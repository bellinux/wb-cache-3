5|$|I {{had a lot}} of {{theories}} I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the unconscious mind of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ruleta" [...] {{was shot at}} the Domeniul Greaca resort in Romania by Barna Nemethi, with Marius Apopei serving {{as the director of}} photography. Inna recalled the experience, [...] "Actually, I was super chill in that day, super relaxed, just going with the flow. Most of the times, I'm kind of stressed <b>out,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> want everything to be perfect. Not too many funny stuff, just having fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Cagney had {{demonstrated}} {{the power of}} the walkout in keeping the studios to their word. He later explained his reasons, saying, [...] "I walked <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> depended on the studio heads to keep their word on this, that or other promise, and when the promise was not kept, my only recourse was to deprive them of my services." [...] Cagney himself acknowledged the importance of the walkout for other actors in breaking the dominance of the studio system. Normally, when a star walked out, the time he or she was absent was added onto the end of an already long contract, as happened with Olivia de Havilland and Bette Davis. Cagney, however, walked out and came back to a better contract. Many in Hollywood watched the case closely for hints of how future contracts might be handled.|$|E

[...] "Neither of us trusted the other… which worked <b>out</b> well <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't touch {{him with a}} ten foot pole. Jimmy Nicholson was the brains of that operation. With Arkoff, you never got a {{straight}} count." ...|$|R
500|$|The HIV storyline {{came to an}} end {{on-screen}} in 2003, when {{executive producer}} Louise Berridge decided to axe Mark Fowler. In the serial, Mark discovers his HIV medication is failing, but instead of allowing Pauline to witness his deterioration, he leaves to spend the remainder of his life travelling. Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: [...] "I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going I could barely get my lines out for want of crying—but everybody said I acted it well. It was, I think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was being selfish and didn't want Todd to go." [...] Mark, who had appeared intermittently for 18 years, was eventually killed off-screen in 2004, dying of an AIDS-related illness.|$|E
500|$|Gaven {{was born}} as Marcia Mitzman on February 28, 1959 in New York City, New York. She was raised {{with her two}} {{siblings}} {{in the village of}} Hastings-on-Hudson, New York by their mother Patricia Mitzman, who had previously had a career in art. Newt Mitzman, their father, directed [...] television specials and commercials for a living. Gaven went to Hackley Elementary School in Tarrytown, New York when she was young. At that time she was certain that she wanted to work in show business. As the result of a lie, she was able to study at the High School of Performing Arts even though the school was only open to inhabitants of New York City. She then became a drama major at the State University of New York at Purchase, though she did not get a degree. She said in a 1987 interview with The New York Times that [...] "they kicked me <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> missed a major rehearsal", and she never applied for readmission since she had already made her first appearance on Broadway in Grease by then. While at Purchase, Gaven performed in student productions such as The Taming of the Shrew and Trumpets and Drums.|$|E
500|$|William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet {{inspired}} the lyrics for [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)". Initially Yorke {{wanted to work}} lines from the play into the song, but the final draft of the lyrics became a broad summary of the narrative. He said: [...] "I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13 and I cried my eyes <b>out,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> couldn't understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn't just run away. It's a song for two people who should run away before all the bad stuff starts." [...] Yorke compared {{the opening of the}} song, which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar, to Johnny Cash's At Folsom Prison. Mellotron choir and other electronic voices are used throughout the track. The song climaxes with the entrance of drums and distorted bass run through a fuzz pedal. The climactic portion of the song is an attempt to emulate the sound of trip hop group Portishead, but in a style that bass player Colin Greenwood called more [...] "stilted and leaden and mechanical". The song concludes by fading back to Yorke's voice, acoustic guitar and Mellotron.|$|E

500|$|Both Surfer Rosa and Steve Albini's {{production}} of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa {{as the basis for}} Neverminds songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1993 that he [...] "heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was too afraid to play them for anybody." [...] Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as [...] "the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame." [...] Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa [...] "blew my mind," [...] and that she [...] "immediately went to track down Steve Albini." [...] Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.|$|E
500|$|While von Stauffenberg {{listens to}} Richard Wagner's [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] in the film, {{in reality the}} colonel hated Wagner. In addition, von Stauffenberg's elder brother Berthold was also omitted from the film. Bryan Singer {{purposely}} left out some of von Stauffenberg's [...] "macho" [...] moments in writing the character, such as the colonel's refusal of morphine to avoid addiction. He explained the removals, [...] "There were things I actually left <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> knew people would think we were making them up ... imagine Tom Cruise saying 'No morphine!' People would think it's a contrivance." [...] In the film, von Haeften steps {{out in front of}} von Stauffenberg when he faces the firing squad, but when filmmakers attempted to reconstruct the scene based on eyewitness testimony and photographs, they discovered that the shots that killed von Haeften would also have killed von Stauffenberg, who was actually shot shortly after. Another alteration was to the portrayal of Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, played in the film by Kevin McNally. Goerdeler was written in the film to be antagonistic, dramatically representing the friction and conflict that existed within the conspiracy, though filmmakers considered him a [...] "much more moral character" [...] in reality.|$|E
2500|$|She {{said she}} had never had plastic surgery but that [...] "I wouldn't rule it <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't know how I'll feel in the future." [...] She said {{she would like to}} [...] "grow old gracefully, {{wrinkles}} and all".|$|E

2500|$|Hirst gave up {{smoking and}} {{drinking}} in 2002, although the short-term result was that his wife Maia [...] "had to move <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was so horrible." [...] He had met Joe Strummer (former lead singer of The Clash) at Glastonbury in 1995, becoming good friends and going on annual family holidays with him. Just before Christmas 2002, Strummer {{died of a heart}} attack. This {{had a profound effect on}} Hirst, who said, [...] "It was the first time I felt mortal." [...] He subsequently devoted a lot of time to founding a charity, Strummerville, to help young musicians.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the release}} of Music, Madonna told Rolling Stone about how she felt about the song's leak: [...] "There's not much to say, honestly. I think it's blown out of proportion. They {{downloaded}} a portion of 'Music' before I'd even mixed it. It was astonishing. I {{have no idea how}} they got it. It was still in such a beginning stage. And it freaked me <b>out,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> suddenly thought, 'Oh, my God. If they got that, then they have other things on my record that aren't finished.' And that's really scary. So, basically, I made — well, my manager made — a public statement [...] Simple as that. And then suddenly it was in every headline: 'Madonna is against Napster.' I mean ... I don't take that sort of a stance. I feel covetous about my work, and I don't want people to hear it until it's finished. At the same time, I think, to a certain extent, the trading of information is inevitable. And, on the other hand, Napster could be a great way for people to hear your music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's what I have to say about that. Really, I want to strangle the person who got ahold of it. I don't know — I can't control everybody [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|... “The old days. [...] After all {{the fall}} of 1906 is a far piece back, and high school {{football}} then was a mighty casual and simple thing. [...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games. [...] I can’t remember who we beat, but I do recall, painfully even after this lapse of time, that our friends over at the county seat (Canton, Ohio) took us to the cleaners twice.” ...|$|E
