5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E

Lukić states that the Partisans rested the remaining children at Žumberak for a day, before arranging for them to be transferred across the Kupa river into liberated areas of the Bosanska Krajina. According to one survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> were liberated from the camp by the Partisans inAugust 1942 were placed with families in the Žumberak district and were subsequently re-captured by the Ustaše.

More than 100 captives were taken on an overland journey hundreds of miles north to the Caughnawaga mission village near Montreal, where most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> survived were adopted by the Mohawk people. Several adults were later redeemed or released in negotiated prisoner exchanges, including the minister, who tried for years without success to ransom his daughter. She became fully assimilated, marrying a Mohawk man. There was an active market in human trafficking of the captive colonists during these years, and communities raised funds to ransom their citizens from Indian captivity.|$|E

A study conducted by Tada et al. in Bangkok slums illustrates that in terms of weight-forage, 25.4% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> participated in the survey suffered from malnutrition, compared to around 8% national malnutrition prevalence in Thailand.

25|$|Emmy Werner {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{scientists}} to use the term resilience in the 1970s. She studied a cohort of children from Kauai, Hawaii. Kauai was quite poor and many {{of the children in the}} study grew up with alcoholic or mentally ill parents. Many of the parents were also out of work. Werner noted that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> grew up in these detrimental situations, two-thirds exhibited destructive behaviors in their later teen years, such as chronic unemployment, substance abuse, and out-of-wedlock births (in case of teenage girls). However, one-third of these youngsters did not exhibit destructive behaviours. Werner called the latter group 'resilient'. Thus, resilient children and their families were those who, by definition, demonstrated traits that allowed them to be more successful than non-resilient children and families.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, through sheer luck, {{the group}} find {{themselves}} perfectly positioned to attempt another {{attack on the}} Airfield.

There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops since the war began. The group rescue five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by a chance to do something positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.|$|E

40|$|For a {{complete}} description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> {{law enforcement in}} bullying prevention, see the fact sheet “Involvement of Law Enforcement Officers in Bullying Prevention. ” Research your state laws. Even though your state may not have an anti-bullying law, there are usually many laws that are applicable to dealing with bullying behaviors, including theft, assault, battery, and extortion. Complete the investigation before contacting parents. Complete a thorough investigation of a bullying incident before contacting parents of involved students. Contact <b>the</b> parents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> was bullied and seek suggestions for reparation before contacting <b>the</b> parents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> was bullying. When speaking to <b>the</b> parent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> bullied, make it clear that: (1) you have conducted an investigation that included getting their <b>child’s</b> account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident, and (2) witnesses and physical evidence clearly indicate that their child was bullying.

25|$|For {{months after}} the wreck, bodies washed up {{for as much as}} thirty miles to the north and south of Vanderbilt Reef. Wreckage and the passengers' {{belongings}} were also found, including toys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> had died on the ship. Many of the bodies were scarcely recognizable as human remains, being covered with a thick coat of oil. Among the dead was Walter Harper, the first person to reach the summit of Mount McKinley, the highest mountain in North America. Most of the bodies recovered were taken to Juneau, where many of the local citizens volunteered to help identify the remains and prepare them for burial. The bodies had to be scrubbed with gasoline to remove the oil. Teams of women prepared female bodies, and teams of men handled the males. The volunteers were particularly affected by the bodies of the children. Divers at the wreck site recovered about 100 bodies. Many were floating in cabins for {{months after the}} wreck. The families of passengers brought legal action against Canadian Pacific, but these failed.|$|E
25|$|In the German-speaking lands, {{groups of}} young people called Sternsinger (star singers) travel from door to door. They are dressed as the three Wise Men, plus the leader {{carrying}} a star, usually of painted wood attached to a broom handle. Often these groups are four girls, or two boys and two girls {{for the benefit of}} singing their songs in four-part harmony, not necessarily three wise men at all. German Lutherans often note in a lighthearted fashion that the Bible never specifies that the Weisen (Magi) were men, or that there were three. The star singers will be offered treats at the homes they visit, but they also solicit donations for worthy causes, such as efforts to end hunger in Africa, organized jointly by the Catholic and Evangelical-Lutheran churches. As a sign of gratitude, the young people then perform the traditional house blessing, by marking the year over the doorway with chalk. In Roman Catholic communities this may be a serious spiritual event with the priest present even today, but among Protestants it is more a tradition, and a part of the German notion of Gemütlichkeit. Usually on the Sunday following Epiphany, these donations are brought into churches. Here all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> have gone out as star singers, once again in their costumes, form a procession of sometimes dozens of wise men and stars. The German Chancellor and Parliament also receive a visit from the star singers at Epiphany.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{makes use}} of a regular trope from science-fiction: bored, god-like beings playing with the lives of mortals {{for the purpose of}} amusement. [...] In their book About Time, Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood liken this to a {{prevalent}} strand of children's fiction, where magical worlds are held together by the rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> visit them. [...] Miles and Wood also highlight the political elements of the story, likening the portrayal of the Eternals to the view of the upper classes as [...] "effete parasites feeding off the labour (and in this case the imagination) of the proles." [...] The Doctor then, acts as part of the class struggle, helping the workers gain freedom while the gentry get their comeuppance.|$|E
