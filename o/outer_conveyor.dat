40|$|It {{comprises}} two fingers, each {{of which}} has two phalanges and a planar manipulator structure with two rotary joints. Furthermore, each phalanx is equipped with one Sensitive Active Surface (SAS). The Velvet Fingers [1] is a dexterous under-actuated gripper for unstructured industrial environments. It offers enhanced manipulability by means of Active Surfaces (AS) on its fingers, i: e:; surfaces able to emulate different levels of friction and to apply tangential thrusts to the contacted object. The usefulness of the AS (implemented by controlled conveyor belts) is discussed in [2]. Although their benefits are substantial, their main limitations are the lack of force feedback and missing information of the contact point loca-tion, as well as limitations on the fictitious friction range. In this article we discuss the employment of an intrinsic force/torque (F/T) sensor mounted between the frame of the phalanx and the AS which are henceforth referred to as Sensitive Active Surfaces (SAS). For this purpose the experimental device shown and described in Fig. 2 has been set up at the University of Pisa. Furthermore, we implemented and tested an algorithm for the determination of contact point locations, as well as a variable friction control algorithm. The geometrical portion of the belt involved in a pos-sible contact with a grasped object is formed by a plane corresponding to the <b>outer</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt surface and two semicircles associated with the belt rollers (see indicators (3) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-In {{this paper}} {{different}} component of conveyor pulley (shell, end disk, hub, and shaft) failure and the stresses generated on them are discussed. The basic {{idea is to}} present the state of work about the conveyor pulley design analysis. The <b>outer</b> diameter of <b>conveyor</b> pulley to shaft diameter {{is a measure of}} the flexible nature of the end disc. This ratio was approximately 6 to 8 by Leo J Laughlin [1]. If the ratio of <b>outer</b> diameter of <b>conveyor</b> pulley to shaft diameter smaller, then conveyor pulley end disc will tend to be rigid. If the ratio of <b>outer</b> diameter of <b>conveyor</b> pulley to shaft diameter larger then conveyor pulley end disc will tend to be flexible. So conveyor pulley diameter to shaft diameter ratio in the range of five to eight then their stresses were fairly low. The paper was mainly focused on the improvement in the design and dimension of conveyor pulley which helpful for computational level. I...|$|R
