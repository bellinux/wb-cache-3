40|$|Among warm season grasses, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers, {{commonly}} called bermudagrass, {{is one of}} the species that better tolerates drought stress and is the most widely employed for turf in Italy. When temperatures drop below 0 °C, bermudagrass plants enter dormancy and eventually leaves turn brown. In spring, exit from dormancy occurs when soil temperatures persist for several days with an average above 10 °C. The management of an <b>ornamental</b> <b>turf</b> during dormancy could include the use of other herbaceous species able to enhance aesthetic quality, although no study has so far been carried out on the potential for combined planting of warm season grasses, wildflowers and/or bulbous species. The present study was carried out to (a) evaluate the possibility of integrating into the dormant Cynodon dactylon x C. Transvaalensis cv. Tifway 419 lawn some plants able to enhance the ornamental aspect and biodiversity, (b) attempt to identify the best species, (c) observe phenomena of competition, and (d) define the protocol for cultivation of a lawn composed of hybrid bermudagrass, bulbous, annual and perennial herbaceous plant species. The experiment was carried out on a mature (over 5 years-old) sward of hybrid bermudagrass on which eight bulbous species (geophytes) were planted and eight species of native forbs (wildflowers) were sown. Forbs that could coexist after two years with bermudagrass were B. perennis and G. molle. Concerning the bulbous species C. pulchellus, M. neglectum, G. nivalis and N. minor were suitable to be planted in a Bermuda grass. The presence of these species on a dormant bermudagrass turf improved the aesthetical quality and the diversity of the vegetation; as the studied species are able to attract pollinating insects therefore, support a habitat.

40|$|Oryzalin is an {{herbicide}} registered nationally {{for control}} of annual grasses and certain broadleaf weeds in fruit and nut crops, vineyards, Christmas tree plantations, <b>ornamentals,</b> <b>turf,</b> and several other noncrop sites. A Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) that includes an ecological risk assessment for freshwater fish, aquatic invertebrates, and aquatic plants was issued in September of 1994. Oryzalin is moderately toxic to fish, moderately to highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates, and highly toxic to aquatic plants. We modeled Estimated Environmental Concentrations (EECs) for use of oryzalin on grapes and almonds, the two major uses of oryzalin. Acute and chronic risk quotients calculated from these EECs and the available toxicity values indicate no direct risk to endangered fish or aquatic-invertebrate populations. However, risk to aquatic vascular plants exceeds OPP’s level of concern when predicted aquatic concentrations {{are based on the}} maximum application rate. Loss of aquatic plants might indirectly impact listed Pacific salmon and steelhead through loss of plant cover. We conclude that oryzalin may affect but is not likely to adversely affect 17 ESUs and will have no effect on nine ESUs.

However, when applied to grassland habitat containing populations of gray-tailed voles, no biologically significant impairment was observed in reproductive development of male voles whose mothers were exposed to the treatment while the young were in utero. Reproductive organs were sufficiently developed to result in high reproductive rates and juvenile recruitment in the field with no effects on population growth or demography. Under the conditions of this study, one standard application of Curalan[copyright] fungicide had no measurable reproductive or demographic consequences on gray-tailed voles.

40|$|Wildlife damage {{problems}} are experienced by {{all segments of}} society. Row crops, forages, rangeland, fruits, vegetables, <b>ornamentals,</b> and <b>turf</b> are all susceptible to wildlife damage at various stages of development. Agricultural producers lose billions of dollars each year due to crop damage caused by deer, voles, blackbirds, and other wildlife species (Conover et al. 1995). In addition, over 75, 000 people are injured annually or become ill in North America due to wildlife-related incidents. For most of these problems, IPM principles {{can be applied to}} reduce damage to tolerable levels. Information, materials, and services on wildlife damage management are available through educational institutions, agencies, and private industry, but access is highly variable, depending on the location and type of problem that exists. The worldwide web provides an excellent opportunity to consolidate existing and future information on IPM and wildlife damage management. The authors have developed a Center on the worldwide web (html. www. ianr. unl/wildlife) to facilitate distribution of information and increase adoption of IPM practices. They anticipate that it will become a widely known, one-stop website that facilitates access to up-to-date, comprehensive, and useful information on wildlife damage management. The project is national, if not international, in scope. The goal of this project is to increase adoption of IPM practices through the development and maintenance of a website on the internet that will centralize access to wildlife damage management information. The 420 measurable objectives include: 1) increase public access (producers, consultants, homeowners) to all internet information on IPM practices associated with wildlife damage management; 2) increase public access to agencies, organizations, consultants, and materials vendors that provide information and assistance on wildlife damage management; and 3) increase communication among resource professionals associated with IPM and wildlife damage management on the internet.

50|$|Bacillus licheniformis strain SB3086 {{has been}} {{identified}} as a biological control agent of mango anthracnose infection, and also shows some antagonistic effects toward powdery mildew infections when applied in combination with copper oxychloride. One current issue with the use of B. licheniformis as a control agent is that no reliable means has been developed for maintaining the bacterial population over the long term. The other major issue with the use of this species as a biopesticide is that it has been potentially identified as causing illnesses such as food poisoning in humans, as well as several other diseases in animals. It is currently approved in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency for use in controlling fungal diseases on <b>ornamental</b> plants and <b>turf,</b> but cannot be applied to any crop intended for consumption by animals or humans. Ampelomyces quisqualis is another biological control agent, this being a fungus that is capable of parasitizing O. mangiferae. It was registered with the EPA as a biopesticide in 1994, used for powdery mildew control on various fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops. It has been deemed safe for use on crops intended for human and animal consumption, with no adverse side effects anticipated. It is marketed with the trade name “AQ10”, and is available in powder format. Several varieties of A. quisqualis that are resistant to commonly used fungicides are also available, so that regular fungicide applications may also be used in combination with the biopesticide. Pycnidia are produced within the mycelia and conidiophores of the powdery mildew, leading to reduced growth or colony death. The limitation of this parasite as a biocontrol agent is that it requires that some of the pathogen be present to act as a host for its growth. In plant species and cultivars with little or no powdery mildew resistance, the small amount of pathogen growth may cause an unacceptable amount of damage before A. quisqualis can control the fungus.|$|R
40|$|Oriental beetle, Anomala orientalis (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is a pest of <b>turf,</b> <b>ornamentals,</b> {{and several}} crops, {{including}} cranberry; damage {{is caused by}} larval feeding on plant roots. Imidacloprid [...] -the only new pesticide registered against scarabs in cranberry since the ban on organochlorines in the 1970 s [...] -is expensive and relatively ineffective against later instar larvae. I evaluated the potential management of oriental beetle in cranberry by mating disruption using female sex pheromone deployed from wax disks. I found strong trap shutdown in mating disruption treatments. Because attempts to disrupt mating may be compromised if males eventually find females, I studied the effects of delayed mating on female reproductive output in the lab. Females were relatively resilient to mating delay, exhibiting only a gradual decline in fecundity with increased age at mating. Thus, in order for mating disruption {{to be a successful}} management tool, mating must be prevented rather than delayed. I deployed tethered virgin females deployed in the field and found that mating is indeed largely prevented in pheromone-treated bogs. These results demonstrate the strong potential of mating disruption for management of oriental beetle in cranberry. ^ I also studied relative fertilization success between males in successive matings of the same female. Characters of the first male to mate [...] -including male body size and genitalia morphology [...] -had primacy in influencing relative paternity, an uncommon pattern in sperm precedence studies. Surprisingly, relative paternity of the first male was inversely correlated with his size. Because this result is at odds with the general positive relationship between male size and reproductive success in insects, I hypothesized that larger males experience greater lifetime reproductive success when mating multiply. I then examined how male size and mating history impacted reproduction. Only for smaller males was reproductive output reduced in successive matings. These results suggest that after their first mating, smaller males must either compete using a lower quality ejaculate or submit to a longer refractory period to replenish ejaculate reserves. Thus, the sexually selected advantage of smaller males in their first mating is apparently balanced by lower lifetime reproductive potential relative to larger males. ...|$|R
