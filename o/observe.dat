40|$|Century-long <b>observed</b> gridded land {{precipitation}} datasets are {{a cornerstone}} of hydrometeorological research. But recent work has suggested that <b>observed</b> Northern Hemisphere midlatitude (NHML) land mean precipitation does not show evidence of an expected negative response to mid-twentieth-century aerosol forcing. Utilizing <b>observed</b> river discharges, the <b>observed</b> runoff is calculated and compared with <b>observed</b> land precipitation. The results show a near-zero twentieth-century trend in <b>observed</b> NHML land mean runoff, {{in contrast to the}} significant positive trend in <b>observed</b> NHML land mean precipitation. However, precipitation and runoff share common interannual and decadal variability. An obvious split, or breakpoint, is found in the NHML land mean runoff–precipitation relationship in the 1930 s. Using runoff simulated by six land surface models (LSMs), which are driven by the <b>observed</b> precipitation dataset, such breakpoints are absent. These findings support previous hypotheses that inhomogeneities exist in the early-twentieth-century NHML land mean precipitation record. Adjusting the <b>observed</b> precipitation record according to the <b>observed</b> runoff record largely accounts for the departure of the <b>observed</b> precipitation response from that predicted given the real-world aerosol forcing estimate, more than halving the discrepancy from about 6 to around 2 W m− 2. Consideration of complementary <b>observed</b> runoff adds support to the suggestion that NHML-wide early-twentieth-century precipitation observations are unsuitable for climate change studies. The agreement between precipitation and runoff over Europe, however, is excellent, supporting the use of whole-twentieth-century <b>observed</b> precipitation datasets here...|$|R
