5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions,</b> like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these questions may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E
25|$|One {{characteristic}} of creative people, {{as measured by}} some psychologists, is what is called divergent production. Divergent production {{is the ability of}} a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation. One way of measuring divergent production is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} the <b>open-ended</b> <b>question</b> on inhibitors are aligned with the finding from the close-ended {{questions}} that business inhibitors are the most challenging. The result related to the second-ranked inhibitor domain from the <b>open-ended</b> <b>question</b> does not align with the result obtained from the close-ended question. Participants answered the <b>open-ended</b> <b>question</b> before being presented the inhibitor domains and the full set of inhibitors. An insight from informal interviews with industry representatives is that the perception of IoT is technology-dominated. This could explain why inhibitors stated {{in response to the}} <b>open-ended</b> <b>question</b> are more technology-oriented. After being confronted with all inhibitor domains and the entire collection of inhibitors, the participants may reassess their opinion.|$|R
3000|$|Among other questions, the Phase 2 {{interviews}} {{included an}} <b>open-ended</b> <b>question</b> concerning {{the relationship between}} family member problem gambling and family violence for participants who reported both: “In what way are the aggressive behaviours and problem gambling related?” The Phase 2 interviews also included an <b>open-ended</b> <b>question</b> concerning gambling-related family impacts: “What impact {{do you think your}} family member(s) gambling has had on you and your family members?”, and an <b>open-ended</b> <b>question</b> concerning their gambling-related coping strategies: “What strategies have you used to cope with your family member’s gambling?” [...]...|$|R
25|$|In 2001, the HKEAA {{decided on}} an {{across-the-board}} revamp upon {{the format of}} questions in the exam. The changes included the replacement of questions on prescribed texts with <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> in the questions on culture paper. It was HKEAA's attempt to prevent candidates from memorising the suggested reading materials. That, however, was dismissed {{by a number of}} candidates as a move towards the subject turning out into a saliva subject (吹水科, Jyutping: Ceoi1 Seoi2 Fo1) in which candidates concentrate on writing large amounts of verbose text and neglect the actual quality of the contents.|$|E
25|$|A cloze passage with a {{total of}} ten items and a weight of 10 is {{provided}} to the student; the passage tests grammar specifically. Following this ten sentences with highlighted spelling and grammar mistakes which are supposed to be copyedited, {{with a total}} weight of 10. After this, students are given a cloze passage testing comprehension as opposed to grammar, which currently has a weight of 15 in which they fill in blanks with words on their own. Students are then given a passage to comprehend, and will have to answer ten <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> with a total weight of 20.|$|E
25|$|Since the gay {{and lesbian}} {{veterans}} are not asked to disclose information about their sexual orientation on medical forms, the healthcare providers are often unaware of this information when they consider medical treatment options. In response to these concerns, the Institute of Medicine suggested that patients disclose such information on medical records. The information will be confidential and only used to assess health. The VHA is striving to prevent this information from being shared with other organizations. Sharpe and Uchendu suggest the option of incorporating <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> to encourage the veterans to supply additional written information.|$|E

40|$|There are {{few studies}} on the {{experiences}} of spouses of military members, with most focused on adverse impacts of deployment. Responses to an <b>open-ended</b> <b>question</b> {{in a survey of}} spouses' health and wellbeing enabled access to perceptions and insights on a broad range of topics. The objective of this investigation was to examine how respondents used the <b>open-ended</b> <b>question</b> and what they discussed, in aim of informing support service agencies and spouses of military members. Thematic analysis was conducted on responses to the <b>open-ended</b> <b>question.</b> Descriptive analysis was performed on the demographics, military member characteristics and self-reported health of respondents and non-respondents to the <b>open-ended</b> <b>question.</b> Over a quarter (28. 5 %) of the 1, 332 survey participants answered the <b>open-ended</b> <b>question,</b> with respondents having a significantly higher level of education than non-respondents. Respondents expressed negative and positive experiences and insights on military life, provided personal information, commented on the survey, and qualified their responses to closed-ended questions. Topics included 'inadequate support', 'deployment impacts', 'suggestions for supporting agencies', 'appraisal of experiences' and 'coping strategies'. This investigation uncovered issues of importance to spouses of military members that were not included or identified in a quantitative study. The findings provide a platform from which to explore these issues further, particularly the impact of military life on the non-serving spouse's career. The findings also provide support agencies with evidence to strengthen their services and they give spouses an opportunity to reflect on their own and others' feelings and evaluations of military life...|$|R
500|$|The {{original}} [...] "Ten Key Values" [...] {{statement was}} approved by the Greens' national steering committee and released in late 1984. [...] The values in the original statement are: Ecological Wisdom, Grassroots Democracy, Personal and Social Responsibility, Nonviolence, Decentralization, Community-based Economics, Postpatriarchal Values, Respect for Diversity, Global Responsibility, and Future Focus. [...] One unusual aspect, say many observers, is the way the values are described; instead of declaratory statements full of [...] "shoulds" [...] and [...] "musts", each value is followed by a series of <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions.</b> [...] "That idea... came from Mark Satin", Spretnak told scholar Greta Gaard in 1997. [...] Its effect, says sociologist Paul Lichterman, was to promote dialogue and creative thinking in local Green groups across the U.S.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} values statement was, and remains, controversial. [...] U.S. Green Party co-founder John Rensenbrink credits it {{with helping}} {{to unify the}} often contentious Greens. [...] However, party co-founder Howie Hawkins sees it as just a watered-down, [...] "spiritual", and [...] "New Age" [...] version of the German Greens' Four Pillars statement. [...] Greta Gaard says it fails to call {{for the elimination of}} capitalism or racism. [...] Looking back after 20 years, Green activist Brian Tokar said that [...] "the voice of the original [...] questions is distinctly personal … and aims to avoid fundamental conflicts with elite social and cultural norms." [...] A [...] "modified" [...] list of the Ten Key Values became part of the U.S. Greens' political platform. [...] However, all the <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> were replaced by declaratory sentences, and the U.S. Greens have come to be regarded as a party of the left, rather than one seeking to be neither left nor right.|$|E
500|$|The {{psychoanalyst}} Gerard J. M. van den Aardweg, {{writing in}} the American Journal of Psychotherapy, criticized Bell et al.′s interpretation of their data. Aardweg argued that too many studies suggest that domineering mothers {{play a role in}} the development of male homosexuality for Bell et al.′s conclusion that mothers have at most a weak influence on the development of their sons' sexual orientation to be readily acceptable, that all questionnaire studies have inherent limitations, and that their data are inferior to those collected over time by psychotherapists. He suggested that homosexuals might give defensive answers due to not wanting to be labelled abnormal, that Bell et al.′s data were of poor quality, since too few questions about parental behavior had been asked and <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> yielded superficial answers, and that it was unjustified to conclude that parents must have only a small influence on the development of their children's sexual orientation simply because that influence did not reveal itself clearly. He accused Bell et al. of admitting the limitations of path analysis only to then ignore those limitations, arguing that the technique had [...] "numerous dubious premises" [...] and that Bell et al. used it in a way that was open to technical objections such as its failure to [...] "distinguish between different types of psychodynamic development to homosexuality". He considered Bell et al. mistaken to treat their variables as isolated items, rather than in combination with each other. He also found the studies cited by Bell et al. as evidence that homosexuality might have a hormonal basis unconvincing.|$|E

2500|$|Qualitative {{psychological}} research emphasizes fieldwork, {{and this}} emphasis {{has been offered}} as a distinguishing mark. Qualitative psychological research is also described as holistic. That is, qualitative researchers believe in studying phenomena in its context rather than concentrating on narrow aspects of the phenomena. This means that they either observe or participate in the phenomena they are studying, e.g. attending a football game to understand the behaviours of fan, and/or they ask <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> about the behaviour of fans at football games. These questions are holistic because {{they are designed to}} understand the context of behaviour—they will usually follow a pattern that replicates the experience, e.g. [...] "What did you do when you arrived? Who did you come with? What did you do then?" [...] However, similar methods are used by quantitative researchers.|$|E

They then voluntarily completed English versions of the MRSQ and RBI. Four versions of each questionnaire were used, and the order of the MRSQ and RBI was counterbalanced across participants in order to eliminate spurious effects in the data due to a specific ordering of questions.
