5|$|The {{palatial}} structures at Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos were erected on {{the summits}} of hills or rocky outcrops, dominating the immediate surroundings.

In Central Greece, Thebes and Orchomenos have been <b>only</b> <b>partially</b> exposed. On the other hand, the palace built at the acropolis of Athens has been almost completely destroyed. A substantial building at Dimini in Thessaly, possibly ancient Iolcos, is believed {{by a number of}} archaeologists to be a palace. A Mycenaean palace has been also unearthed in Laconia, near the modern village of Xirokambi.|$|E
5|$|HIV-2’s closest {{relative}} is SIVsm, {{a strain}} of SIV found in sooty mangabees. Since HIV-1 is derived from SIVcpz, and HIV-2 from SIVsm, the genetic sequence of HIV-2 is <b>only</b> <b>partially</b> homologous to HIV-1 and more closely resembles that of SIVsm.|$|E

5|$|Tanaka et al. (2015) {{found that}} among modern archosaurs (the group {{including}} birds, crocodilians, and dinosaurs), the porosity of eggshells {{can be used}} to accurately predict whether the eggs are buried or laid in open nests. They concluded that Macroolithus nests were either open or <b>only</b> <b>partially</b> covered with vegetation. The eggs' blue-green coloration could have acted as a camouflage to hide the nest from predators.|$|E
5|$|The boccamela group (large weasels): Very large weasels {{with large}} skulls, {{relatively}} long tails and lighter coloured pelts.

As part of London Underground's <b>only</b> <b>partially</b> {{completed}} Northern Heights plan, the station was completely rebuilt with additional tracks in the late 1930s. Northern line trains started serving the station in 1939 and main line passenger services ended in 1941.|$|E

5|$|While HIAG <b>only</b> <b>partially</b> {{achieved}} {{its goals}} {{of legal and}} economic rehabilitation of Waffen-SS, its propaganda efforts led to the reshaping {{of the image of}} Waffen-SS in popular culture.

5|$|A third species, L. consors, was {{established}} by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882, which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part {{of at least one}} other individual. The skull was <b>only</b> <b>partially</b> preserved, {{and the fact that the}} vertebrae were represented only by centra suggests a partially grown individual. Galton (1983) notes that much of the current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster, or had paint applied.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{the still}} poorly {{developed}} peninsula suddenly {{found itself in}} a strategic position, as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the ice-free harbors of the Murman Coast remained {{the only means of}} sending the war supplies to the Eastern Front. In March 1915, the construction of the railroad was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, even though it was <b>only</b> <b>partially</b> completed and poorly built. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (modern Murmansk) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Loring {{was planned}} in 1947 as Limestone Army Air Field and was {{designed}} with {{a capacity of}} over 100 B-36 Peacemaker strategic bombers. This plan was <b>only</b> <b>partially</b> completed due to budget constraints, but, over time, Loring {{became one of the}} largest air bases of SAC. After the B-36 was phased out, the B-52 Stratofortress was based at Loring, first with D models, then with B-52Gs. The Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter was also based there for a number of years, until it was replaced by the better-known KC-135A Stratotanker.|$|E
5|$|Most {{extraterrestrial}} helium {{is found}} in a plasma state, with properties quite {{different from those of}} atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is <b>only</b> <b>partially</b> ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.|$|E

50|$|An {{asset in}} {{economic}} theory is an output good which can <b>only</b> be <b>partially</b> consumed (like a portable music player) or input {{as a factor}} of production (like a cement mixer) which can <b>only</b> be <b>partially</b> used up in production. The necessary quality for an asset is that value remains after the period of analysis {{so it can be}} used as a store of value. As such, financial instruments like corporate bonds and common stocks are assets because they store value for the next period. If the good or factor is used up before the next period, there would be nothing upon which to place a value.|$|R
