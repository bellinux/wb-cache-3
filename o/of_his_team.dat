5|$|During {{the second}} {{expedition}} 1907–1909 he and three companions established {{a new record}} Farthest South latitude at 88°S, only 97 geographical miles (112 statute miles, 180km) from the South Pole, the largest advance to the pole in exploration history. Also, members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> climbed Mount Erebus, the most active Antarctic volcano. For these achievements, Shackleton was knighted by King Edward VII on his return home.|$|E
5|$|In early 2004, two {{men were}} arrested in Virginia for distributing marijuana. The truck they were driving was {{registered}} to Vick.

5|$|Lewis Hamilton got {{the better}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> mate during the third {{practice}} session on Saturday morning, as Rosberg only managed third behind Vettel, almost a second down on Hamilton. Both Williams and Ferrari had another good session, while Lotus got both their drivers in the top ten, raising hopes for a points finish on Sunday. Red Bull continued to struggle, with Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat down in 15th and 18th and Ricciardo's car stopping {{at the end of}} pit lane due to engine problems. Between them were the once more struggling McLaren drivers.|$|E
25|$|Slater's matchwinning 123 against England at Sydney in the 1998–99 Ashes series {{comprised}} 66.84 {{per cent}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team's</b> entire total. This remains the greatest proportion since Charles Bannerman made 165 not {{out in the}} very first test innings of all, which was 67.34 per cent <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team's</b> total.|$|R
50|$|Houston {{was fired}} after a 5-22 {{campaign}} in 1994, finishing the worst season in Tennessee history. None <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teams</b> reached the NCAA Tournament, and only two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teams</b> received invitations to the NIT, the two of which were also <b>his</b> only <b>teams</b> to finish with winning records. Houston finished with an overall record of 65-90 at Tennessee.|$|R

5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} the chance to join Tranmere Rovers, but instead joined Preston North End after being persuaded by manager John McGrath, who promised to make Allardyce the {{backbone}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team.</b> Preston won promotion out of the Fourth Division in second-place in 1986–87 (Allardyce was also named on the PFA Team of the Year), and consolidated their Third Division status with a 16th-place finish in 1987–88. By this time Allardyce began considering his retirement as a player, and applied to management positions at York City and Notts County, and had an unsuccessful interview with Doncaster Rovers.|$|E
5|$|Charlton was {{approached}} by the FAI to manage the Republic of Ireland in December 1985. He was the first foreigner to be appointed to the role. In May 1986, Ireland won the Iceland Triangular Tournament at Laugardalsvöllur, in Iceland's capital of Reykjavík, with a 2–1 victory over Iceland and a 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia. By this time Charlton had developed his tactics, which {{were based on the}} traditional British 4–4–2 system, as opposed to the continental approach of using deep-lying midfielders, as he noted that most of the Ireland international players plied their trade in England. Crucially he instructed all members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> to pressure opposition players and in particular force ball-playing defenders into mistakes.|$|E
5|$|During the 2005–06 season, Duncan {{suffered}} from plantar fasciitis {{for most of}} the season, which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances. The big man came back strong in the 2006 NBA Playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center Erick Dampier able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense. But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the tragic hero <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith Van Horn, Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7.|$|E

50|$|With Ole Miss {{behind the}} rest of the Southeastern Conference in terms of talent, Brewer was never able to win a conference title. However, many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teams</b> were known for over-achieving, embodying the scrappy persona of their combative coach. On the flip side, some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teams</b> {{failed to live up to}} those {{expectations}} after being the subjects of considerable preseason hype.|$|R
5|$|During {{the third}} season, Coulson begins a secret mission to {{assemble}} the Secret Warriors, a team of Inhumans, as Hydra restores its ancient Inhuman leader Hive to power. After the defeat of Hive and with Hydra destroyed, S.H.I.E.L.D. is made a legitimate organization once again for the fourth season, with {{the signing of the}} Sokovia Accords. Coulson returns to being a field agent, due to the world believing he is dead, and is tasked with tracking down more enhanced people including Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider. In addition, Agent Leo Fitz and Holden Radcliffe complete their work on the Life Model Decoy project as well as the development of the Framework. The fifth season sees Coulson and members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> abducted to deep space, where they must try and save humanity while figuring out how to get home.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{regarded}} as the greatest batsman {{in the history of}} cricket, the right-handed Bradman played in all five Tests as captain at No. 3. Bradman was more influential than other Australian captains because he {{was also one of the}} three selectors who had a hand in choosing the squad. He was also a member of the Australian Board of Control while still playing, a privilege that no other person has held. At the age of 40, Bradman was by far the oldest player on the team; three-quarters <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> were at least eight years younger, and some viewed him as a father figure. Coupled with his status as a national hero, cricketing ability and influence as an administrator, this associated the team more closely to him than other teams to their respective captains. Bradman's iconic stature as a cricketer also led to record-breaking public interest and attendances at the matches on tour.|$|E
5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team.</b> As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} {{practice}} session, Castroneves recorded the fastest {{time with a}} lap of one minute and 1.6642 seconds, ahead <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>Team</b> Penske teammates Power and Briscoe. Hideki Mutoh recorded the fourth-fastest time; Dixon was fifth and Tracy sixth. Wilson was seventh-fastest, Kannan eighth, Marco Andretti ninth and Sato completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Several drivers had high-speed spins without damaging their cars which triggered the caution flags to be displayed. A stoppage was caused when Tracy and Alex Tagilani both spun in the first turn; the former narrowly avoided a collision with Baugette who was exiting the pit lane.|$|E
5|$|India {{followed}} the NZ tour with {{a trip to}} Australia. India lost the Test series 3–0 and the margin of defeat was heavy {{in each of these}} matches – 285 runs, 180 runs, innings and 141 runs. The highlight of the Test series came in the final Test when V. V. S. Laxman scored 167 at a run a ball in fading light at the Sydney Cricket Ground and came for much praise from the media. India's ODI series performance matched the Test series in failure as India managed to win just one match against Pakistan and Kapil had to come out in defense <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team.</b>|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's manager Kenny Dalglish {{stated in}} the aftermath, that the victory would lead to more trophies. The club reached the 2012 FA Cup Final, but were beaten 2–1 by Chelsea. Their league form faltered after the victory and they {{finished}} the season in 8th place. Despite this, victory in the final ensured Liverpool had qualified for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League. Cardiff manager Malky Mackay was proud <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> despite their defeat. They finished the season in 6th place in the 2011–12 Football League Championship, reaching the playoffs where they were beaten by West Ham United over two-legs.|$|E

5|$|Simpson {{fell ill}} with {{diarrhoea}} during the Tour's tenth stage. He was {{under pressure from}} his personal manager {{to continue in the}} race, though members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> encouraged him to quit. Near the summit of Mont Ventoux, Simpson fell off of his bike but was able to get back on it. After riding a short distance further, he collapsed. He was pronounced dead after being airlifted to a hospital. The post-mortem examination found that he had taken amphetamine and alcohol, a diuretic combination which proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and the stomach complaint.|$|E
5|$|The {{second session}} on Thursday {{afternoon}} saw considerably less running than the first. A red flag was shown ten minutes into practice after Roberto Merhi crashed on the exit of the tunnel. During the stoppage, rain began to fall, keeping most drivers {{in the garage}} when practice was restarted. It was not until ten minutes {{from the end of}} the session that the drivers took to the track again, but under damp conditions they managed times that were slower than the pace set at the beginning. Lewis Hamilton finished the session fastest, more than seven-tenths of a second in front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> mate. Toro Rosso confirmed their high pace with Carlos Sainz Jr. and Max Verstappen in sixth and seventh respectively, while McLaren proved they might challenge for points as predicted, with Fernando Alonso in eighth place.|$|E
5|$|Though many {{remained}} unimpressed, Oppenheimer appointed Neddermeyer {{the head}} of a new group to test implosion. His group became the E-5 (Implosion) Group, which was part of Captain William S. Parsons' E Division. A gun-type nuclear weapon was the preferred method, but implosion research constituted a backup. Neddermeyer embarked on an intensive series of experiments testing cylindrical implosions. The result was a series of distorted shapes. Progress was made; Neddermeyer and a member <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team,</b> Hugh Bradner, along with James L. Tuck from the British Mission, conceived the idea of explosive lenses, in which shaped charges are used to focus the force of an explosion. Nevertheless, seemingly unsolvable problems with shock wave uniformity brought progress on implosion to a crawl.|$|E

5|$|To aid the {{performances}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team,</b> Sudell recruited several Scottish players, giving them nominal {{jobs in the}} cotton mill he managed. After a dispute arising from payments to players resulted in Preston's withdrawal from the 1884 FA Cup, Sudell became an outspoken proponent of professionalism. His actions resulted in the acceptance of professionalism by the Football Association (FA), and led to Preston becoming the leading team of the early professional era. Under Sudell's leadership, Preston North End became founder members of the Football League, and won a league and cup double, going unbeaten for the entire season.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team.</b> Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E
5|$|At the Sabre store opening, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} {{to put on}} a theatrical presentation to impress Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Dwight assigns the members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> various tasks: Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is to act like a hipster to make the Sabre Pyramid more appealing, Cathy (Lindsey Broad) is to flirt with the bloggers, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) is to give a presentation to wow the critics, and Todd Packer (David Koechner) is to play the part of a sexual predator— much to Packer's chagrin. As the grand opening progresses, things begin to fall apart. Several bloggers notice Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) using his old cell phone instead of his Sabre Arrowhead phone, resulting in a reprimand from Nellie. Erin disappears with a group of seniors after Dwight drives them away, fearing their age will frighten the youth. Ryan has a panic attack and, after being consoled by Dwight and Jim— who imitate Kelly and his mother respectively in an attempt to calm him down— leaves to go to his parents' house. Jim is forced to give the presentation, which, despite a rocky start, impresses the crowd. After the opening, Dwight is named vice president by Nellie.|$|E
