40|$|Since the {{declaration}} of the year 1975 as the year <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and that decade as women's decade, several issues related to women came into focus of scholars.

50|$|Marriage in Hong Kong is {{becoming}} {{based on personal}} happiness and romantic satisfaction, {{as opposed to the}} traditional marriage based on duty and the expectation to stay with one's spouse, regardless <b>of</b> the situation. <b>Women</b> now have more of a say in who they wish to marry, and if the marriage does not work out according to planned, are able to openly consider divorce. Traditional marriage values are becoming less important. In general, divorce has become more common and socially acceptable. Consequently, more individuals in Hong Kong than ever before are single. However, {{it is important to note}} that in China marriage is based on strong family ties and relationships, despite any lack of romance. Therefore, if one were to propose divorce, he or she would risk losing all contact with family. As of 2011, 49.0% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> married, 8.7% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> widowed, 4.4% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> divorced, 0.6% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> separated, and 37.3% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> had never <b>been</b> married.|$|R

25|$|Rousseau {{turns to}} the topic of love, which, he says, is in the realm of women. Women {{naturally}} have power over men via resistance in the area of relationships and this power can be extended to the play, where women can have the same control over the audience. This extension of the empire <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>is</b> against natural order. Rousseau refers to ancient Sparta, where the most virtuous and appreciated women were those who were modest and generally not spoken about. In the decadence of France, Rousseau claims the most esteemed woman is the one who is most social, most talked about, judgmental and authoritative.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{objectification}} {{has been}} studied based on the proposition that girls and women develop their primary view of their physical selves from observing others. These observations can {{take place in the}} media or through personal experience. Through a blend of expected and actual exposure, women are socialized to objectify their own physical characteristics from a third person perception, which is identified as self-objectification. Women and girls develop an expected physical appearance for themselves, based on observations of others; and are aware that others are likely to observe as well. The sexual objectification and self-objectification <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>is</b> believed to influence social gender roles and inequalities between the sexes.|$|E
25|$|While the {{majority}} of Dawoodi Bohras have traditionally been traders, {{it is becoming increasingly}} common for them to become professionals.
