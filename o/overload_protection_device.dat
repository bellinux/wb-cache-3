We collected marker-based upper extremity kinematic data from non-amputee volunteers during advanced activities of daily living (AADLs) that applied dynamic loading to the humerus. Inverse dynamic analysis was applied to calculate the axial force, bending and torsional moments at three virtual amputation levels representing 25, 50, and 75 % residual humeral length. The influences of amputation level, elbow flexion constraint, gender and anthropometric scaling were assessed. Results indicate that the proximal (25 %) amputation level experienced significantly higher axial forces and bending moments across all subjects when compared to distal amputation levels (p≤ 0. 030). Constraining elbow flexion had a limited influence on peak transhumeral loads. Male subjects experienced higher axial forces during all evaluated activities (p≤ 0. 023). Peak axial force for all activities occurred during jumping jacks (174. 5 N). Peak bending (57. 6 Nm) and torsional (57. 2 Nm) moments occurred during jumping jacks and rapid internal humeral rotation, respectively. Calculated loads fall within the range of implant fixation failure loads reported in cadaveric investigations of humeral stem fixation; indicating that periprosthetic fracture may occur during non-contact AADLs.

40|$|Abstract-The {{protection}} of electrical circuits against the overload or short circuits is usually {{achieved by the}} single use of blow-out fuses. The paper contains the examining results of the multiple use of polymer fuses. The static and dynamic characteristics of selected fuses are acquired on the test station. Some interesting features of the polymer fuses, not included in datasheets, are carried out. The courses of characteristics in comparison to their technical data with elements of accuracy analysis are discussed. I. The polymer fuses attributes Fuses are the basic <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> used in circuits. Except fuses there are also used bimetallic devices. The first ones break the circuit {{in the event of}} short circuit. The second ones provides <b>overload</b> <b>protection.</b> Both <b>devices</b> prevent damage to the connected equipment and cables. The disadvantageous feature of the traditional fuses is their blow-out. In consequence of that there is a break in a circuit and necessity of replacement. The typical bimetallic devices {{does not need to be}} replaced. They can back to their idle state. However they can reset even if the fault is not removed. It causes a cycling on and off between the fault event and a protected state which may damage the equipment. Nowadays above mentioned elements may be replaced by one freed from described problems. It is polymer fuse (PPTC- Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient), called resettable fuse [1 - 14]. It realizes functions like devices above, however it does not need to be replaced and it does not expose the equipment on damage. The PPTC fuses are constructed with a non-conductive polymer plastic, which can change in two phases.
