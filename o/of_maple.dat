5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding the classification <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> syrup to be uniform. Whereas {{in the past}} each state or province had their own laws on the classification <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been {{a work in progress}} for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, {{at the request of the}} IMSI.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup {{production}} is centred in northeastern North America; however, given the correct weather conditions, {{it can be}} made wherever suitable species <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> trees grow.|$|E

5|$|A {{few other}} (but not all) species <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer) are also {{sometimes}} used {{as sources of}} sap for producing maple syrup, including the box elder or Manitoba maple (Acer negundo), the silver maple (A. saccharinum), and the bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum). Similar syrups may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources.|$|E
5|$|From Rosendale, NY32 {{climbs up}} out of the Rondout valley and veers east into the hamlet <b>of</b> <b>Maple</b> Hill, where it crosses over the Thruway once again.

5|$|The basic {{ingredient}} in maple syrup is the sap from the xylem of sugar maple or various other species <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> trees.

5|$|Lactarius rubidus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.rufulus, but it has watery to whey-like latex and develops a strong odor <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> syrup or butterscotch when dried. Another lookalike is Lactarius thiersii, {{but it has a}} smaller cap and stem and has mild-tasting flesh and latex. The flesh and latex of Lactarius rufus have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo. Additionally, L.rufus typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base, and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than L.rufulus. L.vinaceorufescens has a yellowing latex.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup {{was first}} {{collected}} {{and used by}} the indigenous peoples of North America, and the practice was adopted by European settlers, who gradually refined production methods. Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing. The Canadian province of Quebec {{is by far the}} largest producer, responsible for 70% of the world's output; Canadian exports <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> syrup in 2016 were C$ 487 million (about US$ 360 million), with Quebec accounting for some 90% of this total. Vermont is the largest producer in the United States, generating about 6% of the global supply.|$|E

The center was originally developed and managed by Ryan Companies US, Inc., but was acquired by Hempel Properties in January 2016 for $19.2 million. Currently, the center features national chains, including Chipotle Mexican Grill, Great Clips, and Subway.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a letter}} written to General Cheatham from Judge Mangum post war, Cleburne's remains were first laid to rest at Rose Hill Cemetery in Columbia, Tennessee. At the urging of Army Chaplain Biship Quintard, Judge Mangum, staff officer to Cleburne and his law partner in Helena, Cleburne's remains were moved to St. John's Episcopal Church near Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, where they {{remained}} for six years. He had first observed St. John's during the Army of Tennessee's march into Tennessee during the campaign {{that led to the}} Battle of Franklin and commented that it was the place he would like to be buried because of its great beauty and resemblance to his Irish homeland. In 1870, he was disinterred and returned to his adopted hometown of Helena, Arkansas, with much fanfare, and buried in the Confederate section <b>of</b> <b>Maple</b> Hill Cemetery, overlooking the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|Golden and Amber grades {{typically}} have a milder flavour than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark {{and have an}} intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested {{earlier in the season}} tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden has to have 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous peoples {{living in}} northeastern North America {{were the first}} groups known to have {{produced}} maple syrup and maple sugar. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began, but various legends exist; {{one of the most}} popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. Other stories credit the development <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> syrup production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup.|$|E

5|$|Municipalities NY430 {{runs through}} include (from west to east) {{the villages of}} Sherman and Mayville, the hamlet <b>of</b> <b>Maple</b> Springs, the village of Bemus Point {{and the city of}} Jamestown. Besides NY60, NY430 intersects with NY76 in Sherman and NY394 in Mayville. It meets the Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate86 or I-86 and NY17) {{multiple}} times: in Sherman via NY76, twice in Bemus Point (once by way of a short expressway designated as the unsigned NY954J and also via an interchange located southwest of NY954J), and in Jamestown via Strunk Road. NY430 also runs along the east side of Chautauqua Lake, and services both Long Point State Park and Midway Park.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is {{also used}} for the {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> syrup, though the hard maples Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer nigrum (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple {{with those of the}} red maple, {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|E
5|$|Students explore broad {{learning}} themes at {{each level}} {{that allow them to}} learn across subjects and engage them in creative and collaborative projects. The second group, for example, spends much of their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a personal space in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> trees to make syrup, which they share {{with the rest of the}} school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The fourth group holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style mastaba, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair.|$|E
