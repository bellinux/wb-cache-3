40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>advice</b> {{complexity}} <b>of</b> {{an online}} problem describes the additional information both necessary and sufficient for online algorithms to compute solutions {{of a certain}} quality. In this model, an oracle inspects the input before it is processed by an online algorithm. Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> input string, the oracle prepares an advice bit string that is accessed sequentially by the algorithm. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> bits that are read to achieve some specific solution quality can then serve as a fine-grained complexity measure. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to study a powerful method for proving lower bounds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> bits necessary. To this end, we consider the string guessing problem as a generic online problem and show a lower bound <b>on</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> bits needed to obtain a good solution. We use special reductions from string guessing to improve the best known lower bound for the online set cover problem and to give a lower bound <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> online maximum clique problem. ...|$|R
