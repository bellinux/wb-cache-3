5|$|After {{the school}} bus is destroyed, Homer is forced to drive several {{students}} to school. Along the way, he listens to a classic rock radio station and is shocked to discover that all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> hate it. After several more days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> hating his music, Homer visits a music store and realizes that what he likes is no longer considered cool. As a result, Homer decides to take Bart and Lisa to the Hullabalooza music festival. At the festival, Homer tries to act cool by wearing a Rastafarian hat, but all he does is humiliate himself and is confronted by an angry crowd of Generation Xers who mistake him for a narc. After being tossed out by the crowd, Homer angrily kicks a cannon, which shoots one of Peter Frampton's inflatable pigs at his stomach. The festival head is impressed and Homer is hired {{as a part of}} the festival's freak show.|$|E
5|$|All major {{characters}} in the miniseries were played by the five members <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> in the Hall, except for the mayor's son, who was played by young actor Landon Reynolds-Trudel. Several of the original The Kids in the Hall characters appear in cameo roles, including Mark McKinney's Chicken Lady as a candidate juror and Paul Bellini clad only in his towel at an ATM; in addition, McCulloch and McKinney's police officers are tweaked variations of their OPP officer characters of the original series.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{proposed}} by Bruce McCulloch during a 2008 The Kids in the Hall comedy tour and {{developed by the}} ensemble into a dark-comedy murder mystery, a departure from their typical sketch comedy format. Inspiration for the series came {{in part from the}} British comedy series The League of Gentlemen. While the members <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> in the Hall play all of the major adult characters, a number of other comedic actors appear in supporting roles, including Dan Redican, Colin Mochrie, Wayne Robson, Susan Kent and Mike Beaver. The series was filmed in North Bay, Mattawa and Sturgeon Falls, Ontario in the summer of 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} {{virtually}} {{the same in the}} DS version, but with some major differences in the introductory sequence: Luneth goes to the Altar Cave alone, but while exploring he trips and falls into a hole created by the earthquake. He is then beset by goblins, and while he is frantically searching for a way out, he comes upon the wind crystal. It tells him that he has been chosen as a Warrior of Light, destined to restore balance to the world, and there are three others like him, but before Luneth can ask it to elaborate, he is teleported to the surface. He returns to Ur, but Elder Topapa does not elucidate much on the matter. Going to a corner of town, Luneth finds his friend Arc being bullied by some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids.</b> When Luneth intervenes, Arc runs away, heading for the village of Kazus.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} Mt. Battle, people inform Wes and Rui that Cipher {{has already}} taken over {{the first section of}} the mountain. After battling nine other Trainers, Wes battles the Cipher administrator Dakim. Dakim owns a Shadow Entei, {{who is one of the}} trio of legendary beasts. After defeating Dakim, Wes heads to The Under, which is an underground city located underneath Pyrite Town, and under the control of Cipher. More members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kids</b> Grid are here. They tell the player of Venus, another Cipher administrator, who has influence over The Under. After Wes confronts Venus, the owner of the second legendary beast Suicune, she flees. Next, Wes and Rui head to the Shadow Pokémon Lab, where Pokémon are transformed into Shadow Pokémon. After defeating numerous Cipher peons, Wes faces Ein, the final Cipher administrator and the owner of the final legendary beast Raikou.|$|E
5|$|Veronica meets Parker Lee (Julie Gonzalo), who annoys both Veronica and Mac. Veronica, Parker, Mac, Wallace, and Piz go to a concert. Veronica {{talks about}} Piz’s {{problem at the}} concert, and three kids say that they saw a white girl who was faking being fat. Dick shows up at Mac’s door and tells her that Beaver never cared about her. Veronica finds Piz’s guitar, and they visit the seller. The seller’s {{description}} matches that of other people. Veronica talks to Piz about a suspect, {{but he says that}} it doesn’t match the woman he saw. Keith and the bail-jumper’s car gets stranded. Veronica signs up for the mentoring program in criminology class, and she notices that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> at the concert has a criminal record. Dick gets beaten up when he talks to another man’s girlfriend, but Logan tases the man. Veronica finds the Welcome Wagon girl, the seller’s husband.|$|E
50|$|As {{noted above}} {{concerning}} the ending, {{the most common}} interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel is that Holden kills <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> in a Fort Griffin, Texas, outhouse. The fact that <b>the</b> <b>kid's</b> death is not depicted might be significant. Blood Meridian is a catalog of brutality, depicting, in sometimes explicit detail, all manner of violence, bloodshed, brutality and cruelty. For the dramatic climax to be left undepicted leaves something of a vacuum for the reader: knowing full well the horrors established in <b>the</b> past hundreds <b>of</b> pages, <b>the</b> <b>kid's</b> unstated fate might still be too awful to describe, and {{too much for the}} mind to fathom: <b>the</b> sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid's</b> fate leaves several witnesses stunned almost to silence; never in the book does any other character have this response to violence, again underlining <b>the</b> singularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid's</b> fate.|$|R

25|$|In the 2000' s, China {{introduced}} boot camps combining forced {{physical exercise}} and {{various forms of}} shock torture to try and cure kids who have been addicted to internet use and videogames.

25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.|$|E

25|$|A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), {{who never}} quite understands {{what is going}} on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, idiocy and pretense annoys {{everyone}} he meets, although he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which we see a flashback of Darill {{as a child in}} Belgium, and the strange rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date he has brought back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals that the only thing he ever daydreams about is a tiny oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> in the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill onto that show.|$|E
25|$|Noll {{has become}} a popular {{internet}} meme, particularly in Australia. The popular phrase 'Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australian Idol title' gained popularity in 2015, with multiple Facebook pages appearing featuring the phrase. Noll acknowledged the internet fame, finding it 'very funny' and stating 'Some of the stuff they’ve done is bloody brilliant and very clever and very funny. I reckon half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> putting together these memes {{need to be on}} my marketing team!' In January 2016 a Facebook page was created titled 'Get Shannon Noll to Groovin' the Moo 2016'. Despite the pages thousands of likes the organisers of Groovin' the Moo didn't reach out to the artist to perform. In June 2016, the 'GATchphrase' for the 2016 GAT (a theme chosen by the VCE students of Victoria to write into their papers to show group protest) was voted to be Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australia Idol title. An estimated 3,600 took part in this event. Noll is recognisable by his southern cross tattoo, an image of which was highly circulated in internet meme culture. This displays his patriotic pride and love for Australia.|$|E
25|$|After the Schism, around {{half of all}} the mutants on Utopia {{accompany}} Wolverine to Westchester {{to be a part of}} the new school. He appoints {{himself as}} the headmaster, Kitty Pryde as the co-headmistress, Hank McCoy as the vice-principal, and various other characters such as Rogue, Cannonball, Iceman, Rachel Grey, and Gambit are appointed as the school's staff. Toad is appointed as a janitor. The first issue focuses on the state education board visiting to approve of their school application. As Logan and Kitty give the delegation a tour, Kade Kilgore shows up and tells Logan that he is the one who caused the Schism and he will destroy all that Logan has worked to build up. Wolverine founded the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, spending all the fortune that he had amassed over the years upon it. On its first day it was assaulted by the new Hellfire Club, who had been a major force in causing the Schism of the X-Men. Wolverine made it clear that he didn't want to lose any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> and fought as hard as he could against the Frankenstein Monsters whom Iceman defeated by making Ice clones of himself. Then, they were attacked by the Hellfire Club, who were in possession of a spawn of the original Krakoa.|$|E
