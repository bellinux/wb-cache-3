5|$|Along with Democrats John Stuart Williams, William Lindsay, and J. Proctor Knott, and Republican Robert Boyd, McCreary was {{nominated}} for a U.S. Senate seat in 1878. Democrats were divided by sectionalism and initially unable to unite behind one of their four candidates. After more than a week of caucusing among Democratic legislators, the nominations of McCreary, Knott, and Lindsay were withdrawn, and Williams was elected over Boyd. Historian Hambleton Tapp opined that the withdrawals were likely a part <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of deal among legislators, although the details of the deal, if it ever existed, were not made public.|$|E
5|$|Einstein and De Haas {{demonstrated}} that magnetization {{is due to}} the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> is responsible for magnetization.|$|E

5|$|The film marked {{something}} of an {{end of an era}} for its creator. The director himself recognized this {{at the time of its}} release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, {{a remnant}} of the {{earliest}} known bridge-like structure in London was discovered alongside Vauxhall Bridge, when shifting currents washed away a layer of silt which had covered it. Dating to between 1550BC and 300BC, it consists of two rows of wooden posts, which it is believed would originally have carried a deck <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind.</b> It is believed {{that it did not}} cross the whole river, but instead connected the south bank to an island, possibly used for burial of the dead. As no mention of this or similar structures in the area is made in Julius Caesar's account of crossing the Thames nor by any other Roman author, it is presumed that the structure had been dismantled or destroyed prior to Caesar's expedition to Britain in 55BC. The posts are still visible at extreme low tides.|$|E
5|$|It is in {{this period}} that the broch was built. Part of the {{structure}} has been lost to coastal erosion, and modern sea defences have been erected. The tower was probably originally 13metres (40feet) or more high and as with many broch sites the position would have commanded fine views of the surrounding seas. During this period archaeological sites in Shetland usually exhibit defensive fortifications <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind,</b> and Jarlshof is no exception. An outer defensive wall associated with the broch contained a substantial (although rather poorly constructed) house and byre at one time. This wall was utilised at a later stage to build a large roundhouse {{in the lee of}} the broch.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{suburb of}} Royton {{is served by}} a school <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind,</b> {{including}} some with religious affiliations. All the schools in the town perform either {{at or above the}} national average for test results. Royton has several primary schools, including St Annes, Thorp Primary School and S.s. Aidan and Oswalds Primary. Royton has two secondary schools, Royton and Crompton School and Our Lady's R.C. High School. Royton and Crompton is a coeducational, secondary comprehensive school for 11- to 16-year-olds. It has Science College status and was constructed in 1968. Our Lady's is a coeducational Roman Catholic high school and sixth form college for 11- to 19-year-olds. It was established in 1961 and specialialises in Mathematics and Computing. In the 2000s, Oldham Council and the Diocese of Salford agreed to merge Our Lady's with the St Augustine of Canterbury R.C. High School in Werneth. However, the proposal, which would have a newly built Catholic secondary on a new site in the 2010s, has been met with protest.|$|E

5|$|Reich {{responded with}} a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein's mind. To rule out the {{influence}} of convection he told Einstein {{that he had taken}} certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the accumulator, wrapping it in a blanket, hanging it from the ceiling, burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that in all these circumstances the temperature difference remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air. Einstein did not respond to this or to Reich's future correspondence– Reich would write regularly reporting the results of his experiments– until Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and asked that his name not be misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein's change of heart was part of a conspiracy <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind,</b> perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as The Einstein Affair.|$|E
5|$|Ripley deciphers {{part of the}} transmission, {{determining}} it's not a distress signal, but {{a warning}} <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind.</b> In the spacecraft, Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of large egg-like objects. When he touches one, it opens and a creature springs out and attaches to his face through the facemask of his spacesuit. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo. As acting senior officer, Ripley refuses to let them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash ignores Ripley and lets them in. The crew unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. It later detaches on its own and is found dead. The ship is partly repaired, and the crew lifts off. Kane awakens with some memory loss but otherwise unharmed. During a final crew meal before returning to stasis, he chokes and convulses in pain then dies as a small alien creature bursts from his chest and escapes into the ship. The crew attempts to locate it with a tracking device and capture or kill it with nets, electric prods and flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|Opinion amongst modern historians is also split; for instance, Fine {{accepts the}} concept of the Peace of Callias, whereas Sealey {{effectively}} rejects it. Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia, but no actual treaty. Fine argues that Callisthenes's denial that a treaty was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point. Further, he suggests that Theopompus was actually referring to a treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in 423 BC. If these views are correct, it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty's existence. A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in 449 BC, which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of peace agreement. On the other hand, if there was indeed some kind of accommodation, Thucydides's failure to mention it is odd. In his digression on the pentekontaetia, his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power, and such a treaty, {{and the fact that the}} Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it, would have marked a major step in the Athenian ascendancy. Conversely, it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides's history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement. There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty's existence.|$|E

5000|$|Researchers {{uncovered}} mounting {{empirical evidence}} of the idiosyncratic nature of media effects on individuals and audiences, identifying numerous intervening variables, such as demographic attributes, social psychological factors, and different media use behaviors. With these new variables added to research, {{it was difficult to}} isolate media influence that resulted in any media effects to an audience's cognition, attitude and behavior. As Berelson (1959) summed up in a widely quoted conclusion: [...] "Some <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> communication on <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> issues have brought to the attention <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> people under <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> conditions have <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> effect." [...] Though the concept of an all-powerful mass media was diluted, this did not determine that the media lacked influence or effect. Instead, the pre-existing structure of social relationships and cultural contexts were believed to primarily shape or change people's opinions, attitudes and behaviors, and media merely function within these established processes. This complexity had a dampening effect upon media effects studies.|$|R
