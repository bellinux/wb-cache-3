5|$|A {{concern for}} sexual {{activity}} that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for both partners is bladder or bowel leakage due to urinary or fecal incontinence. Couples can prepare for sex by draining the bladder using intermittent catheterization or placing towels down in advance. People with indwelling urinary catheters must take special care with them, removing them or taping them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the tag team match between John Cena and Batista versus {{the team of}} King Booker and Finlay. Batista {{wrestled}} the match with his left arm taped up due to a previous injury. Both teams wrestlers inconclusively until Cena applied the STFU on Booker. Finlay broke the submission hold, and The Little Bastard ran into the ring. Little Bastard attempted to kick Cena, but accidentally kicked himself in his head when Cena moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Then, Booker tried to superkick Batista, but Batista moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> and Booker accidentally hit Finlay. Batista then delivered a Batista Bomb and pinned Booker to earn the victory for his team.|$|E
50|$|The {{legislation}} was privately constructed {{before it was}} debated by Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce committees. After 18 hours of debate, Tiberi voted <b>the</b> legislation <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means Committee at 4:30 am on March 9, 2017. <b>The</b> initial version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill was not brought to the House floor for a vote.|$|R

5|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Jeff Hardy. MVP quickly beat down Hardy and {{dominated}} {{early in the}} match. Hardy tried {{to come back with}} a mule kick from the corner, but MVP moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> leading Hardy to crash the mat face first. MVP controlled most of the match, until Hardy finally had some offense with a rope-aided corner dropkick in the corner. With the upper hand, Hardy performed a Swanton bomb on MVP, but MVP moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> MVP tried to perform a running big boot, but Hardy countered into a drop toe hold. The match ended with Hardy winning the match, after performing the Whisper in the Wind, a move performed by executing a backflip from the top turnbuckle, then spinning 180°, landing on a fallen opponent back-first.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched {{their attention to the}} Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating with at least one photographer to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of his view of the game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that there appeared to be nothing wrong at this point.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Criterion {{launched}} their follow-up to Burnout 3: Takedown, titled Burnout Revenge. Revenge retained Takedowns {{but continued to}} evolve the aggressive style of driving by introducing new features {{such as the ability}} to knock traffic <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> and into opponents. With Revenge, Criterion wanted to set the game on its own path rather than just recreate Burnout 3 again. Ward admitted that later Burnout games may not have recaptured the same quintessential feeling that Burnout 3 did. He considered Burnout 3 to be the game that he was most proud of working on and high point for the studio.|$|E

5|$|Marine {{researchers}} {{note that}} mammals and birds {{get the most}} attention but smaller creatures {{at the base of}} the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil. Life on the sea floor and near the shore such as mussels, barnacles, and other shellfish are unable to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E
5|$|Removal {{of mines}} and {{obstacles}} from the beach, {{a job that}} had to be performed quickly before the tide came in at 10:30, was the assignment of 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions and the eight dozer tanks. The teams used explosives to destroy beach obstacles and blow gaps in the sea wall to allow quicker access for troops and vehicles. The dozer tanks pushed the wreckage <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to create clear lanes for further landings.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reason for}} this 87 king {{position}} is because it is faster to create: the usual right-side Mino castle has the king positioned on the second file from the edge.

50|$|The {{practice}} arose because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrow passageways on ships. Since officers {{may need}} to quickly move about the ship, sailors would get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officer's <b>way</b> by bracing. <b>The</b> tradition has extended to include the corridors and hallways of buildings (depending on the situation), and it is mostly an obeisance, but it still serves a useful purpose aboard ships (especially submarines).|$|R

5|$|The {{court was}} shown {{extensive}} video footage of Tomlinson and Harwood on the day.

Harwood pushed a man who blew a vuvuzela at him, then appeared to push a BBC cameraman who was filming the arrest of another man. The footage showed Harwood push a third man <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> and shortly after this (the passageway now almost empty) the officers reached Tomlinson.|$|E
50|$|It {{can also}} be used for {{subsequent}} biotechnology applications such as for <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> transgenic animals using innovative gene-editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs and ZFNs for biomedical research.

50|$|In {{a futuristic}} Manhattan, AIs have become {{intelligent}} and independent of humans.

5|$|The next {{match on}} the card was the Six-Man tag team match. The Headshrinkers' manager Afa {{interfered}} by attacking Billy Gunn outside the ring. At one point, Tatanka {{looked like he was}} gaining control, as he began his usual war dance. Bigelow kicked him {{in the back of the}} head, however, to end his momentum. Near the end of the match, Bigelow and the Headshrinkers each climbed the turnbuckles to attempt simultaneous diving headbutts, but Tatanka rolled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Tatanka seized the opportunity and pinned Samu for the win.|$|E
5|$|The second {{match was}} Tyson Tomko, {{accompanied}} by Trish Stratus, versus Chris Jericho.

5|$|After Hōshō was commissioned, {{experienced}} aircrews requested changes, and {{the ship}} was modified by the Yokosuka Navy Arsenal from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed the flight deck and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part of the flight deck was made horizontal, and the 8cm AA guns were moved forward, close {{to the position of}} the former island and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of landing operations. After the island was removed, the carrier's flight operations were controlled from a platform extending {{from the side of the}} flight deck, a design that would be repeated in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.|$|E
5|$|Along a highway, {{the group}} is forced to stop {{as a number of}} {{abandoned}} cars litter the road, making it impossible to pass; further, Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) must stop to fix his RV. As the others push cars <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> and scavenge for supplies, a horde of walkers appear behind them. The group take shelter under cars to avoid conflict, though in his haste, T-Dog (IronE Singleton) severely cuts his arm. Some walkers spot Sophia (Madison Lintz), daughter of Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride), hiding under a car, and she flees into the nearby forest. Rick follows her and tells her to find someplace safe to hide while he dispatches the walkers.|$|E
5|$|Amelia and Kanyenke next {{fight the}} Circle at their last stronghold in Cuba, and, after allying with the Spanish colony of Havana and {{awaiting}} {{the arrival of}} the U.S. Navy, they destroy the Ossuary and the fixed guns guarding it. As the battle is ending, Amelia and Kanyenke pass under an archway in which Beaumont is concealed. Beaumont jumps down and attempts to stab Amelia but Kanyenke pushes her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> All three tumble to the ground. Beaumont charges at Amelia, about to stab her, but when Beaumont gets near, Amelia kicks him and pushes him backwards. He quickly charges at her again, but she grabs her shotgun and shoots him. Amelia later uses the Circle's stored treasure to revive the Falcon Company and succeeds in building railroads to the west coast.|$|E

25|$|Under the Fiscal Year 2010 budget resolution, <b>the</b> text <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{reconciliation}} bill {{submitted to}} the Budget Committee {{had to have been}} reported by the relevant Committees by October 15, 2009. Therefore, the Democrats combined <b>the</b> text <b>of</b> America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 as reported <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means Committee, and as it was reported <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Education and Labor Committee, and <b>the</b> text <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act as reported <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Education and Labor Committee. This version was never meant to be passed; it was only created so that the reconciliation bill would comply with the Budget resolution. The bill was automatically amended to the version that was meant to be passed per the special rule that was reported <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rules Committee. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act was added to the Reconciliation Act as only one reconciliation bill can be passed each budget year, and it also faced a tough road through the Senate due to Republican filibuster and opposition from several centrist Democratic Senators. The move was also thought to give President Obama two key victories in overhauling the health care and student loan system. It also eventually became clear that the budget savings caused by the student loan bill would become essential to the overall reconciliation bill by reducing the deficit enough for the overall bill to qualify for the reconciliation process.|$|R
