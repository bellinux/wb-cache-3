5|$|The third contest had Zach Gowen facing Matt Hardy. Both men {{performed}} {{a variety of}} moves on one another until Gowen {{performed a}} springboard moonsault with <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> on Hardy for the win.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius had {{at least}} one illegitimate son, John Athalarichos, who conspired a plot against Heraclius with his cousin, the magister Theodorus, and the Armenian noble David Saharuni. When Heraclius {{discovered}} the plot, he had Athalarichos's nose and hands cut off, and he was exiled to Prinkipo, one of the Princes' Islands. Theodorus had the same treatment but was sent to Gaudomelete (possibly modern day Gozo Island) with additional instructions to cut off <b>one</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E

5|$|Krishna {{is often}} {{depicted}} wearing a peacock-feather wreath or crown, {{and playing the}} bansuri (Indian flute). In this form, he is usually shown standing with <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> bent {{in front of the}} other in the Tribhanga posture. He is sometimes accompanied by cows or a calf, which symbolise the divine herdsman Govinda. Alternatively, he is shown as a romantic and seductive man with the gopis (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{enlisted in}} the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1942, where he was tasked with drawing {{airplane}} diagrams. A problem with <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> prevented him from being aircrew. In late 1943, following recommendations from artists William Dargie and Harold Herbert, he was commissioned as an official war artist attached to the army, and given the rank of lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Philip Morrison {{was born}} in Somerville, New Jersey, November 7, 1915, the only son of Moses Morrison and Tillie Rosenbloom. He had a younger sister, Gail. The family moved to Pittsburgh when he was two. He {{contracted}} polio when he was four, {{and as a result}} wore a calliper on <b>one</b> <b>leg,</b> and spent his last years in a wheelchair.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a variety}} of stained glass within the {{building}} including coats of arms, a sundial and depictions of various birds. A window {{to the west of}} main range has medieval stained glass including a picture of a swan ringing a bell, as at the Bishop's Palace, Wells, with others including a peacock, a heron, an owl, a crane and a bird with a bell attached to <b>one</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E
5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E
5|$|Already before this, in 1430, FitzAlan had {{departed}} for France, where {{he held a}} series of important command positions. He served under John, Duke of Bedford, the uncle of the eight-year-old King Henry VI. FitzAlan was involved in recovering fortresses in the Île-de-France region, and in suppressing local rebellions. His military career ended, however, at the Battle of Gerbevoy in 1435. Refusing to retreat in the face of superior forces, Arundel was shot in the foot and captured. His leg was later amputated, and he died shortly afterwards from the injury. His final resting place was a matter of dispute until the mid-nineteenth century, when his tomb at Arundel Castle was revealed to contain a skeleton missing <b>one</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ballroom tango steps {{stay close}} to the floor, while the River Plata Tango (Uruguayan and Argentine) {{includes}} moves such as the boleo (allowing momentum to carry <b>one's</b> <b>leg</b> into the air) and gancho (hooking <b>one's</b> <b>leg</b> around <b>one's</b> partner's <b>leg</b> or body) in which the feet travel off the ground. Both Uruguayan and Argentine tango features other vocabulary foreign to ballroom, such as the parada (in which the leader puts his foot against the follower's foot), the arrastre (in which the leader appears to drag or be dragged by the follower's foot), and several kinds of sacada (in which the leader displaces the follower's leg by stepping into her space).|$|R

50|$|An {{interesting}} {{analogy is}} that using the side or soccer style kick means <b>one's</b> <b>leg</b> becomes {{similar to a}} golf club, also allowing for great accuracy.|$|R
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only <b>one</b> <b>leg.</b> This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|Cole is {{classified}} in the S9 category in swimming due to her amputation, a classification that also includes swimmers who have joint restrictions in <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> and those with double below-knee amputations. She began competitive swimming in 2003 and, at the 2006 IPC Swimming World Championships in Durban, she won a silver medal in the women's 100m backstroke S9 event. Also in 2006 Cole won the 100m backstroke at the Telstra Australian Swimming Championships. Cole qualified for the Australian Paralympic Swim Team in 2008 and, in the same year, attended the Beijing Paralympics where she won a silver medal in the Women's 100m Butterfly S9 event and bronze medals in the 400m Freestyle and 100m Backstroke events.|$|E

5|$|During {{its early}} years, the Centre Democrats {{received}} extensive media attention on two occasions. The first {{occurred when the}} Centre Democrats and Centre Party met on 29 March 1986 in Kedichem. A group of anti-fascist activists believed that the two parties were planning to merge, and firebombed the hotel where the meeting was held. The venue was severely damaged, Janmaat narrowly escaped death and the party secretary Wil Schuurman had <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> amputated after jumping from a window to escape the conflagration.|$|E
5|$|Emmy's father, Max Noether, was {{descended from}} a family of {{wholesale}} traders in Germany. At 14, he had been paralyzed by polio. He regained mobility, but <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> remained affected. Largely self-taught, he was awarded a doctorate from the University of Heidelberg in 1868. After teaching there for seven years, he took a position in the Bavarian city of Erlangen, where he met and married Ida Amalia Kaufmann, the daughter of a prosperous merchant. Max Noether's mathematical contributions were to algebraic geometry mainly, {{following in the footsteps of}} Alfred Clebsch. His best known results are the Brill–Noether theorem and the residue, or AF+BG theorem; several other theorems are associated with him; see Max Noether's theorem.|$|E
5|$|Female okapis become {{sexually mature}} at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach {{maturity}} after two years. Rut in males and estrus in females {{does not depend}} on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The male and the female begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing his head and protruding <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.|$|E

5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and could {{move quickly to}} catch balls hit some distance from him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded {{him as one of}} the best slip fielders in England.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|The Borobudur reliefs {{also pay}} close {{attention}} to Indian aesthetic discipline, such as pose and gesture that contain certain meanings and aesthetic value. The reliefs of noblemen, and noble women, kings, or divine beings such as apsaras, taras and boddhisattvas are usually portrayed in tribhanga pose, the three-bend pose on neck, hips, and knee, with <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> resting and one upholding the body weight. This position is considered as the most graceful pose, such as the figure of Surasundari holding a lotus.|$|E
