40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{study the}} pattern of ocular aberrations in {{amblyopic}} children, and evaluate a possible relation to etiology and treatment outcomes of amblyopia. MethodsThe WaveScan Wavefront System (AMO, Santa Ana, CA, USA) aberrometer {{was used to assess}} 75 eyes (60 children) after instillation of 1 % cyclopentolate eyedrops. There were 29 males and 31 females {{with a mean age of}} 9. 23 ± 2. 55 years (range, 5 – 14 years). The study sample was subdivided into four groups; 16 emmetropic non-amblyopic eyes (control group); 24 pre-treatment newly diagnosed amblyopic eyes; 16 eyes of treated amblyopes and; 19 eyes with refractory amblyopia. ResultsAmblyopes had statistically significant greater root mean square (RMS) values for whole eye aberrations, 2 nd order aberrations, defocus (Z 20) and astigmatism (Z 22) compared to emmetropes (P< 0. 0001). The refractory amblyopic group showed statistically significant differences in whole eye RMS, 2 nd order- aberrations, defocus (Z 20) and astigmatism (Z 22) when compared to treated amblyopic groups (P< 0. 0001). Apart from a statistically significant difference in 5 th order RMS of pre-treated amblyopes versus the control group, no other significant differences were found in higher order aberrations (HOAs: coma, spherical, higher-order astigmatism, trefoil, or 3 rd, 4 th, 5 th or 6 th order terms) between emmetropes and any of the amblyopic groups. ConclusionLower order aberrations remain the major factor that affect retinal image quality and hence amblyopia development especially in ametropic eyes. This can be corrected optically. Studying HOA profile in amblyopic eyes failed to explain why refractory amblyopia does not respond to <b>orthoptic</b> <b>treatments.</b> This outcome indicates that theories of central problems in image processing and binocular interaction are likely the main cause of refractory amblyopia...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of different kinds of reperfusion on I/R injury in a rat model. Arterialized <b>orthoptic</b> rat liver <b>treatment</b> was performed on male LEWIS-(RT 1) -rats. Three groups (n = 7) were formed. Group I: antegrade reperfusion with a 6 -min delayed reperfusion via the hepatic artery. Group II: Antegrade reperfusion, simultaneously, via the portal vein and the hepatic artery. Group III: Retrograde reperfusion via the vena cava. Serum parameters were determined one, 24 and 48 h after operation. Furthermore, after 48 h, the liver was taken for histological assessment. After 48 h, rats of group III showed significantly lower aspartate amino transferase and alanine amino transferase serum levels compared with group I and group II rats. Forty-eight hours after transplantation, glutamate dehydrogenase serum level was significantly lower in group III than in group II. In histology, group III livers showed significantly less necrotic spots than group I and group II livers. Maximum size of the necrotic spots was significantly lower in group III than in group I. Also, significantly more necrotic spots were seen in the ‘Rappaport′s zone’ 1 and 2 of group I than in group III. Our data suggested that the expression of I/R-injury correlates with the type of reperfusion. Furthermore, under standard conditions, this study was able to demonstrate that in a rat model, the retrograde reperfusion leads to a lower expression of I/R-injury than the antegrade reperfusion...|$|R
40|$|DURING {{the last}} few years it has been found that many {{patients}} presumed to have normal binocular single vision after optical, <b>orthoptic,</b> and/or surgical <b>treatment,</b> have in fact a small angle of anomaly. From certain points of view this is not of great importance, as such cases are satisfactory cosmetically, and show good visual acuity in each eye with a limited degree of fusion detectable by certain tests. On the other hand, the amplitude of fusion is invariably restricted and true stereopsis is absent, and this is an unfortunate state of affairs in these days when normal binocular function is required in an increasing number of professions. Even if (in common with some authors) we decry the value of stereopsis, there remain the risks associated with a small range of fusion-secondary divergence and the gradual establishment of amblyopia. It is not unusual to encounter heterophoria of as much as twelve degrees, which, if associated with good fusion, causes no subjective symptoms. By contrast, quite low degrees of heterophoria, if associated with lack of fusion, may lead to intermittent or permanent decompensation. This is not meant to imply that our standards are so high that our poorest results are those in which the residual angle is so small as to be hardly detectable by the ordinary methods of measurement; on the contrary, we classify such cases as "successful failures". An analysis of these results, however, suggests that perhaps these small residual angles might have been avoided, and perhaps also that, from the strictly sensory viewpoint (because it is harder to improve the sensory relationship in a case with a small angle of anomaly than in one with a large angle), we have made matters worse by treatment...|$|R

40|$|FOR {{many years}} we have made, under the {{surgeons}} with whom we have worked, {{a study of the}} most beneficial glasses that can be ordered in conjunction with <b>orthoptic</b> <b>treatment,</b> because we have felt that the success of <b>orthoptic</b> <b>treatment</b> depends upon the glasses ordered, and we are convinced that glasses are the basis of <b>orthoptic</b> <b>treatment.</b> In cases of convergent squint associated with hypermetropia, experience has shown us that, when the relationship between con-vergence and accommodation breaks down, the patient makes an excessive convergence effort to obtain clear vision uniocularly and, if diplopia has been present, to separate the images far enough for them not to be confusing. The suppression of the second image is thus facilitated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A meticulous fundoscopy is an {{essential}} examination before administering an orthoptic occlusion therapy (patching), even in cases with a "clear indication" for patching. In this case of an 8 -year-old hyperopic boy the subsequent fundoscopy revealed a bilateral maculopathy that explained the stagnation of the increase of the monocular visual acuity (VA) {{in spite of a}} correctly applied patching. HISTORY AND SIGNS: The patient was a boy (8 years old) with a history of ineffective <b>orthoptic</b> <b>treatment</b> for 15 months due to hyperopia. Complete ophthalmological examination, optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT, Zeiss, Germany) and electro-oculography (EOG) were performed. No "everyday" symptoms were found. Best corrected VA (hyperopic) on the right was 10 / 20, on the left 8 / 20. Binocular VA was 20 / 20. 15 out of 15 Ishihara plates were identified on both sides. Orthophoria has been seen. Perimetry revealed bilateral nasal-parafoveal microscotoma. Fundoscopy showed a confined and slightly prominent yellow spot on the temporal side of the fovea. OCT revealed a subfoveal accumulation of solid material in the RPE in both eyes. EOG showed normal findings in our case. THERAPY AND OUTCOME: There was no further deterioration of VA in a follow-up time of 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Ineffective <b>orthoptic</b> <b>treatment</b> (patching) in amblyopic children should prompt the ophthalmologist to a meticulous fundoscopy, even if done so before patching, which is highly recommended. This young patient had no "everyday" visual symptoms. Because mainly the temporal fovea on both sides was affected, he showed normal binocular VA inspite of bilateral VA reduction. The authors think that this effect is due to biretinal summation (retinal filling in) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSome strabismic {{patients}} with inconstant squint can fuse two images {{in a single}} eye, and experience lustre and depth. One of these images is foveal and the other extrafoveal. Depth perception was tested on 30 such subjects. Relief was perceived mostly on the fixated image. Camouflaged continuous surfaces (hemispheres, cylinders) were perceived as bumps or hollows, without detail. Camouflaged rectangles could not be separated in depth from the background, while their explicit counterparts could. Slanted bars were mostly interpreted as frontoparallel near or remote bars. Depth responses were more frequent with stimuli involving inward rather than outward disparities, and were then heavily biased towards “near” judgements. All monocular fusion effects were markedly reduced after the recovery of normal stereoscopic vision following an <b>orthoptic</b> <b>treatment.</b> The depth effects reported here may provide clues on what stereoscopic pathways {{may or may not}} accomplish with incomplete retinal and misleading vergence information...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This study {{reports a}} case series of <b>orthoptic</b> <b>treatment</b> (OT) for {{convergence}} insufficiency (CI) in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Method: We are reporting two cases {{of individuals with}} PD who completed OT for CI. Both had a confirmed diagnosis of CI, accompanied by CI-type symptomatology. They each underwent an OT program consisting of three office-based visits and 8 weeks of home-based exercises. Treatment outcome {{was based on the}} changes measured pre- versus post-OT on the near point of convergence, positive fusional vergences, and symptomatology score. Results: The two participants successfully completed therapy, gained ability to converge, had fewer symptoms, and were satisfied with the OT-induced changes they felt in their day-to-day lives. Conclusion: This case series show that OT for CI in PD is possible. Further research is required as these results demonstrate that OT has the potential to improve symptomatic CI in these patients. In the meantime, the positive results obtained in these two cases should encourage clinicians to consider OT (a therapy with no/minimal risk) for CI in patients with PD whose quality of life is affected by this binocular dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} orthoptic treatments {{in the management of}} intermittent exotropia Methods: In a retrospective study, clinical records of patients diagnosed with intermittent exotropia were reviewed. Patients with basic, convergence insufficiency (CI) and divergence excess (DE) types of intermittent exotropia who underwent orthoptic treatments were enrolled. Office treatments included prism exercises and pencil push-ups, and home exercises included pencil push-ups, 3 D tests and dominant eye occlusion. Clinical evaluation of symptoms, binocular orthoptic status and maximum angle of deviation was done before treatment and at 8 weeks after the beginning of the treatment and at the time of last examination. Results: Seventy four patients {{with a mean age of}} 18. 4 ± 12. 2 years and mean follow-up of 13. 5 ± 10. 1 weeks were included in the study. Forty three (58. 1 %) patients had a basic type of exodeviation, 22 (29. 7 %) had a CI type of exodeviation and 9 (12 %) had a DE type of exodeviation. The treatment was successful in 88. 3 % of patients in basic type, all patients in CI type and 88. 8 % in DE group. Success rate was not significantly different between the three groups (P= 0. 25). Strabismus surgery was performed in one patient in basic type and one in DE group due to the lack of improvement. Conclusion: <b>Orthoptic</b> <b>treatment</b> seems to be effective in reducing symptoms and improving signs of intermittent exotropia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{tested the}} hypothesis that the successful treatment of convergence insufficiency (CI) with vision-training (VT) procedures, leads to an increased capacity of vergence adaptation (VAdapt) allowing a more rapid downward adjustment of the convergence accommodation cross-link. Nine subjects with CI were recruited from a clinical population, based upon reduced fusional vergence amplitudes, receded near point of convergence or symptomology. VAdapt and the resulting changes to convergence accommodation (CA) were measured at specific intervals over 15 min (pre-training). Separate clinical measures of the accommodative convergence cross link, horizontal fusion limits and near point of convergence were taken and a symptomology questionnaire completed. Subjects then participated in a VT program composed of 2. 5 h at home and 1 h in-office weekly for 12 – 14 weeks. Clinical testing was done weekly. VAdapt and CA measures were retaken once clinical measures normalized for 2 weeks (mid-training) and then again when symptoms had cleared (post-training). VAdapt and CA responses as well as the clinical measures were taken on a control group showing normal clinical findings. Six subjects provided complete data sets. CI clinical findings reached normal levels between 4 and 7 weeks of training but symptoms, VAdapt, and CA output remained significantly different from the controls until 12 – 14 weeks. The hypothesis was retained. The reduced VAdapt and excessive CA found in CI were normalized through <b>orthoptic</b> <b>treatment.</b> This time course was underestimated by clinical findings but matched symptom amelioration...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{analyze the}} impact of early {{ametropia}} detection on clinical and economic treatment aspects. Patients and methods. Retrospectively, quality of ophthalmological care in 60 children aged 6 - 8 with ametropia and strabismus was analyzed. All children were divided into three groups depending on age, refractive error and year at which treatment was initiated. In group 1 (30 children), refractive error and strabismus were diagnosed at {{the first year of}} life. In group 2 (18 children), refractive error and strabismus were diagnosed at the age of 1 - 3 years. In group 3 (12 children), glasses were prescribed at the age of 3 - 7 years. Retrospective analysis of primary medical records of enrolled patients was performed. All diagnostic and treatment methods that were applied as well as treatment results performed at the age of 6 - 8 were considered. The study of economic aspects considered the rates of ophthalmological examinations and pleoptic and <b>orthoptic</b> <b>treatment</b> courses as well as need in surgery. Direct medical costs were calculated for mediumterm prospects (3 - 5 years). Results. Early detection of refractive errors prevents amblyopia, binocular vision impairment, and strabismus. Uncorrected refractive errors in children are characterized by high economic and social burden (i. e., the higher is the age at which refractive error was revealed, the higher treatment costs are). Ametropia diagnosis in children requires special skills, hence, dilated eye exam must be performed by pediatric ophthalmologist but not by an orthoptist. Early diagnosis of refractive errors and strabismus provides accurate glass correction and timely therapy thus reducing treatment costs. Conclusions. In terms of clinical and economic efficacy, optimal age of refractive error detection is less than 1 year. Increase in diagnostic costs is compensated by good clinical outcomes and decrease in costs of managing complications and non-medical costs associated with reduced quality of life of patients and their families.  </span...|$|E
