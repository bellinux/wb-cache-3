5|$|Beginning in 1932, Mary J. L. McDonald {{made the}} then-largest {{donation}} of books {{to the library}} when she donated volumes worth just over $10,000. She donated a total of over 1,000 items that included a complete works of Abraham Lincoln valued at $4,800. In 1936, the Works Progress Administration gave a decorative archway to the library to be installed over the south entrance to the building. The library was among several buildings vandalized by University of Oregon students in October 1945 during {{the run-up to the}} Civil War football game between the two schools. The library received a bequest of about 5,500 volumes valued at about $15,000 in December 1947 from William H. Galvani's estate. This donation overtook that <b>of</b> <b>McDonald</b> to become the largest received by the library up to that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Culver Line {{was opened}} by the Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad {{and was named}} after the railroad's builder, Andrew N. Culver. The line ran along the surface <b>of</b> <b>McDonald</b> Avenue (then Gravesend Avenue) from Greenwood Cemetery (where it connected with horse car lines including the Vanderbilt Avenue Line, operated by the PP until 1886) to the Culver Depot in Coney Island, on June 25, 1875. The PP began serving the Union Depot at 36th Street, where transfer {{could be made to}} the Fifth Avenue Elevated, on June 7, 1890, by using the Prospect Park and South Brooklyn Railroad from a junction at Parkville. During a period of Long Island Rail Road control, from 1893 to 1899, a ramp at 36th Street was opened in 1895, allowing Brooklyn Elevated Railroad trains to operate over the Culver Line to Coney Island. The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), by then the owner of the Brooklyn Elevated, leased the Culver Line (to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad) on June 18, 1899, and began using it to take not only elevated trains but also trolleys to Coney Island.|$|E

Urban life was evoked in the five-movement Cockney Suite (1924), described by The Times as [...] "character pieces complete with leering saxophone, cheeky mouth-organ, and some infernally catchy tunes". Ketèlbey depicts successively a royal procession from Buckingham Palace to the Houses of Parliament; an East End pub, with a main theme based on the Cockney ditty [...] "'Arf a pint of mild and bitter"; a waltz at a palais de danse; a sombre glimpse of the Cenotaph in Whitehall; and in the finale, [...] "'Appy 'Ampstead", {{a picture of the}} August Bank Holiday fair on Hampstead Heath.|$|E

2500|$|If July was a down month, then August was an up {{and down}} month for D.C. United. An early second half goal by Pontius was enough for a 1-0 home win over Columbus, but United next dropped a road match in Kansas City, despite a first-half goal by DeLeon. With two home games next, United was able to secure a draw against the Union, despite an early goal by former D.C. United regular Brian Carroll. United scored the tying goal on an own goal that came on a free kick taken by Branko Bošković, but Bošković was ejected 20 minutes later because of a scrum after De Rosario had {{seemingly}} earned the win for United with penalty kick goal in the 87th minute.
