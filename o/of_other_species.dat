5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apart from A. sarcophagus, A. arctunguis and A. libratus, {{several other}} species of Albertosaurus have been named. All of these are today seen as younger {{synonyms}} <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> or as nomina dubia, and are not assigned to Albertosaurus.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, Oryzomyini {{includes}} over {{a hundred}} species in about thirty genera.

50|$|Hirticlavula elegans fruit {{bodies are}} highly distinctive. The {{characteristic}} hairy stems {{are very different}} from those <b>of</b> any <b>other</b> <b>species</b> in the Clavariaceae. Hairy stems are seen among more distant relatives, including members of Typhula, Pistillina and Pterula. However, the hairs of H. elegans are specialised structures containing numerous cells, while the more irregular hairs on the stems <b>of</b> the <b>other</b> <b>species</b> are merely branched hyphae. In addition, the hairs on the H. elegans stems thicken at the furthest point from the stem, while any hairs on the stems <b>of</b> <b>other</b> known <b>species</b> <b>of</b> clavarioid fungi thin at the end.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the diets <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of porpoises. A {{dissection}} of three Burmeister's porpoises shows that they consume shrimp and euphausiids.

50|$|Not {{all species}} in the large genus Dalbergia yield rosewoods; only about a dozen species do. The woods <b>of</b> some <b>other</b> <b>species</b> in the genus Dalbergia are notable - even famous - woods in their own right: African blackwood, cocobolo, kingwood, and tulipwood. The woods <b>of</b> some <b>other</b> <b>species</b> are usable for tool handles at best.|$|R
50|$|Best {{known as}} the pistachio, Pistacia vera is a small tree native to Iran, grown for its edible seeds. The seeds <b>of</b> the <b>other</b> <b>species</b> were also eaten in prehistory, but {{are too small to}} have {{commercial}} value today. Records of Pistacia from preclassical archaeological sites, and mentions in preclassical texts, always refer to one <b>of</b> these <b>other</b> <b>species</b> (often P. terebinthus).|$|R

5|$|Both {{species were}} {{formerly}} recognized {{as belonging to}} Theriosuchus; K. guimarotae was initially named as T. guimarotae, and specimens of K. langenbergensis were initially referred to T. pusillus upon their discovery. Schwarz and colleagues recognized a number of characteristics that united these two taxa to the exclusion <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of Theriosuchus; in particular, Knoetschkesuchus only has two distinct types of teeth, lacking the leaf-shaped teeth seen in other atoposaurids. Other distinguishing traits include the relatively wide skull, {{and the presence of}} the antorbital and mandibular fenestrae in all life stages.|$|E
5|$|Females lay up to 3,000 eggs {{in one or}} more silk egg sacs, which {{maintain}} a fairly constant humidity level. In some species, the females die afterwards, but females <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> protect the sacs by attaching them to their webs, hiding them in nests, carrying them in the chelicerae or attaching them to the spinnerets and dragging them along.|$|E

5|$|M.challengeri is {{considered}} {{to have the most}} primitive morphology of any species of Metanephrops, having even fewer novelties than the oldest known fossil species, M.rossensis. Its rostrum is longer than that <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> in the thomsoni species group, and the ridge along the midline of the carapace only has two small spines. Unlike some other species of Metanephrops, the carapace is smooth, as are the abdominal tergae, and the chelipeds are covered in fine granules.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys is one {{of about}} thirty genera within the tribe Oryzomyini, {{a diverse group of}} well over a hundred species, many of which were {{formerly}} also included in Oryzomys. Oryzomyini {{is one of}} several tribes within the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, which includes hundreds <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of mainly small rodents, distributed mainly in the Americas and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|The larvae <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of caddisfly make nets {{rather than}} cases. These are silken webs {{stretching}} between aquatic vegetation and over stones. These net-making larvae usually live in running water, different species occupying different habitats with varying water speeds. There {{is a constant}} drift of invertebrates washed downstream by the current, and these animals, and bits of debris, accumulate in the nets which serve both as food traps and as retreats.|$|E

5|$|Thus, {{the species}} {{is now known as}} Euryoryzomys emmonsae. As a species of Euryoryzomys, it is {{classified}} within the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), which includes over a hundred species, mainly from South and Central America. Oryzomyini in turn is part of the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest {{can also}} {{listen in on}} the alarm calls <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species,</b> and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types of calls had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The alarm calls were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{classification}} by Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, Oryzomys antillarum {{is one of}} eight species in the genus Oryzomys, which occurs from the eastern United States (O.palustris) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). O.antillarum is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear {{and it is likely}} that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in the 2006 paper by Weksler and colleagues, which excluded more than forty species from the genus. All are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} demonstrates close coevolution of {{host and}} parasite, {{for example in}} cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species,</b> ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong {{negative impact on the}} host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.|$|E
5|$|Cranial display features, {{such as the}} one {{possessed by}} Cryolophosaurus, make sense in social, gregarious animals, where other members of the species are {{available}} to observe and interpret messages of sexual status. Kevin Padian et al. (2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of bizarre cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>species.</b> Padian et al. noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures {{can be explained by the}} phenomenon of intra-species recognition, which is supported by the fossil evidence. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. (2010) found that the bizarre crest of Cryolophosaurus was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture. According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating.|$|E
