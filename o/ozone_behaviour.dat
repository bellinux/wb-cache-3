40|$|In {{this second}} {{part of a series}} of two papers which aim to study the local impact of deep {{convection}} on the chemical composition of the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (UTLS), we focus on ozone simulation results using a mesoscale model that includes on-line chemistry. A severe convective system observed on 8 February 2001 at Bauru, Brazil, is studied. This unorganised convective system is composed of several convective cells that interact with each other. We show that there is an increase in the ozone concentration in the tropical transitional layer (TTL) in the model during this event, which is compatible with ozone sonde observations from Bauru during the 2004 convective season. The model horizontal variability of ozone in this layer is comparable with the variability of the ozone sonde observations in the same area. The calculation of the ozone budget in the TTL during a 24 h period {{in the area of the}} convective system shows that the <b>ozone</b> <b>behaviour</b> in this layer is mainly driven by dynamics. The horizontal flux at a specific time is the main contribution in the budget, since it drives the sign and the magnitude of the total ozone flux. However, when averaged over the 24 h period, the horizontal flux is smaller than the vertical fluxes, and leads to a net decrease of ozone molecule number of 23 %. The upward motions at the bottom of the TTL, related to the convection activity is the main contributor to the budget over the 24 h period since it can explain 70 % of the total ozone increase in the TTL, while the chemical ozone production inside the TTL is estimated to be 29 % of the ozone increase, if NO x production by lightning (LNO x) is taken into account. It is shown that downward motion at the tropopause induced by gravity waves generated by deep convection is non negligible in the TTL ozone budget, since it represents 24 % of the ozone increase. The flux analysis shows the importance of the vertical contributions during the life time of the convective event (about 8 h). The TTL ozone is driven out of the domain horizontally by the convective outflow during this period, limiting the ozone increase in this layer...|$|E
40|$|The {{high density}} of European surface ozone {{monitoring}} sites offers good opportunities forinvestigation {{of the regional}} ozone representativeness and for evaluation of chemistry climatemodels. In this thesis we analyze both aspects with close relation of one to another. As starting point we analyze ozone trends and the seasonal behavior of ozone concentrations atselected individual stations in different regions of Europe. At this step we are interested to find outhow the observed long-term trends in surface ozone concentrations are consistent across stations,and would the annual <b>ozone</b> <b>behaviour</b> give any distinctive patterns within Europe. The nextanalysis is extended to seasonal-diurnal ozone variations, which appear as the main components ofozone time series and therefore allow to describe the ozone behavior more comprehensively. Theregional representativeness of European ozone measurements is investigated through a clusteranalysis (CA) of ozone air quality data from 1492 European surface monitoring stations (Airbasedatabase). K-means clustering is implemented for 3 sets of properties: (i) seasonal-diurnal variationsin absolute mixing ratio units, (ii) normalized seasonal-diurnal variations, and (iii) averaged andnormalized seasonal and diurnal variations. Each CA identifies different ozone pollution regimes,and each of them is compared with {{the output of the}} multi-year global reanalysis produced withinthe Monitoring of Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) project. Recent methods for evaluation of global chemistry-climate models often provide only thecomparison of the simulated output mean to individual ozone observations or arbitrarily aggregatedsets of observations. This can give general information about the model biases for area, captured bysites, but does not help in the interpretation of these biases. Our CA approach yields useful information for the evaluation of numerical models, as it allows for apre-selection of stations and uses clusters as means to stratify the comparison with the respectivemodel output. Comparing the MACC data to cluster results allows to see whether the model is ableto capture specifics of each group and how well it describes the various ozone pollution regimes. The selected parameters for the investigation of ozone representativeness provide severalpossibilities to distinguish representative groups of ozone over Europe. Relying on the most stableconditions, there are 5 and 4 clusters which adequately describe the seasonal-diurnal ozoneEuropean patterns in case of absolute and normalized properties, respectively. Comparison of the model with observations for individual clusters reveal first of all differentoverestimation biases, and secondly differences mainly in seasonal ozone behavior. These biases aremostly driven by summertime ozone rather than wintertime, where ozone is generally wellpredicted. Such biases decrease from more polluted clusters to cleaner ones. Also the seasonal anddiurnal cycles are described better for clusters with relatively clean signatures. The best fit isobserved for clusters, which stations are influenced more by regional rather than local factors...|$|E
40|$|Stratospheric {{preconditions}} for {{the annual}} Antarctic ozone hole are analysed using the amplitude of quasi-stationary planetary waves in temperature {{as a predictor of}} total <b>ozone</b> column <b>behaviour.</b> It is found that the quasi-stationary wave amplitude in August is highly correlated with September–November total ozone over Antarctica with correlation coefficient as high as 0. 83 indicating that quasi-stationary wave effects in late winter have a persisting influence on the evolution of the ozone hole during the following three months. Correlation maxima are found in both the lower and middle stratosphere. They are likely manifestations of wave activity influence on chemical ozone depletion and large-scale ozone transport, respectively. Both correlation maxima indicate that spring total ozone tends to increase in the case of amplified activity of quasi-stationary waves in late winter...|$|R

For instance, iron changes from a body-centered cubic structure (ferrite) to a face-centered cubic structure (austenite) above 906 °C, and tin undergoes a modification known as tin pest from a metallic form to a semiconductor form below 13.2 °C (55.8 °F).

40|$|Three-year-old beech {{trees were}} exposed to episodes of ozone {{pollution}} {{over a period of}} 128 d beginning in May 1991. The episodes were artificially created to correspond with the meteorological conditions under which ozone pollution normally occurs. The target concentrations were 60, 80, 100 and 120 ppb, and the cumulative dose was slightly greater than that in the UK at the present time, but not above that on parts of the European mainland. The effects of <b>ozone</b> on stomatal <b>behaviour</b> were observed both for trees that were well watered and others that were deprived of water for a period of time. In the well-watered trees there was increased stomatal resistance in the presence of ozone, but in the unwatered trees ozone reduced the increase in stomatal resistance that occurred as water stress developed. These data suggest that the effects of ozone on beech might be deleterious in two respects: (1) when the trees are well supplied with water there may be reduced CO 2 uptake for photosynthesis; (2) if the stomata remain partially open when drought occurs, it may be difficult for the trees to control their water economy at critical times. It is emphasized that these findings apply to young trees under semi-controlled conditions, and further research will be needed to explore the responses of mature trees in the field...|$|R
40|$|Several {{physical}} mechanisms {{concerning the}} impact of Rossby waves on ozone distribution and circulation in the stratosphere and troposphere are studied in the thesis. Summertime total ozone variability over Middle Asia and Northern Scandinavia shows similar wave-like behaviour with typical periods of 10 - 20 days and amplitudes of 20 - 50 Dobson units. These variations are caused by eastward travelling Rossby waves in the lower stratosphere. The same mechanism plays the primary role {{in the formation of}} an intense low ozone episode over Scandinavia in August 2003. A strong anticyclone was formed in the troposphere over Europe {{as a part of a}} Rossby wave train. The anticyclone coincides with a displaced Artic pool of low-ozone air in the stratosphere aloft of the anticyclone. A combination of the two above-mentioned processes results in the total ozone minimum over Northern Europe for summer 2003. Interannual variability of the atmospheric circulation and total ozone during winter is strongly controlled by the diabatic (Brewer-Dobson) circulation which is driven by upward propagating waves from the troposphere. In the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes, wintertime total <b>ozone</b> shows antiphase <b>behaviour</b> with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index on interannual and decadal time-scales. Weaker (stronger) wave activity leads to less (more) northward ozone transport and to a stronger (weaker) AO. Rossby wave activity occurs as episodic wave events and this wave forcing is not uniform during winter. The November-December stratospheric eddy heat flux is strongly anticorrelated with the January-February eddy heat flux in the midlatitude stratosphere and troposphere. Weaker upward wave fluxes in early winter lead to stronger upward wave fluxes from the troposphere as well as to a stronger polar night jet during midwinter and vice versa. Hence upward wave activity fluxes in early winter define, to a considerable extent, the subsequent evolution of the midwinter circulation in the stratosphere and troposphere...|$|R
40|$|Natural rubber {{has a good}} {{potential}} {{to be used as}} a material for the development of wave energy converters (WECs). Generally, rubber has the ability to withstand very large strains without permanent deformation or fracture and is not much affected by exposure to water. This makes it ideal for applications related to wave energy converter (WECs). However, there is a need to predict the efficiency of performance over the full lifetime of such an application given that WECs will represent large, expensive and novel products that must remain operational in an at-sea environment for 10 - 15 years. Pertaining to that criterion, fracture mechanics of rubber is an important aspect as well as strain-history and environmental effects. The objective of this study is to gain a fundamental understanding of several factors that contribute to service lifetime: the effect of ozone and oxidation, stress-strain behaviour including hysteresis, set, and cyclic stress relaxation, mechanical fatigue and the possible role of poorly dispersed filler agglomerates in nucleating failure. The work includes studies of the effect of protective coating layers and of naturally aged rubber artefacts using a mathematical model for diffusion limited oxidation. A literature review has been performed to address rubber science and associated technology, including, the durability of rubber. Experiments encompassing the effect of <b>ozone,</b> cyclic stress-strain <b>behaviour</b> and crack growth & fatigue of rubber were performed to interpret the relevant properties for the consideration of the development of wave energy converters. New parameters for characterizing macro dispersion in rubber are introduced in an attempt to seek a correlation with the life span of rubbers. All these observations and outcomes give an opportunity to enhance our understanding of the factors that determine long-term mechanical properties of rubber, to the general benefit of rubber science and technology...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} {{a detailed description}} of the atmospheric conditions characterizing the high Himalayas, thanks to continuous observations begun in March 2006 at the Nepal Climate Observatory-Pyramid (NCO-P) located at 5079 m a. s. l. on the southern foothills of Mt. Everest, in the framework of ABC-UNEP and SHARE-Ev-K 2 -CNR projects. The work presents a characterization of meteorological conditions and air-mass circulation at NCO-P during the first two years of activity. The mean values of atmospheric pressure, temperature and wind speed recorded at the site were: 551 hPa, − 3. 0 °C, 4. 7 m s− 1, respectively. The highest seasonal values of temperature (1. 7 °C) and relative humidity (94 %) were registered during the monsoon season, which was also characterized by thick clouds, present in about 80 % of the afternoon hours, and by a frequency of cloud-free sky of less than 10 %. The lowest temperature and relative humidity seasonal values were registered during winter, − 6. 3 °C and 22 %, respectively, the season being characterised by mainly cloud-free sky conditions and rare thick clouds. The summer monsoon influenced rain precipitation (seasonal mean: 237 mm), while wind was dominated by flows from the bottom of the valley (S-SW) and upper mountain (N-NE). The atmospheric composition at NCO-P has been studied thanks to measurements of black carbon (BC), aerosol scattering coefficient, PM 1, coarse particles and <b>ozone.</b> The annual <b>behaviour</b> of the measured parameters shows the highest seasonal values during the pre-monsoon (BC: 316. 9 ng m− 3, PM 1 : 3. 9 μg m− 3, scattering coefficient: 11. 9 Mm− 1, coarse particles: 0. 37 cm− 3 and O 3 : 60. 9 ppbv), while the lowest concentrations occurred during the monsoon (BC: 49. 6 ng m− 3, PM 1 : 0. 6 μg m− 3, scattering coefficient: 2. 2 Mm− 1, and O 3 : 38. 9 ppbv) and, for coarse particles, during the post-monsoon (0. 07 cm− 3. At NCO-P, the synoptic-scale circulation regimes present three principal contributions: Westerly, South-Westerly and Regional, as shown by the analysis of in-situ meteorological parameters and 5 -day LAGRANTO back-trajectories. The influence of the brown cloud (AOD> 0. 4) extending over Indo-Gangetic Plains up to the Himalayan foothills has been evaluated by analysing the in-situ concentrations of the ABC constituents. This analysis revealed that brown cloud hot spots mainly influence the South Himalayas during the pre-monsoon, in the presence of very high levels of atmospheric compounds (BC: 1974. 1 ng m− 3, PM 1 : 23. 5 μg m− 3, scattering coefficient: 57. 7 Mm− 1, coarse particles: 0. 64 cm− 3, O 3 : 69. 2 ppbv, respectively). During this season 20 % of the days were characterised by a strong brown cloud influence during the afternoon, leading to a 5 -fold increased in the BC and PM 1 values, in comparison with seasonal means. Our investigations provide clear evidence that, especially during the pre-monsoon, the southern side of the high Himalayan valleys represent a "direct channel" able to transport brown cloud pollutants up to 5000 m a. s. l., where the pristine atmospheric composition can be strongly influenced...|$|R
40|$|Ozonation is {{currently}} {{considered as one}} of the most effective microbial disinfection technologies due to its powerful disinfection capacity and reduction in levels of chlorinated disinfection by-products (DBP). However, ozonation of waters containing bromide can produce bromate ion above regulated levels, leading to tradeoffs between microbial and chemical risks. In efforts to meet increasingly stringent drinking water regulations and to be cost-effective, water suppliers are required to optimize ozone dosage. Therefore, there is a need to develop a robust and flexible tool to accurately describe ozone disinfection processes and contribute to their design and operation. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has come into use recently for evaluating disinfection systems. However, the focus of its application has been largely on modelling the hydraulic behaviour of contactors, which is only one component of system design. The significance of this dissertation is that a fully comprehensive three dimensional (3 D) multiphase CFD model has been developed to address all the major components of ozone disinfection processes: contactor hydraulics, ozone mass transfer, ozone decay, and microbial inactivation. The model was validated using full-scale experimental data, including tracer test results and ozone profiles from full-scale ozone contactors in two Canadian drinking water treatment plants (WTPs) : the DesBaillets WTP in Montréal, Quebec and the Mannheim WTP in Kitchener, Ontario. Good agreement was observed between the numerical simulation and experimental data. The CFD model was applied to investigate ozone contactor performance at the DesBaillets WTP. The CFD-predicted flow fields showed that recirculation zones and short circuiting existed in the DesBaillets contactors. The simulation results suggested that additional baffles could be installed to increase the residence time and improve disinfection efficiency. The CFD model was also used to simulate ozone contactor performance at the Mannheim Water Treatment Plant before and after installing new liquid oxygen (LOX) ozone generators and removing some diffusers from the system. The modelling results indicated that such changes led to an increase in effective residence time, and therefore an adjustment to operational parameters was required after system modification. Another significant contribution is that, for the first time, the Eulerian and Lagrangian (or particle tracking) approaches, two commonly utilized methods for predicting microbial inactivation efficiency have been compared for the study of ozone disinfection processes. The modelling results of two hypothetical ozone reactors and a full scale contactor suggested that the effective CT values predicted by the Lagriangian approach were slightly lower than those obtained from the Eulerian approach but their differences were within 10 %. Therefore, both approaches can be used to predict ozone disinfection efficiency. For the full scale contactor investigated, the tracer residence time distribution predicted by the Euerlian approach provided a better fit to the experimental results, which indicated that the Eulerian approach might be more suitable for the simulation of chemical tracer performance. The results of this part of work provided important insight in understanding the complex performance of multiphase ozonation systems and played an important role in further improving CFD modelling approaches for full-scale ozone disinfection systems. The third significant contribution of this work is that a CFD model was applied to illustrate the importance of ozone residual monitoring locations and suggest an improved strategy for ozone residual monitoring. For the DesBaillets ozone contactors, the CFD modelling results showed that ozone residuals in the cross section of the outlets of some contactor chambers differed by an order of magnitude. The “optimal” area of monitoring locations however varied at different operational conditions. Therefore, it was suggested that multiple ozone residual sampling points should be installed based on CFD analysis and experimental studies, to provide more accurate indicators to system operators. The CFD model was also used to study the factors affecting the residence time distribution (RTD). The results suggested that the selection of the tracer injection locations as well as tracer sampling locations might affect the RTD prediction or measurement. The CFD-predicted T 10 values at different outlet locations varied by more than 10 % variation. It is therefore recommended that CFD modelling be used to determine tracer test strategy before conducting a full-scale tracer test, and multiple sampling points should be employed during tracer tests, if possible. In addition, a research based on full-scale investigation has also been done to compare the three different CT prediction approaches: CT 10, integrated disinfection design framework (IDDF), and CFD, to determine the most appropriate method for design and operation of ozone systems. The CFD approach yielded more accurate predictions of inactivation efficacy than the other two approaches. The current results also suggested that the differences in the three approaches in CT predictions became smaller at higher contactor T 10 /T ratios conditions as the contactors performed more closely to ideal plug flow reactors. This study has demonstrated that the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach is an efficient tool for improving ozone disinfection performance of existing water treatment plants and designing new ozonation systems. The model developed in this study can be used for ozone contactor design, evaluation, and troubleshooting. It can also be used as a virtual experimental tool to optimize <b>ozone</b> contactor <b>behaviour</b> under varying water quality and operational conditions...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the ever}} {{increasing}} concerns about pollutants and contaminants found in water, new treatment technologies have been developed. Ozonation {{is one of}} such technologies. It has been widely applied {{in the treatment of}} pollutants in water and wastewater treatment processes. Ozone has many applications such as oxidation of organic components, mineral matter, inactivation of viruses, cysts, bacteria, removal of trace pollutants like pesticides and solvents, and removal of tastes and odours. Ozone is the strongest conventional oxidant that can result in complete mineralisation of the organic pollutants to carbon dioxide and water. Because ozone is unstable, it is generally produced onsite in gas mixtures and is immediately introduced to water using gas/liquid type reactors (e. g. bubble columns). The ozone reactions are hence of the type gas liquid reactions, which are complex to model since they involve both chemical reactions, which occur in the liquid phase, and mass transfer from the gas to the liquid phase. This study focuses on two aspects: mass transfer and chemical reactions in multicomponent systems. The mass transfer parameters were determined by experiments under different conditions and the chemical reactions were studied using single component and multicomponent systems. Two models obtained from the literature were adapted to the systems used in this study. Mass transfer parameters in the semi-batch reactor were determined using oxygen and ozone at different flow rates in the presence and absence of t-butanol. t-Butanol is used as a radical scavenger in ozonation studies and it has been found to affect the gas-liquid mass transfer rates. An experimental study was carried out to investigate the effects of t-butanol concentrations on the physical properties of aqueous solutions, including surface tension and viscosity. It was found that t-butanol reduced both properties by 4 % for surface tension and by a surprising 30 % for viscosity. These reductions in the solution physical properties were correlated to enhancement in the mass transfer coefficient, kL. The mass transfer coefficient increased by about 60 % for oxygen and by almost 50 % for <b>ozone.</b> The hydrodynamic <b>behaviour</b> of the system used in this work was characterised by a homogeneous bubbling regime. It was also found that the gas holdup was significantly enhanced by the addition of t-butanol. Moreover, the addition of t-butanol was found to significantly reduce the size of gas bubbles, leading to enhancement in the volumetric mass transfer coefficient, kLa. The multicomponent ozonation was studied with two systems, slow reactions when alcohols were used and fast reactions when endocrine disrupting compounds were used. ii These experiments were simulated by mathematical models. The alcohols were selected depending on their volatilization at different initial concentrations and different gas flow rates. The degradation of n-propanol as a single compound was studied at the lowest flow rate of 200 mL/min. It was found that the degradation of n-propanol reached almost 60 % within 4 hours. The degradation of the mixture was enhanced with {{an increase in the number}} of components in the mixture. It was found that the degradation of the mixture as three compounds reached almost 80 % within four hours while the mixture as two compounds reached almost 70 %. The effect of pH was studied and it was found that an increase in pH showed slight increase in the reaction. Fast reactions were also investigated by reacting endocrine disrupting chemicals with ozone. The ozone reactions with the endocrine disrupters were studied at different gas flow rates, initial concentrations, ozone concentrations and pH. The degradation of 17 β-estradiol (E 2) as a single compound was the fastest, reaching about 90 % removal in almost 5 minutes. However estrone (E 1) degradation was the lowest reaching about 70 % removal at the same time. The degradation of mixtures of the endocrine disruptors was found to proceed to lower percentages than individual components under the same conditions. During the multicomponent ozonation of the endocrine disruptors, it was found that 17 β-estradiol (E 2) converted to estrone (E 1) at the beginning of the reaction. A MATLAB code was developed to predict the ozone water reactions for single component and multicomponent systems. Two models were used to simulate the experimental results for single component and multicomponent systems. In the case of single component system, good simulation of both reactions (slow and fast) by model 1 was obtained. However, model 2 gave good agreement with experimental results only in the case of fast reactions. In addition, model 1 was applied for multicomponent reactions (both cases of slow and fast reaction). In the multicomponent reactions by model 1, good agreement with the experimental results was also obtained for both cases of slow and fast reactions.
