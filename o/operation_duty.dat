40|$|Abstract—We {{report the}} {{fabrication}} and characterization of buried heterostructure quantum cascade (BH-QC) lasers formed by selective lateral regrowth of InP on the laser ridge by metal organic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (MOCVD). A fivefold improvement in maximum average power (up to 10 mW) and a twofold improvement in maximum <b>operation</b> <b>duty</b> cycle (up to 17 %) are measured at 273 K and are attributed to lower lateral waveguide losses and a better heat dissipation. Index Terms—Buried heterostructure, intersubband transition, mid-infrared semiconductor laser, quantum cascade laser. THE QUANTUM cascade (QC) laser [1] is a unipolarsemiconductor laser source that has demonstrated pulsed operation at room temperature in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) range. These devices have also been demonstrated recently based on GaAs–AlGaAs [2] but the best performances have been obtained in the InGaAs–AlInAs material system [3]–[7]...|$|E

The output of solar power fed from boost inverter feed to autonomous load without any intermediate conversion stage and a filter. For boost converter <b>operation</b> <b>duty</b> cycle is varied through fuzzy logic controller and PWM block to regulate the converter output voltage.

40|$|In our {{paper we}} present a series of aspects {{regarding}} the use of NaCl solions in various traditional therapies and, more recently in improving human performance.

40|$|This work proposes and {{experimentally}} validates {{an autonomous}} battery-less sensor module based on off-the-shelf electronics {{powered by a}} multi-beam piezoelectric energy converter that exploits impact to widen the harvesting bandwidth at low frequency. The module manages the converted energy, interfaces two sensors and periodically sends the measurement signals over a radio-frequency (RF) link. The architecture and principle have been experimentally validated on a fabricated proof-of-concept prototype. The solution that exploits impact increases the overall rms output voltage of the converter of up to 35 % and widens the useful bandwidth toward lower frequencies of up to 50 % over the no-impact condition at parity of mechanical excitation. In the tested experimental conditions, the prototype features a typical time interval between measurement-and-transmission events of a few seconds, with event durations {{of the order of}} tens of milliseconds, corresponding to an <b>operation</b> <b>duty</b> cycle of about 1 %. The average power consumption during transmission is of the order of 35 mW with an operative range of 25 m in laboratory environment...|$|E
40|$|An energy-autonomous battery-less sensor module is presented, entirely {{powered by}} a {{piezoelectric}} energy converter driven by mechanical vibrations from the environment. The module manages and stores the converted energy, interfaces {{to one or more}} passive sensors and periodically sends the corresponding measurement signals over a radio-frequency (RF) link. As an additional variant, the module can send a programmable identification (ID) code on the RF carrier, in order to enable module tagging and tracking by the external receiver unit. The module’s general architecture is presented and the strategy used for sensor signal conditioning and transmission is illustrated. The architecture and principle have been experimentally validated on a fabricated prototype including a piezoelectric bimorph converter, two passive sensors made by a resistive–capacitive sensor pair and purposely designed electronic circuitry based on low-power off-the-shelf components. In the tested experimental conditions, the prototype features a typical time interval between measurement-and-transmission events of a few tens of seconds, with event durations of the order of tens of milliseconds, corresponding to an <b>operation</b> <b>duty</b> cycle of the order of 0. 1 %. Peak power consumption during transmission is of the order of 20 mW and operative range is of the order of meters in a laboratory environment. The obtained results show that the proposed approach has attractive characteristics because of the total absence of batteries and, despite the inherent intermittent operation, provides significant measurement performances in terms of achievable sensitivity and resolution...|$|E
40|$|With the {{advancement}} of the Internet of Things movement, ubiquitous computing is now an accelerating field for embedded system researchers to pursue. Almost all of these new connected systems are equipped with sensors to gather useful information about their surroundings, and of these sensors the visual sensor presents the richest available datasets in comparison to its scalar counterparts. Deploying wireless sensor networks in remote environments {{makes it difficult to}} acquire power to these systems and many choose a battery-supplied source. After optimizing the sensor node for long battery life, many sacrifices are made in performance to delay the need for battery replacement maintenance. Now, however, there is promising furtherance in energy harvesting and rechargeable battery capable sensor nodes, and the need for node maintenance may be obsolete in the coming years. Sensor network devices can now focus less on optimizing for battery life and instead increase the amount of on-board local processing making the device "smart". What defines a smart camera is its ability to process video footage locally instead of a central processing unit online or at a remote network sink node. Progress in the field of computer vision has brought the ability to identify complex objects and behaviors of monitored environments. In this thesis, we present SlugCam, a solar-powered wireless smart camera network platform {{that can be used in}} a variety of outdoor applications including surveillance of public spaces, habitat and environmental monitoring, wildfire prevention and detection, to name a few. The system is built with off-the-shelf components which not only keeps it modular and low cost, but also facilitates its prototyping, rapid duplication, and evolution. SlugCam's on-board processing capability allows computer vision software to run locally which contributes to the system's autonomous operation capabilities. Energy efficiency in SlugCam is accomplished both in: (1) hardware by micro-managing low-power components; as well as in (2) software by having the system's <b>operation</b> <b>duty</b> cycles automatically adapt to the current state of the battery in order to balance the trade-off between application-level requirements and power awareness...|$|E
