5|$|A few modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} murder as an option. Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer of Amy Dudley's {{death on the}} grounds that, if Amy was mortally ill, he had the strongest murder motive {{and that he was}} the main beneficiary of the ensuing scandal. Against this idea {{it has been argued that}} he would have risked damaging neither Elizabeth's reputation nor his own position. The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her (with and without his master's knowledge) has been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c.1563 chronicle by John Hales (also called Journal of Matters of State) and the 1584 libel Leicester's Commonwealth. This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition <b>of</b> <b>gossip,</b> poison being a stock-in-trade accusation in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Before the ceremony, Chuck {{talks to}} Blair who professes her undying {{love for him}} -which has been filmed by Georgina- but still refuses to call off the wedding.

The ceremony is temporarily suspended until Blair {{comes back to the}} aisle determined to marry Louis. As a result, she becomes Her Serene Highness, Princess Blair of Monaco. At the reception, Serena tells Dan how she feels about him but quickly leaves before he can answer. During their last dance, Louis reveals to Blair {{that it will be a}} loveless, contracted marriage. After hearing that, Blair runs away in a limousine with Dan at the wheel. At the end of the episode, the identity <b>of</b> <b>Gossip</b> Girl is seemingly revealed to be Georgina Sparks.|$|E
5|$|In early 1891, Berlin society {{erupted in}} scandal {{after a series}} of {{anonymous}} letters circulated to prominent members of the court, including Wilhelm and his wife Dona. The letters were written in the same handwriting, and featured salacious gossip, accusations, and intrigues among the court's powerful. Some included pornographic images layered upon royal photographs. Several hundred letters were sent over a four-year period. Wilhelm ordered an investigation, but the writer (or writers) were never identified. Some contemporaries speculated that Charlotte, known for her sharp tongue and love <b>of</b> <b>gossip,</b> may have been responsible. Historians have since suggested that the writer may have been Dona's brother Duke Ernst Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein in collaboration with his mistress. It is clear that the author had an intimate understanding of the many personalities within the royal family, likely making him or her either a family member or courtier.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms <b>of</b> <b>gossip</b> and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E

They made stops at Trieste and Vienna, spending three weeks in the latter where they were entertained by the local nobility and heard the Missa in Angustiis by Haydn that now bears Nelson's name.

During this period, Nelson was reported as being cold and distant to his wife and his attention to Emma became the subject <b>of</b> <b>gossip.</b> With the marriage breaking down, Nelson began to hate even being in the same room as Fanny. Events came to a head around Christmas, when according to Nelson's solicitor, Fanny issued an ultimatum on whether he was to choose her or Emma. Nelson replied: I love you sincerely but I cannot forget my obligations to Lady Hamilton or speak of her otherwise than with affection and admiration. The two never lived together again after this.|$|E
