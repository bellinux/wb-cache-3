40|$|Kathryn Bigelow has {{undoubtedly}} been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hollywood</b> 2 ̆ 7 s {{most significant}} female players, {{well known in}} popular terms for films such as Point Breakand Blue Steel, yet relatively unexplored in academia. Soundbites about women and guns and speculation {{about the role of}} ex-husband James Cameron (Aliens, Titanic) in her career have often helped obscure rather than elucidate an understanding of her work. This collection explores how Bigelow can be seen to provide a point of intersection to a whole range of issues at the forefront of contemporary film studies and of the transformation of Hollywood into a post-classical cinema machine, with a particular emphasis on her most ambitious and controversial picture, Strange Days. Her place within new Hollywood is as a filmmaker that blurs genre conventions, reinscribes gender identites, and produces a breathless cinema of attractions. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Taking {{issue with}} many {{orthodox}} views of Film Noir, Frank Krutnik argues for a reorientation of this compulsively engaging area of Hollywood cultural production. Krutnik recasts the films within a generic framework and draws on recent historical and theoretical research to examine both {{the diversity of}} film noir and its significance within American popular culture of the 1940 s. He considers classical Hollywood cinema, debates on genre, {{and the history of}} the emergence of character in film noir, focusing on the hard-boiled' crime fiction of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain as well as the popularisationof Freudian psychoanalysis; and the social and cultural upheavals of the 1940 s. The core of this book however concerns the complex representationof masculinity in the noir tough' thriller, and where and how gender interlocks with questions of genre. Analysing in detail major thrillers like The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Out of the Past and The Killers, alongside lesser known but nonetheless crucial films as Stranger on the Third Floor, Pitfall and Dead Reckoning Krutnik has produced a provocative and highly readable study of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hollywood</b> most perennially fascinating groups of films...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that the action film has been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hollywood</b> 2 ̆ 7 s most successful products {{over the last three}} decades or so. However, many commentators, both popular and academic, continue to marginalize or dismiss the value of the action film as a critical, socially conscious, and aesthetically potent artefact. Scholarship that has approached the action film has tended to be based upon readings of gender and political ideology. Aesthetic readings of 1980 s action films (the decade when the genre was at its peak), such as Eric Lichtenfeld 2 ̆ 7 s Action Speaks Louder (2004), have tended to be dismissive of the films as examples of propagandistic, exceedingly patriotic 2 ̆ 7 Reaganite entertainments 2 ̆ 7. It is the intention of this article, through a close analysis of George P. Cosmatos 2 ̆ 7 1986 film Cobra, to demonstrate that - rather than simply a piece of replicatory right-wing propaganda - the 1980 s action film (and action cinema in general) challenges the notions of American political identity, patriotism and heroism upon which it is founded, thereby opening the way for a deeper critical understanding of American cultural and mythical impulses at large...|$|E
