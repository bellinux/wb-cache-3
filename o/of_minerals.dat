40|$|There {{is concern}} that modern cultivars and/or agronomic {{practices}} {{have resulted in}} reduced concentrations <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> elements essential to human nutrition in edible crops. Increased yields are often associated with reduced concentrations <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> elements in produce, {{and a number of}} recent studies have indicated that, when grown under identical conditions, the concentrations <b>of</b> several <b>mineral</b> elements are lower in genotypes yielding more grain or shoot biomass than in older, lower-yielding genotypes. Potato is a significant crop, grown worldwide, yet few studies have investigated whether increasing yields, through agronomy or breeding, affects the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> elements in tubers. This article examines the hypothesis that increasing yields, either by the application <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> fertilizers and/or by growing higher-yielding varieties, leads to decreased concentrations <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> elements in tubers. It reports that the application of fertilizers influences tuber elemental composition in a complex manner, presumably as a consequence of soil chemistry and interactions between mineral elements within the plant, that considerable variation exists between potato genotypes in the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> elements in their tubers, and that, like in other crops, higher-yielding genotypes occasionally have lower concentrations <b>of</b> some <b>mineral</b> elements in their edible tissues than lower-yielding genotypes. ...|$|R

It is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions.|$|E

5|$|Mars is a {{terrestrial}} planet that consists <b>of</b> <b>minerals</b> containing silicon and oxygen, metals, {{and other elements}} that typically make up rock. The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{challenges}} the determinism {{of the resource}} curse hypothesis.

This approach narrows the field of study to MDCs only, and aims to reveal the extent to which the level <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> export dependence influences social policy making. With that purpose, this paper provides a cross-country analysis of the linkages between state revenue and social policy in contexts <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> wealth, and presents an approach to identify those linkages and the effects of a mineral-led development strategy on welfare regimes...|$|R

Through Konig, Pistrucci met the famous naturalist, Sir Joseph Banks, who commissioned the artist to do a portrait of him. While Banks was sitting for Pistrucci, the connoisseur Richard Payne Knight came by, anxious to show Sir Joseph a cameo fragment he had purchased, and which he dated to Ancient Greece. After Banks praised it highly, Pistrucci, on examining it, identified it as his own work, displaying the secret mark he had placed on it. The incident increased Pistrucci's reputation in London.|$|E

5|$|The types <b>of</b> <b>minerals</b> {{present in}} {{volcanic}} ash {{are dependent on}} the chemistry of the magma from which it erupted. Considering that the most abundant elements found in silicate magma are silicon and oxygen, {{the various types of}} magma (and therefore ash) produced during volcanic eruptions are most commonly explained in terms of their silica content. Low energy eruptions of basalt produce a characteristically dark coloured ash containing ~45 - 55% silica that is generally rich in iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg). The most explosive rhyolite eruptions produce a felsic ash that is high in silica (>69%) while other types of ash with an intermediate composition (e.g., andesite or dacite) have a silica content between 55-69%.|$|E
