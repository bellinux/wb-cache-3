50|$|While the {{advantages}} of latex have made it the most popular condom material, it does have some drawbacks. Latex condoms are damaged when used with oil-based substances as lubricants, such as petroleum jelly, cooking oil, baby oil, mineral <b>oil,</b> <b>skin</b> lotions, suntan lotions, cold creams, butter or margarine. Contact with oil makes latex condoms more likely to break or slip off due to loss of elasticity caused by the oils. Additionally, latex allergy precludes use of latex condoms {{and is one of}} the principal reasons for the use of other materials. In May 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the production of condoms composed of Vytex, latex that has been treated to remove 90% of the proteins responsible for allergic reactions. An allergen-free condom made of synthetic latex (polyisoprene) is also available.|$|E

40|$|Background: Dry skin is a {{disorder}} of skin surface due to reduced fluid or oil {{content of the}} skin. So that, the moisture {{on the surface of}} the skin layer decreases. One of the efforts to keep the moisture of the skin is providing a moisturizer every day. Aloe vera extract and olive oil can be used as a basic ingredient in the formulation of basic moisturizer. Purpose: To determine the effectiveness of Aloe vera extract and olive oil mixtures in formulating moisturizers for dry skin. Method: The type of this research is experimental with one-group pre-test post-test design using 34 respondents. First, respondents were tested using a patch test to test the allergic reaction. Once declared negative, respondents filled out a questionnaire on pre-test sheet (H 0) regarding skin moisture levels based on the parameters VSS. Then, respondents were given the product of research applied to the skin at the back of the right hand twice a day for 21 days. Finally, fill out a questionnaire on the post-test sheet (H 21) regarding the level of dryness of the skin with VSS paramet. Analysis data use Wilcoxon test. Results: Of the 34 respondents, there are 28 respondents who experienced a decrease in VSS scores and 6 respondents did not experience an increase or decrease of VSS scores administration of the study product for 21 days. From the Wilcoxon test showed p= 0, 001. Conclusion: Based on this study can be concluded that the mixture of Aloe vera extract and olive oil is effective in reducing the level of dryness of the skin.

40|$|International audience: Cumulative human impacts {{across the}} world's oceans are considerable. We {{therefore}} examined a single model taxonomic group, the penguins (Spheniscidae), {{to explore how}} marine species and communities might be at risk of decline or extinction in the southern hemisphere. We sought to determine the most important threats to penguins and to suggest means to mitigate these threats. Our review has relevance to other taxonomic groups in the southern hemisphere and in northern latitudes, where human impacts are greater. Our review {{was based on an}} expert assessment and literature review of all 18 penguin species; 49 scientists contributed to the process. For each penguin species, we considered their range and distribution, population trends, and main anthropogenic threats over the past approximately 250 years. These threats were harvesting adults for <b>oil,</b> <b>skin,</b> and feathers and as bait for crab and rock lobster fisheries; harvesting of eggs; terrestrial habitat degradation; marine pollution; fisheries bycatch and resource competition; environmental variability and climate change; and toxic algal poisoning and disease. Habitat loss, pollution, and fishing, all factors humans can readily mitigate, remain the primary threats for penguin species. Their future resilience to further climate change impacts will almost certainly depend on addressing current threats to existing habitat degradation on land and at sea. We suggest protection of breeding habitat, linked to the designation of appropriately scaled marine reserves, including in the High Seas, will be critical for the future conservation of penguins. However, large-scale conservation zones are not always practical or politically feasible and other ecosystem-based management methods that include spatial zoning, bycatch mitigation, and robust harvest control must be developed to maintain marine biodiversity and ensure that ecosystem functioning is maintained across a variety of scales.
