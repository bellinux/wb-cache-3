25|$|Rameau was the {{greatest}} ballet composer of all times. The genius of his creation rests on <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his perfect artistic permeation by folk-dance types, {{on the other hand}} on the constant preservation of living contact with the practical requirements of the ballet stage, which prevented an estrangement between the expression of the body from the spirit of absolute music.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{the rigid}} design, speedcuffs {{can be applied}} in one of four {{different}} positions, which also apply to hinged handcuffs but not chain-linked. In British police training, these positions are termed 'front stack', 'palm to palm', 'rear stack', and 'back to back'. Many forces teach two positions to their officers, but some teach all four. The 'stacked' positions are those where, once applied (assuming a standing prisoner), the handcuffs are vertical and the wrists pass through the cuffs in opposite directions, resulting in <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{each side of the}} handcuffs.|$|E

According to the Gospel of John (the event is not mentioned in other accounts) Jesus was first brought before Annas and after a brief questioning of him (John 18:19-23) was sent to the home of Caiaphas where some members of the Sanhedrin were gathered and the first trial of Jesus took place (Matt. 26:57-68).|$|E
25|$|The exaggerated walk, with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{the small}} of his back and his torso bent almost 90 degrees at the waist was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s. Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand held fast to the base of their spines, and with a slight lean forward at the waist and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, {{allowing}} the left hand to swing free with the gait. (Edmund Morris, in his biography The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, walking into the House Chamber for the first time in this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members.) Groucho exaggerated this fad to a marked degree, and the comedy effect was enhanced by how out of date the fashion was by the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E

500|$|Fighting {{tactics are}} governed by several actual rules and enforcers will also adopt {{informal}} tactics particular to their style and personality. One tactic adopted by players is known as [...] "going for it", in which the player puts {{his head down and}} just throws as many punches as he can, as fast as he can. In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.|$|E

500|$|Writing for AllGame, Shawn Sackenheim {{considered}} the [...] "highly technical" [...] control scheme of 1080° Snowboarding {{one of the}} game's strengths despite its initial difficulty. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games positively reviewed the control scheme, but disagreed on its difficulty, noting [...] "the controls have been implemented so brilliantly that you're able to play perfectly well with just <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the stick and Z button." [...] GameSpot called the game's control [...] "thoroughly involving" [...] and said that [...] "he crouch move alone– which makes for supertight turns– makes this fun to play." [...] The music was also generally praised, with Matt Casamassina of IGN calling it [...] "a shining example {{of what can be}} achieved on the format" [...] and Sackenheim calling it [...] "one of the best N64 soundtracks to date". Sackenheim also praised the game's sound effects.|$|E
500|$|Six runs {{after the}} fall of Washbrook, the {{diminutive}} Emmett fended a rising ball from Lindwall to Sid Barnes at short leg, leaving England 28/2. Surprised by Lindwall's bouncer, Emmett took his eyes from the ball and fended with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the horizontally-held bat, while ducking his head down below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett's bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia's match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not deliver any more bouncers to Emmett during the match, and O'Reilly thought the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent's weakness against the short ball. O'Reilly concluded that Australia's pace duo [...] "had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort".|$|E
500|$|His {{coaching}} brought immediate improvement. In 1897 and 1898, the Carlisle {{teams had}} 6–4 records. In 1899 (Warner's first year), Carlisle won nine and lost two games—to the country's two best teams: Harvard and Princeton. That year saw Carlisle's first major victory, {{against one of}} the [...] "Big Four" [...] teams, beating Penn 16–5. At the end of the season, the school played Columbia at the Polo Grounds in New York City, a premier sports venue at the time, defeating them 42–0. The Columbia game {{was the first time that}} a crouching start, a form of what is now known as a three point stance, was used by the running backs. Before Warner's innovation, the stance for a back before the ball was snapped was bent forward with his feet well apart and his hands on his knees. Warner realized that if his players took a stance similar to the one taken by sprinters, the legs would be bent, the back leaning forward, with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the ground and the other arm cocked back to the thigh/hip region. Like with sprinters, this similar stance maximized the speed of his players. Shortly after, it became the standard football stance for both backs and linemen.|$|E

500|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, Hutton had been dropped, {{sparking}} much acrimony and {{controversy in the}} English cricket community. The reason {{was said to be}} Hutton's difficulties against Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. Observers noticed Hutton backing away, and the English selectors believed such a sight would {{have a negative effect on}} the rest of the side as it was a poor example from a key player. The Australians were pleased and believed the England selectors had erred, because they regarded Hutton as the hosts' best batsman. England batted first and Lindwall removed Hutton’s replacement as opener, George Emmett, who fended a short ball to Sid Barnes at short leg to leave England at 2/28. Emmett had been surprised by Lindwall's bouncer and took his eyes from the ball, fending with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the bat, while ducking his head below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett’s bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia’s match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not bounce Emmett again during the match, and O’Reilly surmised that the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent’s weakness against the short ball. O’Reilly concluded that Lindwall and Johnston [...] "had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort".|$|E
500|$|The teams {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia dropped Brown, who {{had scored}} 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings in his unfamiliar {{position in the}} middle order. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and England made 363. Barnes caught his first victim for the Test series, the diminutive debutant opener George Emmett, who was surprised by a rising ball from Ray Lindwall. Emmett took {{his eyes from the}} ball and fended with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the horizontally-held bat, while ducking his head down below his arms; the ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett’s bat, rebounded gently up in the air to Barnes, leaving England at 2/28. Barnes dropped two catches later in the day, but neither cost Australia substantially. Jack Crapp hit Ernie Toshack to Barnes at short leg, who failed to hold the catch. However, Crapp did not capitalise and was out soon after. During the same middle session, Yardley hit Toshack to Barnes, who was again unable to complete the reflex catch. However, Yardley was dismissed shortly after for 22. Tail-ender Dick Pollard came to the crease on the second morning and pulled a ball from Ian Johnson into the left ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg, almost {{on the edge of the}} cut strip. According to Fingleton, Barnes [...] "dropped like a fallen tree", and a minority of spectators loudly celebrated the injury. Briefly paralysed on his left side, he had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination.|$|E
