5|$|In 1871, eight {{main line}} {{railways}} existed in Berlin, with terminal stations at the city's edge <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the city limits. This was very impractical for many passengers, who {{were forced to}} use hackney carriages to transfer from one train to another. Therefore, a railway line was planned to connect these terminuses with each other.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} rely on visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet {{caused him to}} lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was {{unexpectedly}} reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence within <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain {{to form a new}} government.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2), {{adenosine}} monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate groups (PP) are released as waste products. Luciferase catalyzes the reaction, {{which may be}} mediated by cofactors such as calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium (Mg2+) ions, and for some types of luciferin (L) also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction can occur either inside <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the cell. In bacteria such as Aliivibrio, the expression of genes related to bioluminescence {{is controlled by the}} lux operon.|$|E

Tumors {{occurring}} in the bile ducts within the liver {{are referred to as}} intrahepatic, those occurring in the ducts outside the liver are extrahepatic, and tumors occurring at the site where the bile ducts exit the liver may be referred to as perihilar. A cholangiocarcinoma occurring at the junction where the left and right hepatic ducts meet to form the common hepatic duct may be referred to eponymously as a Klatskin tumor.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{gathering}} CCTV – Some ambulances are {{now being}} fitted with video cameras used to record activity either inside <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the vehicle.

5|$|In {{a further}} royal charter of 28 April 1472, King James III ordered the {{demolition}} of houses built on <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the King's Wall, which were hampering efforts to strengthen the defences.

5|$|In the United Kingdom, a bill is {{presented}} for royal assent {{after it has}} passed all the required stages in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the House of Commons may, under certain circumstances, direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the House of Lords. Officially, assent is granted by the sovereign or by Lords Commissioners authorised to act by letters patent. It may be granted in parliament <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> parliament; in the latter case, each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect.|$|E

5|$|The mythology {{surrounding}} Rommel {{has been}} the subject of analysis by both English- and German-speaking historians in recent decades. The reevaluation has produced new interpretations of Rommel, including his relationship with National Socialism, his abilities as operational and strategic level commander, and his role (if any) in the July 20th plot to assassinate Hitler. Historians and commentators conclude that Rommel remains an ambiguous figure, not easily definable either inside <b>or</b> <b>outside</b> the myth.|$|E
