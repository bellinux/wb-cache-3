The condition is often mentioned in media coverage of methamphetamine, and it has been included in media portrayals <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> to demonstrate the scope of the drug's effects or to provoke disgust in the audience. Opponents argue that the term is used to negatively stereotype methamphetamine users, and that it is falsely portrayed as inevitable or characteristic.|$|E
5|$|Timmons' career {{declined}} {{quickly in}} the 1960s, in part because <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> and alcoholism and {{partly as a result}} of frustration at being typecast as a composer and player of seemingly simple pieces of music. In 1968 he made his second, final, recording for Milestone, Do You Know the Way? In the following year he played in a quartet led by Sonny Red, with Dexter Gordon on one of the saxophonist's temporary returns to the US from Europe, and in a trio backing vocalist Etta Jones. Timmons continued to play in the early 1970s, mostly in small groups or in combination with other pianists, and mainly in the New York area.|$|E

5|$|Aronofsky {{followed}} his debut with Requiem for a Dream, a film based on Hubert Selby, Jr.'s {{novel of the}} same name. He was paid $50,000, and worked for three years with nearly the same production team as his previous film. Following the financial breakout of Pi, {{he was capable of}} hiring established actors, including Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, and received a budget of $3,500,000 to produce the film. Production of the film occurred over the period of one year, with the film being released in October 2000. The film went on to gross $7,390,108 worldwide. Aronofsky received acclaim for his stylish direction, and was nominated for another Independent Spirit Award, this time for Best Director. The film itself was nominated for five awards in total, winning two, for Best Actress and Cinematography. Clint Mansell's soundtrack for the film was also well-regarded, and since their first collaboration in 1996, Mansell has composed the music to every Aronofsky film. Ellen Burstyn was nominated for numerous awards, including for an Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the Independent Spirit Award. Aronofsky was awarded the PRISM Award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for the film's depiction <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the World Indoor Championships 60 metres final, Chambers won {{a silver}} medal and {{recorded}} a new personal best of 6.54s to take second behind Olusoji Fasuba. The performance did not sway opinion: Chambers continued to encounter extensive criticism within athletics. Promoters did not invite him to key athletics events, Eddie Kulukundis – who had supported Chambers earlier in his career – refused to sponsor the sprinter, and the British Olympic Association (BOA), prevented him from competing in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. To return to the track Chambers {{had to rely on}} the money he received from his partner, Leonie Daley, a civil servant whom he met at the Miss Jamaica UK competition. The couple now had a child, a boy named Skye who was born in September 2005, and Chambers desperately needed to earn a living to support his family and pay off debts incurred through the drug ban. He amassed a selection of cuttings about his fall from grace and the BALCO Scandal in order to show his son the risks <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse.</b>|$|E

40|$|Individuals {{addicted}} to <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> such as alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, and heroin {{are a significant}} burden on healthcare systems all over the world. The positive reinforcing (rewarding) effects of the above mentioned drugs {{play a major role}} in the initiation and maintenance of the drug-taking habit. Thus, understanding the neurochemical mechanisms underlying the reinforcing effects <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> is critical to reducing the burden <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> addiction in society. Over the last two decades, there has been an increasing focus on the role of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in drug addiction. In this review, pharmacological and genetic evidence supporting the role of glutamate in mediating the rewarding effects of the above described <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> will be discussed. Further, the review will discuss the role of glutamate transmission in two complex heterogeneous brain regions, namely the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which mediate the rewarding effects <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse.</b> In addition, several medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration that act by blocking glutamate transmission will be discussed in the context <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> reward.
