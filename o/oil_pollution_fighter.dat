40|$|Abstract—In {{the last}} century the world {{experienced}} some major oil spills of the time with catastrophic effects to marine environment. Responding to such unfortunate events, among other things, enacted liability and compensation conventions to ensure timely and adequate compensation to victims of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution.</b> Even so, the application of such conventions raised some questions on whether such liability conventions promote environmental protection. This paper examined the role of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> liability conventions in the protection of marine environment through compensation and challenges facing the conventions {{in the process of}} application in relevant <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> incidents. The authors started by drawing attention to the role played by oil in world economy and effects of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> to marine environment; outlined the international legal regime for <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> liability and examined selected <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> incidents for reflections on the application of the conventions to reveal some challenges faced by implementation of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> conventions [...] In the last part, the paper studies the role of played by liability conventions in the protection of marine environment; challenges arising there from.

40|$|Using {{the remote}} sensing methods {{is the most}} {{promising}} for day-to-day control of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution.</b> The laser-induced fluorescence method provides efficient detection and classification of <b>oil</b> <b>pollutions.</b> To monitor <b>oil</b> <b>pollutions</b> on the earth surface {{is more complicated than}} on the water one because of lower fluorescence intensity and interfering fluorescence of natural objects available on the earth surface. Properties of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> classifiers depend largely on the number and positions of spectral bands of fluorescence registration. Reducing the number of spectral bands allows us to diminish computation complexity and cost of equipment. In some cases the reduction increases classification accuracy. The number of spectral bands can be reduced through increasing their width. The paper presents mathematical modeling of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> detection and classification. The experimentally obtained fluorescence spectra of <b>oil</b> <b>pollutions</b> on different substrates were used as input data. The k-nearest neighbors algorithm was used to detect and classify <b>oil</b> <b>pollutions.</b> Cross validation was applied in mathematical modeling. The mathematical modeling results have shown that for <b>oil</b> <b>pollutions</b> detection using over 8 spectral bands (band width less than 50 nm) a classification error rate does not depend on the further increasing number of the spectral bands. As to the type classification of <b>oil</b> <b>pollutions</b> (4 classes), an increasing width of the spectral bands up to 60 nm (the number of spectral bands reduced up 7) does not lead to a significantly decreasing overall classification accuracy. In the case of the sort classification of <b>oil</b> <b>pollutions</b> (8 classes) a local maximum of the overall accuracy has been observed at 25 - 30 nm width of the spectral band (14 - 16 spectral bands). The spectral resolution improvement (increasing the number of bands) does give an essentially increasing accuracy. The paper has shown that to detect and classify <b>oil</b> <b>pollutions</b> on the earth surface {{there is no need to}} acquire fluorescence with high spectral resolution and numerous spectral bands. </p...|$|R

The effects of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> on highly visible marine wildlife such as seabirds, which are often dramatically affected by such events, have more recently {{been the subject of}} intense study. However, studies of the impacts of marine <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> on the commercial fisheries resources of Newfoundland and Labrador have not been as rigorously pursued. This study examines the marine <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> problem in Newfoundland and Labrador from both the marine transport industry and the oil industry operations currently underway within the province and their impacts on commercial fishery resources. The focus of the study is Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, where prominent oil handling operations, heavy marine traffic associated with the oil industry, and one of the richest fishery resources within the North Atlantic coexist. Chronic <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> is identified as a current and very real threat to fisheries conservation in southeastern Newfoundland and the Placentia Bay area. The threat of an oil tanker accident is also examined, with particular attention given to volume of tanker traffic, volume of oil transported through Placentia Bay, and oil spill response capacity for the Newfoundland and Labrador region. Also examined are the existing initiatives in place {{to address the issue of}} current and potential <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> threats to the fishery resources of Placentia Bay.

40|$|Today an {{environmental}} control of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> {{of water and}} terrestrial surfaces {{in the course of}} production and transportation of oil and oil products is a challenge. One of the remote system options to monitor <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> on a terrestrial surface is the laser fluorescent monitoring system of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> from the aircraft. As the fluorescence spectra of oils and oil products differ from the fluorescence spectra of elements of a terrestrial landscape, there is a potential opportunity to find and classify <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> through a record and analysis of the fluorescence spectrum form at terrestrial surface site under study. The principle of laser fluorimeter operation for monitoring of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> is based on radiation of the studied site of a terrestrial surface by laser in the ultra-violet range and record of fluorescent radiation spectrum (or fluorescent radiation in several narrow spectral ranges). The problem of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> classification on the terrestrial surface using a laser fluorimeter with terrestrial surface radiation at the wavelength of 266 nm and record of the laserinduced fluorescent radiation in several spectral ranges was investigated earlier in a number of works. However, presently developed algorithms for classification of <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> are heuristic and strictly are unproven. The work studies the method capabilities to classify <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> on the terrestrial surface using a record of laser radiation intensity in five spectral ranges and a neural network for data processing of measurements. The method allows four group classifications: terrestrial surface (uncontaminated oil products), flood on a terrestrial surface of the light cleared oil products, spill of heavy oil products, and spill of crude oil. Work results of the neural network show that to solve a problem of the oil products classification on a terrestrial surface the developed neural network can ensure probability of the correct classification of oil products at least 99, 32 %. </p...|$|R
