40|$|The {{main subject}} of the {{research}} project was the poor acceptance of expert systems {{in the areas of}} economy and public administration. The systematic interrelation of development prerequisites (cognitive modelling of the domain and instrumental information technique in a given interactional space) and their practical realization in the programming of a PROLOG-prototype were examined {{on the basis of a}} research-accompanying XPS-development analysis sector (travel agency). The changes of the interactional space resulting from the XPS in combination with personal communication processes (staff and its qualifications) and the existing electronic and non-electronic instrumental information techniques (<b>office</b> <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> and booking/reservations systems) were investigated with the help of classical methods of empirical social research and recent approaches of systems theory. Besides cataloguing the development requirements, the results of this part of the project also refer to the conditions which facilitate the design and use of XPS as 'active communications media' - as opposed to present practice which is largely determined by hard AI. The fundamental prerequisite for this is to reconstruct the organizational structure of the interactional space on the basis of the actually occurring communication and information processes; neither completely ignoring (hard AI) nor reducing them by projecting them onto business management processes.

Maintenance staff needs a standard application capable of diagnosing and monitoring heterogeneous on-board equipments. We propose to build a web-based diagnosis and monitoring system.

However, nowadays many <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> are equipped {{with more than one}} transmitter. Therefore, it is necessary to study energy harvesting <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> with multiple transmitters. In [26], optimal packet scheduling in a multiple access <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> with two energy harvesting transmitters was investigated. In [27], a <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> with an energy harvesting transmitter over parallel and fading Gaussian broadcast channels was studied. In [28], an optimal power allocation policy for a <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> with two energy harvesting transmitters over an interference channel was proposed. These works shed light on energy harvesting <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> with multiple transmitters, but did not consider transmitter switching. In our opinion, transmitter switching can provide flexibility and robustness to an energy harvesting <b>communication</b> <b>system,</b> especially when a transmitter is unable to send data or the energy harvested from the environment is insufficient for data transmission. If this happens, other neighboring transmitters can turn to work and help the transmitter to proceed data transmission. To make the transmitter switching effective and decrease the switching overhead, a well-designed policy is essential to choosing the suitable transmitter to work.|$|R
