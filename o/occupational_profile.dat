40|$|Striving for {{economic}} growth and employment opportunities, policy makers put forward a better match between supply and demand on the labour market as a key objective. For this they {{are in need of}} in-depth and updated insight into tasks and competence requirements. <b>Occupational</b> <b>profiles</b> make a clear overview of tasks and related competence requirements of a certain occupation. These overviews are used by empoyment offices, training institutes, educational institutes etc. as a basis for developing programmes that are focused at ‘tackling the skills gap’. The STILE-project has taken up the challenge to develop a profile of two occupations that are typical for the ‘New economy’. In the contemporary economic environment boundaries between economic sectors are blurring and technological developments change with great strides. Providing clear and well-defined <b>occupational</b> <b>profiles</b> is not obvious in the current socio-economic circumstances. Working on <b>occupational</b> <b>profiles</b> of ICT-occupations in an international comparative perspective has led to three important results. First of all the project resulted in a profile of customer technical support and web development & -maintenance. Second, the work made it possible to identify opportunities and limitations of existing profiling methods for getting insight into occupations that emerged in the ‘New economy’. This resulted in recommendations for profiling occupations. Third, the project has evolved interesting questions for other international comparative research on the occupations that were studied.

50|$|Building a {{distinctive}} <b>occupational</b> <b>profile</b> and {{an affinity for}} entrepreneurship and business, Jews were heavily involved in the Canadian garment industry {{as it was the}} only business for which they had any training. Furthermore, cultural factors that made the industry somewhat lucrative as Jews could be certain that they would not have to work on the Sabbath or on major holidays if they had Jewish employers as opposed to non Jewish employers and were certain that they were also unlikely to encounter anti-Semitism from co-workers. Jews generally did not exhibit any loyalty and sympathy toward the working class through successive generations. Even within the working class, Canadian Jews tended to be concentrated in the ranks of highly skilled, as opposed to unskilled labor. But ties to the working class and union solidarity were not part of an eternal ideology as Jewish parents desired their children to attend University and achieve higher ranked jobs as it served as the primary gateway for a higher income. By the end of World War II, Jews in Canada began to disperse the working class in large numbers and attained a disproportionate amount success in a variety of white collar jobs as well as starting their businesses. Median household incomes in the Jewish community exceeded the national average.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compares the}} <b>occupational</b> <b>profiles</b> of six {{immigrant}} {{groups in the}} Los Angeles economy to expose details {{of the relationship between}} gender, nativity, time of arrival and labor market segmentation. We investigate the occupational division of labor among the foreign-born from Mexico, El Salvador, the Philippines, Guatemala, Korea and China and find that gender plays a dominant role relative to ethnicity in the process of labor market segmentation. We also discover that newly arrived immigrant men are more likely to enter male-dominated occupations than newly arrived women are likely to concentrate in female-dominated occupations. This tendency, however, varies in strength by nativity. Nativity and time of arrival also affect the anatomy of occupational specialization, but, again, this effect is not consistent across groups. Our observation of variability in the relative strength of gender and ethnicity in the determination of <b>occupational</b> <b>profiles</b> across a broad sample of immigrant groups directs future researchers to consider how ethnic resources are gendered in different ways by nativity.

50|$|In 1924, Ku Klux Klan {{members were}} {{elected to the}} Anaheim City Council on a {{platform}} of political reform. Up until that point, the city had been controlled by a long-standing business and civic elite that was mostly German American. Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the German Americans did not strongly support prohibition laws of the day. The mayor himself was a former saloon keeper. Led by the minister of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic, and self-serving. The Klansmen aimed to create what they saw as a model, orderly community, one in which prohibition against alcohol would be strictly enforced. At the time, the KKK had about 1200 members in Orange County. The economic and <b>occupational</b> <b>profile</b> of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were the majority of their opponents, however the opposition to the Klan also included many Catholic Germans. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents, and many of the individuals in Orange County who joined the Klan did so {{out of a sense of}} civic activism. Upon easily winning the local Anaheim election in April 1924, the Klan representatives promptly fired city employees who were known to be Catholic and replaced them with Klan appointees.

40|$|Background. The American Occupational Therapy Association and the American Medical Association {{have changed}} CPT codes {{to require a}} {{completed}} <b>occupational</b> <b>profile</b> at every evaluation and re-evaluation session for reimbursement as of January 1, 2017. A revitalization of art in occupational therapy {{has led to a}} recent increase in the evidence supporting the use of expressive art in practice. The benefits of expressive art can directly enhance the <b>occupational</b> <b>profile</b> required by these changing reimbursement requirements. Methods. A scoping review method was applied in the current study. Out of 347 initial articles, 12 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed through critical appraisal of topics and use of a matrix. Results. Analysis of the data elucidated emergent themes of expressive art’s positive effects on verbal communication, the client’s therapeutic reflection, the accuracy of information, the clinician’s use of prompting, the therapeutic relationship, and client engagement. Conclusion. Expressive art can strengthen the <b>occupational</b> <b>profile</b> and information-gathering process. The benefits related to using art in occupational therapy may enhance the complexity of the overall evaluation process, as described by newly changing CPT codes. Expressive art techniques can facilitate the development of client-centered goals and individualized intervention planning, creating an overall positive service delivery process...|$|E

40|$|As banks, {{securities}} houses, {{and insurance}} companies offer increasingly similar services, how have their human resource needs changed? An analysis of survey data reveals that all three industries have come to rely more heavily on high-skilled labor; however, the educational and <b>occupational</b> <b>profiles</b> of their workforces have not become substantially more alike. In the past, commercial banks were characterized by their deposit-taking and lending activities, while investment banks were characterized by their securities underwriting and investment advisory services. More recently, increased competition, technological change, and a chipping away at the regulatory barriers embodied in the Glass-Steagall Act have led commercial banks to expand their activities into domains traditionally associated with investment banks, brokerage houses, {{and insurance companies}}. 1 At the same time, investment banks are venturing into commercial lending and brokerage houses are attracting an increasing share of household savings invested in mutual funds. These developments have generated a widespread belief that banks, securities firms, and insurance companies are evolving into allpurpose financial institutions. This edition of Current Issues examines the human resource trends that have accompanied these changes in the financial sector. As financial institutions offer increasingly similar services, we could expect their human resource needs to become more uniform as well. To determine whether this is occurring, we look for evidence of convergence—that is, increasing similarity— in the educational and occupational makeup of the banking, insurance, and securities industry workforces since the mid- 1980 s. Educational profiles are useful indicators because they {{provide a sense of}} the general skill level of an industry’s workforce; <b>occupational</b> <b>profiles</b> provide a sense of how an industry uses its human resources. Despite the prevalent notion that banks, securities firms, and insurance companies are becoming all-purpose financial institutions, our analysis provides little evidence of meaningful convergence in either the educational or the <b>occupational</b> <b>profiles</b> of these industries. We therefore conclude that substantial staffing changes lie ahead if these firms are to complete the transition to all-purpose financial institutions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Payment by Results (PbR) was {{recently}} introduced {{to mental health}} care in England. The system allocates service users to one of 20 clusters and will provide funding based on cluster membership, rather than on block contracts. Occupational therapists are challenged to define care packages {{for each of the}} clusters. Method: To facilitate their development, this study identified the <b>occupational</b> <b>profiles</b> of service users in each cluster based on measures offered by the Model of Human Occupation. The study used existing data from the clinical records of 625 service users from two organisations, collected through use of the Mental Health Clustering Tool and the Model of Human Occupation Screening Tool. Results: Across the sample, service users showed greatest problems with habituation, followed by volition and process skills. Qualitatively distinct <b>occupational</b> <b>profiles</b> were identified across the clusters. Service users with non-psychotic problems showed the least interference with occupational participation; those in clusters involving psychosis showed moderate levels of interference; and those in clusters involving cognitive impairment demonstrated the most difficulty with occupational participation. Conclusion: These findings provide an important evidence base for thinking about the occupational needs of service users within the various PbR clusters and the corresponding services that might be offered. © The College of Occupational Therapists Ltd...|$|R

30|$|In Ireland, {{early years}} {{practitioners}} outside {{the education system}} — i.e. those working in the predominantly privately-run childcare sector mainly for children under 4 years of age — have not been required to have a specific minimum qualification, whereas teachers working with 4 and 5 year olds in the (non-compulsory) infant classes in primary school have a three-year Bachelor-level teaching qualification, but without a strong specialisation in early years pedagogy. A recent survey of the Irish workforce showed that 12 per cent of the childcare workforce {{does not have any}} accredited childcare-related qualification (OMCYA, 2009). In order to improve opportunities for staff with no or low-level qualifications, a new set of <b>occupational</b> <b>profiles</b> linked into the National Qualifications Framework of Ireland now enable early childhood practitioners to progress through various stages (Basic, Intermediate, Experienced, Advanced, Expert), ranging from ICED 3 to ISCED 5, thus opening up pathways for career progression. Since a new policy move in 2009 to introduced entitlement for 3 year olds to a fee-free year of pre-school provision, however, the leaders of (private) settings offering this provision are now required to hold a specialised certificate equivalent to ISCED level 4, and it is expected that this requirement will be upgraded in the not-too-distant future (OMCYA, 2009).
