25|$|Television {{broadcasting}} in Japan {{started in}} August 28, 1953, making the country {{one of the}} first in the world with an experimental television service. The first television tests were conducted as early as 1926 using a combined mechanical Nipkow disk and electronic Braun tube system, later switching to an all-electronic system in the 1935 using a domestically developed iconoscope system. In spite <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> of the beginning of World War II in the Pacific region, this first full-fledged TV broadcast experimentation lasted only a few months. Regular television broadcasts would eventually start in 1953.|$|E
25|$|The {{executive}} offices of General Motors headquarters continued to clash with DeLorean's nonconformity, {{and he was}} still not able to fit the traditional mold of conservatism that was usually expected of someone of his stature. When John was appointed, Chevrolet was having financial and organizational troubles, and GM president Ed Cole needed a first-class manager in that position to sort things out – company man or not. The new model Camaro was due out for the 1970 model year, and it was rapidly falling behind schedule. Redesigns for the Corvette and Nova were also delayed, and unit sales had still not recovered from the past four years of turmoil, much <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of the bad publicity surrounding the Corvair and well-publicized quality-control issues affecting other Chevy models, including defective motor mounts that led to an unprecedented recall of 6.7 million Chevrolets built between 1965 and 1969. DeLorean responded to the production problems by delaying the release of the Camaro, and simplifying the modifications to the Corvette and Nova.|$|E
500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] was {{the first}} episode that did not feature regular {{character}} Kramer (Michael Richards), Jerry's neighbor. David explained {{that the reason for}} Kramer's absence was because—during Seinfelds early seasons—the character never left his apartment and did not go out with the other three. Richards was still displeased with the absence of his character, as he felt the episode was a breakthrough and—as such—essential for the series' development. In an interview for the Seinfeld first and second season DVD box set, he commented, [...] "The Chinese restaurant episode was so unique, and I just {{wanted to be a part}} <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> it was cutting edge. I knew that was a very important episode; it was so odd." ...|$|E

50|$|Laudanosine {{is also a}} {{metabolite}} <b>of</b> cisatracurium <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its identical {{structure to}} atracurium, undergoes chemodegradation via Hofmann elimination in vivo. Plasma concentrations of laudanosine generated are lower when cisatracurium is used.|$|R
500|$|In July 2012, Pusha T told MTV {{that while}} he was putting {{together}} his solo album, he was heavily influenced by Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino's 1997 film The Devil's Advocate. [...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If you just look at it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', but when you get tuned into the record, you realize that you get both sides of it." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
2500|$|In Pakistan, 40 {{percent to}} 50 {{percent of the}} {{residents}} of some villages have only one kidney because they have sold the other for a transplant into a wealthy person, probably from another country, said Dr. Farhat Moazam of Pakistan, at a World Health Organization conference. Pakistani donors are offered $2,500 for a kidney but receive only about half <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> middlemen take so much. In Chennai, southern India, poor fishermen and their families sold kidneys after their livelihoods were destroyed by the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004. About 100 people, mostly women, sold their kidneys for 40,000–60,000 rupees ($900–$1,350). Thilakavathy Agatheesh, 30, who sold a kidney in May 2005 for 40,000 rupees said, [...] "I used to earn some money selling fish but now the post-surgery stomach cramps prevent me from going to work." [...] Most kidney sellers say that selling their kidney was a mistake.|$|E

2500|$|Growing up, Kripke {{connected}} to television shows that had signature cars, such as The Dukes of Hazzard and Knight Rider. This {{prompted him to}} include one in Supernatural. [...] "We say it's a modern American Western— two gunslingers who ride into town, fight the bad guys, kiss the girl and ride out into the sunset again. And we were always talking {{from the very beginning}} that if you're going to have cowboys, they need a trusty horse." [...] He originally intended for the car to be a '65 Mustang, but his neighbor convinced him to change it to a '67 Impala, since [...] "you can put a body in the trunk" [...] and because [...] "you want a car that, when people stop next to it at the lights, they lock their doors." [...] Kripke has commented, [...] "It's a Rottweiler of a car, and I think it adds authenticity for fans of automobiles because <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> it's not a pretty ride. It's an aggressive, muscular car, and I think that's what people respond to, and why it fits so well into the tone of our show." ...|$|E

60|$|I say, I {{could not}} but reflect upon the {{brutality}} and blindness <b>of</b> mankind; <b>that</b> <b>because</b> nature {{had given me}} a good skin and some agreeable features, should suffer that beauty to be such a bait to appetite as to do such sordid, unaccountable things to obtain the possession of it.|$|R
50|$|Innes {{was unusual}} for a British artist <b>of</b> <b>that</b> time, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his bold {{painting}} style, more attuned to the French post-impressionists. It has been argued his unusual style led the way for British artists such as David Hockney.|$|R
