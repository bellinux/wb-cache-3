We argue that these models can be enriched with explicit annotations provided by an expert (e.g., {{a member of the}} software architecture team), who, in general, will also generate the SAD contents. This expert is able to select those concepts <b>or</b> <b>categories</b> <b>that</b> best <b>describe</b> the semantics of each document. The annotations are considered part of the document representations. Moreover, the annotations are helpful to model documents/sections of the SAD template that are partially completed (or even empty), or to refine the representation of documents that are not accurately described by their textual contents (e.g., documents that contain many images and little text).|$|R

5000|$|Concept learning, {{also known}} as {{category}} learning, concept attainment, and concept formation, is largely based on {{the works of the}} cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner. Bruner, Goodnow, & Austin (1967) defined concept attainment (or concept learning) as [...] "the search for and listing of attributes {{that can be used to}} distinguish exemplars from non exemplars of various categories". More simply put, concepts are the mental <b>categories</b> <b>that</b> help us classify objects, events, or ideas, building on the understanding that each object, event, or idea has a set of common relevant features. Thus, concept learning is a strategy which requires a learner to compare and contrast groups <b>or</b> <b>categories</b> <b>that</b> contain concept-relevant features with groups <b>or</b> <b>categories</b> <b>that</b> do not contain concept-relevant features.|$|R

40|$|In this work, we give {{a precise}} {{mathematical}} {{description of a}} fully chiral gapless edge of a 2 d topological order (without symmetry). We show that the observables on the 1 + 1 D world sheet of such an edge consist {{of a family of}} topological edge excitations, boundary CFT's and walls between boundary CFT's. These observables can be described by a chiral algebra and an enriched monoidal category. This mathematical description automatically includes that of gapped edges as special cases. Therefore, it gives a unified framework to study both gapped and gapless edges. Moreover, the boundary-bulk duality also holds for gapless edges. More precisely, the unitary modular tensor <b>category</b> <b>that</b> <b>describes</b> the 2 d bulk phase is exactly the Drinfeld center of the enriched monoidal <b>category</b> <b>that</b> <b>describes</b> the gapless/gapped edge. We propose a classification of all gapped and fully chiral gapless edges of a given bulk phase. In the end, we explain how modular-invariant bulk conformal field theories naturally emerge on certain gapless walls between two trivial phases.

To address this issue, in this paper a method is proposed to incorporate subscene attributes within global descriptions to improve categorization performance, especially in ambiguity cases. This is done by encoding subscenes with layout prototypes that capture the geometric essence of scenes more accurately and flexibly. The proposed method improves categorization accuracy. the proposed method can detect and evaluate ambiguity images more accurately. In this paper, scene categorization method is proposed by including subscene attributes to global descriptors. The use of prototypes is proposed to model the geometric configuration of subscenes. These prototypes are more accurate at capturing the layout and simple in training compared to the shape element-based approaches. Incorporating subscene descriptors can enhance the scene categorization result. Having been capable to detect ambiguity, the proposed method offers better understanding of the scene...|$|R
