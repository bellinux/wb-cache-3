The main agricultural good being imported at the Rhine port of Basel is wheat and from 2010 to 2013, 19 % of all Swiss wheat imports originated from Canada. As over 90 % of all <b>oilseed</b> rape grown in Canada is GM, we hypothesised that imports of Canadian wheat may contain low level impurities of GM <b>oilseed</b> rape. Therefore, waste fraction samples gathered during the mechanical cleaning of Canadian wheat from two Swiss grain mills were analysed by separating <b>oilseed</b> rape seeds from waste fraction samples and testing DNA of pooled seeds for the presence of transgenes by real-time PCR.

5000|$|Breaking {{it down to}} its {{simplest}} formulation, {{the process}} that <b>oilseed</b> presses carry out appears is quite simple. <b>Oilseed</b> presses essentially extrude or ‘press’ vegetable oil from oil-bearing seeds, which include soybean, sunflower, peanut, safflower, canola, sesame, niger, castor bean, linseed, mustard, coconut, olive, and oil palm.

40|$|Clearfield® rape (Brassica napus L.) {{derives from}} {{classical}} breeding methods and makes weed control with ALSinhibiting herbicides in <b>oilseed</b> rape possible. Two alleles of the ALS (acetolactate synthase), which {{are responsible for}} target site resistance (or tolerance, respectively), were crossed into {{two of the five}} ALS genes of <b>oilseed</b> rape. The allele of Clearfield® <b>oilseed</b> rape in ALS I is different from other ALS alleles by an exchange of the amino acid serine by asparagine in the codon 653 and is responsible for tolerance to imidazolinones. The allele in ALS III differs by an exchange of tryptophan to leucine in the codon 574 and causes a broad tolerance to imidazolinones, sulfonylureas, and triazolopyrimidines. The latter allele hinders mainly the control of volunteer Clearfield® <b>oilseed</b> rape with sulfonylureas and triazolopyrimidines e. g. in cereals. To decipher the alleles in Clearfield® <b>oilseed</b> rape and conventional <b>oilseed</b> rape a test based on the dCAPS (derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence) technology was developed and is presented here. With this test a Clearfield® <b>oilseed</b> rape can be discriminated in leaf samples or other parts of plants from conventional <b>oilseed</b> rape. A combination of PCR and digestion with restriction endonucleases is used to discriminate the alleles of ALS I (after incubation of PCR-products with MnlI) and of ALS III (after incubation of PCR-products with NcoI). The identification of Leu 574 is in most cases probably sufficient for proving reduced efficacy of sulfonylureas and triazolopyrimidines. To come to a clear identification and to discriminate Clearfield® <b>oilseed</b> rape from natural occurring target-site resistant <b>oilseed</b> rape both alleles should be analysed in samples.

40|$|The {{yield of}} UK’s {{commercial}} <b>oilseed</b> rape (Brassica napus) crops has not {{increased over the}} last three decades, while a significant increase in yield has been found in trials that test new varieties before they enter the market. It has been suggested that <b>oilseed</b> rape is susceptible to drought and that this may contribute to the poor yield of some commercial crops. A thorough literature review revealed that there is little information on the water relations of <b>oilseed</b> rape crops and in particular on root growth and function and thus no strong evidence to support the above hypothesis. The aim of this thesis was to investigate root function and water relations of <b>oilseed</b> rape to determine whether it is more sensitive to drought than wheat, a crop species grown in rotation with <b>oilseed</b> rape. The water relations of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Tybalt) and <b>oilseed</b> rape (Brassica napus L. cv. SW Landmark) were compared in a lysimeter experiment conducted in an open sided glass house to test the hypothesis that <b>oilseed</b> rape was more sensitive to drying soil than wheat. Plants were grown with or without irrigation at a population density equivalent to that of commercial field crops. Irrigated <b>oilseed</b> rape crops transpired more water than wheat crops and <b>oilseed</b> rape showed a greater reduction in growth when water was withheld. The onset of drought also occurred slightly earlier in <b>oilseed</b> rape. In a separate experiment the root hydraulic conductance of <b>oilseed</b> rape, measured on a root surface area basis, was about twice that of wheat (113. 1 ± 20. 0 mlNm- 2 Nh- 1 NMPa- 1 for <b>oilseed</b> rape and 53. 5 ± 10. 6 for wheat). These results suggest that <b>oilseed</b> rape needs a less dense root system for water extraction than wheat. In the above experiment plants were grown in relatively loose soil repacked into the lysimeters. It has been suggested that <b>oilseed</b> rape is particularly sensitive to soil compaction, which may be a common occurrence in commercial fields. Therefore the sensitivity of <b>oilseed</b> rape and wheat growth to compaction was compared in an experiment under well-watered conditions. Plants were grown in a controlled environment chamber in pots packed with soil at four different bulk densities. Although the root length, shoot mass, leaf area and stomatal conductance of <b>oilseed</b> rape were all reduced by soil compaction, <b>oilseed</b> rape was no more sensitive to soil compaction than wheat under these well-watered conditions. When soil dries it also hardens and high soil strength is known to impede root growth and alter plant-water relations. The hypothesis that <b>oilseed</b> rape is more sensitive to increasing soil strength than wheat was tested in an experiment in which soil bulk density and soil water content were varied to create a range of soil strengths. At low soil strength <b>oilseed</b> rape had a greater stomatal conductance than wheat, but as soil strength increased, stomatal conductance decreased to a greater extent in <b>oilseed</b> rape, indicating a more sensitive response. In dense or strong soil, plants often rely on pores created by earthworms or roots of the previous crop to explore the soil volume. The ability of <b>oilseed</b> rape and wheat to exploit soil pores to penetrate hard soil layers was compared in a pot experiment. A hard layer, comparable to a hard–pan in a cultivated field, was created at twelve centimetre depth of each pot by packing the soil to a bulk density of 1. 5 g·cm- 3 relatively loose soil at a bulk density of 1. 1 g·cm- 3 was present above and below the layer. In one treatment seven pores were drilled through the hard layer; controls had none. Presence of pores in the hard layer led to a significant increase in number of roots in the deeper soil, of 29 % for wheat and 54 % for <b>oilseed</b> rape. This project has shown that the physiological response to drought occurred earlier in <b>oilseed</b> rape than in wheat and that stomatal conductance and biomass production of <b>oilseed</b> rape reacted more sensitively to soil drying. However, water use by <b>oilseed</b> rape {{does not seem to be}} limited by the ability of its roots to explore the soil and transport water compared to wheat. The growth and distribution of roots under a range of soil conditions was as good as, if not better than, that of wheat. The implications of these findings for the commercial production of <b>oilseed</b> rape in the UK are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Blackleg—Leptosphaeria maculans—is a major {{worldwide}} pest for <b>oilseed</b> rape. Blackleg is an airborne pathogen spreading {{over several}} kilometres and surviving {{for at least}} 3 – 5 years on crop residues. In <b>oilseed</b> rape, the classical control strategy against blackleg is varietal resistance. However, genetic diversity is decreasing in agricultural crops. Moreover, at the farm level, management of <b>oilseed</b> resistance to blackleg must be adapted {{to take into account}} specific farm household objectives and organisation. Therefore, the different types of <b>oilseed</b> management should be identified. Here, we built a typology of <b>oilseed</b> rape management focusing on blackleg management. We used a methodology based on expert knowledge to analyse 32 farms of three French regions. Our results show that eight types of <b>oilseed</b> rape management were identified and can be discriminated according to the risk of blackleg resistance breakdown. We thus identified three categories, high, low, and medium risks. High risk management types have both a low level of <b>oilseed</b> rape management flexibility and a high level of inputs. Low risk systems are systems where <b>oilseed</b> rape is only a minor part of farmer sales and where inputs are minimised. Medium risk systems are systems where <b>oilseed</b> rape is integrated in the rotation, and where input use is optimised by taking into account the short rotation and the expected revenue.
