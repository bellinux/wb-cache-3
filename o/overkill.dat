5|$|Scientists {{are divided}} over whether climate change, hunting, or a {{combination}} of the two, drove the extinction of the Columbian mammoths. According to the climate change hypothesis, warmer weather led to the shrinking of suitable habitat for Columbian mammoths, which turned from parkland to forest, grassland and semi-desert, with less diverse vegetation. The <b>overkill</b> hypothesis, on the other hand, attributes the extinction to hunting by humans. This idea was first proposed by Paul S. Martin in 1967; more recent research on this subject have varied in their conclusions. A 2002 study concluded that the archaeological record did not support the <b>overkill</b> hypothesis, given that only 14 Clovis sites (12 with mammoth remains and two with mastodon remains) out of 76 examined provided strong evidence of hunting. In contrast, a 2007 study found that the Clovis record indicated the highest frequency of prehistoric exploitation of proboscideans for subsistence in the world, and supported the <b>overkill</b> hypothesis. Whatever the actual cause of extinction, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner was in {{many ways}} the most {{interesting}} personality in Nixon's political camp: aggressive, egocentric, a professional among amateurs, brilliant, overbearing, ruthless, engaging, habitually guilty of <b>overkill,</b> constantly enlarging his area of operation. Painted in sinister colors by the press, he was both a public relations problem for Nixon and an invaluable campaign strategist.|$|E
5|$|A prequel {{feature film}} titled Minions, {{featuring}} the Minions {{as the main}} characters, was released on July 10, 2015. Written by Brian Lynch, it was directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda, and produced by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy.

5000|$|... 1987 {{marked the}} release of <b>Overkill's</b> second album Taking Over, {{the first to be}} {{released}} by Megaforce in cooperation with the major label Atlantic Records. The album featured improved song writing and production and had a somewhat more epic style, showcased in such songs as the anthemic [...] "In Union We Stand". The song was chosen to be <b>Overkill's</b> first music video, used to promote the band through the booming new medium of music television. Another European tour followed, this time opening for Helloween.|$|R

Trainee Skye is frustrated when Coulson refuses to tell the team what the information is, based on their clearance level. At The Hub, a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility run by Agent Victoria Hand, it is revealed that a South Ossetian separatist group has built a weapon called the <b>Overkill</b> device, which uses sonic vibrations to trigger other weapons from great distances. Ward, a field specialist, and Agent Leo Fitz, a weapons technology specialist, are tasked with finding and disabling the device within 24 hours, before the separatists use it to declare independence from Russia and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} heavy metal had {{branched}} {{in so many}} different directions that fans, record companies, and fanzines created numerous subgenres. The United States was especially known for one of these subgenres, thrash metal, which was innovated by bands like Anthrax, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Testament, Exodus, Nuclear Assault, Death Angel, Mono Men, The DT's, OFF!, and <b>Overkill,</b> with Metallica being the most commercially successful. The United States was {{known as one of the}} birthplaces of Death Metal during the mid to late 1980s. The Florida scene was the most well-known, featuring bands like Death, Morbid Angel, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Malevolent Creation, Obituary, and many others. There are now countless death metal and deathgrind bands across the country.|$|E
5|$|Starbreeze {{partnered with}} Electronic Arts {{to develop a}} reboot to the Syndicate series, but it ended up being a {{commercial}} failure, and many staff members moved to rival company MachineGames, established by Starbreeze's founders. As a result, the company shifted part of its focus to developing smaller games, such as Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Starbreeze began expanding the company in 2012 with its acquisition of <b>Overkill</b> Software. Overkill's first title after the acquisition, Payday 2, helped Starbreeze make a record profit after suffering an accumulated loss of $14.4 million since its inception. In 2015, the company {{announced that it would}} start publishing video games from independent developers, and that it had begun the development of a virtual reality headset named Project Star VR.|$|E

5|$|In February 1987, Megadeth was {{the opening}} act on Alice Cooper's Constrictor tour, and the {{following}} month the band began its first headlining world tour in the United Kingdom. The 72-week tour was supported by <b>Overkill</b> and Necros, and continued in the United States. During the tour, Mustaine and Ellefson considered firing Samuelson for his drug abuse. According to Mustaine, Samuelson had become too much to handle when intoxicated. Drummer Chuck Behler traveled with Megadeth for the last dates of the tour as the other band members feared Samuelson {{would not be able}} to continue touring. Poland occasionally quarreled with Mustaine, and was accused of selling band equipment to buy heroin. As a result, Samuelson and Poland were asked to leave Megadeth in 1987, with Behler becoming the band's full-time drummer. Later that year, 16-year-old guitarist Jeff Loomis of Sanctuary auditioned for the band. Mustaine complimented Loomis' playing but considered him too young to join. Poland was initially replaced by Jay Reynolds of Malice, but as the band began working on its next record, Reynolds was replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young, when Megadeth was six weeks into the recording of its third album.|$|E

25|$|Theoretically, the {{likelihood}} of survival of an individual microorganism is never zero. To compensate for this, the <b>overkill</b> method is often used. Using the <b>overkill</b> method, sterilization is performed by sterilizing for longer than is required to kill the bioburden present on or in the item being sterilized.

5000|$|The game also {{includes}} three {{new types of}} finishing moves. The first is a second [...] "Overkill" [...] in each stage, called [...] "Sudden Death", that can be activated when the victim still has a little life left. The other two, [...] "Vendetta" [...] and [...] "Cinekill", can be performed on a dazed opponent that has 20% or less of their life {{in the final round}} only. Sudden Deaths and Vendettas are often exceptionally gory, and the original <b>Overkills</b> were made gorier to match. During <b>Overkills</b> (and Sudden Deaths), the winning fighter is carried off the stage in a flash of light the moment the fateful blow was made. The game retains the stage-specific finishing moves called <b>Overkills</b> from the first Eternal Champions, and added ones for the new stages. These are performed by defeating your opponent in a way that ensures that they fall upon a certain area of ground. If they land in the right spot, the life bars disappear and some element of the background kills them.|$|R
