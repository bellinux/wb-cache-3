Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the historical and}} philosophical context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> “tradition” and <b>the</b> “purpose-task” in <b>the</b> philosophy <b>of</b> Sergius Hessen. <b>The</b> article identified <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> values and hierarchy of values of Heinrich Rickert in definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> “tradition” and “purpose-task” and <b>the</b> main principle <b>of</b> their interaction...|$|R

25|$|In the 1760s {{there was}} a decline of popular demand for the confessional genre that could be {{connected}} to the crisis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> 'Everyman' criminal.|$|E
25|$|Wiener is {{considered}} the originator of cybernetics, a formalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> feedback, with implications for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, neuroscience, philosophy, {{and the organization of}} society.|$|E

30|$|Let the {{function}} F=(F_ 1,F_ 2,...,F_N) : R^n→R^N be differentiable at x^∗. <b>The</b> following generalizations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> invexity, pseudoinvexity, and quasiinvexity for vector-valued functions were originally proposed in [28].|$|R
60|$|Let us now go on {{to observe}} how, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> {{equality}} and number, as arrived at in the manner described, there gradually arose <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> quantitative prevision.|$|R
25|$|The {{language}} of category theory provides a concise definition for Lie groups: a Lie {{group is a}} group object {{in the category of}} smooth manifolds. This is important, because it allows generalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a Lie group to Lie supergroups.|$|E
25|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> reincarnation are obscure. Discussion of {{the subject}} appears in the {{philosophical}} traditions of India.

25|$|The work of Sela on first-order {{theory of}} free and word-hyperbolic groups {{substantially}} influenced {{the development of}} geometric group theory, in particular by stimulating the development and the study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> limit groups and of relatively hyperbolic groups.|$|E

25|$|An earlier example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> {{computing}} as {{the utility}} was in 1965 by MIT's Fernando Corbató. Corbató {{and the other}} designers of the Multics operating system envisioned a computer facility operating “like a power company or water company”.|$|E
25|$|This led in 1828 to an {{important}} theorem, the Theorema Egregium (remarkable theorem), establishing {{an important}} property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> curvature. Informally, the theorem says that the {{curvature of a surface}} can be determined entirely by measuring angles and distances on the surface.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{equivalent}} definitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> {{the fundamental}} group of a graph of groups: {{the first is}} a direct algebraic definition via an explicit group presentation (as a certain iterated application of amalgamated free products and HNN extensions), and the second using the language of groupoids.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} to derive, from the covariant formulation of full quantum theory (Spinfoam) the correct relation between energy and area (1st law), the Unruh temperature and the distribution that yields Hawking entropy. The calculation makes use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> dynamical horizon and is done for non-extremal black holes.|$|E
25|$|Leopold Kronecker {{was skeptical}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> {{infinity}} {{and how his}} fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s.

25|$|Harmful {{environmental}} {{issues such as}} ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication and climate change came to the public's attention in the same period, and caused the onset of environmental science and environmental technology.

50|$|There can be {{confusion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> {{object of}} DBMS and of class object. This {{is very important}} as we live with both significances in one language.

50|$|<b>The</b> {{consequences}} <b>of</b> this revolution, Weaver contends, were <b>the</b> gradual erosion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> distinction and hierarchy, and <b>the</b> subsequent enfeebling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western mind's {{capacity to}} reason. These effects in turn produced {{all manner of}} societal ills, decimating Western art, education and morality.|$|R

25|$|The utility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a {{topology}} {{is shown}} {{by the fact that}} there are several equivalent definitions of this structure.

25|$|PDIFF {{is mostly}} a {{technical}} point: smooth maps are not piecewise linear (unless linear), and piecewise linear maps are not smooth (unless globally linear) – the intersection is linear maps, or more precisely affine maps (because not based) – so they cannot directly be related: they are separate generalizations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> an affine map.|$|E
25|$|The {{class of}} all vector bundles {{together}} with bundle morphisms forms a category. Restricting to vector bundles {{for which the}} spaces are manifolds (and the bundle projections are smooth maps) and smooth bundle morphisms we obtain the category of smooth vector bundles. Vector bundle morphisms are a special case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a bundle map between fiber bundles, and are also often called (vector) bundle homomorphisms.|$|E
