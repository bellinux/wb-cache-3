This study compared 23 hybrids with 21 <b>open-pollinated</b> <b>varieties,</b> all developed in India and/or Southern Africa. Materials were field-tested under conditions of stored soil moisture at two levels of drought stress (dryland or one supplemental irrigation) at Bet Dagan, Israel in 1989. Irrespective of the water regime, grain yield and harvest index increased and leaf area index decreased with a shorter growth duration of the genotypes. Hybrids were earlier, had a larger leaf area index, {{more than double the}} harvest index and produced more grain compared with varieties. In spite of their longer growth duration, varieties were less water-stressed than hybrids, as judged by their midday leaf water potential, relative water content and the extent of leaf rolling. The relatively poor plant water status of the hybrids could be partly ascribed to their larger leaf area index. Hybrids produced more biomass per day than varieties under low stress while varieties produced more biomass per day than hybrids under high stress. Thus, in terms of plant water status and mean daily biomass production, varieties were more drought resistant than hybrids. However, the physiological superiority of the varieties under drought stress did not result in a higher grain yield because of their inherent relatively poor harvest index, typical of the tall and late African sorghums. The superior physiological resistance to drought stress of these varieties could be translated into a yield advantage under drought stress if their potential harvest index is improved...|$|R
