5|$|The Soviet Navy {{examined}} {{the ship in}} great detail after she arrived in Libau. The cruiser was then renamed Admiral Makarov and assigned to the 8th Fleet, based in Tallinn. In late 1948, she became the flagship of the 8th Fleet, {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral F. V. Zozulya. In the early 1950s, three new s entered service, which prompted the Soviet Navy to withdraw Admiral Makarov from front line duties. She returned to her old job as a training cruiser, this time based in Kronstadt in mid-1954. During this period, most of her light anti-aircraft armament was removed, and new radars were installed. Her ultimate fate is unclear; she appears to have been placed out of service by May 1959, and was scrapped some time thereafter, reportedly by mid-1960. Nevertheless, she was the longest-surviving major warship of the Kriegsmarine, and the only <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> active service {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E

As a result of his early training he was the first <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the wakes of the two torpedoes coming from the port side. Both torpedoes went between the Helena and the San Francisco and when both ships turned, the torpedoes went past us and one of them hit the Juneau.

25|$|Because {{the lunar}} orbit is also {{inclined}} to Earth's ecliptic plane by 5.1°, the rotational {{axis of the}} Moon seems to rotate {{towards and away from}} Earth during one complete orbit. This is referred to as latitudinal libration, which allows <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> almost 7° of latitude beyond the pole on the far side. Finally, because the Moon is only about 60 Earth radii away from Earth's centre of mass, an observer at the equator who observes the Moon throughout the night moves laterally by one Earth diameter. This gives rise to a diurnal libration, which allows one to view an additional one degree's worth of lunar longitude. For the same reason, observers at both of Earth's geographical poles would be able to see one additional degree's worth of libration in latitude.|$|E

2500|$|On the 25th {{anniversary of}} the crash, Peter Otzen Jnr, the son {{of one of the}} victims, {{announced}} that he was approaching the South African Constitutional Court in an attempt to have the commission of inquiry into the disaster reopened. In pursuit of this, he has obtained affidavits from former SAA employees who had never before given evidence. An Australian, Allan Dexter, had given a sworn statement to Mr. Otzen claiming that he had been informed by the SAA Manager at Taipei airport that the Helderberg was carrying rocket fuel, which caused it to crash. A second affidavit secured by Mr. Otzen was sworn by former Chief Cabin Steward Willem Bothma, who claimed that when he was in Taipei on 28 November 1987, the day of the crash, he received a telex from the SAA CEO Gert van der Veer which read [...] "Seize all cargo documents related to SA295.

2500|$|The ancient Aitareya Upanishad equates Indra, {{along with}} other deities, with Atman (soul, self) in the Vedanta's spirit of {{internalization}} of rituals and gods. It begins with its cosmological theory in verse 1.1.1 by stating that, [...] "in the beginning, Atman, verily one only, was here - no other blinking thing whatever; he bethought himself: let me now create worlds". This soul, which the text refers to as Brahman as well, then proceeds to create the worlds and beings in those worlds wherein all Vedic gods and goddesses such as sun-god, moon-god, Agni and other divinities become active cooperative organs of the body. The Atman thereafter creates food, and thus emerges a sustainable non-sentient universe, according to the Upanishad. The eternal Atman then enters each living being making the universe full of sentient beings, but these living beings fail to perceive their Atman. The first <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Atman as Brahman, asserts the Upanishad, said, [...] "idam adarsha or [...] "I have seen It". Others then called this first seer as Idam-dra or [...] "It-seeing", which over time came to be cryptically known as [...] "Indra", because, claims Aitareya Upanishad, everyone including the gods like short nicknames. The passing mention of Indra in this Upanishad, states Alain Daniélou, is a symbolic folk etymology.|$|E
