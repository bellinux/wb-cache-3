40|$|This study {{examined}} 25 university students' use of addition to solve large single-digit subtractions by contrasting {{performance in the}} standard subtraction format (12 - 9 =.) and in the addition format (9 +. = 12). In particular, we investigated {{the effect of the}} relative size of the subtrahend on performance in both formats. We found a significant interaction between format, the magnitude of the subtrahend (S) compared to the difference (D) (S > D vs. S < D), and the numerical distance between subtrahend and difference. When the subtrahend was larger than the difference and S and D were far from each <b>other</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> 12 - 9 =.), problems were solved faster in the addition than in the subtraction format; when the subtrahend was smaller than the difference and S and D were far from each <b>other</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> 12 - 3 =.), problems were solved faster in the subtraction than in the addition format. However, when the subtrahend and the difference were close to each <b>other</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> 13 - 7 =.), there were no significant reaction time differences between both formats. These results suggest that adults do not rely exclusively and routinely on addition to solve large single-digit subtractions, but select either addition-based or subtraction-based strategies depending on the relative size of the subtrahend.

40|$|Many {{policies}} to limit {{greenhouse gas emissions}} have at their core efforts to {{put a price on}} carbon emissions. Carbon pricing impacts households both by raising the cost of carbon intensive products and by changing factor prices. A complete analysis requires taking both effects into account. The impact of carbon pricing is determined by heterogeneity in household spending patterns across income groups as well as heterogeneity in factor income patterns across income groups. It is also affected by precise formulation of the policy (how is the revenue from carbon pricing distributed) as well as the treatment of <b>other</b> government policies (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> the treatment of transfer payments). What is often neglected in analyses of policy is the heterogeneity of impacts across households even within income or regional groups. In this paper, we incorporate 15, 588 households from the U. S. Consumer and Expenditure Survey data as individual agents in a comparative-static general equilibrium framework. These households are represented within the MIT USREP model, a detailed general equilibrium model of the U. S. economy. In particular, we categorize households by full household income (factor income as well as transfer income) and apply various measures of lifetime income to distinguish households that are temporarily low-income (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>retired</b> households drawing down their financial assets) from permanently low-income households. We also provide detailed within-group distributional measures of burden impacts from various policy scenarios. ...|$|R

The relative infestation level (i. e., {{the probability that a}} plant is attacked by herbivores) of E. vitis on different grapevine cultivars and their sensitivity (i. e., the incidence of symptoms expression in response to herbivore feeding or other stimuli) to this pest were studied over four years in two vineyards located in northeastern Italy. Some cultivars (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Carménère and Sauvignon Blanc) were usually more infested than <b>others</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Gris), although some differences were observed among years and sites.

Information obtained can be used within the framework of integrated pest management in vineyards. Action thresholds should differ on the basis of sensitivity.

Dutch duration sensitivity patterned with Czech but {{was larger than}} Spanish in the native vowel, while it was smaller than Czech and Spanish in the non-native vowel. An interpretation of these findings suggests that in Dutch, duration is used phonemically {{but it might be}} relevant for the identity of certain native vowels only. Furthermore, the finding that Spanish listeners are more sensitive to duration in non-native than in native vowels indicates that a lack of duration differences in one’s native language could be beneficial for second-language learning...|$|R
