40|$|Background: Very {{little is}} known about the {{characteristics}} of sleep related (SR) crashes <b>occurring</b> <b>on</b> low speed roads compared with current understanding of the role of sleep in crashes <b>occurring</b> <b>on</b> high speed roads e. g. motorways. To address this gap, analyses were undertaken to identify the differences and similarities between (1) SR crashes <b>occurring</b> <b>on</b> roads with low (= 100 km/h) speed limits, and (2) SR crashes and not-SR crashes <b>occurring</b> <b>on</b> roads with low speed limits...|$|R
50|$|The {{arrangement}} of antheridia and archegonia {{on an individual}} bryophyte plant is usually constant within a species, although in some species it may depend on environmental conditions. The main division is between species in which the antheridia and archegonia <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> the same plant and those in which they <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> different plants. The term monoicous may be used where antheridia and archegonia <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> the same gametophyte and the term dioicous where they <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> different gametophytes.|$|R

2500|$|Between 50 and 80% of diaphragmatic {{ruptures}} <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> {{the left}} side. [...] It {{is possible that}} the liver, which is situated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, cushions the diaphragm. However, injuries <b>occurring</b> <b>on</b> the left side are also easier to detect in X-ray films. [...] Half of diaphragmatic ruptures that <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> the right side are associated with liver injury. Injuries <b>occurring</b> <b>on</b> the right are associated with a higher rate of death and more numerous and serious accompanying injuries. Bilateral diaphragmatic rupture, which occurs in 1–2% of ruptures, is associated with a much higher death rate (mortality) than injury that <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> just one side.|$|R
30|$|Observations by ocean-bottom seismometers in the {{southern}} Ryukyu Trench have revealed that the LFEs <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> the plate interface (Arai et al. 2016). Although the observational periods are only 3  months, {{the distribution of the}} epicenters is consistent with the 12 -year long-term distribution. This suggests that most LFEs would <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> the plate interface; however, some might <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> the splay faults. Long-term observations using ocean-bottom seismometers placed above the hypocenter area of LFEs would reveal whether all LFEs <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> the plate interface.|$|R
5000|$|Didymascella thujina <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> western {{red cedar}} (T. plicata) and T. plicata var. atrovirens {{on the west coast}} of North America, and eastern white cedar (T. occidentalis) in eastern North America.

Energy dissipation analysis is extended to hydraulic jumps occurring downstream of grade-control structures in the presence of movable stilling basin...|$|R
