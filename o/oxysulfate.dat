The chisel exhibited smaller grain sizes near two of the surfaces while the structure in the interior was equiaxed. The deformed grains and inclusions near the surfaces and variation in the microhardness of the sample from different faces proved that the copper chisel was processed by cold deformation after initial casting of the square cross-section chisel.

Detailed characterization of altered basaltic tephra on Mauna Kea have identified a variety of alteration phases including allophane, npOx, hisingerite, jarosite, alunite, hematite, goethite, ferrihydrite, halloysite, kaolinite, smectite, and zeolites. The presence of npOx and other Fe-bearing minerals (jarosite, hematite, goethite) was confirmed by the M ssbauer Spectrometer onboard the Mars Exploration Rovers. Although the presence of allophane has not been definitely identified on Mars robotic missions, chemical analysis by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers and thermal infrared spectral orbital measurements suggest the presence of allophane or allophane-like phases on Mars. SRO phases form under a variety of environmental conditions on Earth ranging from cold and arid to warm and humid, including hydrothermal conditions. The formation of SRO aluminosilicates such as allophane (and crystalline halloysite) from basaltic material is controlled by several key factors including activity of water, extent of leaching, Si activity in solution, and available Al. Generally, a low leaching index (e. g., wet-dry cycles) and slightly acidic to alkaline conditions are necessary. NpOx generally form under aqueous oxidative weathering conditions, although thermal oxidative alteration may occasional be involved. The style of aqueous alteration (hydrolytic vs. acid sulfate) impacts which phases will form (e. g., oxides, <b>oxysulfates,</b> and oxyhydroxides). Knowledge on the formation processes of SRO phases in basaltic materials on Earth has allowed significant enhancement in our understanding of the aqueous processes at work on Mars. The 2011 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) will provide an instrument suite that should improve our understanding of the mineralogical and chemical compositions of SRO phases. CheMin is an X-ray diffraction instrument that may provide broad X-ray diffraction peaks for SRO phases; e. g., broad peaks around 0. 33 and 0. 23 nm for allophane.

The adsorption, characterized by pseudo-second order kinetics and Freundlich isotherm, was attributed to the reaction between the hydroxyl groups of TiO 2 and Pb 2 + to form Pb- 0 bond, as indicated by XPS analysis. The adsorbent can be easily regenerated for a number of times without significant reduction in adsorption performances. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|In our {{previous}} work [16], we chose titanium <b>oxysulfate</b> sulfuric acid hydrate (TiOSO 4 · x H 2 SO 4 · x H 2 O) as a titania precursor and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a structure-directing {{agent for the}} preparation of titania. Both TiOSO 4 and CTAB are cheap and common materials for industries. After simply mixed together at a lower range of temperatures (30 – 60 °C), hexagonal-structured assemblies of nanocrystalline titania were formed through hydrolysis of TiOSO 4 promoted by CTAB spherical micelles and condensation process (named as Hex-ncTiO 2 /CTAB nanoskeleton) [22, 23]. This system had some unique features and advantages, for example, a facile preparation, crystallization of titania in aqueous solution in mild conditions and formation of hexagonal-structured anatase titania framework. Then, we were successful to prepare mesoporous titania particles with honeycomb structure and anatase crystalline framework after the calcinations of the Hex-ncTiO 2 /CTAB nanoskeleton at 723 K for 2 h [16, 23].|$|E
3000|$|The {{concentration}} of H 2 O 2 in leaves was measured following the method described by Jana and Choudhuri (1982). All experimental steps were performed at 4 °C. 0.125  g leaf tissue was {{ground to a}} fine powder in liquid nitrogen and further homogenized with 450  μL Solution I (10  mM Na-P buffer, pH  6.5, 10  mM 3 -amino- 1.2. 4 -triazole). The supernatant from a 25  min centrifugation at 13, 000  g under 4 °C was transferred to a new eppendorf tube and the extraction was repeated. To 600  μL of the supernatant 200  μL Solution II (0.1 % titanium <b>oxysulfate</b> and 0.1 % titanium sulfate in 20 % H 2 SO 4) was added and the solution was mixed well. [...]. Finally, 200  μL supernatant was dispensed to 96 well plates and the absorption was measured at OD 410 (TECAN Infinite® M 200 PRO). The H 2 O 2 content was calculated with a standard curve.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Nano-titanium dioxide (N-TiO 2) {{have already}} been studied and applied in the {{different}} fields due to its special surface, quantum size effect and high photocatalysis etc super properties. As a kind of biomaterials, biocompatibility and corrosion resistant of titanium {{are closely related to}} the surface oxide films. In this paper, nano-titanium dioxide with uniform granularity was synthesized using coprecipitation method. The effects of reactant mixture ratio and sintering temperature on synthesized N-TiO 2 were discussed. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were employed to analyze structure of N-TiO 2. The results showed that prepared N- TiO 2 were all anatase and rutile coexistence and the larger ratio of carbamide to titanium <b>oxysulfate</b> (CO(NH 2) 2 /TiOSO 4) is propitious to formation of metatitanic acid (TiO(OH) 2) precipitate. Meanwhile, with CO(NH 2) 2 /TiOSO 4 increasing, the start time and end time of precipitate decreased. The method used in this paper was a kind of simple process and easy to do...|$|E
