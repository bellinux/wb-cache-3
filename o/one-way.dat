5|$|After DE 9A, DE 9 enters Wilmington {{and heads}} through urban areas as an {{undivided}} road, crossing Norfolk Southern's Shellpot Secondary before intersecting the northbound direction of US 13. At this point, DE 9 splits into a <b>one-way</b> pair with the northbound direction becoming concurrent with northbound US 13 on <b>one-way</b> New Castle Avenue and the southbound direction following southbound US 13 on South Heald Street, briefly turning east along with northbound US 13 on D Street {{at the south}} end of the <b>one-way</b> pair. The <b>one-way</b> pair, which carries two lanes in each direction, passes rowhomes and businesses, with New Castle Avenue merging onto South Heald Street. Here, US 13/DE 9 continue north-northeast on four-lane undivided South Heald Street, coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of DE 9A.|$|E
5|$|At Unionville, M-25 turns more {{westerly}} {{to round}} {{the bottom of}} Saginaw Bay into Bay City along Bay City-Forestville Road in Tuscola County. In the community of Quanicassee, it transitions to Center Road and crosses into Bay County. M-25 is routed the <b>one-way</b> street pair of 7th Street and McKinley Street before crossing the Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Saginaw River. West of the bridge, the <b>one-way</b> pairing of Jenny Street and Thomas Street are used before the two merge into Thomas Street west of the M-13 intersections.|$|E
5|$|At the {{intersection}} with Montgomery Street, MD 2 splits into another <b>one-way</b> pair with the northbound direction running east on Montgomery Street and then turning north on Light Street, intersecting MD 2 Truck (Key Highway) and passing by the Maryland Science Center, and the southbound direction following Hughes Street to Hanover Street. Along this <b>one-way</b> pair, the route carries one lane {{in each direction}} {{with the exception of}} Light Street, where the northbound direction has four lanes. Both directions of MD 2 join again along eight-lane divided Light Street and the route heads toward the Inner Harbor. Near Harborplace, the route splits into another <b>one-way</b> pair with northbound MD 2 running along three-lane Calvert Street and southbound MD 2 running along four-lane St. Paul Street. The route crosses many streets in downtown Baltimore, including Pratt Street, Lombard Street, Baltimore Street, Fayette Street, and Saratoga Street. The <b>one-way</b> pair passes by Mercy Medical Center before coming to US 40. Calvert Street passes under US 40 (the Orleans Street Viaduct) while St. Paul Street intersects US 40 as it follows the <b>one-way</b> pair of Franklin Street westbound and Mulberry Street eastbound.|$|E
5|$|At this point, DE 4 turns {{north for}} a {{concurrency}} with DE 7 on the six-lane divided Stanton Christiana Road, running through wooded areas with nearby development, including the Hale-Byrnes House, and passing over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad {{line and the}} White Clay Creek and Mill Creek near their confluence. The road passes {{to the east of}} Delaware Park Racetrack and curves northeast into Stanton. At this point, the two routes head into a commercial area and split into the <b>one-way</b> pair of Mitch Road eastbound and Main Street westbound. DE 7 splits from DE 4 by heading northwest on Limestone Road. DE 4 continues east along the <b>one-way</b> pair past homes and businesses with two lanes in each direction, crossing Red Clay Creek. The directions of the route rejoin and the route becomes four-lane divided West Newport Pike, heading through suburban areas and crossing Hershey Run. DE 4 enters Newport and splits into the <b>one-way</b> pair of West Market Street eastbound and West Justis Street westbound. The route has an interchange with the DE 141 freeway and the <b>one-way</b> pair becomes East Market Street eastbound and East Justis Street westbound.|$|E
5|$|MD 528 and MD 378 {{head north}} through the {{downtown}} area of Ocean City, where they meet the eastern terminus of US 50 at North Division Street. North Division Street between MD 528 and MD 378 is <b>one-way</b> eastbound, so traffic coming from the south uses North 1st Street, which is <b>one-way</b> westbound and designated MD 378A, to access US 50 west. MD 528 and MD 378 continue north to 9th Street, which is <b>one-way</b> westbound and designated MD 378B. MD 528 becomes two-way at 9th Street. MD 378 continues north as a two-lane street northbound to 15th Street, where the state highway turns west to reach its northern terminus at MD 528. Baltimore Avenue continues north of 15th Street as a two-way municipal street to its northern end at 33rd Street.|$|E
5|$|On the mainland, SR 160 {{once again}} runs atop the east levee, now 1–2 miles (1.5–3km) west of Interstate 5. The final {{bridge over the}} river is the Freeport Bridge, which carries County Route E9 to the west levee, where it turns south to return to SR 160 at {{the west end of}} the Paintersville Bridge. About a mile (1.5km) beyond the Freeport Bridge, SR 160 leaves the levee, enters the city of Sacramento (where state {{maintenance}} and control ends), passes under I-5, and farms give way to suburbs. Here the former SR 160 is known as Freeport Boulevard, a major surface road that passes the Sacramento Executive Airport and Sacramento City College. Freeport Boulevard turns to the northwest at about 4th Avenue. It was formerly a <b>one-way</b> pair with 21st Street with Freeport heading <b>one-way</b> southbound and 21st heading <b>one-way</b> northbound. The city converted these streets back to two-way streets for traffic calming purposes in 2008. After a short jog west on Broadway, former SR 160 turns north on the <b>one-way</b> pair of 15th (southbound) and 16th (northbound) Streets, almost immediately crossing Business 80 and entering downtown Sacramento.|$|E
5|$|PA 222 {{heads into}} {{downtown}} Allentown, where it splits into a <b>one-way</b> pair at 12th Street. Northbound PA 222 turns south onto 12th Street and east onto Walnut Street while southbound PA 222 runs west along Linden Street to 12th Street, following 12th Street south to Hamilton Street. Walnut Street is two lanes and two-way until 10th Street, where it becomes <b>one-way</b> with two northbound lanes heading east, while Linden Street {{is one way}} southbound with two lanes heading west. The <b>one-way</b> paring continues east past homes and businesses in the downtown area. Southbound PA 222 passes {{to the north of}} the PPL Center sports arena, where the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League and the Lehigh Valley Steelhawks of the National Arena League play, between 8th and 7th streets. PA 222 intersects 7th Street, which carries southbound PA 145, before it reaches its northern terminus at 6th Street, which carries northbound PA 145.|$|E
5|$|Traffic {{through the}} village has been so heavy on {{weekends}} during summer and peak leaf peeping weekends in early autumn that many residents have proposed making Main Street <b>one-way,</b> carrying traffic only to the west, while diverting eastbound traffic onto either of two parallel streets. Other villages that have made such changes found making streets <b>one-way</b> decreased business at their retailers.|$|E
5|$|US40Alternate {{begins as}} Baltimore Street at its {{intersection}} with <b>one-way</b> southbound Potomac Street within the Hagerstown Historic District {{on the southern}} edge of downtown Hagerstown. Baltimore Street, which continues west as a city street toward the Hagerstown City Park, runs eastwest two blocks south of US40, which comprises a <b>one-way</b> pair of Washington Street eastbound and Franklin Street westbound. After heading east for two blocks, during which US40Alternate intersects <b>one-way</b> northbound Locust Street, the municipally-maintained alternate route turns southeast onto Frederick Street at a five-way junction that also includes northsouth Mulberry Street. US40Alternate intersects Memorial Boulevard, which heads east past Municipal Stadium, home of the minor league baseball Hagerstown Suns. The highway meets a CSX rail spur at grade while passing through an industrial area that extends to the southern city limits of Hagerstown at Kenly Avenue.|$|E
5|$|After this, SR75 {{passes through}} the United States Naval Amphibious Base for a few miles before {{entering}} downtown Coronado. The highway becomes Orange Avenue and turns north-northeast as the main street through Coronado. SR75 intersects SR 282 at the <b>one-way</b> couplet of Third and Fourth Streets; SR282 continues west on Third Street and returns to SR75 on Fourth Street, while SR75 continues east on Fourth Street and heads west towards Orange Avenue on Third Street. The <b>one-way</b> couplet is brief, and SR75 becomes a divided highway before crossing the Coronado Bridge. While on the bridge, SR75 crosses into the city of San Diego again.|$|E
5|$|At Main Street, Church Street splits {{into a pair}} of <b>one-way</b> {{streets and}} becomes North and South Division Street. The route follows South Division eastward for two blocks to an {{intersection}} with Ellicott Street located one block north of Coca-Cola Field. At the junction, which includes the northern terminus of NY16, NY5 turns northward, rejoining NY5 westbound one block later at North Division. The route continues on Ellicott for nine blocks to the unidirectional East Tupper Street, where NY5 westbound separates from the route once more. NY5 eastbound, however, continues north on Ellicott for an additional block to the <b>one-way</b> Goodell Street. NY5 heads west on Goodell for two blocks before turning north onto Main Street, rejoining NY5 westbound at the intersection.|$|E
5|$|By March 2003, the {{cheapest}} fare from the UK was £59 return, available all year around. In June 2009 {{it was announced}} that <b>one-way</b> single fares would be available at £31 at {{the cheapest}}. Competition between Eurostar and airline services was a large factor in ticket prices being reduced from the initial levels.|$|E
5|$|Concorde was {{normally}} {{perceived as}} a privilege of the rich, but special circular or <b>one-way</b> (with return by other flight or ship) charter flights were arranged to bring a trip within the means of moderately well-off enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|In Elizabeth, Route 27 narrows to two {{lanes and}} becomes Rahway Avenue, {{crossing}} Route 439 {{and continuing to}} the northeast through residential and commercial areas. Route 27 splits into a <b>one-way</b> pair with northbound Route 27 following Rahway Avenue east and turning north onto Cherry Street and southbound Route 27 following Westfield Avenue west and turning south onto Chilton Avenue. The southbound direction of Route 27 intersects the eastern terminus of Route 28, where that route continues west on Westfield Avenue. Past the <b>one-way</b> pair, Route 27 resumes east on four-lane Westfield Avenue, turning north onto Broad Street. The route heads into a more urbanized setting and continues northeast onto Newark Avenue, intersecting the northern terminus of Route 439. Through Elizabeth, about 10,000 to 20,000 vehicles travel on Route 27 every day.|$|E
5|$|In Lansing, {{the highway}} travels splits {{to follow the}} <b>one-way</b> streets of Saginaw (eastbound) and Oakland (westbound) near the Sparrow Specialty Hospital. BL I-69/M-43 then crosses the Grand River and passes Marshall Park. The {{trunkline}} then passes over US127 just before the paired <b>one-way</b> streets merge back together on Grand River Avenue. After the merge, M-43 heads southeast through East Lansing, passing the main campus of Michigan State University and Spartan Stadium. The road continues on its southeast path, traveling by the Meridian Mall as it enters Meridian Township. From here the road travels through Williamston before terminating at an interchange with I-96 just south of Webberville at exit122.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, the High Street {{was made}} <b>one-way</b> for traffic heading towards Saltford and Bath with all Bristol-bound {{diverted}} along Ashton Way. There is now {{no access to}} Temple Street from High Street {{with the exception of}} buses and taxis, all traffic for Temple Street is diverted along Ashton Way.|$|E
5|$|In {{downtown}} Adrian, {{the highways}} previously split into an uncommon arrangement of <b>one-way</b> streets. This arrangement {{was similar to}} a traffic circle in how the traffic was routed through the central business district on Church, Broad, Front and Winter streets. The first <b>one-way</b> pairing started on Main Street at the intersection with Winter Street. Northbound traffic continued on Main Street, while southbound traffic was routed along Winter Street. At Church Street, westbound Bus. US223/northbound M-52 turned east for a block on Church and then north onto Broad Street. Then the highway designations continued on Broad Street three blocks north to Front Street, passing {{to the east of}} the downtown businesses. The designations were then routed west along Front Street. At Main Street, M-52 turned back north again as a two-way street. In the opposite direction, southbound M-52 traffic was diverted from Main west on Front Street. Front Street west of Main Street carried southbound M-52 and westbound Bus. US223 traffic one block west to Winter Street, which then turned down Winter. Westbound Bus. US223 traffic turned west along Maumee Street while eastbound Bus. US223 followed southbound M-52 down Winter to Main Street. This arrangement was ended in November 2009 when the City of Adrian converted all of the <b>one-way</b> streets to two-way traffic. Downtown streets had been converted to <b>one-way</b> traffic between 1950 and 1973.|$|E
5|$|Kitsap Fast Ferries {{charges a}} $2 {{eastbound}} fare and $10 westbound fare, offering monthly passes and PugetPasses for frequent passengers; reduced fare passengers are charged a $1 eastbound fare and $5 westbound fare. The regional ORCA card is accepted to pay <b>one-way</b> fares, along with exact cash and tokens.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette Square is one {{of three}} squares laid out in Joseph Ellicott's city plan. The square is located three blocks east of Niagara Square and is the second most {{important}} space in downtown Buffalo. The block is surrounded by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority's Metro Rail light rail rapid transit to the west, which runs above-ground along Main Street in what is called the Free Fare Zone, Washington Street to the east, Lafayette Square to the north (a <b>one-way</b> westbound continuation of Broadway) and Lafayette Square to the south (a <b>one-way</b> eastbound connection to Clinton Street).|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 1962, the I-96 freeway was {{completed}} around {{the south and}} west sides of Lansing, and a year later, the I-496 freeway {{was completed}} north into downtown from I-96. M-78 was rerouted from the I-96/US27 interchange southwest of Lansing east along I-96 and then north on I-496. From there, M-78 followed the <b>one-way</b> pairing of Homer and Howard streets from the northern end of the freeway up to the <b>one-way</b> couplet of Saginaw Street and Grand River Avenue, returning to its previous routing. The former route through downtown along US27 was redesignated Business M-78 (Bus. M-78) at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Since June 25, 2017, {{the first}} fare hike in three years, peak-period rail fares {{increased}} 10 cents, with $2.25 {{as the new}} minimum and $6 as the maximum <b>one-way</b> fare. Off-peak fares rose 25 cents, to $2 minimum, $3.85 maximum, as will bus fares. A new one-day unlimited rail/bus pass {{will be available for}} $14.75.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins as}} two <b>one-way</b> streets, Goodell Street (traveling west) and East Tupper Street (traveling east). Both {{intersect}} with NY5 (Ellicott Street) in Buffalo, {{from where they}} serve as a <b>one-way</b> couplet for three blocks before they merge to become the Kensington Expressway, a limited-access highway. It initially travels through dense urban areas {{by way of a}} cut, in which both roadways are separated only by a Jersey barrier. The expressway runs past the Buffalo Museum of Science, located at Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, and through the middle of Humboldt Parkway in Buffalo, where the Scajaquada Expressway (NY198) leaves at the former exit for Main Street. The section of the expressway between the Scajaquada and Harlem Road (NY240) just outside the city limit is the busiest on all of NY33, handling in excess of 100,000 vehicles per day in areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{impactor}} was maneuvered {{to plant}} itself {{in front of}} the comet, so that Tempel 1 would collide with it. Impact occurred at 05:45 UTC (05:52 Ground UTC, +/- up to three minutes, <b>one-way</b> light time = 7m 26s) on the morning of July 4, 2005, within one second of the expected time for impact.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} the road is <b>one-way</b> northbound {{and part of the}} A4, a major road through West London. From Piccadilly Circus northwards, it is numbered A4201, though in common with roads inside the London congestion charging zone, the number does not appear on signs.|$|E
5|$|The two routes remain {{concurrent}} as they snake to {{the northwest}} through Tompkins County. Southwest {{of the city of}} Ithaca in the town of Ithaca, NY34 and NY96 meet NY13. The three routes continue northeast through the town, intersecting NY327 and NY13A before crossing over the inlet of Cayuga Lake and entering the city of Ithaca on Meadow Street. Here, NY96B reconnects to its parent at the junction of Clinton and Meadow Streets. North of this point, Meadow Street splits into a <b>one-way</b> couplet, with Fulton Street carrying southbound traffic and Meadow Street handling northbound traffic. NY79, also routed on a <b>one-way</b> couplet here, crosses NY96 at Green and Seneca Streets, with NY79 eastbound using one block of Fulton Street to travel from State Street to Green Street.|$|E
5|$|The western {{section of}} the road {{is part of the}} A4 <b>one-way</b> system between Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square. No buses run along the full length of Coventry Street but there is access to {{numerous}} routes from Piccadilly Circus or nearby Charing Cross Road.|$|E
5|$|Vistara's Airbus A320-200s do {{not have}} {{in-flight}} entertainment screens installed and it provides pre-loaded tablets for its business-class fliers.

5|$|A Caversham bypass was {{constructed}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was officially opened in 1987. It now carries State Highway 1 away from the retail heart of the suburb, connecting at its northern end with the city's <b>one-way</b> street system. With {{the construction of the}} bypass, Caversham Valley Road was truncated close to its junction with South Road, and the upper stretch of the road continued as part of State Highway 1, connecting the bypass with Dunedin Southern Motorway.|$|E
5|$|Adrian {{previously}} converted their downtown {{streets to}} <b>one-way</b> traffic between 1950 and 1973. The traffic pattern created an unusual arrangement in the routings {{of the two}} state highways downtown. Southbound M-52 followed Winter Street, which also carried both eastbound and westbound directions of the US223 business loop. These streets carried both highways around the downtown business district in this arrangement until November 2009.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop Interstate 96 (BL I-96) is a {{business}} loop of I-96 through the city of Lansing. The western terminus is at I-96's exit90 northwest of Lansing in Watertown Township in Clinton County near the I-96/I-69 junction. From there, it follows Grand River Avenue under I-96. East of I-96, BL I-96 intersects Francis Road, which provides access to I-69, and then passes under I-69. Grand River Avenue is three lanes, one in each direction divided by a central turn lane, and runs past light industrial areas, crossing into Lansing and Eaton County near the Capital Region International Airport. The area around the airport is commercial, but east of there North Grand River Avenue runs through residential neighborhoods. Near the intersection with Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard, the business loop runs along the Grand River and then BL I-96 turns eastward on North Street to an interchange with Cedar and Larch streets. The business loop turns and splits onto the <b>one-way</b> pairing of the three-lane Cedar (southbound) and Larch (northbound). As it runs southward, the highway runs parallel to the Grand River through Old Town Lansing. At Oakland Avenue (westbound) and Saginaw Avenue (eastbound), BL I-96 intersects the two <b>one-way</b> streets that carry BL I-69. It continues south through {{the eastern edge of}} downtown Lansing.|$|E
5|$|Business Spur Interstate96 (BS I-96) was a {{business}} spur of I-96 in the Muskegon area. It was formerly the route of US16 from the carferry docks in Muskegon {{to the end of}} I-96 in Norton Shores. The spur ran concurrently with M-46 southeasterly from the docks along Mart Street and Sixth Street. At the intersections with the <b>one-way</b> pairing of Webster Avenue (southbound) and Muskegon Avenue (northbound) in downtown Muskegon, BS I-96 separated from M-46 and turned southward to follow Bus. US31 while M-46 turned northward along Bus. US31. From there, BS I-96/Bus. US31 ran southwesterly along the <b>one-way</b> pair for a few blocks before the two directions of traffic merged onto the north–south section of Seaway Drive southwest of downtown. The business route then ran due south along Seaway Drive, exiting Muskegon at Sherman Drive and crossing onto a section of the Norton Shores–Muskegon Heights city line. South of Norton Avenue, Seaway Drive turned eastward along the southern edge of Muskegon Heights. BS I-96/Bus. US31 ran along the northern edge of Mona Lake and crossed the Black Creek in Norton Shores. Southwest of the lake, the business route came to an end at the interchange along US31 that marked the western starting point of I-96.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, {{what would}} become DE 4 existed as a county road. The road from Stanton to Wilmington was paved four years later and the portion west of Stanton was paved by 1936. In 1936, work was {{underway}} to improve the road between Stanton and Newport by widening and resurfacing it, with completion a year later. In 1957, Maryland Avenue between Silview and Boxwood Road was widened to four lanes and the <b>one-way</b> pair along Market Street and Justis Street in Newport was established.|$|E
5|$|Greyhound Charter Services {{arranges}} charter buses {{for customers}} using Greyhound's fleet of motorcoaches. Unlike many smaller charter operators, Greyhound {{is able to}} operate nationwide and offer <b>one-way</b> services, due to its network of routes.
