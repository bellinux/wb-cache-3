5|$|Musical {{instrument}} classification is a discipline {{in its own}} right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, their material composition, their size, etc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses {{the means by which}} they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called <b>organology.</b>|$|E
2500|$|This {{subsection}} {{is traditionally}} called tuned percussion, however the corresponding term untuned percussion is avoided in modern <b>organology</b> {{in favour of}} the term unpitched percussion, so the [...] instruments of this subsection are similarly termed pitched percussion. All instruments of this subsection are pitched, and {{with the exception of}} the timpani, all pitched instruments of the percussion section are in this subsection.|$|E
2500|$|The view of most {{scholars}} (see <b>organology)</b> {{is that the}} term [...] "brass instrument" [...] should be defined {{by the way the}} sound is made, as above, and not by whether the instrument is actually made of brass. Thus one finds brass instruments made of wood, like the alphorn, the cornett, the serpent and the didgeridoo, while some woodwind instruments are made of brass, like the saxophone.|$|E
2500|$|Such aristocratic {{associations}} {{sealed the}} instrument's fate {{in the aftermath}} of the Russian Revolution: it was deemed insufficiently proletarian and was discouraged. A predecessor of the torban called the kobza (also known sometimes referred to as the bandura) was the instrument of the common folk. It differed from the torban by the absence of a second peg box at the end of the neck and the lack of bass strings, and was closely related in its <b>organology</b> to central European mandora and other instruments descending from the pandura (also see lute).|$|E
5000|$|Elementary <b>organology,</b> {{also known}} as {{physical}} <b>organology,</b> is a classification scheme based on the elements (i.e. states of matter) in which sound production takes place. [...] "Elementary" [...] refers both to [...] "element" [...] (state of matter) and to something that is fundamental or innate (physical). The elementary <b>organology</b> map {{can be traced to}} Kartomi, Schaeffner, Yamaguchi, and others, {{as well as to the}} Greek and Roman concepts of elementary classification of all objects, not just musical instruments.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Organology</b> (from Greek: [...] - organon, [...] "instrument" [...] and λόγος - logos, [...] "study") is {{the science}} of musical {{instruments}} and their classification. It embraces study of instruments' history, instruments used in different cultures, technical aspects of how instruments produce sound, and musical instrument classification. There is a degree of overlap between <b>organology,</b> ethnomusicology (being subsets of musicology) and the branch of the acoustics devoted to musical instruments.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{his early}} {{observations}} about the skull sizes and facial features of his classmates, Gall developed {{the theory of}} <b>Organology</b> and the method of Cranioscopy that would later be known as Phrenology. Gall's version of <b>Organology</b> states that the mind {{is a collection of}} independent entities housed within the brain. Cranioscopy is a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties {{on the basis of the}} external shape of the skull. During his lifetime, Gall collected and observed over 120 skulls in order to test his hypotheses.|$|E

50|$|Owing to {{the skills}} {{required}} of the player, the keyboard glockenspiel {{is placed in}} the keyboard section of the orchestra rather than the percussion section, and is similarly not regarded as a keyboard percussion instrument.
