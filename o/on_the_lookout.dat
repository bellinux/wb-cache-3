5|$|On April 6, 2007 at {{approximately}} 10 AM, Howard and Maureen Cotterman drove from Mexico to the Lukeville Port of Entry (POE). Upon arrival, the inspector checked the U.S. Customs and Border Protection electronic database {{and found a}} computer-generated alert, based upon Howard Cotterman's prior conviction for child sex crimes in 1992. The alert advised the inspector to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for child pornography and due to the warning, the Cottermans were sent to a secondary inspection area.|$|E
5|$|Hartebeest {{are remarkably}} alert and {{cautious}} animals with highly developed brains. Generally calm in nature, hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual stays <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for danger, often {{standing on a}} termite mound to see farther. At times of danger, the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.|$|E
5|$|In the {{moonlight}} of 3 October just before midnight Mansell was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for Spinola's galleys and were soon sighted. Mansell ordered an attack and off Dungeness; Moon, Samson and the Answer charged at the galleys. Spinola seeing this decided to swing his galleys round {{to face the}} South East, {{the direction of the}} Flanders coast but in so doing the lead ship San Felipe (St. Philip) ran straight into the Victory and Hope forcing the galleys inadvertently further East.|$|E
60|$|The {{order to}} sail was evidently an {{important}} one, for scarcely was the Shohirika {{out of sight}} of land than all steam was crowded <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lookouts</b> were also doubled, and when night came the strictest watch possible was maintained.|$|R
5000|$|The boat's RLS [...] "Albatross" [...] {{radar set}} {{had been used}} at full power {{throughout}} the day for the missile launches and now needed maintenance, which required that it be placed in [...] "hot standby." [...] The captain gave permission for the radar to be secured, and relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookouts</b> to spot any hazards.|$|R
50|$|Big Walker Lookout hosts {{traditional}} arts demonstrations <b>on</b> weekends. <b>The</b> <b>lookout</b> {{tower is}} open to the public, and the cost to climb the tower is $6 for adults and $4 for children.|$|R
5|$|Stone {{had fallen}} ill with {{appendicitis}} {{during the previous}} leg of the voyage; he was hospitalised in Dakar and took no further part in the adventure. Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water, but Girl Pats arrival {{attracted the attention of}} the local Lloyd's agent, who had been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for the vessel. On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the log book, where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies. Orsborne was asked to present the ship's papers at the British consulate but, on the pretext that he needed to test the engines, he rapidly put to sea. The appearance of Girl Pat in Dakar—the first confirmation since Corcubión that the vessel was still afloat—was widely reported. Relatives of the crew members were relieved that those aboard were safe but were apprehensive about what might lie ahead.|$|E
5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, who was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At {{the meeting of the}} railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case}} of stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, the leafy sea dragon sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents. Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two.|$|E
5|$|September 9, 2007– Tropical Storm Gabrielle moves ashore <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cape <b>Lookout</b> National Seashore, {{producing}} locally {{heavy rainfall}} but causing little damage.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lookout</b> {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places on July 14, 1987, and is also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> National Historic <b>Lookout</b> Register.|$|R
50|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> 13 May <b>Lookout</b> sighted a {{small boat}} 10 miles {{north-east}} of Plane Island. Thirteen Germans and one Italian were captured. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> 22 May <b>Lookout</b> made radar contact with Italian auxiliary transport Stella Maris. Lookout fired 24 rounds of 4.7 inch and along with Laforey, successfully sank <b>the</b> Italian vessel. <b>Lookout</b> then covered Laforey as she picked up survivors.|$|R

25|$|Visitors are cautioned to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for prairie rattlesnakes, which {{frequent}} the site. Visitors {{are asked}} to wear heavy hiking boots, watch small children closely, and keep pets on a leash.|$|E
25|$|In {{most parts}} of the country, squalls are called subasko and are {{characterized}} by heavy rains driven by blustery winds. Local fishermen at sea are often <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for signs of impending squalls on the open water and rush to shore at its early signs.|$|E
50|$|The Corolla Wild Horses Protection Act (H.R. 126;113th Congress), if passed, {{would take}} wild horses from herds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cape <b>Lookout</b> National Seashore and {{introduced}} {{them to the}} herds in the Currituck National Wildlife Refuge {{in order to ensure}} genetic viability.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first attack <b>on</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>lookouts</b> came in <b>the</b> {{civil war}} stage, on December 16, 1947, when local Bedouin {{attacked}} a vehicle between Halutza and Revivim. The British {{forces in the}} area refused to intervene.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the final leg, teams flew to Honolulu, Hawaii, but were {{required}} to book their flights at a travel agency before proceeding to the airport. Once in Hawaii, they then drove to Puu Ualakaa State Park and found their next clue <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marked <b>lookout</b> point.|$|R
25|$|As a {{businessman}} always <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for new business opportunities {{and concerned about}} the economic situation of his country, Álvaro Noboa announced his decision in October 2009 to search for new international markets for his products, organizing meetings with foreign investors to bring about new deals.|$|E
25|$|Farley Boats {{were high}} quality boats and built to last. However, {{because of high}} {{frequency}} of hurricanes {{and the fact that}} no new models have been built in 40 years, there are very few remaining Farley Boats. Historians, anglers and boat builders are always <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for Farley Boats.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, about 300 {{officers}} and agents from city, county, state, {{and federal agencies}} responded to the active-shooter event, converging on the scene as people were being evacuated. The FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department counter-terrorism unit were called in to assist. Police were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for a black SUV used by the perpetrators to flee the scene.|$|E
50|$|Public {{access to}} <b>the</b> park focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Point <b>Lookout</b> area, at 1563 m above sea level, from where {{on a clear}} day the Tasman Sea is visible.

25|$|In {{subsequent}} years {{conditions at the}} MCG improved but the ever-ambitious Melburnians were always <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for {{more than the usual}} diet of club and inter-colonial games. In 1861, Felix William Spiers and Christopher Pond, the proprietors of the Cafe de Paris in Bourke Street and caterers to the MCC, sent their agent, W.B. Mallam, to England to arrange for a cricket team to visit Australia.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, Zazi {{flew back}} to Denver. FBI agents searched several homes in New York on September 14, and found his {{fingerprints}} on an electronic scale and several AA batteries at the home he had stayed at in Queens, {{as well as a}} dozen black backpacks. An alert was issued to American law enforcement officials to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for hydrogen peroxide-based bombs.|$|E
25|$|Twenty {{hours after}} Myrons sinking, Captain Jordon of the steamer W.C. Franz was upbound {{out of the}} Soo Locks and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for {{survivors}} when he sighted a body moving on wreckage near Ile Parisienne. Captain Jordon launched a lifeboat and rescued a half-dead Captain Neal {{from the roof of}} Myrons pilothouse. Captain Neal's clothing was frozen to his body and his hands were so swollen that 2 finger rings were not visible but he survived.|$|E
5000|$|The bitumen [...] "Castle Hill Road" [...] winds for 2.6 {{kilometres}} {{from the}} northeast slopes to the summit of <b>the</b> second peak, <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> Hynes <b>Lookout</b> platform has been erected.|$|R
50|$|The skyline may be {{observed}} {{from one of}} two <b>lookouts</b> <b>on</b> Mount Royal. <b>The</b> <b>lookout</b> at <b>the</b> Belvedere takes in downtown, the river, and <b>the</b> Monteregian Hills. <b>On</b> clear days <b>the</b> Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York are visible, as are the Green Mountains of Vermont. <b>The</b> eastern <b>lookout</b> has a view of The Plateau neighbourhood, Olympic Stadium and beyond.|$|R
5000|$|Sound-powered {{telephones}} {{are widely}} used on naval vessels. A typical example on a U.S. Navy ship is the [...] "JL" [...] circuit which is used by <b>the</b> <b>lookouts</b> to report visual contacts to the pilot house and the Combat Information Center (CIC). In this case there would be five stations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> circuit (stern <b>lookout,</b> port lookout, starboard lookout, pilot house and CIC).|$|R
25|$|The {{league is}} {{continually}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for college-quality baseball fields for each team to permanently call home. There {{are plenty of}} fields that can host a weekend here or there, but very few have enough summer schedule flexibility to accommodate a 37-game season. Most college facilities have summer camps or youth tournaments that would conflict with LCBL games. One potential solution {{is the creation of}} a new baseball-only four-field complex in St. Louis, though no plans are currently in the works.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of the Black Gate {{was filmed}} in April at the Rangipo Desert, a former minefield. New Zealand {{soldiers}} were hired as extras while guides were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for unexploded mines. Also {{a cause for}} concern were Monaghan and Boyd's scale doubles during a charge sequence. In the meantime, Wood, Astin and Serkis filmed at Mount Ruapehu for the Mount Doom exteriors. In particular, they spent two hours shooting Sam lifting Frodo on to his back with cross-camera coverage.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{testimony}} {{indicated that}} Detective Scott inquired of a railroad engineer named Rush, where {{would be the}} worst place for a train wreck. Rush pointed out the high bridge where, if a rail was pulled, the train would crash three or four hundred feet down an embankment, killing or injuring all on the train. Scott told Rush to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for damaged track that night at that spot. Later that evening Rush stopped his train, walked ahead on the track and discovered that spikes had been pulled.|$|E
