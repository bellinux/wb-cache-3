30|$|Plant growth-promoting (PGP) {{microbes}} are rhizosphere associated {{organisms that}} colonize the rhizosphere and rhizoplane and improve plant growth when artificially inoculated onto the seeds or into soil. PGP microbes may promote plant growth either by direct stimulation such as iron chelation, phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation and phytohormone production or by indirect stimulation such as suppression of plant pathogens and induction of resistance in host plants against pathogens (Basak and Biswas 2009; Hao et al. 2011; Panhwar et al. 2012). The opportunities of PGP microbes include alternating applications of PGP microbes as bio-fungicides with <b>inorganic</b> <b>fungicides</b> to manage fungicide resistance {{and to reduce}} the number of fungicide applications per year. PGP microbes also plays an important role in integrated nutrient management programs with a goal of reducing run-off of unused fertilizers and the environment damage that results (Kloepper 2009; Gopalakrishnan et al. 2013 a).|$|R
