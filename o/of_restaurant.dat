5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths <b>of</b> <b>restaurant</b> cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books {{paved the way for}} other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, other {{similarly}} green-capped species {{collected by}} mushroom hunters include various green-hued brittlegills {{of the genus}} Russula and the formerly popular Tricholoma equestre, now regarded as hazardous owing to a series <b>of</b> <b>restaurant</b> poisonings in France. Brittlegills, such as Russula heterophylla, R.aeruginea, and R.virescens, can be distinguished by their brittle flesh {{and the lack of}} both volva and ring. Other similar species include A.subjunquillea in eastern Asia and A.arocheae, which ranges from Andean Colombia north {{at least as far as}} central Mexico, both of which are also poisonous.|$|E
5|$|A similar issue again {{arose in}} 2009 when Burger King {{diverted}} {{several million dollars}} of advertising rebates paid to its American franchises by Coca Cola Corporation and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group to its own coffers. The company intended to utilize these funds to increase its advertising presence in the United States {{at a time when}} corporate advertising costs were falling, which would allow an increased media presence of approximately 25% from the previous year (2008). The NFA contended that Burger King Corporation improperly redirected 40% <b>of</b> <b>restaurant</b> operating funds (ROF) paid by the two beverage suppliers to franchises since 1990 into the corporate advertising budget. These funds were often used by the franchises to pay for beverage support systems such as filtration units and local marketing, and diversion of the funds would cost franchises at least $65 million (USD) between 2010-2012. These funds often helped the franchises' bottom lines, as they were often used to offset other costs imposed on the franchises by Burger King, such as the $1 (USD) Double Cheeseburger.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, the {{executive}} board of the state railways wanted to centralise the operation <b>of</b> <b>restaurant</b> carriages {{and the most important}} station restaurants in Norway under one management. The board stated that they wanted to minimise the conflict of interest between the railway company and the dining-car operator. They also saw centralising operations as a way to allocate a larger share of the revenue to the railway company, and to ensure a high quality of service on new lines. At that time the Sørland Line and Dovre Line were in the planning stages, and the NSB intended to introduce dining services on these when they opened. Oslo East Station and its restaurant were operated by the private Norwegian Trunk Railway. In an agreement signed on 18 September 1918 both railway companies agreed that a new restaurant operator would be controlled by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, but this company had to abide by the NSB's decision of how many restaurant carriages to operate on any line.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large pipe wrench. The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe wrench, trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise <b>of</b> <b>restaurant</b> guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's {{departure}} from the company for soft drinks producer PepsiCo in 1980, the company began to see a system-wide decline in sales. Pillsbury executive vice president <b>of</b> <b>restaurant</b> operations Norman E. Brinker was tasked with turning the brand around and strengthening its position against its main rival, McDonald's. One of his first acts was to initiate an advertising plan emphasizing claims that Burger King's flame-broiled burgers were better and larger than its rival's. The program, arguably the first attack ads on a food chain by a competitor, was controversial in that before it fast food ads only made allusions to the competition without ever mentioning them by name. McDonald's sued Burger King, their ad agency at the time J. Walter Thompson. The child actress Sarah Michelle Gellar was also implicated in the lawsuit because of her appearance in these television commercials. The suit was settled the following year on undisclosed terms. Despite the controversy, the ad plan, dubbed the Burger Wars, boosted same store sales. Brinker continued working for the company in this capacity until 1982 when {{he was promoted to}} president of Pillsbury's food service division, which included the company's other chains beyond Burger King. Brinker left the company in 1984 to take the helm at Dallas-based gourmet burger chain Chili's.|$|E

5|$|From the 1854 {{establishment}} of railways in Norway to 1909, no dining service was offered aboard trains; passengers {{were allowed to}} bring food with them. Train stations also lacked dining facilities. The first dining service was started by restaurateur Carl Christiansen. He established the restaurant at Drammen Station, and in 1907 was asked by NSB to establish a dining service aboard the express trains on the Bergen Line, which would open in 1909. After investigating similar operations in England and Germany, he ordered two carriages from Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk. These were {{to be paid for}} by the state, but the Parliament of Norway delayed the grants after a long debate regarding the suitability <b>of</b> <b>restaurant</b> carriages on trains. The plans were opposed by the teetotaler faction of Parliament, but there was a majority in favor of dining service. To get the carriages in time, Christiansen personally guaranteed the production cost in case a state grant was not allocated. After the parliamentary decision, the cost of the carriages was refunded by NSB. In 1910, when President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt visited Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, several restaurant carriages were ordered solely for the occasion. Two years later, restaurant carriages were put in regular service on the Østfold Line.|$|E

The idea was continued after the Exposition by the Brasserie de l'Espérance on the Rue Champollion on the Left Bank, and was soon imitated by others. By 1890, there were forty-two brasseries on the Left Bank, with names including the Brasserie des Amours, the Brasserie de la Vestale, the Brasserie des Belles Marocaines, and the Brasserie des Excentriques Polonais (brasserie of the eccentric Poles), and they were often used {{as a place to}} meet prostitutes.|$|E
