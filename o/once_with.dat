5|$|After {{debating whether}} {{abolition}} of slavery would best proceed gradually or at <b>once,</b> <b>with</b> compensation to loyal Union men or without, the Convention resolved to abolish slavery immediately without compensation on April 10, 1864. It abolished the viva voce voting {{and called for}} secret balloting for electing state officials. Immediately on its proclamation, the Constitution of 1864 was enforceable only in areas under Union control, but it would serve as Virginia's fundamental law until the Constitution of 1870 went into force.|$|E
5|$|At Spencer's Island, Mary Celeste and her lost crew are commemorated by a {{monument}} {{at the site}} of the brigantine's construction and by a memorial outdoor cinema built in the shape of the vessel's hull. Postage stamps commemorating the incident have been issued by Gibraltar (twice) and by the Maldives (twice, <b>once</b> <b>with</b> the name of the ship misspelt as Marie Celeste).|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} {{had no choice}} but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at a meeting at the Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods could no longer be subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and factory occupations began at <b>once,</b> <b>with</b> the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E

50|$|It {{is to the}} {{vestibular}} ligaments (vestibular folds <b>once</b> covered <b>with</b> mucous membrane) {{what the}} rima glottidis is to the vocal ligaments (vocal folds <b>once</b> covered <b>with</b> mucous membrane) - the space formed when the folds are separated.

5|$|Despite {{the declining}} {{prevalence}} of marriage, {{more than three-quarters}} of Americans will marry at least once in their lifetime. The average age for marriage for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to remarry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages were remarriages. All together one can conclude that while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most Americans (the average Joe) will get married and divorced <b>once</b> <b>with</b> a considerable number of Americans remarrying at least once.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgerald {{holds the}} record for the most wins in this category, with four. Diane Schuur is the only other artist to receive the award more than <b>once,</b> <b>with</b> two {{consecutive}} wins.

5|$|In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the Green Knight appears before Arthur's court {{during a}} Christmas feast, holding a bough of holly {{in one hand}} and a battle axe in the other. Despite {{disclaim}} of war, the knight issues a challenge: he will allow one man to strike him <b>once</b> <b>with</b> his axe, with the condition that he return the blow the next year. At first, Arthur accepts the challenge, but Gawain takes his place and decapitates the Green Knight, who retrieves his head, reattaches it and tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel at the stipulated time.|$|E
5|$|In {{competitions}} using two-legged matches, {{each team}} competes at home <b>once,</b> <b>with</b> an aggregate score {{from the two}} matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule {{may be used to}} determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.|$|E

5|$|Plymouth Argyle won {{the match}} 10 {{thanks to a}} headed goal from Ronnie Mauge to gain {{promotion}} back to the third tier of English football one season after being relegated. For the club's manager, Neil Warnock, it was his fourth success in the play-offs as a manager, having achieved it twice with Notts County and <b>once</b> <b>with</b> Huddersfield Town. His counterpart, Jim Platt, would leave full-time management {{at the end of}} that year.|$|E
5|$|Rowson cites as {{an example}} of the last {{phenomenon}} the well-regarded Zaitsev Variation of the Ruy Lopez. After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d6 9.h3 Bb7 10.d4 Re8 (initiating the Zaitsev Variation), White can repeat moves <b>once</b> <b>with</b> 11.Ng5 Rf8 12.Nf3. This puts Black in an awkward situation, since he must either (a) insist on the Zaitsev with 12...Re8, which allows White to choose whether to draw by threefold repetition with 13.Ng5 Rf8 14.Nf3, or play on with a different move, or (b) play a different (and possibly inferior) variation by playing something other than 12...Re8.|$|E

5|$|The king grows only {{slightly}} larger after initial mating {{and continues to}} mate with the queen for life (a termite queen can live between 30 to 50years); this {{is very different from}} ant colonies, in which a queen mates <b>once</b> <b>with</b> the male(s) and stores the gametes for life, as the male ants die shortly after mating. If a queen is absent, a termite king produces pheromones which encourage the development of replacement termite queens. As the queen and king are monogamous, sperm competition does not occur.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Celtic found {{themselves}} drawn with AC Milan, Ajax and again Barcelona {{in the group}} stage. The campaign was dismal, winning only <b>once</b> <b>with</b> a 21 home win over Ajax, and slumping to a 61 rout away against Barcelona in the final group match. That game saw Celtic concede the most goals they had ever done in a single European tie, and equalled their previous heaviest defeat in Europe, a 5–0 loss to Artmedia Bratislava.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech- The Georgia Tech – Virginia Tech (V.P.I. – Virginia Polytechnic Institute) rivalry {{has grown}} {{considerably}} since Virginia Tech entered the ACC.

Since the ACC switched to Division format in 2005, the winner of this game has gone on to win the Coastal Division all but <b>once,</b> <b>with</b> VT winning six times and GT winning four times. Dubbed the Battle of the Techs, the game has seen some very close, very intense match-ups.|$|E
