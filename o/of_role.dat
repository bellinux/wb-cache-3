5|$|In the 1880s, Alfred Comyn Lyall, an {{administrator}} of the British Raj who also studied history, revisited Tod's classification and asserted that the Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties played some sort <b>of</b> <b>role</b> {{in the relationship between}} princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to a tribal basis, Lyall was able to deny the possibility that the Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory that European nations had followed, thereby forestalling any need to consider that they might evolve into sovereign states. There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.|$|E

5|$|Looking for a {{near term}} solution, McNamara once again turned to ARPA, asking it to {{consider}} the Zeus system in depth. The agency returned a new report in April 1962 that contained four basic concepts. First was the Zeus system in its current form, outlining what sort <b>of</b> <b>role</b> it might play in various war fighting scenarios. Zeus could, for instance, be used to protect SAC bases, thereby requiring the Soviets to expend more of their ICBMs to attack the bases. This would presumably mean less damage to other targets. Another considered the addition of new passive electronically scanned array radars and computers to the Zeus, which would allow it to attack dozens of targets at once over a wider area. Finally, in its last concept, ARPA replaced Zeus with a new very high speed, short range missile designed to intercept the warhead at altitudes as low as , by which time any decoys or fireballs would be long gone. This last concept became Nike-X, an ad hoc name suggested by Jack Ruina while describing the ARPA report to PSAC.|$|E
5|$|Swords and Sorcery is {{presented}} in a first person top-down perspective and contains elements of dungeon crawling, a common trait <b>of</b> <b>role</b> playing video games. The game {{is set in a}} fictional land called Zob, in which he main objective is to explore its catacombs and discover a large wealth of treasure, alongside collecting seven pieces of sacred Zob armour. The game begins with allowing the player to choose their player-character; the default protagonist is called Flubbit the Dull, however there is an option to allow the player to create and personalise their own character. Once a character has been created, a 14 in-game day training scheme will commence which gives the player an opportunity to improve their abilities such as lock picking, sword fighting and thieving. An in-game armoury is also accessible at any time, which includes utilities such as body armour and various weaponry. The form of currency in the game is dragon's teeth, which can be used to purchase items and equipment.|$|E

40|$|Devising a {{complete}} and correct set <b>of</b> <b>roles</b> has been {{recognized as one of}} the most important and challenging tasks in implementing role based access control. A key problem related to this is the notion of goodness- when is a set <b>of</b> <b>roles</b> good? Recently, the role mining problem (RMP) has been defined as the problem of discovering an optimal set <b>of</b> <b>roles</b> from existing user permissions. Several different objectives for optimality have been proposed. However, one problem with these definitions is that often organizations already have a deployed set <b>of</b> <b>roles</b> and wish to optimize this set. Even if an optimal set <b>of</b> <b>roles</b> is discovered, if this is widely different, it is impossible to simply throw out the deployed roles and start using the new ones as this may disrupt organizational processes and separation of duty constraints that are defined on roles. Essentially, what is missing is taking role migration cost into account when defining optimality, which would allow us to come up with the best suited set <b>of</b> <b>roles.</b> In this paper, we define a fundamentally different Role Mining Problem that takes the problem <b>of</b> deployed <b>roles</b> into account. We define the Minimal Perturbation RMP as the problem of discovering an optimal set <b>of</b> <b>roles</b> from existing user permissions that are similar to the currently deployed roles. In order to do this, we discuss the concept <b>of</b> similarity <b>of</b> <b>roles</b> and propose suitable definitions. Solutions also need to be parameterized to set relative weight of similarity and minimality to find the optimal set. We propose a heuristic solution based on the previously developed FastMiner algorithm that meets these requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm through our experimental results. Portions of this work were supported by award CNS...|$|R

In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} a new {{approach}} for the definition of context-based behavioural substitutability and refinement <b>of</b> <b>roles</b> in MAS, and provide a formal framework for modeling roles together with their composition.

The proposed compatibility relations take into account the property preservation such as the completion and the proper termination <b>of</b> <b>roles.</b> Then, our formal framework is enhanced with the definition of two flexible behavioral subtyping relations related to the principle of substitutability. We show the existing link between compatibility and substitutability <b>of</b> <b>roles,</b> and namely the preservation of the proposed compatibility relations by substitutability. Finally, we study the action as well as the state-based refinements <b>of</b> <b>roles</b> and investigate the links between the substitutability and the refinements <b>of</b> <b>roles.</b> We show that the proposed roles behavioural substitutability relations are preserved under the roles refinement. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we generalize and merge two models <b>of</b> <b>roles</b> used in multiagent systems which address {{complementary}} aspects: enacting roles and communication among roles {{in an organization}} or institution. We do this by proposing a metamodel <b>of</b> <b>roles</b> and specializing the metamodel to fit the two existing models. We show how the two approaches can be integrated since they deal with complementary aspects: roles in organizations are used to specify interactions among agents, and, thus, they emphasize the public character <b>of</b> <b>roles.</b> Role enactment focuses instead on how roles are played, and thus it emphasizes the private aspects of roles: how the beliefs and goals <b>of</b> the <b>roles</b> can become the beliefs and goals of their players. The former approach focuses on the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>roles</b> in function <b>of</b> the communication process. The latter approach focuses on the internal dynamics of the agents when they start playing a role or shift the role they are currently playing. ...|$|R
