40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the concept}} of a σ-locally {{countable}} mapping is introduced, by which the relations between metric spaces and spaces with σ-locally countable networks, <b>or</b> <b>spaces</b> with σ-locally countable k-networks, <b>or</b> <b>spaces</b> with σ-locally countable cs-networks, <b>or</b> <b>spaces</b> with σ-locally count-able bases are established...|$|R

For instance, we have the b-metric space, quasi-metric space, quasi-b-metric space, dislocated metric <b>space</b> (<b>or</b> metric-like <b>space),</b> dislocated b-metric <b>space</b> (<b>or</b> b-metric-like <b>space),</b> dislocated quasi-metric <b>space</b> (<b>or</b> quasi-metric-like <b>space),</b> and the dislocated quasi-b-metric <b>space</b> (<b>or</b> quasi-b-metric-like <b>space)</b> (see [3, 5, 9 – 11, 13 – 18]).

5|$|Innis {{examined}} {{the rise and}} fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time <b>or</b> <b>space</b> affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E
5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the {{technique}} of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates {{the illusion of a}} flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time <b>or</b> <b>space.</b> In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E
5|$|There exist data {{structures}} that may improve on binary search {{in some cases}} for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. However, while these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys, such data structures are usually only faster because they exploit the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time <b>or</b> <b>space</b> consuming for keys that lack that attribute. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, {{use a combination of}} approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.|$|E
