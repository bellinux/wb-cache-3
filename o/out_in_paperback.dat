500|$|In {{a review}} of the book What Mad Universe (1949), Paul Di Filippo of Sci Fi Weekly posited that the book's author Fredric Brown may have been {{influenced}} by Hubbard's story. Umberto Rossi wrote in The Twisted Worlds of Philip K. Dick (2011) that writer Philip K. Dick was likely influenced by Typewriter in the Sky. Rossi noted Typewriter in the Sky came <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a <b>paperback</b> format <b>in</b> 1951, and a year later Dick succeeded in getting his first short story, the tale [...] "Beyond Lies the Wub" [...] published. Rossi said Typewriter in the Sky was [...] "the text that admittedly inspired" [...] The Cosmic Puppets (1957) by Philip K. Dick. In the book Harlan Ellison's Watching (1989), by Harlan Ellison, Typewriter in the Sky is compared to Purple Rose of Cairo, [...] "I bet if L. Ron Hubbard had written Purple Rose of Cairo they'd have given it a Hugo ... I mean, it is sort of a hip, updated version of Typewriter in the Sky."

Elaborating in 2010, he said, [...] I put together a memo for publisher Martin Goodman saying why we should a character. ... I hadnt {{read a lot of}} Howard, I bought a couple of the books for the Frazetta covers but Id never really read them. When Goodman gave us permission to license a character, we figured we couldnt afford Conan..... By that time, thered been about half-a-decade of Conan coming <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Lancer <b>paperbacks,</b> so we figured no sense going after that, there was no way {{we were going to get}} it. I knew Lin Carter slightly, who had authored a character called Thongor, who was half Conan and half John Carter of Mars.... Lin was great, but his agent kept wanting us to offer more money than the $150 per issue that Martin Goodman had magnanimously said we could pay for rights.|$|R

5000|$|In 2011, Phillips {{directed}} and presented the documentary [...] "Burma Boy", for Al Jazeera's Correspondent series. The documentary, tracing the extraordinary {{life of a}} Nigerian veteran of a Burma campaign, Isaac Fadoyebo, won a CINE Golden Eagle Award in 2012. His book, 'Another Man's War', published in 2014, tells the same story, and also examines the British legacy in Nigeria and Burma. It tells the dramatic story of the survival of Isaac Fadoyebo, a Nigerian soldier {{who was part of}} the forgotten African army that fought in Burma for the British in the Second World War. 'Another Man's War' was described by the Daily Telegraph as a 'profoundly moving' book that 'ranks alongside such classics of wartime literature as The Great Escape and Darkness Be My Friend'. The Spectator said it was 'an extraordinary story, very well told'. NPR in the United States described it as 'riveting' and chose it as 'one of the Best Books of 2014'. The Times Literary Supplement said it was 'impressive........a gripping military history which brings African witnesses to the dying days of the British Empire out of the shadows'.'Another Man's War' came <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>paperback</b> in June 2015.

40|$|When J. R. R. Tolkien’s trilogy The Lord of the Rings was {{published}} in Swedish 1959 - 1961, the translation by Åke Ohlmarks was considered by most critics to be excellent. According to Ohlmarks, even J. R. R. Tolkien himself and his son Christopher were very pleased with it, which Ohlmarks was told by Christopher when he met him in 1975. This is, however, contradicted in the authorised biography of Tolkien by Carpenter (1978), in which Tolkien {{is said to have}} been most negative towards the way Ohlmarks handled the text. Before the biography {{was published}}, Christopher Tolkien and Ohlmarks had become bitter enemies, which might explain the re-evaluation. The schism has been described by Ohlmarks in his book Tolkiens arv (1978). But ever since The Lord of the Rings came <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>paperback</b> in 1971 there has been a discussion about the translation quality also in Sweden. When I first read the books in English I had the Swedish translation beside me. I soon discovered that Ohlmarks had taken great liberties with the text. I noticed that the descriptions were often more detailed in the Swedish translation than in the original and it was this fact that first roused my interest. Therefore, I decided to try to make a translation quality assessment of a part of the text, using a model by Juliane House...|$|E

40|$|We {{were delighted}} {{to come across}} a piece by Friend of the Blog Michael Meyer (called “About That Book Advance…“) in last week’s New York Times Sunday Book Review section. We figured, based on the author’s track record as a writer (and the insightfulness of his {{comments}} when talking about his work), that this piece would be lively and offer some illumination on an interesting topic and that it might also have some China tidbits. Well, {{it was not just}} illuminating (explaining how tough it can be for an author to live on what sounds at first like a very good advance, once the agent’s cut and self-employment taxes come into play) but also entertaining (a favorite part: how in literary circles advance amounts are sometimes “coyly described like cigarette brands — the ‘mid-fives,’ the ‘low sixes,’ the ‘mild sevens 2 ̆ 7 ”). But as for China tidbits… there were only two. We learned how much of an advance Meyer got for his book, The Last Days of Old Beijing (as in the spirit of disclosure he tells us precisely: 50, 000), and even better we learned that his book will be coming <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>paperback</b> next month (take note all those in book groups, as it would work nicely in that setting). What kind of advance, you may be wondering, did we receive for China in 2008 ? Rather than tell you a number, let’s just say it was in the “barely fours”–so barely that with just a dollar taken away, {{it would have been a}} three figure advance (albeit one of the “mighty threes”). Of course, Rowman 2 ̆ 6 Littlefield basically doubled their up-front lay-out by giving each of our contributors a free copy. After reading the piece, some of us had two thoughts. First, that academics trying their hand at writing for general audiences are lucky to have day jobs to cover the bills. And, second, that it would be nice if the New York Times Sunday Book Reviewsection editors liked Meyer’s essay as much as we did, in which case they might commission a sequel, in this case demystifying the high amounts paid for translation rights. A good starting point might be that famous 100, 000 reportedly offered to bring out the English language version of a certain Cry of the Wild with Chinese characteristics, boy meet wolf tale that was criticized andcelebrated by different China Beat contributors last year (and incidentally inadvertently helped China Beat earn its first mention in the New York Times’excellent “Paper Cuts” book blog) ...|$|E
