In his <b>own</b> <b>day</b> he was the world's most famous geographer but, in addition, he had interests in theology, philosophy, history, mathematics and magnetism as well as being an accomplished engraver, calligrapher and maker of globes and scientific instruments.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medieval}} Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, {{but as an}} educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or {{completely}} dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his <b>own</b> <b>day,</b> even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.|$|E

25|$|In Thackeray's <b>own</b> <b>day</b> some commentators, such as Anthony Trollope, ranked his History of Henry Esmond as his {{greatest}} work, {{perhaps because it}} expressed Victorian values of duty and earnestness, as did some of his other later novels. It is perhaps {{for this reason that}} they have not survived as well as Vanity Fair, which satirises those values.|$|E

25|$|Her novels, voluminous and frequent, are now {{regarded}} as stylistically innovative and important transitions from the erotic seduction novels and poetry of Aphra Behn (particularly Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister (1684)) and the straightforward, plainly spoken novel of Frances Burney. In her <b>own</b> <b>day,</b> her plays and political writing attracted the most comment and attention, and thus {{she was a}} full player in the difficult public sphere, but today her novels carry the most interest and demonstrate the most significant innovation.|$|E
25|$|The Wealth of Nations was a {{precursor}} to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his <b>own</b> <b>day</b> and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by Tory writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests. In 2005, The Wealth of Nations was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time. Former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it is said, used to carry {{a copy of the}} book in her handbag.|$|E

25|$|Smith {{laid the}} {{foundations}} of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his <b>own</b> <b>day</b> and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by Tory writers in the moralising tradition of William Hogarth and Jonathan Swift. In 2005, The Wealth of Nations was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time. The minor planet 12838Adamsmith was named in his memory.|$|E
25|$|One {{especially}} difficult aspect of Hegel's work is his innovation in logic. In response to Immanuel Kant's {{challenge to the}} limits of pure reason, Hegel develops a radically new form of logic, which he called speculative. The difficulty in reading Hegel was perceived in Hegel's <b>own</b> <b>day,</b> and persists into the 21st century. To understand Hegel fully requires paying attention to his critique of standard logic, such as the law of contradiction and the law of the excluded middle. Many philosophers who came after Hegel and were influenced by him, whether adopting or rejecting his ideas, did so without fully absorbing his new speculative or dialectical logic.|$|E
25|$|The {{main focus}} of the Nong Shu written by Wang was the realm of Chinese agriculture. His book listed and {{described}} an enormous catalogue of agricultural tools and implements {{used in the past}} and in his <b>own</b> <b>day.</b> Furthermore, Wang incorporated a systematic usage of illustrated pictures in his book to accompany every piece of farming equipment described. Wang also created an agricultural calendrical diagram {{in the form of a}} circle, which included the Heavenly Stems, the Earthly Branches, the four seasons, twelve months, twenty-four solar terms, seventy-two five-day periods, with each sequence of agricultural tasks and the natural phenomena which signal for their necessity, stellar configurations, phenology, and the sequence of agricultural production.|$|E

25|$|The Young King's {{contemporary}} reputation, however, was by {{no means}} so negative. This {{had much to do with}} his place in the enthusiastic tournament culture of his <b>own</b> <b>day.</b> We can see this from his appearances in the History of William Marshal, the biography of the knight assigned to him as a tutor in 1170, and who became his tournament team leader until 1182. The History depicts him as constantly moving from one tournament to another across northern and central France between 1175 and 1182. With his cousins, Philip, Count of Flanders, and Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut, Flanders and Namur, he was one of the key patrons of the sport. He is said to have spent over £200 a day on the great retinue of knights he brought to the tournament of Lagny-sur-Marne in November 1179.|$|E
25|$|Chad {{was invited}} then to become {{bishop of the}} Northumbrians by King Oswiu. Chad is often listed as a Bishop of York. Bede {{generally}} uses ethnic, not geographical, designations for Chad and other early Anglo-Saxon bishops. However at this point, he does also refer to Oswiu's desire that Chad become bishop {{of the church in}} York. York later became the diocesan city partly because it had already been designated as such in the earlier Roman-sponsored mission of Paulinus to Deira, so {{it is not clear whether}} Bede is simply echoing the practice of his <b>own</b> <b>day,</b> or whether Oswiu and Chad were considering a territorial basis and a see for his episcopate. It is quite clear that Oswiu intended Chad to be bishop over the entire Northumbrian people, over-riding the claims of both Wilfrid and Eata.|$|E
25|$|No Christian tradition, {{other than}} some Syriac ones, has ever adopted a {{harmonized}} Gospel text {{for use in}} its liturgy. However, in many traditions, {{it was not unusual}} for subsequent Christian generations to seek to provide paraphrased Gospel versions in language closer to the vernacular of their <b>own</b> <b>day.</b> Frequently such versions have been constructed as Gospel harmonies, sometimes taking Tatian's Diatessaron as an exemplar; other times proceeding independently. Hence from the Syriac Diatessaron text was derived an 11th-century Arabic harmony (the source for the published versions of the Diatessaron in English); and a 13th-century Persian harmony. The Arabic harmony preserves Tatian's sequence exactly, but uses a source text corrected in most places to that of the standard Syriac Peshitta Gospels; the Persian harmony differs greatly in sequence, but translates a Syriac text that is rather closer to that in Ephrem's commentary.|$|E

25|$|The king {{not only}} took a leading part in ritual, but ritual {{is likely to}} have focused on his office as well. The {{erection}} of stelae showing the king and dedicated to the day 'King' (Ahaw), which concluded intervals of five 360-day years, constituted a royal ritual by itself. It appears to implicate the king as the divine lord of his <b>own</b> <b>day.</b> Inversely, at San Bartolo, the divine hero of the day 'King', Hunahpu, substitutes for the real king. Setting up a stela may additionally have involved the notion of the king as a protective 'tree of life'. Moreover, in the Classic period, the king is commonly depicted holding a cosmic serpent from whose jaws deities (often those of rain, lightning and fire) emerge; the king's raising and balancing of this serpent, accompanied by his 'conjuring' of the emerging deities, may well have been expressed and supported by ritual.|$|E
25|$|Paper cutting rituals {{may be part}} of {{community}} observances. One of the main celebrations is the new year, now celebrated on January 1, as it represents renewal of the cosmos. On this day, ceremonies often take place in caves with cutouts as offerings along with food items. Day of the Dead is important in the town, like the rest of Mexico. It is celebrated here from October 31 to November 2 with a day dedicated to children, adults and saints respectively. October 31, which is for children, is then subdivided into those who died without eating corn and those who had eaten corn but not had sexual relations. The Fiesta del Pueblo (Town Festival) begins a week after Holy Week ends and lasts for fifteen days. The event honors twelve saints with each having its <b>own</b> <b>day.</b> The most important day is the first Thursday which honors the Holy Trinity, followed by that of Saint Paul, the patron of the town.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} and specific source for his romances are uncertain. He speaks in the vaguest {{way of the}} materials he used, and though Celtic influence is detectable in the stories, {{there is no direct}} evidence that he had Celtic written sources. Geoffrey of Monmouth or Wace might have supplied some of the names, but neither author mentioned Erec, Lancelot, Gornemant and many others who {{play an important role in}} Chrétien's narratives. One is left to guess about Latin or French literary originals which are now lost, or upon continental lore that goes back to a Celtic source in the case of Béroul, an Anglo-Norman who wrote around 1150. However, Chrétien found his sources immediately at hand, without much understanding of its primitive spirit, but appreciating it as a setting for the ideal society dreamed of, although not realized, in his <b>own</b> <b>day.</b> And Chrétien's five romances together form the most complete expression from a single author of the ideals of French chivalry. Though so far there has been little critical attention paid to the subject, it is not inaccurate to say that Chrétien was influenced by the changing face of secular and canonical law in the 12th century. This is particularly relevant for his Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart which makes repeated use of the customary law prevalent in Chrétien's day.|$|E
