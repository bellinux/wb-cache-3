5|$|During the 2004 {{crossover}} event , Black Mask commandeers Oracle's {{computers and}} satellites and engages {{in a fight}} to the death with Batman. In order to prevent Batman from killing his adversary, <b>Oracle</b> initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results in the destruction of Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, <b>Oracle</b> decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn (2005), and Birds of Prey: The Battle Within (2005), <b>Oracle</b> is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although <b>Oracle</b> overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body. <b>Oracle</b> develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{computer}} systems {{are prone to}} various classes of runtime faults due to their reliance on features such as concurrency and peripheral devices such as sensors. Testing remains a common method for uncovering faults in these systems, but many runtime faults are difficult to detect using typical testing <b>oracles</b> that monitor only program output. In this work we empirically investigate the use of internal test oracles: <b>oracles</b> that detect faults by monitoring aspects of internal program and system states. We compare these internal <b>oracles</b> {{to each other and}} to output-based <b>oracles</b> for relative effectiveness and examine tradeoffs between <b>oracles</b> involving incorrect reports about faults (false positives and false negatives). Our results reveal several implications that test engineers and researchers should consider when testing for runtime faults...|$|R

During the Green Lantern limited series Blackest Night, Hal Jordan crashes into the Bat-Signal after a fight with the Black Lantern Martian Manhunter. <b>Oracle</b> and Commissioner Gordon are both present. Origins & Omens hints towards an involvement in the storyline. After sending Green Lantern's intel to every superhero community across the planet of the Black Lanterns, the Gordons find themselves being attacked by the original Dark Knight's deceased rogue gallery members, who are all reanimated by the Black Lantern Corps. <b>Oracle</b> and her father are forced to fight for their lives as they witness the Black Lanterns massacring everyone on sight at Gotham Central. During the crisis, <b>Oracle</b> is rendered unconscious by an explosion and is possessed by Deadman, who uses Oracle's body to save Commissioner Gordon from the reanimated King Snake and the Trigger Twins. After being rescued by Batman, Robin, and Red Robin, the Gordons were attacked by Batman and Red Robin's parents with their saviors, the reanimated Graysons and the Drakes. While Grayson and Drake battle the Black Lanterns, Robin takes the Gordons to their underground base where Alfred tends her and her father's wounds.|$|E

40|$|Greedy transition-based parsers {{are very}} fast but tend {{to suffer from}} error propagation. This problem is aggravated {{by the fact that}} they are {{normally}} trained using <b>oracles</b> that are deterministic and incomplete in the sense that they assume a unique canonical path through the transition system and are only valid as long as the parser does not stray from this path. In this paper, we give a general characterization of <b>oracles</b> that are nondeterministic and complete, present a method for deriving such <b>oracles</b> for transition systems that satisfy a property we call arc decomposition, and instantiate this method for three well-known transition systems from the literature. We say that these <b>oracles</b> are dynamic, because they allow us to dynamically explore alternative and nonoptimal paths during training – in contrast to <b>oracles</b> that statically assume a unique optimal path. Experimental evaluation on a wide range of data sets clearly shows that using dynamic <b>oracles</b> to train greedy parsers gives substantial improvements in accuracy. Moreover, this improvement comes at no cost in terms of efficiency, unlike other techniques like beam search. ...|$|R
