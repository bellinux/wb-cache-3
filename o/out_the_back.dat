5|$|From Spangenberg's, the Cowboys {{moved to}} the O.K. Corral where {{witnesses}} overheard them threatening to kill the Earps. For unknown reasons the Cowboys then walked <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the O.K. Corral and then west, stopping in a narrow, empty lot next to C. S. Fly's boarding house.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1943, {{according}} to Wiesenthal, Kohlrautz warned {{him that the}} camp and its prisoners {{were about to be}} liquidated. Kohlrautz gave Wiesenthal and fellow prisoner Arthur Scheiman passes to go to town, accompanied by a Ukrainian guard, to buy stationery. The two men escaped <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the shop while their guard waited at the front counter.|$|E
5|$|Somehow King {{walked in}} {{the front door of the}} jail and a few minutes later <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> King had {{arranged}} with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nugget) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.|$|E

5|$|That night, Natalie sneaks into Dylan's house. When they kiss, {{something}} apparently cuts her mouth, {{causing her}} to leave in tears. Dare's friends, who believe Dylan is responsible for his death, pull up moments later and abduct him. During the drive, an insect-like protrusion comes out of Dylan's mouth and sprays webbing everywhere, causing the car to flip and crash. Doggett and Reyes arrive at the scene, and are told that Dylan chewed his way <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> window. Meanwhile, Scully and a bug specialist search Dylan's home. Scully leaves to help Reyes find the teenager while the specialist stays behind; the specialist is subsequently attacked by Dylan's mother.|$|E
5|$|Gibson's Brigade {{continued}} south, waking the 37th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry. This unit fled in all directions, and Gibson's men did {{not need}} to shoot. This left the 36th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, between Gibson's Brigade and General Johnson's headquarters at the McNeill house. The 36th offered the best resistance Gibson had faced so far, but the surprised Confederates were forced to retreat toward the McNeill farm. Near the McNeill house the men from the Confederate Baltimore Battery attempted to fire canister from their two guns, but the unit and guns were captured by the 8th Ohio Cavalry before they could be fired. General Johnson was nearly captured when his headquarters was partially surrounded by Union cavalry. He escaped <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> door and jumped on a horse—racing south to the 8th Virginia Cavalry.|$|E
5|$|In American football, if {{what would}} {{normally}} be a safety is scored on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt (officially known in the rulebooks as a try), one point is awarded to the scoring team. This {{is commonly known as}} a conversion safety or one-point safety and it can be scored by the offense. There are at least two known occurrences of the conversion safety in Division I college football– a November 26, 2004 game in which Texas scored against Texas A, and the 2013 Fiesta Bowl in which Oregon scored against Kansas State. In both games, the point-after-touchdown kick was blocked, recovered by the defense, and then fumbled or thrown back into the end zone. Coincidentally, play-by-play commentator Brad Nessler of the ESPN family of networks (currently with CBS) called both of these games. No conversion safeties have been scored in the NFL since 1940, although it is now slightly more likely after the rule change in 2015 which allowed the defense to take possession and score on a conversion attempt. Before 2015, the only scenario in which a one-point safety could have been scored in the NFL would have involved the defense kicking or batting a loose ball <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the end zone without taking possession of it. After the 2015 rule change, a one-point safety can also be scored after the defense takes possession and fumbles out of their own end zone or is tackled in it after leaving it, as in the NCAA.|$|E

25|$|Mule Train {{missions}} during 1962 became extremely diverse, {{with the}} C-123s serving in roles ranging from duck delivery to napalm bombing. In the latter role, the Provider carried nine wooden pallets, each holding three 55-gallon drums of napalm mixed with gasoline. With a good kicker, the load could go <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> ramp {{in less than}} five seconds and leave a pattern of flame 1,200 feet long.|$|E
25|$|Sergeant Robert A.

25|$|In mid-January 2012, protesters {{against the}} NTC stormed its Benghazi headquarters, {{demanding}} greater transparency on expenditures, that Gaddafi-era officials be sacked, and that Islamic sharia law {{be the source}} of the country's future constitution. Jalil was in the building, but slipped <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> before protesters broke in and stole computers and furniture. A few days earlier, Abdul Hafiz Ghoga, vice president of the NTC, was surrounded and jostled by a group of university students in Benghazi, before being pulled to safety by supporters.|$|E
25|$|Sizing up the situation, Sgt Owens {{decided that}} the only way to {{neutralize}} the gun was to charge it directly from the front. Calling on four volunteers to assist him, he positioned them where they could place supporting bunkers under fire. At the moment when he judged he had a fair chance of reaching his objective, the six-feet-three, 232-pound Marine charged right into the very mouth of the still rapidly firing cannon. Entering the emplacement through the fire port, he chased the Japanese <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> where they were cut down by his rifleman. Pursuing them, he in turn was instantly killed.|$|E
25|$|In mid-May, Lefebvre {{advanced}} on the Tyrol {{from the}} north and northeast with the Bavarian VII Corps. After the Bavarians mauled Chasteler's regulars at Wörgl, the Austrian general abandoned the Tyrol and attempted to join with the retreating army in Hungary. The victory allowed the Bavarians to temporarily reoccupy Innsbruck, though not without additional fighting. The Tyrolean Rebellion, however, was far from over. Even after the regular Austrian armies met defeat at the Battle of Wagram in early July, the revolt resisted all efforts to stamp it <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> <b>back</b> of the rebellion was finally broken in November and only fizzed out in February 1810.|$|E

25|$|A {{theoretical}} {{idea for}} enabling interstellar travel is by propelling a starship {{by creating an}} artificial black hole and using a parabolic reflector to reflect its Hawking radiation. Although beyond current technological capabilities, a black hole starship offers some advantages compared to other possible methods. Getting the black hole {{to act as a}} power source and engine also requires a way to convert the Hawking radiation into energy and thrust. One potential method involves placing the hole at the focal point of a parabolic reflector attached to the ship, creating forward thrust. A slightly easier, but less efficient method would involve simply absorbing all the gamma radiation heading towards the fore of the ship to push it onwards, and let the rest shoot <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

25|$|A typical {{vertebra}} {{consists of}} two parts: the vertebral body and the vertebral arch. The vertebral arch is posterior, meaning it faces {{the back of a}} person. Together, these enclose the vertebral foramen, which contains the spinal cord. Because the spinal cord ends in the lumbar spine, and the sacrum and coccyx are fused, they do not contain a central foramen. The vertebral arch is formed by a pair of pedicles and a pair of laminae, and supports seven processes, four articular, two transverse, and one spinous, the latter also being known as the neural spine. Two transverse processes and one spinous process are posterior to (behind) the vertebral body. The spinous process comes <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> one transverse process comes out the left, and one on the right. The spinous processes of the cervical and lumbar regions can be felt through the skin.|$|E

500|$|In American football, {{intentionally}} conceded safeties are {{an uncommon}} strategy. Teams have utilized elective safeties to gain field {{position for a}} punt when pinned deep in their own territory and, when ahead {{near the end of}} a game, to run down the clock so as to deny the other team a chance to force a turnover or return a punt. Teams have also taken intentional safeties by kicking a loose ball <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of their end zone, with the intent of preventing the defense from scoring a touchdown.|$|E
