5|$|The {{capybara}} has a heavy, barrel-shaped {{body and}} short head, with reddish-brown fur {{on the upper}} part <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body</b> that turns yellowish-brown underneath.

5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats. Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition {{have been shown to}} greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium and teeth due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, and changes in the size <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body</b> have been correlated to climate fluctuations.|$|E

5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their {{exceptionally}} acute eyesight and strong, agile flight. They are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating {{a wide variety of}} insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the legs to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body</b> weight in prey per day.|$|E
5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its ability to raise its head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body</b> length upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The octopus (along with cuttlefish) has {{the highest}} brain-to-body mass ratios of all invertebrates, and is also greater than many vertebrates. It has a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is {{localised}} in its brain, which is contained in a cartilaginous capsule. Two-thirds of an octopus's neurons {{are found in the}} nerve cords of its arms, which show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain. Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses are not organised in their brain via an internal somatotopic map <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body,</b> instead using a nonsomatotopic system unique to large-brained invertebrates.|$|E

5|$|The snail's {{oesophageal}} gland houses symbiotic gammaproteobacteria {{from which}} the snail appears to obtain its nourishment. This species {{is considered to be}} one of the most peculiar deep-sea hydrothermal-vent gastropods, and it is the only known extant animal that incorporates iron sulfide into its skeleton (into both its sclerites and into its shell as an exoskeleton). Its heart is, proportionately speaking, unusually large for any animal: the heart comprises approximately 4% <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body</b> volume.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its size}} and {{electrical}} defenses, the marbled electric ray does not often fall prey to other animals such as sharks. This species exhibits different defensive behaviors depending on whether a prospective predator grasps it by the disc or the tail. A ray touched on the disc will quickly turn toward the threat while producing electric shocks; {{this is followed by}} it fleeing in a straight line, after which it may re-bury itself. A ray touched on the tail will propel itself upward into a loop; if it has not escaped after the maneuver, the ray will curl into a ring with the belly facing outward, so as to present the area <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body</b> with the highest electric field gradient (the underside of the electric organs) towards the threat; these behaviors are accompanied by short, strong electric shocks. The ray tends to produce more electric bursts when protecting its tail than when protecting its disc.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are easy}} to {{identify}} due to their perceptibly broad and smaller mandibles. Their antennae consist of 13 segments, and are almost the same length as the ants' bodies. Ergatandromorph (an ant that exhibits both male and worker characteristics) males are known; in 1985, a male M. gulosa was collected before it hatched from its cocoon, {{and it had a}} long but excessively curved left mandible while the other mandible was small. On the right side <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body,</b> it was structurally male, but the left side appeared female. The head was also longer on the female side, its colour was darker, and the legs and prothorax were smaller on the male side. Male genitalia are retracted into a genital cavity that is located in the posterior end of the gaster. The sperm is structurally the same to other animal sperm, forming an oval head with a long tail.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have keen eyesight. Like other cephalopods, {{they can}} {{distinguish}} the polarisation of light. Colour vision appears to vary from species to species, for example being present in O. aegina but absent in O. vulgaris. Attached {{to the brain}} are two special organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body.</b> They provide information on {{the position of the}} body relative to gravity and can detect angular acceleration. An autonomic response keeps the octopus's eyes oriented so that the pupil is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz, and hears best at 600Hz.|$|E

5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and {{tugging at the}} carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it. The {{breeding}} pair typically monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done {{at the expense of other}} family members, especially non-pups. The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15–19% <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body</b> weight in a single feeding.|$|E
5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body</b> weight. While all horses can pull {{more than they}} can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} propels itself {{underwater}} {{by moving the}} rear end <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body,</b> including its tail and hind feet, up and down, and is capable of speeds of up to 9km/h (5.6mph). When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest. When at the surface, it usually floats on its back and moves by sculling its feet and tail from side to side. At rest, all four limbs can be folded onto the torso to conserve heat, whereas on particularly hot days, the hind feet may be held underwater for cooling. The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times {{greater than that of}} similar-sized land mammals – and the air trapped in its fur. The sea otter walks with a clumsy, rolling gait on land, and can run in a bounding motion.|$|E

5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is one of}} {{the three}} most common sharks inhabiting the reefs of the Indo-Pacific, the other two being the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). The habitat {{preferences}} of this species overlap those of the other two, though it does not tend to frequent very shallow water like the blacktip reef shark, nor the outer reef like the grey reef shark. The whitetip reef shark swims with strong undulations <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body,</b> and unlike other requiem sharks can lie motionless on the bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration. This species is most active at night or during slack tide, and spends much of the day resting inside caves singly or in small groups, arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another. Off Hawaii, these sharks may be found sheltering inside underwater lava tubes, while off Costa Rica they are often seen lying in the open on sandy flats.|$|E
5|$|Though Kentrosaurus likely {{stood with}} forelimbs erect like in other dinosaurs, it is {{hypothesised}} {{that the animal}} adopted a sprawling posture when defending itself. Its neck was flexible enough {{to allow it to}} keep sight of predators, as it could reach the sides <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body</b> with its snout and look over the back. In addition, the posterior position of the center of mass may not have been advantageous for rapid locomotion, but meant that the animal could quickly rotate around the hips by pushing sideways with the arms, keeping the tail pointed at the attacker. Kentrosaurus was nevertheless not invulnerable. A quick predator could have made it to the tail base (where the impact speed would be much lower) when the tail passed and the neck and upper-part of the body would have been unprotected by the tail swings. A successful predation of Kentrosaurus may have required group hunting. Compared to the more robust spikes of Stegosaurus, the thinner spikes of Kentrosaurus were at greater risk of bending.|$|E
5|$|Three {{to seven}} eggs (typically four or five) are laid {{approximately}} 24–72 hours apart. The average egg size is , 10% larger than average for birds <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>body</b> size. The eggs are white to cream in color with brown or grey splotching. Incubation usually lasts 30 days and is mainly {{the responsibility of}} the female, although the male incubates 15–20% of the time. Eggs that are lost are typically replaced in 11–12 days. Hatching takes place over three to four days. Hatchlings are altricial, and are only able to sit up after five days. They grow very quickly, reaching an adult weight after 16–17 days. After 28–31 days, their wings develop and they are able to leave the nest.|$|E
