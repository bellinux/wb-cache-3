50|$|In Scotland however, {{an estate}} agent, acting {{on behalf of}} the seller, can {{initiate}} instances of another form of gazumping. Once a closing date for written offers has been reached and an estate agent has given an <b>oral</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the chosen bid, the estate agent can then attempt to induce a bidding war between the successful buyer and a rival, who may be fictional, in an attempt to increase the offer made by each party. In such circumstance there is little recourse for a successful buyer who, despite having been informed orally that their offer has been accepted, is then informed orally that their offer has been rejected in favour of a higher bid. Such situations only occur at an early stage of the conveyancing process, prior to any written acceptance of an offer being given by the seller's solicitor. Often they result from the legal requirement on the part of estate agents to advise a seller of any higher offer received prior to written confirmation of an orally accepted offer being given, including those received after a closing date.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Young {{children}} {{with developmental disabilities}} {{are at risk of}} food refusal. In case of severe food refusal, children are being fed by nasal or gastrostomy tube. Behavioural treatment may be effective in establishing oral food intake. METHODS: A behavioural treatment package was implemented in an outpatient setting for the treatment of severe food refusal in five toddlers with developmental disabilities. During the course of treatment, treatment principles were generalized to parents in the home setting. RESULTS: Treatment resulted in <b>oral</b> <b>acceptance</b> of a variety of food items in each child and was successfully generalized. Treatment effects were maintained during follow-up between 3 and 12 months. Tube feeding was discontinued in each child and health status of each child improved. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioural treatment may be highly effective in establishing oral food intake in {{children with}} developmental disabilities (in the absence of organic causes). As a side-effect of this treatment, tube-feeding may be discontinued and general heath status improved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Cholera {{remains a}} serious {{public health problem}} in low-income {{countries}} despite efforts {{in the past to}} promote oral rehydration therapy as major treatment. In 2007, the majority of worldwide cases (94 %) and deaths (99 %) were reported from Africa. To improve cholera control efforts in addition to maintaining and improving existing water supply, sanitation and hygiene behaviour measures, the World Health Organization has recently started to consider the use of vaccines as an additional public health tool. To assess this new approach in endemic settings, a project was launched in Zanzibar to vaccinate 50, 000 individuals living in communities at high risk of cholera with an oral two-dose vaccine (Dukoral ®). Immunisation programmes in low-income countries have suffered a reduced coverage or were even brought to a halt because of an ignorance of local realities. To ensure the success of vaccination campaigns, implementers have to consider community-held perceptions and behaviours regarding the infectious disease and the vaccine of interest. The main aim {{of this study is to}} provide advice to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Zanzibar regarding routine introduction of an oral cholera vaccine from a socioeconomic and behavioural perspective as part of a long-term development for a sustained cholera prevention strategy. Methods and design Qualitative and quantitative methods of health social science research will be applied on four stakeholder levels before and after the mass vaccination campaign. Rapid assessment individual interviews and focus groups will be used to describe cholera- and vaccine-related views of policy makers, health care professionals and community representatives. The cultural epidemiological approach will be employed on the individual household resident level in a repeated cross-sectional design to estimate determinants of anticipated and actual <b>oral</b> cholera vaccine <b>acceptance.</b> Discussion The study presented here is designed to inform about people's perceptions regarding cholera and about socioeconomic and behavioural factors determining anticipated and actual <b>oral</b> cholera vaccine <b>acceptance</b> in Zanzibar. Its pre- and post-intervention design using a mixed-methods approach on different stakeholder levels in communities at high risk of cholera outbreaks will ensure the collection of locally valid data relevant for public health action and planning. </p...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the extent to which}} married women were able to negotiate independent leisure outside the home. It explores the constraints women faced and any strategies used to resist restrictions imposed by their husbands. The evidence is gathered from an industrial community in East Cleveland, an area dominated by the iron and steel industries and in particular ironstone mining. It is focused on the years between 1939 and 1960, a period in which the ideology of companionate marriage was gaining widespread <b>acceptance.</b> <b>Oral</b> testimony confirms the expectation that marital partners should spend some leisure time together outside the home. However, the ideology of companionate marriage appears to have put some women under added pressure to abandon independent leisure for the sake of their marriage and its public profile. Indeed, it is clear that most women had less access to independent leisure than their male partners. Some women accepted this as natural; others tried to influence their access to leisure with a variety of strategies and with varying degrees of success. Ultimately the majority valued the stability of their marriage and its public profile more than the right to independent leisure...|$|R
40|$|Background: Constructive {{feedback}} {{is an essential}} element of the educational process, helping trainees reach their maximum potential and increasing their skill level. Video-based feedback has been described as highly effective in various educational contexts. The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of video-based, on-ward supervision for final year students in a clinical context with real patients. Methods: Nine final year medical students (three male, six female; aged 25. 1 [*]±[*] 0. 7  years) and eight patients (five male, three female; aged 59. 3 [*]±[*] 16. 8  years) participated in the pilot study. Final year students performed routine medical procedures at bedside on internal medicine wards at the University of Heidelberg Medical Hospital. Students were filmed and were under supervision. After performing the procedures, an oral feedback loop was established including student, patient and supervisor feedback on communicative and procedural aspects of skills performed. Finally, students watched their video, focusing on specific teachable moments mentioned by the supervisor. Written evaluations and semi-structured interviews were conducted that focused on the benefits of video-based, on-ward supervision. Interviews were analysed qualitatively, using open coding to establish recurring themes and overarching categories to describe patients’ and students’ impressions. Descriptive, quantitative analysis was used for questionnaire data. Results: Supervised, self-chosen skills included history taking (n[*]=[*] 6), physical examination (n[*]=[*] 1), IV cannulation (n[*]=[*] 1), and ECG recording (n[*]=[*] 1). The video-based, on-ward supervision was well accepted by patients and students. Supervisor feedback was rated as highly beneficial, with the video material providing an additional opportunity to focus on crucial aspects and to further validate the supervisor’s feedback. Students felt the video material would be less beneficial without the supervisor’s feedback. The setting was rated as realistic, with filming not influencing behaviour. Conclusion: Video-based, on-ward supervision may be a powerful tool for improving clinical medical education. However, it should be regarded as an additional tool in combination with supervisors’ <b>oral</b> feedback. <b>Acceptance</b> was high in both students and patients. Further research should address possibilities of efficiently combining and routinely establishing these forms of feedback in medical education...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the committee of preliminary inquiry (in the context of professional conduct committees) of the Health Professions Council of South Africa, with specific reference to maxillo-facial and oral surgery. An evaluation was done of cases that were referred by the committee for preliminary inquiry to this specific professional conduct committee of the Medical and Dental Professions Board. Where necessary, these cases were supplemented by relevant cases from other professional conduct committees. In order to achieve this goal, a comprehensive literature study was conducted on the broad concept of medical and dental misconduct and negligence. Specific attention was paid to the issues of expert testimony and witnesses and consent. Furthermore, a study was conducted to determine the legal framework in which these committees are supposed to function. In the cases where inquiries into the complaints against the registered practitioners followed, a detailed evaluation of the so-called legal process was done, as well as the findings in each case (in the context of the professional conduct committees). The results of this study have shown that the investigative system of the committee for preliminary inquiry preceding professional conduct inquiries into complaints against registered practitioners has certain shortcomings, especially in the more complex cases. The following proposals have been made (in order of most importance) : 1. Both the committee for preliminary inquiry and professional conduct committee must abide by the rules of natural justice, as pertained in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. 2. Establishment of a Forum of Expert Witnesses that will evaluate all cases of alleged professional misconduct and negligence pertaining to the field of maxillo-facial and oral surgery, after it was evaluated and referred by the Ombudsman. 3. Appointment of a maxillo-facial and oral surgeon as Ombudsman to evaluate all cases brought before the committee for preliminary inquiry pertaining to the field of maxillo-facial and <b>oral</b> surgery. 4. <b>Acceptance</b> of the proposed test of medical negligence, i. e. the ‘reasonable person’s test’, subjected to that of the ‘reasonable specialist’ as standard for evaluation of cases of alleged negligence in maxillo-facial and oral surgery. 5. The proposed patient’s consent form serves as an example of a legitimate patient consent form. It follows that the legal requirements, especially in cases of extensions and deviations of medical interventions, must be adhered to. 6. It is advisable to belong to an organisation providing indemnity cover (such as Medical/Dental Protection Society) in order to receive proper assistance in the handling of these cases of alleged unprofessional/disgraceful conduct. The recommendations consequential to this study would provide a more streamlined, cost- and time effective investigative system to investigate claims of unprofessional conduct for possible further disciplinary action.

40|$|The {{field of}} life {{sciences}} moves forward {{at a rapid}} pace. Many of us do not fully realize that this acceleration is relatively new phenomenon {{in the history of}} mankind. It was in 1990 before the era of wireless phones and laptop computers when J. Craig Venter flew over the ocean and thought inside the airplane about the future of genome projects (as it was written by Ted Anton on his book entitled “Bold Science, Seven Scientists Who Are Changing Our World”). However, just over a short period of time, genome projects, which in 1997 required several years to complete, nowadays take only days. J. Craig Venter stated, as reported by Albert Sasson about the achievements, prospects, and perceptions of medical biotechnology, “For the past 15 years at ever faster rates we have digitizing biology. By that I mean going from the analog world of biology through DNA sequencing into the digital world of the computer. The human genome is perhaps the best example of digitizing biology. Our computer databases are growing faster per day than during the first 10 years of DNA sequencing. Thedatabases have been filling even faster with the results of J. Craig Venter 2 ̆ 7 s global ocean sequencing project. As a result, we have now over 10 million genes in the public databases. ” Indeed life sciences progress rapidly. In other areas, nanotechnology, for example, offers new solutions for biomedical sciences and provides a broad technological platform for application in industry. Such applications include bio-processing, molecular medicine, biotechnology, bio-fluidics for handling DNA, and other molecules, etc. Moreover, in another area, regenerative medical therapy reaches the interaction between scaffold, signaling molecules, and cells to enable neo-tissue formation and enhance healing potentials. All the above progresses in life sciences and biomedical sciences improve possibilities for patients to be helped. Meanwhile, ethical problems also arise by the fast science progresses. What about in oral and dental sciences? In some countries, the prevalence of oral and dental diseases is still considered very high. In some other countries the prevalence of dental caries is reducing by the application of fluoridation in societies. Although science has made human beings wealthy and prolonged life span, but to some extent scientists realize the limitation of sciences to cope health problems. In term of oral and dental sciences, opinions arise from research results and the confrontation of them also happens. In view of the overall mapping, The Indonesian Journal of Dental Research is published by The Faculty of Dentistry, Universitas Gadjah Mada, in collaboration with AFDOKGI, The Indonesian Association of The Faculty of Dentistry. The Indonesian Journal of Dental Research is an International journal dedicated to the latest advancement of dental research in Indonesia and Asia Pacific regions. The goal of this journal is to provide a platform for dentists and academicians {{all over the world to}} promote, share, and discuss various new issues and developments in different areas of dental and <b>oral</b> sciences. The <b>acceptance</b> of manuscripts will not rely on opinions of editors, but on evidence-based logical facts. The editors will help authors to improve their manuscripts by scientific bases. Any kind of articles are welcomed within the aim and scope of this journal. We are waiting for your contributions. Ika Dewi AnaEditor in Chie...|$|R
