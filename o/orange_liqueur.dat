50|$|Basically, an <b>Orange</b> <b>Liqueur</b> {{is a group}} name. These are liqueurs where citrus orange peels {{are being}} used as a base {{ingredient}} in the distillation process. Between the different brands, there are differences in what varieties of oranges are used, the combination of different oranges, what kind of alcohol is used, and of course all the other ingredients (sugar, herbs etc.) that ultimately comprises any recipe for an <b>orange</b> <b>liqueur.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A later {{story is}} that the margarita was invented in October 1961, {{at a party in}} Houston, Texas, by party goer Robert James [...] "Rusty" [...] Thomson while acting as bartender. He concocted a mixture of equal parts tequila, Controy <b>orange</b> <b>liqueur,</b> lime, and crushed ice in a salt-rimmed glass. However, Thomson's recipe was made with Damiana Liqueur, not Cointreau <b>orange</b> <b>liqueur.</b> It is said that the idea was an {{experiment}} after running out of rum while making frozen daiquiris.|$|E
50|$|It is {{made with}} tequila, lime juice, and agave nectar and served in a {{cocktail}} glass. It is distinct from the Margarita in its omission of <b>orange</b> <b>liqueur</b> and its substitution of agave nectar.|$|E
50|$|The Casino is an IBA {{official}} cocktail {{made with}} gin, maraschino <b>liqueur,</b> <b>orange</b> bitters and fresh lemon juice.|$|R
50|$|Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle created Grand Marnier, an <b>orange</b> flavored cognac <b>liqueur,</b> in 1880. He {{learned how}} to distill from his father who was a wine and spirit merchant.|$|R
50|$|Cointreau {{continues}} to produce its <b>orange</b> triple-sec <b>liqueur</b> in nearby Saint-Barthélemy-d'Anjou, {{but many of}} the other industries have since vanished. Modern Angers produces Scania trucks at Ecouflant and computers by Bull, Packard Bell, and NEC. It also supports research labs investigating horticulture and biotechnology. Thanks to its several higher education schools, laboratories, and various offices, Angers is the largest horticultural center in Europe and, as the home of the Community Plant Variety Office, Angers is the hub of the plant breeders' rights system in the European Community. For example, Angers is the leading hydrangeas producer in Europe. The local economy also relies on the presence of many administrative, educational, and health institutions. There are also many small firms, chiefly focused on the agricultural tradition of Maine-et-Loire. Angers also serves as a regional financial center, with many banks and insurance companies (including Afone, CNP Assurances, Crédit agricole, Fiducial, and Groupama) maintaining their regional offices there.|$|R
5000|$|Recipes and {{preparation}} types vary. The primary ingredients are tequila and <b>orange</b> <b>liqueur.</b> Other flavoring ingredients like orange juice, lime juice, sparkling sodas and salt may be used. One common recipe is as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|A breakfast martini {{is a form}} of {{cocktail}} {{created by}} bartender Salvatore Calabrese. The most famous [...] "marmalade cocktail", it is a gin martini with marmalade, <b>orange</b> <b>liqueur,</b> and lemon juice in place of vermouth.|$|E

50|$|Maria Peale (1787-1866) was an American painter, {{primarily}} of still-lifes. She {{was the daughter}} of James Peale, the niece of Charles Willson Peale and the sister of Margaretta Angelica Peale, Sarah Miriam Peale, and Anna Claypoole Peale, but unlike her sisters she never pursued an artistic career. She only exhibited one painting, a still-life of vegetables; currently unlocated, it was shown at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1811. No works by her are known to be extant, although a Still Life with <b>Oranges,</b> Pansies, and <b>Liqueur</b> has been tentatively ascribed to her. In the 1820s she and Margaretta assumed the responsibility of caring for their parents, freeing Anna and Sarah to pursue their careers.|$|R
5000|$|Crêpes are {{especially}} popular throughout France. The common ingredients include flour, eggs, milk, butter, and {{a pinch of}} salt. Crêpes are usually of two types: sweet crêpes (crêpes sucrées) made with wheat flour and slightly sweetened; and savoury galettes (crêpes salées) made with buckwheat flour and unsweetened. The name [...] "galette" [...] came from the French word galet ("pebble") since the first gallettes were made on a large pebble heated in a fire. Batter made from buckwheat flour is gluten-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten allergy or intolerance to eat this type of crêpe. Mille crêpes is a French cake made of many crêpe layers. The word mille means [...] "a thousand", implying the many layers of crêpe. Another standard French and Belgian crêpe is the crêpe Suzette, a crêpe with lightly grated <b>orange</b> peel and <b>liqueur</b> (usually Grand Marnier) which is subsequently lit upon presentation.|$|R
50|$|The sidecar is a {{cocktail}} traditionally made with cognac, <b>orange</b> <b>liqueur</b> (Cointreau, Grand Marnier, Grand Gala or another triple sec), and lemon juice. In its ingredients, the drink {{is perhaps most}} {{closely related to the}} older brandy crusta, which differs both in presentation and in proportions of its components.|$|E
50|$|Patrón tequila {{is offered}} in several {{different}} varieties: Gran Patrón Burdeos, Gran Patrón Platinum, Gran Patrón Piedra, Patrón Silver, Patrón Añejo, and Patrón Reposado. It is also available in a tequila-coffee blend known as Patrón XO Cafe, a tequila-chocolate-coffee blend known as Patrón XO Cafe Dark Cocoa, and an <b>orange</b> <b>liqueur</b> known as Patrón Citrónge.|$|E
5000|$|Distilled in Mexico since 1933, Controy or Naranja (US Market Name) is an <b>orange</b> <b>liqueur</b> {{sometimes}} credited {{as being}} used in the first Margarita.For nearly a century Controy was only available in Mexico. In 2013, Pura Vida Tequila Company of Houston, Texas acquired the rights to export it for sale in the United States. For legal purposes, the name was changed from Controy to Naranja, which translates to [...] "orange" [...] in Spanish.|$|E
5000|$|John Leonard of The New York Times said, [...] "Morgan, like a novelist, {{wants to}} be {{everybody}} else in order to look at himself through innocent eyes, to be charmed....Miss Tyler, witty, civilized, curious, with her radar ears and her quill pen dipped on one page in acid and on the next in <b>orange</b> <b>liqueur,</b> is asking whether art is adequate to the impersonations life insists on, death absolves. She is a wonderful writer." ...|$|E
50|$|Most current {{recipes for}} Mai Tais based on Trader Vic's 1944 recipe include rum, lime juice, orgeat syrup, and <b>orange</b> <b>liqueur</b> (typically orange curaçao). Variants may include orange and {{grapefruit}} juices, bitters, grenadine, falernum, and so on. Various books from Victor Bergeron described using rum Jamaica {{as well as}} from Martinique, which in modern usage is a Rhum Agricole. As noted in Smuggler's Cove from Martin Cate and Rebecca Cate, the Martinique rums used by Bergeron in the 1950s were most certainly not agricole rums.|$|E
5000|$|Another origin {{story of}} the Margarita {{is that it was}} invented in October 1941, at Hussong's Cantina in Ensenada, Mexico, by {{bartender}} Don Carlos Orozco. One afternoon, Margarita Henkel, the daughter of the then German ambassador visited the cantina and Don Carlos who had been experimenting with drinks offered her one. The cocktail consisted of equal parts of tequila, Mexican <b>orange</b> <b>liqueur</b> called Controy (A.K.A. Naranja in the United States), and lime, shaken and served over ice in a salt-rimmed glass. As she was the first to try the drink, Don Carlos decided to name it after her and the [...] "Margarita" [...] was born.|$|E
