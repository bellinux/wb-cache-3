5|$|Giacomo Meyerbeer (born Jacob Liebmann Beer; 5 September 1791 – 2 May 1864) was a German opera {{composer}} of Jewish birth who {{has been}} described as perhaps the most successful stage composer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century.</b> With his 1831 opera Robert le diable and its successors, he gave the genre of grand opera 'decisive character'. Meyerbeer's grand opera style was achieved by his merging of German orchestra style with Italian vocal tradition. These were employed in the context of sensational and melodramatic libretti created by Eugène Scribe and were enhanced by the up-to-date theatre technology of the Paris Opéra. They set a standard which helped to maintain Paris as the opera capital <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

5|$|South of Ardnamurchan, Gaelic {{place names}} are more common, {{and after the}} 13th century, Gaelic became the main {{language}} of the entire Hebridean archipelago. Due to Scots and English being favored in government and the educational system, the Hebrides {{have been in a}} state of diglossia since at least the seventeenth century. The Highland Clearances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> accelerated the language shift away from Scottish Gaelic, as did increased migration and the continuing lower status of Gaelic speakers. Nevertheless, as late as the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> there were significant populations of monolingual Gaelic speakers, and the Hebrides still contain the highest percentages of Gaelic speakers in Scotland. This is especially true of the Outer Hebrides, where a slim majority speak the language. The Scottish Gaelic college, Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, is based on Skye and Islay.|$|E

In this context, the question is raised, what conception of time {{is to be found in}} <b>the</b> philosophers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> and twentieth <b>centuries?</b> This leads on to a study of time in music and in musical theory, especially in those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>centuries...</b>|$|R

Quite a few had more complicated bud-shaped domes, whose form derived from Baroque models of the late seventeenth century. Pear-shaped domes are usually associated with Ukrainian Baroque, while cone-shaped domes are typical for Orthodox churches of Transcaucasia.|$|E

5|$|In later years, {{because it}} was {{impossible}} for parishioners to travel to Llanbadarn Fawr from the more distant parts of the parish, the church eventually had many chapels of ease, as the population of the parish grew.
