5|$|Another {{criticism}} {{pertains to}} the shift in training focus {{after the end of}} Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack <b>of</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|After a {{short period}} <b>of</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> Australia, the {{battalion}} was deployed to New Guinea in August 1942 as the Australians sent reinforcements to the Kokoda Track to fight against Japanese forces that had been advancing towards Port Moresby. After the Japanese exhausted their supplies and began to fall back towards their beachheads on the north coast, the 2/14th saw further action around Gona. In September 1943, {{after a period of}} re-organisation in Australia, the battalion took part in the advance on Lae as the Allies went on the offensive in New Guinea, before taking part in the fighting in the Markham and Ramu Valleys of the Finisterre Range campaign. The battalion's final involvement in the war came in the landing on Balikpapan in 1945. The 2/14th was disbanded after the war, in early 1946.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{evacuation}} from Gallipoli, the AIF was re-organised in Egypt. This saw the splitting of the veteran battalions to provide cadres for new battalions as the AIF's infantry divisions in Egypt were doubled. As {{a part of}} this process, the 15th Battalion provided personnel to the 47th Battalion, and the 4th Brigade became part of the Australian 4th Division. After a further period <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> <b>in</b> June 1916 the battalion sailed for France aboard the transport Transylvania. After landing at Marseilles, the 15th Battalion moved to northern France via rail to Beilleul, moving into the line around Bois Grenier for a brief period on 15 June. Amidst the carnage of the Battle of the Somme which was launched in July, the following month, the 15th Battalion was committed to fighting on the Western Front for the first time, entering the line around Pozières on 5 August, as the 4th Division relieved the shattered 2nd.|$|E

In May 1938 Braham began officer instruction at RAF Uxbridge. After the completion of this course he was moved to RAF Shawbury to begin training on military aircraft. Now assigned to the No. 11 EFS he elected to become a fighter pilot and began training on the Hawker Hart. He completed his advanced flight training on 20 August 1938 and began the final phase <b>of</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> the Hawker Fury.

5|$|In November 1978, Evans {{broke the}} Western Australian {{record for the}} 100m breaststroke during his final year at school. He and his father decided that he should step up his {{swimming}} career, and Evans entered the 1979 Australian Championships in Perth. Despite only four weeks of solid training {{leading up to the}} meet, Evans came second to Lindsay Spencer. Evans was omitted from the Australian squad that toured Britain because he was an unknown swimmer. After the meet, Evans vowed to become an elite swimmer and Olympian. A week later, Evans travelled to England to train at Crystal Palace in London under David Haller, coach of future Olympic breaststroke gold medallist Duncan Goodhew. Evans did so feeling that there was insufficient coaching support for breaststrokers in Australia. In three months <b>of</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> London, Evans had risen up the breaststroke rankings from outside the top 200 into the top 25. He returned to Australia and won selection in the national team for the FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) World Cup in Japan, before returning to London for more training.|$|E

5|$|Scherger {{served as}} Officer Commanding No.2 Training Group at RAAF Station Wagga from July 1943 {{until he was}} {{appointed}} AOC of the newly formed No.10 Operational Group (No.10 OG) in November. The Air Force's main mobile strike force, No.10 OG at its formation consisted of No.77 Wing, operating A-31 Vengeance dive bombers, and No.78 Wing, operating P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, as well as various ancillary units. Promoted to acting air commodore in January 1944, Scherger established his headquarters at Nadzab, Papua New Guinea, {{in support of the}} US Fifth Air Force. Though able to launch No.78 Wing's first mission that same month, he had to deal with several organisational problems to bring all his squadrons to combat readiness, including lack <b>of</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> tropical conditions, and shortcomings in aircraft maintenance and staff rotation that resulted in the RAAF's operational rate of effort being inferior to similar USAAF formations. These issues were overcome later in the year and No.10 OG units began exceeding the rate of effort of their American counterparts.|$|E

5|$|The 2/10th Battalion ("The Adelaide Rifles") was an {{infantry}} {{battalion of}} the Australian Army that was raised for overseas service {{as part of}} the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) during World War II.

Initially, it had been intended that the 2/10th and its parent brigade– the 18th Brigade– would be sent to the Middle East to join the other brigades of the 6th Division, but instead the 18th Brigade was sent to the United Kingdom, to help strengthen the garrison there after France capitulated in mid-1940. Reassigned to the 9th Division, the 2/10th remained in the United Kingdom undertaking defensive duties until late 1940 when it finally arrived in the Middle East, where the 18th Brigade became part of the 7th Division.|$|E

During the fighting around Bardia, the battalion's commander, Wrigley, was seriously wounded in an artillery bombardment, and was temporarily replaced by Major George Sell, as the battalion was committed to the fighting in {{the second phase of the}} assault, advancing through the bridgehead that had been established towards the railway switchline. Later, during the assault on Tobruk, the 2/5th was tasked with conducting a diversionary attack to the east of the Italian perimeter. The battalion's time in Libya cost it 32 killed, and 60 wounded.|$|E
5|$|They then {{undertook}} a further two months <b>of</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> Egypt before an urgent request for reinforcements led to them being dispatched to Gallipoli where they landed on 12 September.

Throughout October they defended the ridge, during which time they suffered five killed and 29 wounded, before being relieved by New Zealanders in early November. After this they moved to new positions in Mule Gulley where they undertook further defensive operations alongside the 26th Battalion. Losses during this time amounted to two killed and eight wounded. In December, they took over from the 28th Battalion around Happy Valley, before {{the decision was made}} to evacuate the Allied forces from the peninsula.

Eventually, Alomar ran away and was found by a truck driver who was part of a rebel militia group. She later joined the group and soon learned that the factory accident her parents had died in was actually a test of a bio-organic weapon (BOW) by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella Corporation. With the help of the local government, Umbrella destroyed Alomar's village and its inhabitants after the test was complete. When Alomar was 15, she was contacted by U.S. operatives to sabotage Umbrella's attempt to sell a BOW. With Alomar's help, the deal was stopped and she was offered a chance {{to start a new life}} in America. Alomar accepted, was speaking fluent English within months and enrolled at a university two years later.
