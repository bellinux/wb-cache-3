25|$|Sea salt was {{a common}} {{condiment}} in ancient Hawaii, and Inamona, a relish made <b>of</b> <b>roasted,</b> mashed kukui nutmeats, sea salt and sometimes mixed with seaweeds, often accompanied the meals. At important occasions, a traditional feast, ‘aha‘aina, was held. When a woman was to have her first child, her husband started raising a pig for the ‘Aha‘aina Mawaewae feast that was celebrated {{for the birth of}} a child. Besides the pig, mullet, shrimp, crab, seaweeds and taro leaves were required for the feast. The modern name for such feasts, lū‘au, was not used until 1856, replacing the Hawaiian words ‘aha‘aina and pā‘ina. The name lū‘au came from the name of a food always served at a ‘aha‘aina — young taro tops baked with coconut milk and chicken or octopus.|$|E

Litti chokha, a baked salted wheat-flour cake {{filled with}} sattu (baked chickpea flour) and some special spices, {{is well known}} among the middle-class families served with baigan bharta, made <b>of</b> <b>roasted</b> eggplant and tomatoes. Among meat dishes, meat saalan is a popular dish made of mutton or goat curry with cubed potatoes in garam masala. Dalpuri is another popular dish in Bihar. It is salted wheat-flour bread, filled with boiled, crushed, and fried gram pulses. Malpua is a popular sweet dish of Bihar, prepared by a mixture of maida, milk, bananas, cashew nuts, peanuts, raisins, sugar, water, and green cardamom. Another notable sweet dish of Bihar is balushahi, which is prepared by a specially treated combination of maida and sugar along with ghee, and the other worldwide famous sweet, khaja, also very popular, is made from flour, vegetable fat, and sugar, which is mainly used in weddings and other occasions. Silav near Nalanda {{is famous for its}} production. During the festival of Chhath, thekua, a sweet dish made of ghee, jaggery, and whole-meal flour, flavoured with aniseed, is made.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{account for}} 8% to 12% of dried green coffee beans. A {{majority}} of the proteins are of the 11-S storage kind (alpha – component of 32 kDa, beta – component of 22 kDa), {{most of which are}} degraded to free amino acids during maturation of green coffee beans. Further, 11-S storage proteins are degraded to their individual amino acids under roasting temperature, thus are an additional source of bitter components due to generation of Maillard reaction products. High temperature and oxygen concentration and low pH degrade 11-S storage proteins of green coffee beans to low-molecular-weight peptides and amino acids. The degradation is accelerated in the presence of organic acids such as chlorogenic acids and their derivatives. Other proteins include enzymes, such as catalase and polyphenol oxidase, which are important for the maturation of green coffee beans. Mature coffee contains free amino acids (4.0mg amino acid/g robusta coffee and up to 4.5mg amino acid/g arabica coffee). In Coffea arabica, alanine is the amino acid with the highest concentration, i.e. 1.2mg/g, followed by asparagine of 0.66mg/g, whereas in C. robusta, alanine is present at a concentration of 0.8mg/g and asparagine at 0.36mg/g. The free hydrophobic amino acids in fresh green coffee beans contribute to the unpleasant taste, making it impossible to prepare a desirable beverage with such compounds. In fresh green coffee from Peru, these concentrations have been determined as: isoleucine 81mg/kg, leucine 100mg/kg, valine 93mg/kg, tyrosine 81mg/kg, phenylalanine 133mg/kg. The concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (a neurotransmitter) has been determined between 143mg/kg and 703mg/kg in green coffee beans from Tanzania. Roasted coffee beans do not contain any free amino acids; the amino acids in green coffee beans are degraded under roasting temperature to Maillard products (reaction products between the aldehyde group of sugar and the alpha-amino group of the amino acids). Further, diketopiperazines, e.g. cyclo(proline-proline), cyclo(proline-leucine), and cyclo(proline-isoleucine), are generated from the corresponding amino acids, and are the major source of the bitter taste <b>of</b> <b>roasted</b> coffee. The bitter flavor of diketopiperazines is perceptible at around 20mg/liter of water. The content of diketopiperazines in espresso is about 20 to 30mg, which is responsible for its bitterness.|$|E

500|$|There {{were two}} groups of guilds – first, those that {{supplied}} the raw materials; butchers, fishmongers, grain merchants, and gardeners. The second group were those that supplied prepared foods; bakers, pastry cooks, sauce makers, poulterers, and caterers. There were also guilds that offered both raw materials and prepared food, such as the charcutiers and rôtisseurs (purveyors <b>of</b> <b>roasted</b> meat dishes). They would supply cooked meat pies and dishes as well as raw meat and poultry. This caused issues with butchers and poulterers, who sold the same raw materials. [...] The guilds served as a training ground for those within the industry. The degrees of assistant-cook, full-fledged cook and master chef were conferred. Those who reached the level of master chef were of considerable rank in their individual industry, and enjoyed {{a high level of}} income as well as economic and job security.
