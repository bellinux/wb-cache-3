5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels.

40|$|About 60 % of the {{anthropogenic}} {{greenhouse effect}} {{is caused by}} CO 2 emissions, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) {{are responsible for the}} rest. 90 % of the CO 2 emissions originate by burning fossil fuels. According to that the power production is responsible for more than 50 % of the emitted greenhouse gases. In industrialized countries this contingent is much higher, e. g. Germany> 80 %. Other responsible parties are industry, agriculture and fire clearings [17]. The reduction of CO 2 emissions during combustion of fossil fuels will play a major key role. The development of advanced fossil fuel power plants enabling CO 2 capture can help to reach the Kyoto goal.

40|$|Faced {{with the}} {{increasing}} concern {{about the effect of}} greenhouse gases in global warming, Carbon Capture and Storage technologies are developed. Oxy-combustion is one of these techniques; it consists of separating the nitrogen from the air and using the O 2 (diluted in CO 2) as an oxidant so that the resulting flue gases are mainly composed by carbon dioxide and water vapour and the capture of CO 2 can be done easily after condensing the steam. Changing the working fluid from air to O 2 /CO 2 modifies combustion properties what might have consequences on the range of operability of the combustor. In order to design a combustor for oxy-fuel cycles in gas turbine applications, the differences between air and <b>oxyfuel’s</b> operational zone at low and high pressures are studied. For comparing their stability, laminar flame speed is computed for air-fuel and oxy-fuel mixtures near stoichiometric equivalence ratios (1 - 0. 95). Diffusion effect is studied as a possible cause of the change in combustion properties when modifying the working media by computing the residence time of blowout of the same mixtures...|$|R
5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and <b>oxyfuel</b> welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and <b>oxyfuel</b> welding were among the first {{processes}} to develop late in the century, and electric resistance welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.|$|E

40|$|Engineers are {{exploring}} several mechanisms to delay corrosive {{attack of the}} CAM (corrosion allowance material) by dripping water, including drip shields and ceramic coatings. Ceramic coatings deposited with high-velocity <b>oxyfuels</b> (HVOF� s) have exhibited a porosity of only 2 % at a thickness of 0. 15 cm. The primary goal of this document {{is to provide a}} detailed description of an abstracted process-level model for Total System Performance Assessment (TSPA) that has been developed to account for the inhibition of corrosion by protective ceramic coatings. A second goal was to address as many of the issues raised during a recent peer review as possible (direct reaction of liquid water with carbon steel, stress corrosion cracking of the ceramic coating, bending stresses in coatings of finite thickness, limitations of simple correction factors, etc.). During the periods of dry oxidation (T 2 100 °C) and humid-air corrosion (T I 100 °C & RH 80 %), it is assumed that the overall mass transfer resistance governing the corrosion rate is due to the combined resistance of ceramic coating & interfacial corrosion products. Two porosity models (simple cylinder & cylinder-sphere chain) are considered in estimation of the mass transfer resistance of the ceramic coating. It is evident that substantial impedance to 02 transport is encountered if pores are filled with liquid water. It may be possible to use a sealant to eliminate porosity. Spallation (rupture) of the ceramic coating is assumed to occur if the stress introduced by the expanding corrosion products at the ceramic- CAM interface exceeds fracture stress. Since this model does not account for the possibility of corrosion products filling pores, it is believe to be very conservative. In such a case, the corrosion product would not spread across the ceramic-CAM interface and no spallation would occur. Thus, the coating would be expected to last indefinitely...|$|R

2500|$|In {{oxy-fuel}} combustion the fuel is burned in oxygen instead of air. To limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled flue gas is recirculated and {{injected into the}} combustion chamber. The flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour, the latter of which is condensed through cooling. The result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored. Power plant processes based on <b>oxyfuel</b> combustion are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "zero emission" [...] cycles, because the [...] stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream (as in the cases of pre- and post-combustion capture) but the flue gas stream itself. A certain fraction of the [...] generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed water. To warrant the label [...] "zero emission" [...] the water would thus have to be treated or disposed of appropriately. The technique is promising, but the initial air separation step demands a lot of energy.|$|E
50|$|Flame contact welding is a {{very common}} form of welding. The most popular kind of flame contact welding is <b>oxyfuel</b> gas welding. Flame contact welding uses a flame exposed {{to the surface of}} the metals being welded to melt and then join them together. <b>Oxyfuel</b> uses oxygen as a primary {{ignition}} source in tandem with another gas such as acetylene to produce a flame which is 2500oC at the tip and 2800-3500oC at the tip of the inner cone.
