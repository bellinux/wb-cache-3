5|$|In 1978, Pope John Paul II, {{formerly}} Archbishop of Kraków in then-Communist Poland, {{became the}} first non-Italian pope in 455 years. His 27-year pontificate {{was one of the}} longest in history. Mikhail Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union, credited the Polish pope with hastening the fall <b>of</b> <b>Communism</b> <b>in</b> Europe.|$|E
5|$|Pilecki's {{place of}} burial has never been found but {{is thought to be}} somewhere within Warsaw's Powązki Cemetery. After the fall <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> Poland a {{symbolic}} gravestone was erected in his memory at Ostrowa Mazowiecka Cemetery. In 2012, Powązki Cemetery was partially excavated in an effort to find Pilecki's remains.|$|E

Most are now derelict, though {{some have been}} reused {{for a variety of}} purposes including residential accommodation, cafés, storehouses and shelters for animals or the homeless. A few briefly saw use in the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|After 1952 the Polish sport {{life was}} {{organized}} through the Polish Cultural and Educational Union. Through the communist era Polish minority declined demographically and this process continue to date, hence {{after the fall}} <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> 1989 only a few sport organizations resumed their activity. Beskid Śląski, the only notable one, focuses on tourism. No exclusively Polish sport club exists today in Zaolzie.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century Białystok was an {{important}} center for light industry, which {{was the reason for}} the substantial growth of the city's population. The tradition continued with many garment factories established in the twentieth century, such as Fasty in the district of Bacieczki. However, after the fall <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> 1989 many of these factories faced severe problems and subsequently closed down.|$|E

5|$|Suppressed {{during the}} era of {{communist}} Poland, after the fall <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> Poland, Dmowski's legacy {{has begun to be}} more widely recognized. A bridge in Wrocław was named after him in 1992. In November 2006 statue of Roman Dmowski was unveiled in Warsaw; it had led to a series of protests from organizations which see Dmowski as fascist and opponent of tolerance; due to similar protests plans to raise statues or memorials elsewhere have commonly been delayed.|$|E
5|$|After the war Mazurkiewicz was persecuted by the Soviet-led {{communist}} {{authorities of}} the People's Republic of Poland, kept {{for two years}} in pre-trial jail, tortured and sentenced to life, {{despite the fact that he}} tried to cooperate with the new regime. He was rehabilitated after the end of the Stalinist period in 1956 and became active in the official veterans' organization Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy (ZBoWiD). He was eventually promoted to the rank of general of the Armed Forces of the People's Republic of Poland (LWP). He died shortly before the fall <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 600 Jews {{were killed}} in Greater Albania during the war. Albania-proper emerged from the war with a {{population}} of Jews eleven times greater than at the beginning, numbering around 1,800 individuals. Most of these subsequently emigrated to Israel, but several hundred remained until the fall <b>of</b> <b>Communism</b> <b>in</b> the early 1990s before they did the same. As of 2011, 69 Albanians have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations for the role they played in saving Jews during the Holocaust.|$|E

5|$|As Police Commissioner Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|Former {{students}} from Prague, including Constantine Menges, and Czech {{refugees from the}} crisis, {{who were able to}} escape or resettle in Western Countries continued to advocate for human rights, religious liberty, freedom of speech and political asylum for Czech political prisoners and dissidents. Many raised concerns about the Soviet Union and Red Army's continued military occupation of the Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse <b>of</b> <b>Communism</b> <b>in</b> Moscow and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} his busy schedule, travelling to the United States, England, Finland, Canada and Japan, and sketching a violin concerto, {{but by the}} first week of 1994 it was clear that cancer had taken hold, and after an operation the composer weakened quickly and died on 7 February at the age of eighty-one. He had, a few weeks before, been awarded Poland's highest honour, the Order of the White Eagle (only the second person to receive this since the collapse <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> Poland—the first had been Pope John Paul II). He was cremated; his devoted wife Danuta died shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|In January 1957, the US {{adopted the}} Eisenhower Doctrine and pledged {{to prevent the}} spread of {{communism}} and its perceived agents in the Middle East. Although Nasser was an opponent <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> the region, his promotion of pan-Arabism was viewed as a threat by pro-Western states in the region. Eisenhower tried to isolate Nasser and reduce his regional influence by attempting to transform King Saud into a counterweight. Also in January, the elected Jordanian prime minister and Nasser supporter Sulayman al-Nabulsi brought Jordan into a military pact with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|In postwar Poland, the {{government}} bought {{most of the}} land where the camp had stood, and built a large stone memorial there between 1959 and 1962. In 1964 Treblinka was declared a national monument of Jewish martyrology in a ceremony {{at the site of the}} former gas chambers. In the same year the first German trials were held regarding war crimes committed at Treblinka by former SS members. After the end <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> Poland in 1989, the number of visitors coming to Treblinka from abroad increased. An exhibition centre at the camp opened in 2006. It was later expanded and made into a branch of the Siedlce Regional Museum.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{some social}} scientists, such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Frank Gibney, refer to these changes as a revolution, one less {{dramatic}} than its Hungarian counterpart but one {{which may have}} had an even more profound impact on the Eastern Bloc. Timothy Garton Ash calls the Polish October the most significant event in the post-war history of Poland until the rise of Solidarity. History professor Iván T. Berend claims that while {{the effects of the}} Polish October on the Eastern Bloc may be disputed, it set the course for the eventual fall <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{there was}} a {{petition}} in Czech Republic to ban the promotion <b>of</b> <b>Communism</b> and <b>in</b> 2007, {{there was a}} proposed amendment to the law to ban Communist symbols. Both attempts failed.|$|R

5|$|Sang Penari {{touches on}} the history <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia, {{focusing}} on the nation's communist party spreading its ideology and the government's purge of the Communist Party's members from 1965–1966, which {{is thought to have}} killed several hundred thousand. It is only the third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later said that if he had written about the killings as they were depicted in the film, the repressive New Order government would have had him shot.|$|E
5|$|She {{listened to}} {{recordings}} of Balkan folk {{music as a}} child and became interested in the tradition. Later, she sang in and directed a Slavic chorus while an undergraduate at Yale University. She and some friends traveled to Eastern Europe in 1989, specifically Bulgaria and Bosnia, to study local musical customs. The recordings they made will be deposited in the Library of Congress. While Kostova was in Europe, the Berlin Wall collapsed, heralding the fall <b>of</b> <b>Communism</b> <b>in</b> Eastern Europe, events which shaped her understanding of history.|$|E
5|$|The {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> <b>in</b> the US {{was shaped}} by the Cold War, which began after World WarII when the Soviet Union failed to uphold the commitments it made at the Yalta Conference. Instead of holding elections for new governments, as agreed at Yalta, the Soviet Union occupied several Eastern European countries, leading to a strained relationship with the US. Subsequent international events served to increase the apparent danger that communism posed to Americans: the Stalinist threats in the Greek Civil War (1946–1949); the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948; and the 1948 blockade of Berlin.|$|E
