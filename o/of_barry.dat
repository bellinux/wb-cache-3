5|$|The extratropical {{remnants}} <b>of</b> <b>Barry</b> produced gusty winds {{along the}} Atlantic coastline which peaked at 60mph (97km/h) near Charleston, South Carolina. Around 200houses in Craven County, North Carolina, were without power after winds downed a power line. In North Carolina, adverse conditions {{from the storm}} delayed an elimination baseball game between the East Carolina University and Western Carolina University teams. In southeastern Virginia, the remnants <b>of</b> <b>Barry</b> caused over 60traffic accidents, which resulted in 10injuries. Rough seas off of Cape Fear left a sailboat containing three people requiring rescue from the Coast Guard. Rainfall extended into the Mid-Atlantic states through New England, with 4.50inches (113mm) reported at Absecon, New Jersey, 3.91inches (99mm) recorded near Central Park, New York, and 3.19inches (81mm) at Taunton, Massachusetts. The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry contributed to heavy rainfall and flooding in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. Roads and several driveways were washed out. Flash flooding was also reported in southeast New York, and high wind gusts caused sporadic tree damage. In New Jersey, northeast onshore flow associated with the remnants <b>of</b> <b>Barry</b> produced high tides and minor coastal flooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the battle appears to have {{originated}} due to a romantic misinterpretation of the numerous tumuli that existed towards the eastern boundary <b>of</b> <b>Barry</b> Parish, near the Lochty burn before the town of Carnoustie was founded in the late 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Camus was the {{supposed}} {{leader of a}} Norse expeditionary force defeated by the armies of King Malcolm II at the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Barry.</b> Tradition, popularised {{in the sixteenth century}} by historian Hector Boece, states that Camus fled the battle scene when defeat was imminent, and was caught and slain {{at the point where the}} cross now stands. The battle, and its main protagonists, including Camus, are now known to be historically inauthentic.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{dedicated}} to exhibiting {{the work of}} artists from the West of England, under the directorship <b>of</b> <b>Barry</b> Barker (1986–1991) the gallery moved towards a more general spread of contemporary art. Barker supervised a successful refurbishment of the gallery spaces and café bar by David Chipperfield. Before development work began, the Arnolfini was attracting over 285,000 visitors per year. Subsequent Directors have been Tessa Jackson (1991–1999), Caroline Collier (1999–2005) and Tom Trevor (2005-2013).|$|E
5|$|The {{cross is}} thought to date from the tenth century, and {{exhibits}} distinctive Hiberno-Scottish mission influences, in common with several other monuments in the area. Tradition and folk etymology suggest that the cross marked the burial site of Camus, leader of the Norse army purportedly defeated by King Malcolm II at the apocryphal Battle <b>of</b> <b>Barry.</b> The name of the stone is likely to derive from the extinct village of Camuston, which has a Celtic toponymy.|$|E
5|$|As he {{nears the}} cabin, the {{imaginary}} Barry appears and tells Alan {{that he will}} have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version of Alan, including the apparition <b>of</b> <b>Barry.</b> Alan is ready to accept that, forcing Alan to fight Taken illusions of Dr. Hartman, Barry, and the Andersons, defeating them all before he is able to reenter the cabin. His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—"Return".|$|E

5|$|Editorially, the {{newspaper}} {{remained in the}} liberal Republican camp, both strongly anti-communist and supportive of civil rights. In April, 1963, the Tribune published Martin Luther King's Letter from Birmingham Jail on its front page. The Tribune became a target <b>of</b> <b>Barry</b> Goldwater partisans in the 1964 presidential campaign. The leadership of the Tribune, while agreeing with Goldwater's approach to national defense, believed he pushed it to an extreme, and strongly opposed Goldwater's voting record on civil rights. After some internal debate, the Tribune endorsed Democrat Lyndon Johnson for the presidency that fall. The newspaper also {{played a major role}} in the election of New York City Mayor John Lindsay, a liberal Republican, in 1965.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Oklahoma {{promoted}} Bud Wilkinson, then {{an assistant}} coach, to head coach.

Wilkinson's tenure included a streak of 13consecutive conference championships (in addition to one by his predecessor). Oklahoma continued to perform well after Wilkinson left, but only returned to the national title picture following the hiring <b>of</b> <b>Barry</b> Switzer in 1973. Switzer began similarly to Wilkinson, with eight consecutive conference championships in addition to national championships in 1974 and 1975. Switzer added Oklahoma's sixth national championship in 1985.|$|E

The highway also briefly crosses the southwest corner <b>of</b> <b>Barry</b> County before it terminates an at intersection with Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) on the northwestern side of downtown Battle Creek.

5|$|This {{view was}} {{the norm for}} some time after Boece and is {{reflected}} in the Statistical Accounts for Aberlemno. It took until the mid-19th century for it to be pointed out that not only was there no evidence that the stones were Scandinavian in origin, there was also ample evidence that the stones were Pictish/Scottish in origin. The kirkyard stone predates the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Barry</b> by three centuries and the most widely accepted interpretation is that the stone commemorates the Pictish victory at the historical Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 AD.|$|E
