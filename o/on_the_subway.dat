5|$|Fare is payable by MetroCard. Since {{this card}} enables free {{transfers}} for a continuing ride <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> and bus systems, {{for many more}} riders there is effectively no fare at all for riding SIR. Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus, SIR, and a Manhattan bus or subway near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR's farebox recovery ratio in 2001 was 0.16that is, for every dollar of expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares, the lowest ratio of MTA agencies. The low farebox recovery ratio {{is part of the}} reason the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper which will simplify the accounting and subsidization of what is essentially a single line.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Joey Santiago and {{songwriter}} Black Francis (born Charles Thompson IV) met when they lived {{next to each}} other in a suite while attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

After six months, he returned to Amherst and dropped out of the university. Francis and Santiago spent 1984 working in a warehouse, with Francis composing songs on his acoustic guitar and writing lyrics <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> train.|$|E

5|$|The SIRT {{continued}} {{to lose money}} even as they rebuilt stations between Jefferson Avenue and New Dorp, almost into the 1970s. Rail traffic via the Arthur Kill Bridge dropped dramatically with the closing of Bethlehem Steel in 1960, and of U.S. Gypsum in 1972. On July 1, 1971, operation of the Tottenville line {{was turned over to}} the Staten Island Rapid Transit Operating Authority, a division of the state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the line itself was purchased by the city of New York. As part of the agreement, freight along the line was to be {{continued to}} be handled by the B On February 28, 1973, the first six new R44 cars—the same as the newest cars then in use <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> lines in the other boroughs—were put into service on the Staten Island Rapid Transit, replacing the PS Standard rolling stock that had been inherited from the B and had remained in continuous service since 1925. Between 1971 and 1973, a project to extend the high-level platforms at six stations commenced. A station rebuilding program began in 1985, and the line's R44s were overhauled, starting in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{had also}} arisen in Buczynski's {{relationship}} with Slater. Living and working {{together at the}} same premises, they had begun to argue regularly, and had both been taking part in sexual activity with other men, particularly in the gay bathhouses which could then be found in New York. By the summer of 1974 they had broken up, and although they briefly remained roommates, Buczynski soon collected together his belongings and moved back in {{with his mother and}} step-father in Ozone Park, where he converted the basement into a bedroom for himself. No longer working at The Warlock Shop, he found himself broke and isolated from the city's occult community, ultimately ceasing active coven work by September 1974. Eventually, he obtained a part-time job at the BookMasters bookstore at 1482 Broadway in Times Square, and it was while commuting home <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> one night that he met Bennie Geraci (1950–), a native of New Orleans who had moved to the city. Buczynski and Geraci soon entered into a relationship, with the former moving into the latter's small rented flat in Rego Park, Queens, which was shared with four other men. In January 1975, he lost his job due to the economic recession, but was able to secure a job as an office boy at J. Aron and Company, a commodities trading corporation based in Wall Street.|$|E
