5|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>comparative</b> philology in the 19th century, {{together with}} ethnological discoveries in the 20th century, established {{the science of}} myth. Since the Romantics, all study of myth has been comparative. Wilhelm Mannhardt, James Frazer, and Stith Thompson employed the comparative approach to collect and classify the themes of folklore and mythology. In 1871 Edward Burnett Tylor published his Primitive Culture, in which he applied the comparative method {{and tried to explain}} the origin and evolution of religion.* Robert A. Segal, Theorizing about Myth, 16 Tylor's procedure of drawing together material culture, ritual and myth of widely separated cultures influenced both Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. Max Müller applied the new science <b>of</b> <b>comparative</b> mythology to the study of myth, in which he detected the distorted remains of Aryan nature worship. Bronisław Malinowski emphasized the ways myth fulfills common social functions. Claude Lévi-Strauss and other structuralists have compared the formal relations and patterns in myths throughout the world.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} was described twice by three American ichthyologists: as Dasybatus dipterurus by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in Proceedings of the United States National Museum, and as Trygon brevis by Samuel Garman in Bulletin of the Museum <b>of</b> <b>Comparative</b> Zoology. Jordan and Gilbert's account {{was published in}} May while Garman's was published in October, making dipterurus (feminine dipterura) the correct name as it was published first. However, when Garman synonymized the two in 1913 he inappropriately gave precedence to brevis, leading to long-standing confusion. Both Dasybatus and Trygon were later synonymized with the genus Dasyatis, but many authors still listed D.brevis in place of or in addition to D.dipterura. Garman also synonymized the Hawaiian stingray (D.hawaiensis) with D.dipterura in 1913, which has since been followed by most authors but requires more study for confirmation.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss a {{particular}} type <b>of</b> <b>comparatives,</b> that we call reflexive comparatives. These reflexive comparatives have the property that they compare an object with itself, but with respect to different temporal, spatial or scalar indices.

A semantics <b>of</b> reflexive <b>comparatives</b> is proposed which is based on paths in scalar and other domains. 1 Reflexive comparatives In this paper we want to draw attention to a type <b>of</b> <b>comparatives</b> that has not received much attention in the literature.
