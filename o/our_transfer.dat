40|$|Making {{use of a}} {{modified}} version, due to McCord, of the Dold-Thom construction of ordinary homology, we give a simple topological definition of a transfer for ramified cov-ering maps in homology with arbitrary coefficients. The transfer is induced by a suitable map between topological groups. We also define a new cohomology transfer which is dual to the homology transfer. This duality allows us to show that <b>our</b> homology <b>transfer</b> coincides with the one given by L. Smith. With our definition of the homology transfer we can give simpler proofs of {{the properties of the}} known transfer and of some new ones. <b>Our</b> <b>transfers</b> can also be defined in Karoubi’s approach to homology and cohomology. Furthermore, we show that one can define mixed transfers from other homology or co-homology theories to the ordinary ones. Copyright © 2006 Hindawi Publishing Corporation.

60|$|In a word, the {{difference}} of an unselfish from a selfish love, even in this life, consists in this, that the latter depends on <b>our</b> <b>transferring</b> <b>our</b> present passion or appetite, or rather on our dilating and stretching it out in imagination, as the covetous man does;--while in the former we carry ourselves forward under a very different state from the present, as the young man, who restrains his appetites in respect of his future self as a tranquil and healthy old man. This last requires as great an effort of disinterestedness as, if not a greater than, {{to give up a}} present enjoyment to another person who is present to us. The alienation from distance in time and from diversity of circumstance, is greater in the one case than in the other. And let it be remembered, that a Christian may exert all the virtues and virtuous charities of humanity in any state; yea, in the pangs of a wounded conscience, he may feel for the future periods of his own lost spirit, just as Adam for all his posterity.|$|R

30|$|It can be {{concluded}} {{from the above}} experiments that all <b>our</b> local <b>transfer</b> learning methods work better than non-transfer learning method, because they reduce the prediction bias of model which is trained and tested on different-distribution datasets. Our local k-NN family transfer learning methods perform better than the global k-NN transfer learning method generally, and the {{reason may be that}} an appropriate k value in k-NN methods could reflect more subtle nature in density estimation. All <b>our</b> local <b>transfer</b> learning methods show comparable performance with KMM method in all situations. TTkNN method exceeds kNN and obtains the best performance among all the methods in half of situations. It could be guessed that TTkNN uses both test and training data information, while kNN only uses test data. Clust method performs well in most situations, this proves its applicability, and better density clustering methods may further enhance this method.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{transfer}} learning for the PI and NLI problems, aiming {{to propose a}} general framework, which can effectively and efficiently adapt the shared knowledge learned from a resource-rich source domain to a resource- poor target domain. Specifically, since most existing transfer learning methods only focus on learning a shared feature space across domains while ignoring {{the relationship between the}} source and target domains, we propose to simultaneously learn shared representations and domain relationships in a unified framework. Furthermore, we propose an efficient and effective hybrid model by combining a sentence encoding- based method and a sentence interaction-based method as our base model. Extensive experiments on both paraphrase identification and natural language inference demonstrate that our base model is efficient and has promising performance compared to the competing models, and <b>our</b> <b>transfer</b> learning method can help to significantly boost the performance. Further analysis shows that the inter-domain and intra-domain relationship captured by our model are insightful. Last but not least, we deploy <b>our</b> <b>transfer</b> learning model for PI into our online chatbot system, which can bring in significant improvements over our existing system. Finally, we launch our new system on the chatbot platform Eva in our E-commerce site AliExpress. Comment:...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose to}} help weakly {{supervised}} object localization for classes where location annotations are not available, by transferring things and stuff knowledge {{from a source}} set with available annotations. The source and target classes might share similar appearance (e. g. bear fur is similar to cat fur) or appear against similar background (e. g. horse and sheep appear against grass). To exploit this, we acquire three types of knowledge from the source set: a segmentation model trained on both thing and stuff classes; similarity relations between target and source classes; and co-occurrence relations between thing and stuff classes in the source. The segmentation model is used to generate thing and stuff segmentation maps on a target image, while the class similarity and co-occurrence knowledge help refining them. We then incorporate these maps as new cues into a multiple instance learning framework (MIL), propagating the transferred knowledge from the pixel level to the object proposal level. In extensive experiments, we conduct <b>our</b> <b>transfer</b> from the PASCAL Context dataset (source) to the ILSVRC, COCO and PASCAL VOC 2007 datasets (targets). We evaluate <b>our</b> <b>transfer</b> across widely different thing classes, including some that are not similar in appearance, but appear against similar background. The results demonstrate significant improvement over standard MIL, and we outperform the state-of-the-art in the transfer setting.
