5|$|In 1995, {{the band}} contributed {{a cover of}} the Underdog theme song to be {{included}} on the tribute album , produced by Ralph Sall for MCA. Later that year, Haynes's side project, P, issued an eponymous LP on Capitol, while Coffey's Trance Syndicate label released the first Butthole Surfers compilation album. Titled The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt, it was mostly live tracks recorded at different venues from 1985 to 1991. In December, Butthole Surfers initiated what would become an extended legal battle with Touch and Go. At first they were seeking to increase their profits from the albums released by the label, because the label chose a strategy of non-promotion. The case quickly became a fight for all ownership rights that dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than three years.|$|E
5|$|Penis pumps induce erections {{without the}} need for drugs or {{invasive}} treatments. To use a pump, the man inserts his penis into a cylinder, then pumps it to create a vacuum which draws blood into the penis, making it erect. He then slides a ring from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of the penis to hold the blood in and maintain the erection. A man who is able to get an erection but has trouble maintaining it for long enough can use a ring by itself. The ring cannot be left <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than 30 minutes and cannot be used {{at the same time as}} anticoagulant medications.|$|E
5|$|Dispatched to France in February 1915, the Canadian Division {{was briefly}} {{initiated}} to trench warfare {{on the periphery}} of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle before being attached to the British 2nd Army under Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien in the Belgian town of Ypres. It was in front of Ypres on 22 April that the Canadians bore the brunt of the most furious German attack of the year. In the afternoon at 5.00 pm the Germans began heavy shelling of the French trenches and the Canadians and the French Algerian troops stationed next to them saw a fog traveling across no-mans land, covering the advance of German forces. The fog was chlorine gas, the first occasion in which this substance had been used in warfare. The Algerians broke and fled, suffering over 6,000 casualties in a matter of minutes and the Canadians were consequently forced to defend twice the length of their front line in the face of a new and deadly weapon. Although the Canadian Division held <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than two days, much ground was lost and the division had themselves suffered over 50% casualties, nearly 6,000 men.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} Helen passed through, cleanup efforts began as power crews had to remove downed trees before fixing power lines. The main power {{lines in the}} city were {{restored}} within 24hours and rural areas were stated to have their power back {{within a day or}} two. Two days after the storm, 500 homes remained without electricity and frustrated residents were further angered after discovering that the Power and Water agency was in control of tree removal and not emergency services. With the power company in charge of clearing downed trees, they stated that their crews would only be dealing with cases involved power lines. Residents with trees in their yards or even on their homes were told to contact private contractors to remove them. By 9January, more than 100 homes were still without power in northern Darwin, resulting in angry outcries from those still left in the dark. Cleanup efforts dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than two months as debris was still present in Darwin in March. Removal of tree stumps took through at least mid-April as the cost to remove downed trees exceeded A$1million (US$882,000). Due to the damage wrought by Helen, its name was retired following its usage. However, it was not replaced by any particular name as a new naming scheme was implemented the following season.|$|E

Howard Marshall had verbally promised him {{a portion of the}} estate; like Smith, Howard III was also left out of J. Howard's will. The case went <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than a decade, producing a highly publicized court battle in Texas and several judicial decisions that have gone both for and against Smith in that time.|$|E

Advertising support was initially weak in the small market, and financial losses started mounting. As early as April and May 1974, the station began advertising in The Free Lance-Star that stock in Television Fredericksburg, Inc. was available to local residents. One of two non-news productions, the daily Children's World, was canceled and replaced by the then-relatively unknown The Phil Donahue Show {{at the end of}} the 1973-74 season.

25|$|In 217, Liu Bei {{started the}} Hanzhong Campaign to {{seize control of}} Hanzhong Commandery, which was under Cao Cao's control. His force {{encountered}} resistance led by Xiahou Yuan at Yangping Pass. The confrontation dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than a year until one night in 219, when Liu Bei {{set fire to the}} barbed fence around Xiahou Yuan's camp at the foot of Mount Dingjun. Alarmed by the attack, Xiahou Yuan sent Zhang He to defend the eastern corner of the camp while he guarded the south. Liu Bei's main force pressed against Zhang He, outmatching the latter. Xiahou Yuan despatched a fraction of his own troops to help Zhang He. Huang Zhong rallied his men and, accompanied by thundering drums, they descended upon Xiahou Yuan's dwindling force. The battle became a rout and Xiahou Yuan was killed in action. The victory at Mount Dingjun was a major stepping stone to the conquest of Hanzhong. Huang Zhong was promoted to General Who Attacks the West (征西將軍) for his contributions in the Hanzhong Campaign.|$|E
500|$|On 10 June 1963, U.S. correspondents were {{informed}} that [...] "something important" [...] would happen the following morning on the road outside the Cambodian embassy in Saigon. Most of the reporters disregarded the message, since the Buddhist crisis had at that point been going <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than a month, {{and the next day}} only a few journalists turned up, including David Halberstam of The New York Times and Malcolm Browne, the Saigon bureau chief for the Associated Press. Đức arrived as part of a procession that had begun at a nearby pagoda. Around 350 monks and nuns marched in two phalanxes, preceded by an Austin Westminster sedan, carrying banners printed in both English and Vietnamese. They denounced the Diệm government and its policy towards Buddhists, demanding that it fulfill its promises of religious equality. Another monk offered himself, but Đức's seniority prevailed.|$|E

500|$|Sissoi Veliky (...) was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} {{built for}} the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1890s. The ship's construction was marred by organizational, logistical and engineering problems and dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than five years. She was commissioned in October 1896 with an appalling number of design and construction faults, {{and only a few}} of them were fixed during her lifetime. Immediately after sea trials, Sissoi Veliky sailed to the Mediterranean to enforce the naval blockade of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War. On , 1897 she suffered a devastating explosion of the aft gun turret that killed 21 men. After nine months in the docks of Toulon for repairs, the ship sailed to the Far East to reinforce the Russian presence there. In the summer of 1900, Sissoi Veliky supported the international campaign against the Boxer Rebellion in China. Sailors from Sissoi Veliky and the battleship [...] participated in the defence of the International Legations in Beijing for more than two months.|$|E
