500|$|Clarkson {{performed}} [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. Her performance garnered positive {{reviews from}} critics, who considered {{it one of}} the highlights in the event. Performing barefoot, Clarkson sang the song as rain cascaded onto the audience. Clarkson told People that one of her favourite moments on television was performing [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at the MTV Video Music Awards, saying [...] "I hate being all dressed up, so the fact that I was soaking wet with mascara smeared all <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> was definitely the highlight of my evening!" [...] Becky Bain of Idolator thought that the performance was Clarkson's most memorable live performances while Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times thought Clarkson's performance was very solid despite the feeling that she sounded better dry than drenched. Clarkson performed the song on Saturday Night Live in 2005, along with the 2006 BRIT Awards which took place in Earls Court, London.|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing {{and you can see}} right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights all <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} the filming of I Wanted Wings that Lake {{developed}} her signature look. Lake's long blonde hair accidentally fell over her right eye during a take and created a [...] "peek-a-boo" [...] effect. [...] "I was playing a sympathetic drunk, I had my arm on a table... it slipped... and my hair- it was always baby fine and had this natural break- fell <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face...</b> It became my trademark and purely by accident", she recalled.|$|E
6000|$|A {{momentary}} convulsion passed <b>over</b> <b>my</b> uncle's <b>face.</b> [...] "The {{will of the}} Lord be done," [...] said he, almost with a groan of anguish.|$|R
6000|$|I {{thought it}} was very strange that she should ask me, and answered, 'Nothing.' I turned <b>over</b> on <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> I recollect, to hide my {{trembling}} lip, which answered her with greater truth. 'Davy,' said my mother. 'Davy, my child!' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{gave him}} my hand. He said to himself, 'Aye, aye, here are fingers that have seen canny service.' Then running his hand <b>over</b> <b>my</b> hair, <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>my</b> dress, he went on with his soliloquy; 'Aye, aye, muisted hair, braidclaith o' the best, and seenteen hundred linen on his back, at the least o' it. And how do you think, my braw birkie, that you are to pass for a {{tramping}} fiddler?' ...|$|R
60|$|MARGARET (wetting {{the other}} foot). And the sheet <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{saw from}} this that I could still speak. So he laid another thick wet towel <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> {{before he spoke}} again.|$|E
60|$|A hand is <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> A cold hand. I peep {{between the}} fingers To watch {{the world that}} lingers Behind, yet keeps pace.|$|E
60|$|Not {{having a}} veil {{to put down}} <b>over</b> <b>my</b> own <b>face,</b> I stooped {{and picked up the}} newspaper. Her devilish {{determination}} quite upset me for the moment. I actually had to steady myself before I could speak to her again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Before a word {{could be}} spoken, {{a look of}} hopeless, heart-piercing woe came <b>over</b> <b>my</b> friend's <b>face.</b> She began to moan and wring her hands most piteously. 'Oh, where am I?' she wailed. 'It is so cold, so cold! So cold and dark! Won't {{somebody}} help me? Oh, help me!' ...|$|R
60|$|In short, I turned <b>over</b> on <b>my</b> <b>face</b> when I came to that, {{and got a}} good {{grasp on}} the hair {{on each side of}} my head, and {{wrenched}} it well. All the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served <b>my</b> <b>face</b> right, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.|$|R
60|$|I cast my arm <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> {{and pretended}} to be asleep. Presently I {{heard the sound of}} a man passing through the bushes, and the Tlascalan stood over me.|$|E
60|$|The tears--miserable, weak, women's {{tears of}} vexation and rage--started to my eyes. She smiled sadly, {{and put her}} {{handkerchief}} <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> to hide for me the betrayal of my own weakness--the weakness of all others which she knew that I most despised.|$|E
60|$|Presently I went sound asleep. How long I slept I do not know. When I awoke it {{was with}} a sharp, {{stinging}} sensation in the head. A pungent odor filled my nose, the scent coming from a handkerchief some one had thrown <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, see or not see, we will go, Luka. If {{we are to}} {{be killed}} it shall be making a fight for it, and not having our throats cut like sheep. Now, I think you are more {{accustomed}} to chewing tough food than I am, so I will roll <b>over</b> on <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and do you set to work and bite through the thong." ...|$|R
60|$|Feet swayed about me, {{and some}} hobnailed miner kicked my ankle and went stumbling. There were shouts and curses, and then {{everything}} had swept past me. I rolled <b>over</b> on <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and beheld the chauffeur, young Verrall, and Lord Redcar--the latter holding up his long skirts of fur, and making a grotesque figure--one behind the other, in full bolt across a coldly comet-lit interval, towards the open gates of the colliery.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could do}} it still better," [...] said Jock, [...] "if I blacked myself all <b>over,</b> not only <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> but all the rest, and put on nothing but my red flannel drawers and a turban. They'd take me for the ghost of the little nigger he flogged to death, and Allen could write {{something}} pathetic and stunning." ...|$|R
6000|$|A hot flush spread <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> Even to her I had not betrayed my apprehensions on this painful subject. Perhaps it {{was because}} of this very reason, knowing me as she did, that she had divined my fate. Could my father have spoken of it to anyone? ...|$|E
60|$|She {{heard and}} {{straightened}} herself. Her whole body seemed to become rigid as though with an agony of joy. Her blind eyes flashed, her lips quivered. She stretched out her hand, feeling at the darkness. Her fingers touched my forehead, and thence she ran them swiftly <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If the {{difference}} be very marked they do. For instance, I needn't wear a hideous long bit of cloth <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> in Constantinople because I am a woman. But when the discrepancies are small, {{then they have}} to be attended to. So I shan't walk about with you any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned me}} <b>over</b> upon <b>my</b> <b>face</b> with his crutch, {{and the next}} moment I felt the cords that tied my hands give way, and knew {{that they had been}} cut, then my legs and feet were {{loosened}} from their lashings, and I was a free man. I heard the fellow say, [...] "Get up!" [...] whereupon I stood upon my feet and gazed about me, though my brain still swam, and all things appeared blurred and distorted to my sight, the sky and the sea and the faces around me being all strangely mingled together. Then presently, as my confusion began to fade away from me, I heard the one-legged man speaking to me.|$|R
60|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} we reached Sodos, situated on a spur between two streams, but so surrounded by fruit trees that little could be seen of the country. The house was spacious, clean and comfortable, and the people very obliging. Many {{of the women and}} children had never seen a white man before, and were very sceptical as to my being the same colour all <b>over,</b> as <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> They begged me to show them my arms and body, and they were so kind and good-tempered that I felt bound to give them some satisfaction, so I turned up my trousers and let them see the colour of my leg, which they examined with great interest.|$|R
6000|$|A look {{of relief}} passed <b>over</b> <b>my</b> father's honest <b>face,</b> {{for he was}} never very easy in his brother-in-law's company. [...] "I {{have been to the}} Admiralty," [...] said he, [...] "and I trust that I shall have a ship when war breaks out; by all {{accounts}} it will not be long first. Lord St. Vincent told me so with his own lips. But I am at Fladong's, Rodney, where, if you will come and sup with me, you will see some of my messmates from the Mediterranean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now'--continued the old woman, with {{singular}} earnestness, yet smiling strangely {{at her own}} folly--'I {{want one}} of you, my children--when your mother is dressed and in the coffin---I want one of you to hold a looking-glass <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> Who knows but I may take a glimpse at myself, and see whether all's right?' ...|$|E
60|$|Already {{they were}} losing their tempers, {{slapping}} their customers with wet towels and jabbing great brushfuls of soap into their mouths. My barber was leaning <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> with his whole body. In another minute {{one or the}} other of them would have been sufficiently provoked to have dealt his customer a blow behind the ear.|$|E
60|$|Finally {{a letter}} came--my first love letter, and surely {{never was a}} love letter {{received}} under stranger circumstances. It began abruptly as all the letters had begun, plunging {{into the middle of}} the writer's strain of thought without any preface. The first words drove the blood to my heart and then sent it flying hotly all <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was {{my first}} idea to have crawled, and then I thought speed was the main thing, and stood half up to make a rush. The same moment from somewhere {{between me and the}} sea there came a flash and a report, and a rifle bullet screeched in my ear. I swung {{straight}} round and up with my gun, but the brute had a Winchester, and before I could as much as see him his second shot knocked me over like a nine-pin. I seemed to fly in the air, then came down by the run and lay half a minute, silly; and then I found my hands empty, and my gun had flown <b>over</b> <b>my</b> head as I fell. It makes a man mighty wide awake to be in the kind of box that I was in. I scarcely knew where I was hurt, or whether I was hurt or not, but turned right <b>over</b> on <b>my</b> <b>face</b> to crawl after my weapon. Unless you have tried to get about with a smashed leg you don't know what pain is, and I let out a howl like a bullock's.|$|R
60|$|With {{that the}} door grated and rang, the key was turned in the lock, and their iron tread sounded on the stone stairs, going upwards. The room was high, narrow, and lit by a barred and stanchioned window, far above my reach, even if I had been unbound. I shame to say it, but I rolled <b>over</b> on <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and wept. This {{was the end of}} my hopes and proud heart. That they would burn me, despite their threats I scarce believed, for I had in nowise {{offended}} Holy Church, or in matters of the Faith, and only for such heretics, or wicked dealers in art-magic, is lawfully ordained the death by fire. But here was I prisoner, all that I had won at Orleans would do little more than pay my own ransom; from the end of my risk and travail I was now further away than ever.|$|R
5000|$|Dickens did {{not break}} down until he {{returned}} home, when, his daughter Mary later recalled, [...] "I remember what a change seemed to have come <b>over</b> <b>my</b> dear father's <b>face</b> when we saw him again... how pale and sad it looked.". All that night he sat keeping watch over his daughter's body, supported by his friend Mark Lemon. The next day Dickens wrote to his wife Catherine, who was recuperating at Malvern in Worcestershire. Anxious that the news might cause a further breakdown in her health, Dickens wrote [...] "I think her very ill", even though Dora was already dead. Forster delivered the letter to her at Malvern himself, and eventually told her the truth. The letter read: ...|$|R
6000|$|... ------ {{taking my}} likeness, I said that such changes would come <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> {{that she would}} not know me when we met again in heaven. [...] "See if I do not!" [...] said she, smiling. There was the most {{peculiar}} and beautiful humor in the point itself, and in her manner, that can be imagined.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{made him}} invent such an atrocity?" [...] Heyst exclaimed. [...] "He seems a stupid animal. He is stupid. How did he manage to hatch that pretty tale? Have I a {{particularly}} vile countenance? Is black selfishness written all <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face?</b> Or is {{that sort of}} thing so universally human that it might be said of anybody?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{continued}} the old woman, with singular earnestness, yet smiling strangely {{at her own}} folly, [...] "I want one of you, my children, when your mother is dressed and in the coffin,--I want one of you to hold a looking-glass <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> Who knows but I may take a glimpse at myself and see whether all's right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One day a calf that we had, died. That night I broke its bones, dumped it into {{a coarse}} sack and tied it up with wire. I put on an old shirt, tore a sleeve 'most out of it, and the collar half off, tangled up my hair, put some red ink {{on my hands and}} spashed some of it <b>over</b> <b>my</b> shirt and <b>face.</b> I must have looked like I'd been having the fight of my life. I put the sack in a wagon and drove out to George's cabin. When I halloed, he came out in a yellow dressing-gown, a Turkish cap and patent leather shoes. George always was a great dresser.|$|R
60|$|She paused, {{appeared}} to meditate, and turned towards me. Her head was still inclining on my bosom, and she gazed upwards at <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> as fondly {{as she did}} in that tender meeting we held just after my return home, in the family room. There was sufficient strength to enable her to raise her pallid but not emaciated hand to <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> even while she passed it <b>over</b> <b>my</b> cheeks, once more parting the curls on my temples, and playing with my hair, with infantile fondness.|$|R
60|$|At {{last they}} ceased talking and fell fast asleep, leaving me awake, {{seated on a}} chest with <b>my</b> <b>face</b> bent <b>over</b> <b>my</b> knees between my hands. And there I sat, till at length the dull beating against the ship's bows, and the silence around soothed me down, and I fell asleep as I sat.|$|R
