His closest competitor, Ivory Williams, received a ban for marijuana usage, leaving Chambers as a strong favourite.

Banned from the 2010 Commonwealth Games, he set his sights on making the team for the 2010 European Athletics Championships.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's assassin Godse made {{no attempt}} to escape and was seized by the witnesses. He was arrested. In the weeks that followed, his {{collaborators}} were arrested as well. Godse was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha. They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for the frenzy of violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as if <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a monopoly of the truth. Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} prior to the July 1940 Democratic National Convention, there was much {{speculation}} as to whether Roosevelt would break with longstanding tradition and run for an unprecedented third term. The two-term tradition, although not yet enshrined in the Constitution, had been established by George Washington when he refused to run for a third term in the 1796 presidential election. Roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement as to his willingness to be a candidate again, and he even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as James Farley, that he would not run for a third term and that they could seek the Democratic nomination. However, as Germany swept through Western Europe and menaced the Britain in mid-1940, Roosevelt decided that <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the Nazi threat. He was aided by the party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat Wendell Willkie, the popular Republican nominee.|$|E

Oppenheimer claimed to have invented the other contacts to conceal the identity of Chevalier, whose identity he believed would be immediately apparent if he named only one contact, but whom he believed to be innocent of any disloyalty. The 1943 fabrication and the shifting nature of his accounts figured prominently in the 1954 inquiry.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of the 3 March 1943 the Luftwaffe was active again. Cunningham {{scrambled}} too late to get contact with the GCI's contact. He climbed toward a searchlight box. The searchlights operated in a box-shape, separated by evenly spaced markers. Each fighter was given a box and flew to its allotted marker beacon. There he orbited until the lights illuminated a target, or formed a cone where he could pick up an AI contact. Soon he had a contact—a Dornier Do 217. He closed in but his cannons jammed. After sitting behind the Dornier for some time and trying in vain to encourage the guns to fire, the German crew suddenly woke up and dived away. Cunningham was furious. Three-quarters of the squadron got airborne but <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen an enemy. Unsatisfied with ground and aircrews, he used his influence in the small night-fighter community to bring in personnel from his old unit, 604, currently languishing in Cornwall.

2500|$|As Robert Nichols {{stated in}} The Times:Sir Henry possessed the fullest {{as well as}} the wisest mind I have ever known.

On each of such topics he not only appeared to have more information than anybody in the room, but spoke after a more illuminating fashion, for, like Leonardo (on whom he was an authority) he had a supreme eye for the significant. Nor did he resemble Leonardo in mind <b>only.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> Leonardo's lofty human compassion, humility, patience, and profound serenity of spirit." [...] (10 October 1940) ...|$|E
2500|$|John's reign {{was marked}} from the {{beginning}} with instability. He came to the throne in June 1280, following the betrayal and death of his brother George (r. 1266–1280) by his own officials. His first recorded act as Emperor was in 1281, when he received an embassy from Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) consisting of George Acropolites and a prominent churchman {{by the name of}} Xiphilinos; the goal of this mission was to convince John to discontinue using the title of [...] "Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans". Michael had gained the throne of the Empire of Nicaea through a coup against the youthful heir John IV Laskaris some 20 years before, then gained possession of Constantinople itself from the Latin Empire, and based on this achievement Michael believed that <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the right to this title. This was not the only reason the Byzantine emperor regarded John as a threat: some opponents of Michael's acceptance of union with the Western Church saw John as a viable Orthodox candidate for the imperial throne. Michael considered high-ranking members of the Byzantine aristocracy who refused to embrace the union as threats to his reign, and they were imprisoned, flogged, blinded, or murdered.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the federalist}} forces in open disarray and the polls {{showing that the}} yes side was going to win, Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin {{suggested}} organizing a gigantic [...] "unity rally" [...] in Montreal. Most of the Cabinet was opposed to Tobin's idea, but Chrétien decided to support the rally, telling Tobin at the Cabinet meeting [...] "Brian-Go!" [...] Chrétien's chief of staff Jean Pelletier later recalled that [...] "We muscled in" [...] on leading the no forces as Johnson, the nominal leader of the no committee {{was considered to be}} an inept leader who would lose the referendum on his own. Facing defeat, Chrétien did an U-turn on the question of a [...] "distinct society", saying in a speech on October 24 in Verdun that the federal government was now open to the idea of recognizing Quebec as a [...] "distinct society" [...] in the constitution. In a speech before the Liberal caucus on October 25, Chrétien acknowledged openly the possibility of defeat, and lashed out at the Quebec media whom he accused of pushing [...] "a big pile of shit" [...] that was allowing the yes side to win people over, and suggested that he might resign if the oui side won. On October 26, 1995, Montreal radio station disk jockey Pierre Brassard telephoned Queen Elizabeth II pretending to be Chrétien; he discussed the pending referendum, but also rambled about odd subjects, such as what the Queen would be wearing for Halloween and placing her effigy on Canadian Tire money. The Queen later said to Chrétien: [...] "I didn't think you sounded quite like yourself, but I thought, given all the duress you were under, you might have been drunk." [...] The result of Tobin's efforts was the Unity Rally of October 27, 1995, when 100,000 people showed up. On the night of the referendum, the prospect of a victory for the yes side was considered to be so realistic that Defence Minister David Collenette ordered the military to begin contingency plans to defend federal property in Quebec from a separatist take-over should the yes side prevail. On October 30, 1995, the federalist no side won by the narrowest of margins. Chrétien blamed the narrow victory on the Quebec Liberals under Johnson, whom he claimed had betrayed him, and argued the federalists would have done much better if <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> intervened in the referendum earlier, and presented the no case in terms of Trudeau-style [...] "hard federalism" [...] instead of the [...] "soft federalist" [...] no case presented by Johnson, which depicted the benefits of Confederation in purely economic terms, and had a strongly nationalist, albeit federalist tone of language.|$|E
