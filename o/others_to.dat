They would have increased the desire of <b>others</b> <b>to</b> be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E

For example, several references to women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received by women have been found. However, Edward F.

5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and <b>others</b> <b>to</b> be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and <b>others</b> <b>to</b> be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Edward Bernays {{helped the}} Lucky Strike {{cigarette}} brand increase its sales among the female demographic.

5|$|San Martín {{thought that}} if he joined forces with Bolívar {{he would be able}} to defeat the remnant royalist forces in Peru. Both liberators would meet in Quito, so San Martín {{appointed}} Torre Tagle to manage the government during his absence. Bolivar was unable to meet San Martín at the arranged date, so San Martín returned to Lima, but still left Tagle in government. Bolívar moved from Quito to Guayaquil, which secured its independence. There were discussions on the future of the region: some factions wanted to join Colombia, <b>others</b> <b>to</b> join Peru, and <b>others</b> <b>to</b> become a new nation. Bolívar ended the discussion by annexing Guayaquil into Colombia. There was Peruvian pressure on San Martín to do a similar thing, to annex Guayaquil to Peru.|$|E
