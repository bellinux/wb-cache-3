He attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. During the 1180s, he was more active in the affairs of his diocese, and appears less often in the secular affairs of the kingdom, but in 1189 he {{took part in the}} coronation of King Richard I of England. In April 1191 he was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> selected to arbitrate between the chancellor William Longchamp and Prince John of England. He also attended the trial of William Longchamp on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge between Reading and Windsor that dismissed Longchamp from his offices. He may have been an unsuccessful candidate for the chancellorship of England. He was active as a bishop: some 122 acta from his time as bishop survive. He built the hospital of St. John in Bath, as well as building extensively at Wells Cathedral and starting the construction of the Bishop's Palace. He also issued a confirmation of the status of the town of Wells.|$|E
5|$|In {{the three}} royal tombs at Vergina, {{professional}} painters decorated {{the walls with}} a mythological scene of Hades abducting Persephone and royal hunting scenes, while lavish grave goods including weapons, armor, drinking vessels, and personal items were housed with the dead, whose bones were burned before burial in golden coffins. Some grave goods and decorations were common in other Macedonian tombs, yet some items found at Vergina were distinctly tied to royalty, including a diadem, luxurious goods, and arms and armor. Scholars have debated about {{the identity of the}} tomb occupants since the discovery of their remains in 1977–1978, and recent research and forensic examination have concluded that at least one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> buried was PhilipII. Located near Tomb1 are the above-ground ruins of a heroon, a shrine for cult worship of the dead.

40|$|In article <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> an electro {{traumatism}} and the {{new approach}} for its decision is considered.

It is noticed that for maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accepted level <b>of</b> safe conditions of person interaction with electro installations in the certain environment the sudden, unapproved exit of electric energy from electro technical systems on <b>the</b> <b>person</b> should not exceed its limiting values; maximum permissible values of electric energy absorbed by a body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> should be established taking into consideration parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concrete <b>person,</b> limiting values of touch pressure, a current which proceeds through a body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person,</b> sorts, frequencies, and time of action <b>of</b> a current. <b>The</b> technique <b>of</b> definition of maximum permissible sizes of pressure of a touch and currents taking into account energy absorbed by <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> is offered.

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this article}} is to show the deep {{affinity}} between non-western ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> and antiindividualistic philosophical ideas through a re-reading of some central texts about <b>the</b> anthropology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person.</b> African concepts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person,</b> as described by Fortes, Augé and Riesman, have indeed a remarkable consonance with <b>the</b> intersubjective philosophy <b>of</b> Charles Taylor and Axel Honneth.

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this thesis}} {{is to explore}} {{implications}} of a necessary presupposition of a theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> in <b>the</b> aims <b>of</b> Personal and Social Education (PSE), with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> furnishing a conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> which retains a significant concept of personal agency in light of constraints on action. From the position that <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> as agent is central to <b>the</b> aims <b>of</b> PSE, {{it is argued that}} given the tension between <b>the</b> conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> as autonomous and recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasticity <b>of</b> <b>persons,</b> <b>the</b> justification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unity <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> suggests itself as a relevant and useful approach. This is held to provide a means of approaching issues of personhood which are central to <b>the</b> concerns <b>of</b> PSE and which also provides important insights into <b>the</b> some issues <b>of</b> agency. It is argued in the second chapter that the relation between a theory of personal identity and <b>the</b> aims <b>of</b> PSE which presuppose such a theory is best understood as one of interdependence. From this position, it is argued that <b>the</b> conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> as potentially autonomous does not necessitate acceptance of a strict identity or non-reductionist theory of personal identity. It is argued, on <b>the</b> grounds <b>of</b> internal coherence and the ideals evident in discussions <b>of</b> PSE, that <b>the</b> alternative, a continuity theory is preferable. In the fourth chapter <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> constraints on <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> and their effect on <b>the</b> acceptability <b>of</b> theories of personal identity is addressed. It is argued that certain constraints lead to <b>the</b> rejection <b>of</b> reductionism with respect to persons but do not affect <b>the</b> acceptability <b>of</b> a continuity theory or its importance. The argument supports the view that <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> personal identity and <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> are indeterminate and allow a qualified form of social ascriptivism. Implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> which has been argued for, are illustrated and explored in the fmal two chapters, where the discussion focuses on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> students' autobiographical writing in PSE. The argument is made that <b>the</b> conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> argued for in the previous chapters has advantages over that contained in <b>the</b> traditional understanding <b>of</b> autobiography.
