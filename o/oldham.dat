5|$|From its {{founding}} in the 9th century until the Industrial Revolution, <b>Oldham</b> {{is believed to have}} been little more than a scattering of small and insignificant settlements spread across the moorland and dirt tracks that linked Manchester to York. Although not mentioned in the Domesday Book, <b>Oldham</b> does appear in legal documents from the Middle Ages, invariably recorded as territory under the control of minor ruling families and barons. In the 13th century, <b>Oldham</b> was documented as a manor held from the Crown by a family surnamed <b>Oldham,</b> whose seat was at Werneth Hall.|$|E

5|$|On {{the back}} of the Industrial Revolution, <b>Oldham</b> {{developed}} an extensive coal mining sector, correlated to supporting the local cotton industry and the town's inhabitants, though there is evidence of small scale coal mining in the area as early as the 16th century. The <b>Oldham</b> Coalfield stretched from Royton in the north to Bardsley in the south and in addition to <b>Oldham,</b> included the towns of Middleton and Chadderton to the west. The <b>Oldham</b> Coalfield was the site of over 150 collieries during its recorded history. Although some contemporary sources suggest there was coal mining in <b>Oldham</b> at a commercial scale by 1738, older sources attribute the commercial expansion of coal mining with the arrival in the town of two Welsh labourers, John Evans and William Jones, around 1770. Foreseeing the growth in demand for coal as a source of motive and steam power, they acquired colliery rights for <b>Oldham,</b> which by 1771 had 14 colliers. The mines were largely to the southwest of the town around Hollinwood and Werneth and provided enough coal to accelerate Oldham's rapid development at the centre of the cotton boom. At its height in the mid-19th century, when it was dominated by the Lees and Jones families, <b>Oldham</b> coal was mainly sourced from many small collieries whose lives varied from a few years to many decades, although two of the four largest collieries survived to nationalisation. In 1851, collieries employed more than 2,000 men in <b>Oldham,</b> although the amount of coal in the town was somewhat overestimated however, and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry. Today, the only visible remnants of the mines are disused shafts and boreholes.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a mixture}} of {{high-density}} urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in <b>Oldham.</b> There is some permanent grassland but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The territory of <b>Oldham</b> is contiguous with other towns on all sides except for a small section along its eastern and southern boundaries, and for purposes of the Office for National Statistics, forms the fourth largest settlement of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom's third largest conurbation. The M60 motorway passes through the southwest of <b>Oldham,</b> through Hollinwood, and a heavy rail line enters <b>Oldham</b> from the same direction, travelling northeast to the town centre before heading northwards through Derker towards Shaw and Crompton.|$|E
