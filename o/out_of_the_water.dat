5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and spin {{three or four times}} about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E
5|$|Some marine halfbeaks, {{including}} Euleptorhamphus velox and Euleptorhamphus viridis, {{are known}} for their ability to jump <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and glide over the surface for considerable distances, and have consequently sometimes been called flying halfbeaks.|$|E
5|$|The {{compound}} Odobenus {{comes from}} odous (Greek for 'tooth') and baino (Greek for 'walk'), based on observations of walruses using their tusks to pull themselves <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The term divergens in Latin means 'turning apart', referring to their tusks.|$|E
50|$|Martin Ledge {{is small}} barren rocks that barely stick <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> Massachusetts Bay, within <b>the</b> city limits <b>of</b> Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The rocks are east of Tewksbury Rock and Outer Brewster Island and {{southwest}} of Three and One-half Fathom Ledge.|$|R
50|$|Unknown to herself, {{she still}} had allies she knew nothing about back in New York, {{watching}} over her {{as she made her}} way back to Agent 13's lair. Also unknown to her, China White had Agent 13 fished <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters,</b> and despite him almost being dead, managed to arrange for him to be secretly transported back to <b>the</b> headquarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brotherhood.|$|R

5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{also worked}} in Bacton, Norfolk, further up the coast, where night-flying was {{conducted}} {{and was later}} involved in supporting anti-submarine patrols. A typical patrol would {{last two or three}} days and would involve the manual labour of hoisting a seaplane in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> by means of a deck-mounted derrick.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain {{the majority of}} their food from predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.|$|E
25|$|Set on {{an island}} in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indre, <b>the</b> château <b>of</b> Azay-le-Rideau seems to rise {{straight}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river, which reflect the castle's façades so that the château appears to float in its own image. The writer Balzac, who lived nearby and was occasionally a guest at the château, deeply admired the building, describing it as 'a facetted diamond, set in the Indre'.|$|R
2500|$|... only 63 megamouth {{specimens}} {{had been}} caught or sighted. They {{have been found in}} the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan have each yielded at least 10 specimens, <b>the</b> most <b>of</b> any single area, amounting to more than half the worldwide total. Specimens have also been sighted in or come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> near Hawaii, California, Mexico, Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Senegal, South Africa, and Ecuador.|$|R

5|$|Day-to-day {{killer whale}} {{behaviour}} generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping completely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water)</b> and tail-slapping. These activities may {{have a variety of}} purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, Aulie's {{father was}} using a tractor to clear snow off a frozen dugout in {{anticipation}} of an outdoor shinny game on New Year's Day. The ice could not support {{the weight of the}} tractor, and he fell through. Aulie was able to pull his father <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and get him to safety. The Canadian Red Cross honoured Aulie with their Rescuer Award for his act.|$|E
5|$|In the water, {{several of}} the crew — most notably Lieutenant, junior grade, Stanton F. Kalk, the officer-of-the-deck when the torpedo struck — began to get men <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and into the life rafts. Kalk worked in the cold Atlantic water to {{equalize}} the load among the various rafts, but died of exhaustion and exposure.|$|E

The writer Balzac, who lived nearby and was occasionally a guest at the château, deeply admired the building, describing it as 'a facetted diamond, set in the Indre'.This striking setting has helped Azay-le-Rideau to become one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most famous <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Loire's many châteaux.|$|R
2500|$|It {{has long}} been {{accepted}} in comparative mythology that Aphrodite preserves some aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indo-European dawn goddess *Haéusōs (properly Greek Eos, Latin [...] Aurora, Sanskrit Ushas). Janda etymologizes her name as [...] "she who rises from the foam [...] " [...] and points to Hesiod's Theogony account of Aphrodite's birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth. Aphrodite rising <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> after Cronus defeats Uranus as a mytheme would then be directly cognate to <b>the</b> Rigvedic myth <b>of</b> Indra defeating Vrtra, liberating Ushas.|$|R

5|$|On May 24, 2013, SeaWorld Orlando opened Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin to the public. The opening drew {{thousands}} of guests to the ride, with some waiting {{more than four}} hours to board. On May 25, one of the penguins escaped the open-air enclosure by leaping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and into the public viewing area; it was returned to the exhibit unharmed.|$|E
5|$|The Sovetsky Soyuz-class {{ships were}} {{provided}} with aircraft facilities to handle two to four KOR-2 flying boats which would be launched by the two catapults mounted on the stern. Two hangars were built into the after end of the forecastle deck to house {{two of them and}} cranes were provided at the forward end of the quarterdeck to hoist them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|To start with, {{there are}} drills {{to help improve}} the goalkeeper in the water. These range from simple {{exercise}} (such as jumping as high <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> as possible with two hands) to drills not specifically used in water polo; rather {{they are used to}} improve the goalkeeper's core muscles (such as catching a ball dropped from the side into the water).|$|E

50|$|The Nuuanu Reservoir {{is located}} up the Nuuanu Pali heading towards Kailua, {{in the valley}} jungle. This small body of water holds various species of catfish, and peacock bass. In efforts towards {{preserving}} the reservoir, appointments must be made half a year prior to the visiting date. This ensures a controlled amount of residents that fish <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters,</b> preventing overfishing. A fresh water game fishing license and an entry fishing card are required to fish there. There is a two fish per license limit, and any catfish that is 16 inches or larger must be kept.|$|R
5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> before transforming.|$|E
5|$|After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose {{return to}} the boat deck. The {{lifeboats}} have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of hypothermia but Rose is saved.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving through}} the Tongan islands, the {{remnants}} of Waka brought large swells, estimated up to , to the North Island of New Zealand. Thousands of residents and tourists were in the region following the New Year's holiday. Meteorologists warned that the oceans would be increasingly dangerous and advised people not to venture into the water. Every lifeguard in Whangamata, as well as former lifeguards, were called in to assist in keeping an estimated 8,000 people <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Although most people stayed within a designated swimming area, several rescues had to be made. Rip currents also pulled 38 people out to sea in Mount Maunganui Main Beach; all were quickly rescued by lifeguards.|$|E

5|$|After riding {{at anchor}} for two weeks, Endeavour was heaved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> on 9 November and laid {{on her side}} for repairs. Some damaged timbers {{were found to be}} infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological problems or death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20µg/g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set.|$|E
5|$|By morning, most of {{the posse}} has deserted, and those {{remaining}} are attacked by Jake's former gang. Jake, who had stolen the gang's loot after their last heist, attempts to retake control but it is foiled. The aliens begin attacking them again and Ella is captured. Jake jumps aboard the ship and attacks the alien pilot, causing the ship to crash. The alien survives the crash, suddenly comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and attacks Ella, fatally wounding her. Jake then kills the alien with his wrist-blaster.|$|E
50|$|These {{dredgers}} use {{a chamber}} with inlets, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is pumped with the inlets closed. It is usually suspended from a crane on land {{or from a}} small pontoon or barge. Its effectiveness depends on depth pressure.|$|R
2500|$|In 1991, {{researchers}} reported <b>the</b> discovery <b>of</b> [...] tall microbialites in Lake Van. These are solid towers {{on the lake}} bed created by mats of coccoid cyanobacteria (Pleurocapsa group) that create aragonite in combination with calcite precipitating <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake <b>water.</b>|$|R
50|$|Oannes (Ὡάννης) was {{the name}} given by the Babylonian writer Berossus in the 3rd century BC to a mythical being who taught mankind wisdom. Berossus {{describes}} Oannes as having <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> a fish but underneath <b>the</b> figure <b>of</b> a man. He is described as dwelling in the Persian Gulf, and rising <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> in <b>the</b> daytime and furnishing mankind instruction in writing, {{the arts and the}} various sciences. Oannes and the Semitic god Dagon were considered identical, but not until long after those gods were formally worshiped - this belief was popularized by the medieval Jewish commentator Rashi and in Dante's Inferno, but has been discarded by modern scholars.|$|R
