25|$|Another part of {{restructuring}} the movement comes from education; bell hooks {{points out that}} there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do not want to hear from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer {{like the rest of the}} masses. In <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> achieve equality, people must be able to learn from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, then there will be more success and less inequality.|$|E

[...] "Shooting at the VLA was, of course, spectacular but {{also one of the most}} difficult aspects of our filming," [...] producer Steve Starkey said. [...] "It is a working facility, so in <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> accomplish shots for the movie, we had to negotiate with the National Science Foundation for 'dish control' in order to move the dishes in the direction we needed to effect the most dramatic shot for the story." [...] After arduous first weeks of location shooting in New Mexico and Arizona, production for Contact returned to Los Angeles for five months' worth of location and sound stage shooting that used a total of nine soundstages at Warner Bros.Studios in Burbank, and Culver Studios. All together, the art department created more than 25 sets.|$|E

60|$|Later, Darius told me {{that the}} second {{messenger}} repeated <b>orders</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> press forward without unnecessary delay; but when our hunger was appeased the lieutenant gave the word that we would be allowed to remain in camp a full two hours, and this was no sooner made known than the majority of us stretched our tired bodies on the ground for a time of sleep.|$|R

He is likely to be less careful now that it has been decided that Walter is dead. He is doubtless well {{aware of the fact that}} trustees have a year given them before proceeding to carry out the provisions of a will, and, therefore, for that time he will keep quiet. At the end of the year his solicitor will write us a courteous letter, asking when we shall be in a position to distribute the estate in accordance with the provisions of the will. We shall reply that we are not in a position to do so. Then, after a time, will come letters of a more and more peremptory character, and at last a notice that they are about to apply to the courts for an <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> act upon the provisions of the will.

Forty odd sail of vessels of war were counted from our ship, as the day dawned, that had been cruising in the narrow waters, during the night, to prevent a surprise.|$|R

6000|$|My mother, {{like most}} of her neighbors, still cooked and served meals in our one living room during the winter but moved into a [...] "summer kitchen" [...] in April. This change always gave {{us a sense of}} luxury--which is pathetic, {{if you look at it}} that way. Our front room became {{suddenly}} and happily a parlor, and was so treated. Mother at once got down the rag carpet and gave <b>orders</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> shake out and bring in some clean straw to put under it, and when we had tacked it down and re-arranged the furniture, it was no longer a place for muddy boots and shirt-sleeved shiftlessness, it had an air of being in perpetual Sabbath leisure.|$|R

Nevertheless, we repulsed all attacks, until Marcin sent <b>orders</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> retire; then we sallied out, after setting fire to the village, flung ourselves upon the enemy, and succeeded in cutting our way through, our regiment forming the rear guard. The whole of Marcin's army were now in full retreat, harassed by the allied cavalry; but whenever their squadrons approached us, we faced about and gave them so warm a reception that they attacked less formidable foes. As for the garrison in Blenheim, you know they were at last surrounded by Marlborough's whole force, with artillery; and with the Danube in their rear, and no prospect of succour, {{they were forced to}} surrender.|$|R

50|$|So, {{from the}} above example, {{it can be seen}} that in <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{distinguish}} between analytic and synthetic we must appeal to synonymy; at the same time, we should also understand synonymy with interchangeability salva veritate. However, such a condition to understand synonymy is not enough so we not only argue that the terms should be interchangeable, but necessarily so. And to explain this logical necessity we must appeal to analyticity once again.|$|E

50|$|Christianity is a {{religion}} of revelation, meaning that Christians believe that God must speak to us in <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> arrive at a correct understanding of his nature and will. If the Bible is to be believed, God spoke to man throughout history but his message was not clearly understood. Because of our misunderstanding, and because God's law is so radically different from man's law, Jesus' message was highly offensive to his listeners. What Jesus told us is that God overcomes evil not by destroying evildoers but by taking their evil upon himself. God's love is suffering love.|$|E
