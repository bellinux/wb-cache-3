Considering the above numbers a single mirror can compensate 4 µm optical path length. Considering the group velocity this is enough for the 3 m air inside the cavity, for the 3 mm of Ti:sapphire crystal three more mirrors are needed, so that a simple Z-cavity can already be compensated. On the other hand, the gain of the crystal of about 1.1, which is high enough to compensate the loss of 8 mirrors, which gives more degrees of freedom in group delay compensation. More critically for short pulses is that the frequency components outside the gain range of the crystal generated indirectly by self-phase modulation are not lost through the end or folding mirrors but and are transmitted through the <b>out-couple</b> mirror. In a kind of decision by majority the modes of the laser decide which group delay to choose, and spectral components close to this delay are emphasized in the output. Due to the ripples in the compensation, the spectrum also has ripples. A single stack reflects between 780 nm and 800 nm. The chirped mirror with 6 times the layers can be reflective from 730 nm to 850 nm. The gain of Ti:Sa is greater than one between 600 nm and 1200 nm. To reflect this bandwidth higher losses have to be accepted.|$|E

By tuning the thickness of the PS layer, in-coupling and <b>out-coupling</b> efficiencies were optimized to achieve maximum light {{extraction efficiency}}. A thicker PS layer resulted in higher in-coupling efficiency, while a thinner PS layer led to higher <b>out-coupling</b> efficiency. Thus, the maximum light extraction efficiency becomes a trade-off between in-coupling and <b>out-coupling</b> effi-ciency.

VGDGWCs that produce <b>out-coupled</b> beams exhibiting a Gaussian irradiance profile are examined in this report. An expression for the grating groove depth variation necessary to produce Gaussian beams from VGDGWCs is derived. The design of a VGDGWC using two different materials for the host planar waveguide is presented. The designs are optimized with a consideration of the waveguide materials, the fabrication process, and the <b>out-coupled</b> beam quality. Two methods, that utilize ion etching to fabricate VGDGWCs are presented. Each method operates by limiting the cross sectional area of an ion beam.

During the time evolution the density profile develops a series of wiggles which are related to the diffraction in time phenomenon.

40|$|Power-scaling of diode-pumped single-frequency {{solid-state}} lasers {{has been}} hindered by strong thermal effects which can degrade beam quality, and often make {{the selection of}} a single-axial-mode difficult. A further problem is that changes in cavity length due to temperature fluctuations become more pronounced at high pump powers leading to mode-hopping. The latter problem can be eliminated by employing frequency selective components intracavity and by active stabilisation of the cavity length to an external reference cavity, but at the expense of considerable increase in complexity and cost. Here we report an efficient diode-end-pumped Nd:YLF master oscillator and power amplifier (MOPA), with > 15 W of reliable single-frequency output in a beam with M 2 < 1. 1 at 1. 053 µm. Our design exploits the weak thermal lensing behaviour on the lower gain o-polarisation to avoid degradation in beam quality, and utilizes a simple passive technique to suppress axial-mode-hopping in the master oscillator. The master-oscillator employed a bow-tie ring cavity with a Faraday rotator and half-wave plates to enforce unidirectional and hence single-frequency operation. The cavity also included a Brewster-angle lithium triborate (LBO) frequency doubling crystal maintained at ~ 162 °C for non-critical phase-matching at 1. 053 µm. The cavity was designed to efficiently <b>out-couple</b> the fundamental by using a mirror with 10 % at 1. 053 µm, with only a small loss in efficiency due to intracavity second harmonic generation. The nonlinear loss experienced by adjacent (non-lasing) axial modes due to sum-frequency generation with the oscillating mode is approximately twice that experienced by the oscillating mode due to second harmonic generation. The net result is that that mode-hopping is suppressed and the lasing frequency can be tuned continuously (mode-hop-free) over many axial-mode-spacings by simply adjusting the cavity length. The master-oscillator was end-pumped by a beam-shaped diode-bar and produced 5 W of single-frequency output at 1. 053 µm in a beam with M 2 < 1. 1. By adjustment of the cavity length continuous mode-hop-free tuning of the fundamental by over 8 GHz, corresponding to ~ 14 axial mode-spacings could be achieved. Thus, under free-running operation the laser could be operated single-frequency (mode-hop-free) for very long periods of time without the need of cavity length adjustment. To increase the power further a dual rod diode-end-pumped Nd:YLF double-pass amplifier scheme was employed. The two Nd:YLF rods were rotated by 90 ° relative to each other to compensate for astigmatism, and had low Nd concentrations (~ 0. 5 %), to minimise energy-transfer-upconversion and its deleterious effects on gain and beam quality. With 45. 5 W of incident diode power the amplifier had a small signal gain of ~ 50 and produced 15. 5 W of output for ~ 5 W input from the master-oscillator in a diffraction-limited beam with M 2 < 1. 1. The relatively high optical-to-optical efficiency of this MOPA approach and the absence of any degradation in beam quality indicates that further power-scaling via the use of additional amplifiers should be easily achievable. <br/...|$|E
