60|$|All these observations, you may suppose, {{were made}} much sooner than I <b>have</b> recorded, <b>or</b> <b>you</b> (<b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not skipped) {{have been able}} to read them.

6000|$|... "Norgate," [...] he {{declared}} solemnly, [...] "trust {{is a personal}} matter. I have no personal feelings. I am a machine. All the work I do is done by machinery, the machinery of thought, the machinery of action. These are the only means by which sentiment can be barred and the curious fluctuations of human temperament guarded against. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> were my son, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> dropped straight down from Heaven with a letter of introduction from the proper quarters, you would still be under my surveillance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am here, Juan de Garcia, {{to avenge}} a murdered woman.

6000|$|... "That doesn't {{matter a}} bit. If you have more, why, {{the more the}} merrier. If you have less, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to give up all your {{property}} when you're married, I will soon make another ten thousand to supply the loss. Only give me one good word, and, by George, I'll fight the seven champions of Christendom, one down and t'other come on, for five thousand a side each. Hang the money!" ...|$|E
6000|$|At length I {{put in a}} word. [...] "Sir," [...] says I to the Dutch merchant, [...] "what is {{all this}} {{discourse}} to my business? What is this gentleman in all these passions about? I wish, {{if he is to}} treat with me, he would speak that I may understand him; <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> business of your own between you that is to be done first, let me withdraw, and I'll come again when you are at leisure." ...|$|E
6000|$|He paused, {{and leaning}} his hands upon {{the table at}} which Sir Richard sat, he faced him, and spoke in a voice of earnest pleading. [...] "Sir Richard, {{this was not the}} task to give me; <b>or,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> planned to give it me, <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> reared me differently; <b>you</b> should not <b>have</b> sought to make of me a gentleman. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> brought me up to {{principles}} of honor, and you ask me now to outrage them, to cast them off, and to become a very Judas. Is't wonderful I should rebel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} thought yer had had more common sense, Sam Hicks," [...] Jerry said reproachfully, [...] "than to go a-mixing {{yourself}} up in a business in which <b>you</b> <b>had</b> no sort of consarn.

60|$|One {{remarkable}} {{result of}} Emerson's idealism {{ought not to}} be passed over. 'The visible becomes the Bestial,' said Carlyle, 'when it rests not on the invisible.' To Emerson all rested on the invisible, and was summed up in terms of the invisible, and hence the Bestial was almost unknown in his philosophic scheme. Nay, we may say that some mighty phenomena in our universe were kept studiously absent from his mind. Here is one of the profoundest differences between Emerson and most of those who, on as high an altitude, have pondered the same great themes. A small trait will serve for illustration. It was well known in his household that he could not bear to hear of ailments. 'There is one topic,' he writes, 'peremptorily forbidden to all well-bred, to all rational mortals, namely, their distempers. If you have not slept, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> slept, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> headache, sciatica, or leprosy, or thunder-stroke, I beseech you by all angels to hold your peace, and not pollute the morning, to which all the housemates bring serene and pleasant thoughts, by corruption and groans. Come out of the azure. Love the day'--(Conduct of Life, 159).|$|E
6000|$|Cyrus {{said what}} he could to console Panthea's grief; but he found it utterly inconsolable. He gave {{directions}} for furnishing her with every thing which she could need, and promised her {{that he would make}} ample arrangements for providing for her in future. [...] "You shall be treated," [...] he said, [...] "while you remain with me, in the most honorable manner; <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any friends whom you wish to join, you shall be sent to them safely whenever you please." ...|$|E

[135] De Oratore, lib. ii., lix.: [...] "Perspicitis, hoc genus [...] quam sit facetum, quam elegans, quam oratorium, sive [...] habeas vere, quod narrare possis, quod tamen, est [...] mendaciunculis aspergendum, sive fingas." [...] Either invent [...] a story, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an old one, add on {{something}} so [...] {{as to make}} it really funny. Is there a parson, a bishop, [...] an archbishop, who, if he {{have any sense of}} humor about [...] him, does not do the same? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lucy, I cannot {{understand}} you," [...] said Fanny, very gravely. [...] "I am sometimes {{inclined to}} doubt whether <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any deep {{feeling in the}} matter <b>or</b> not. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> how can <b>you</b> bring yourself to joke about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She crept away, {{shivering}} with unhappiness, to the schoolroom, {{while the}} others frisked off discussing the wonderful Butterfly's Ball. Lady Merrifield looked in on her, and she hardened herself to endure either another probing or fresh reproaches, but all she heard was, 'My dear, I cannot talk over this sad affair now, as I have to go out. But, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can, I think <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better write to your father about it, and let him understand exactly how it happened. <b>Or,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> rather write than speak in explaining it to me, you can do so, and we can consider tomorrow {{what is to be}} done about it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} might at least let us have a little to eat. We're willing to pay well for it," [...] broke in Jack. [...] "Just a little bread and butter, and maybe {{a cup of hot}} coffee <b>or</b> tea <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose, for tomorrow, {{you will}} like to remain quiet," [...] the count said, [...] "but {{after that we}} will try to amuse you. There is game of all sorts to be shot, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> had enough sport, lately, there will be a sledge and horses at your disposal, {{whenever}} you choose to ride or drive, and in a few days we will give an entertainment, in honour at once of our return, your visit, and the child's restoration to health. Then you will have an opportunity of seeing our national dances." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS WARREN. Yes, saving money. But {{where can}} a woman {{get the money}} to save in any other business? Could y o u save out of four shillings a week and keep {{yourself}} dressed as well? Not you. Of course, if youre a plain woman and can't earn anything more; <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a turn for music, or the stage, or newspaper-writing: thats different. But neither Liz nor I had any turn for such things at all: all we had was our appearance and our turn for pleasing men. Do you think we were such fools as to let other people trade in our good looks by employing us as shopgirls, or barmaids, or waitresses, when we could trade in them ourselves and get all the profits instead of starvation wages? Not likely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Paris is a {{very good}} place for idle people," [...] he said, [...] "or it {{is a very}} good place if your family has been settled here for a long time, and you have made acquaintances and got your {{relations}} round you; <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got a good big house like this, and a wife and children and mother and sister, and everything comfortable. I don't like that way of living all in rooms next door to each other. But I am not an idler. I try to be, but I can't manage it; it goes against the grain. My business habits are too deep-seated. Then, I haven't any house to call my own, or anything {{in the way of a}} family. My sisters are five thousand miles away, my mother died when I was a youngster, and I haven't any wife; I wish I had! So, you see, I don't exactly know what to do with myself. I am not fond of books, as you are, sir, and I get tired of dining out and going to the opera. I miss my business activity. You see, I began to earn my living when I was almost a baby, and until a few months ago I have never had my hand off the plow. Elegant leisure comes hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would like}} to know, sir, simply from curiosity, an' not because it would make any {{difference}} with my desire to go <b>or</b> stay, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a good show of holdin' the fort against so strong a force as is under St. Leger's command?" ...|$|R
