5|$|In 1933, West Ekonk {{was sold}} to Lykes Brothers Steamship Company and home-ported at Houston, Texas. West Ekonk sailed for the Dixie UK Line, a {{subsidiary}} operation of Lykes, for most of 1935, sailing between Galveston and Liverpool. By December 1935, West Ekonk had begun sailing for another subsidiary of Lykes Brothers, the Ripley Steamship Company, and continued sailing on the same Galveston–Liverpool route through September 1937. West Ekonks activities <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> are not recorded.|$|E

For his services to NASA, he was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Offenbach's {{first piece}} for the company's new home was Ba-ta-clan (December 1855), a well-received piece of mock-oriental frivolity, to a {{libretto}} by Halévy. He followed it with 15 more one-act operettas <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years.</b> They were all for the small casts permitted under his licence, although at the Salle Choiseul he was granted an increase from three to four singers.|$|E
5|$|U-5 was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 April 1910, with Linienschiffsleutnant Urban Passerar in command. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> she served {{primarily as a}} training boat, making as many as ten training cruises per month.

5|$|U-6 was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 July 1910, with Linienschiffsleutnant Georg Ritter von Trapp in command. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> she served {{primarily as a}} training boat, making as many as ten training cruises per month. On 7 November 1911, she hosted a Norwegian naval delegation that inspected her.

5|$|A {{veteran of}} the Spanish–American War, Neuer worked as a {{brakeman}} before taking up baseball professionally. He played for various minor league teams in 1905 and 1907 before making his debut for the New York Highlanders. With New York, he threw three shutouts in seven games, and was praised by manager Clark Griffith for his pitching ability during that stretch. However, his control deteriorated after that season, and <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> he played for various minor league teams. He retired after 1910 and became an umpire. He then worked at Bendix Aviation {{until his retirement in}} 1942.|$|E
5|$|After SS-3s March 1911 launch, Whitehead's {{tried to}} sell SS-3 to the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but because the {{evaluation}} of the first two U-5-class boats was still underway, they declined to purchase. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> Whitehead's attempted to sell the boat to the navies of Peru, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Bulgaria, before the Austro-Hungarian Navy rejected an offer for the second time. With the outbreak of war, however, the Austro-Hungarian Navy purchased the unsold submarine to quickly bolster its fleet.|$|E

Baroš played in the 2000 Olympic tournament, making three appearances for the team. He took part in two other major tournaments at junior level: the 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, at which the Czech Republic placed second, and the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, which the Czech Republic won.|$|E
5|$|During {{the week}} of 4 April 1964, the Beatles held twelve {{positions}} on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, including the top five. Their popularity generated unprecedented interest in British music, {{and a number of}} other UK acts subsequently made their own American debuts, successfully touring <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> in what was termed the British Invasion. Their hairstyle, unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults, became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture.|$|E
5|$|ETNC's {{early success}} also {{attracted}} the attention of other communities in North Texas, and in 1904 Denison attempted to entice Mayo to relocate the college there for a considerable amount of financial aid. Whether or not Mayo seriously considered the offer is unknown, but he was able to use it as leverage to persuade Commerce to give the college $30,000 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> for the promise that it would remain, money that was mostly used to renovate and expand ETNC's physical plant.|$|E

5|$|Edward, the Black Prince became Duke of Cornwall in 1337 and he {{acquired}} Lydford Castle on Margaret's death in 1342. Extensive repairs took place <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> and the castle {{was considered to}} be well roofed and decorated inside. Over the next two centuries the condition of the castle fluctuated. Around 1390 the castle roof was stripped for its lead, to be used on castles in Cornwall. The castle well was possibly dug during the 15th century. After 1425, the Crown let it to a range of individuals, including Sir Walter Hungerford and Sir Philip Courteney.|$|E
5|$|Kruger was {{appointed}} Vice-President in March 1877, {{shortly before the}} South African Republic was annexed by Britain as the Transvaal. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> he headed two deputations to London {{to try to have}} this overturned and became the leading figure in the movement to restore the South African Republic's independence, culminating in the Boers' victory in the First Boer War of 1880–81. Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate, then was elected President. In 1884 he headed a third deputation that brokered the London Convention, under which Britain recognised the South African Republic as a fully independent state.|$|E
5|$|Lie {{continued}} to publish novels set in China through 1887, writing five in this period. Several {{of these stories}} were based on extant Chinese tales, as retold by his Chinese-speaking friends. The writer sold his shares in Pembrita Betawi to Karsseboom&Co. in 1887, but {{continued to}} print the newspaper until it– and Lie's printing press– were acquired by Albrecht&Co. later that year. Lie did not work as a publisher again, although he continued to contribute writings to various newspapers, including Meulenhoff's new publication Hindia Olanda. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> {{he did not have}} fixed employment, taking a multitude of jobs, including bamboo salesman, contractor, and cashier.|$|E

5|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> Libby {{worked on}} the gaseous {{diffusion}} process for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb required fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore {{had to find a}} way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant uranium-238. Gaseous diffusion {{worked on the}} principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier was hard to find.|$|E
5|$|A {{regeneration}} {{scheme was}} announced in 2004; supported by the Phoenix Trust, the maltings would be converted into residential, retail and business space. Public consultation took place in 2005 and 2006, with around 90% of participants supporting regeneration and three-quarters asking for a cinema and entertainment complex. Lincolnshire Enterprise granted £200,000 towards the regeneration scheme and the Gladedale Group came forward to develop the project. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> they worked with the Prince's Regeneration Trust to draw up plans for the site's regeneration which protected the historic exterior. In 2009, their proposals were submitted for planning permission. North Kesteven District Council approved the £50million development in 2011; Tesco was also granted permission to build a £20million supermarket {{as part of the}} redevelopment. The maltings would be converted into retail and office space, alongside 220 apartments.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rest}} of 1932 Gielgud played in a new piece, Musical Chairs by Ronald Mackenzie, and {{directed}} one new and one classic play, Strange Orchestra by Rodney Ackland in the West End, and The Merchant of Venice at the Old Vic, with Malcolm Keen as Shylock and Ashcroft as Portia. In 1932 he starred in Richard of Bordeaux by Elizabeth MacKintosh. This, a retelling in modern language {{of the events of}} Richard II, was greeted as the most successful historical play since Shaw's Saint Joan nine years earlier, more faithful to the events than Shakespeare had been. After an uncertain start in the West End it rapidly became a sell-out hit and played in London and on tour <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
