As a practical matter proper management <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer's</b> IOLTA or trust account is a key management skill in the operation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> law office which is based on principles of double-entry bookkeeping, with certain additional safeguards designed to enhance the audit trail in the event <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> becomes unable or otherwise unwilling to cooperate with bar auditors or an inventory attorney to account for handling of client property.

40|$|With an {{emphasis}} on the linguistic experiences of sexual-assault witnesses in the British legal system (adult rape victims and child abuse victims), this paper is <b>a</b> consideration <b>of</b> how the lexical choices in the questions posed to a witness encourage <b>a</b> particular perception <b>of</b> her testimony. The concepts to be discussed include conceptual frames and smuggling information, and we offer <b>a</b> qualitative consideration <b>of</b> how the semantic features <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer’s</b> lexical choices can support <b>a</b> representation <b>of</b> eitherthe witness or her experiences that is not in her interests. The appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer’s</b> chosen frame is of key importance to ‘smuggling information’, a term used when <b>a</b> <b>lawyer’s</b> question inserts (negative) information into a witness’s testimony through suggestion. We look at how such linguistic manipulations can weaken a witness’s account by suggesting that she is to blame, and/or is lying or perhaps has simply misunderstood the situation. Our analysis offers an explanation as to why vulnerable witnesses may not be believed in court...|$|R

25|$|In {{the common}} law tradition, the {{respective}} roles <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> – that is as legal adviser and advocate – were formally split into two separate, regulated sub-professions, the other being the office of solicitor. Historically, the distinction was absolute, but in the modern legal age, some countries that had a split legal profession now have a fused profession – anyone entitled to practise as a barrister may also practise as a solicitor, and vice versa. In practice, the distinction may be non-existent, minor, or marked, depending on the jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, such Australia, Scotland and Ireland, there is little overlap.|$|E

25|$|Comín {{appreciated}} Larramendi following {{works of}} the Zaragoza group; he suggested that the Madrid lawyer becomes his replacement. Don Jaime acknowledged Larramendi’s loyalty during the strife for control of El Correo. Moreover, as a young militant deprived of own political basis {{he seemed to have}} posed no threat to royal leadership; his location in Madrid and profession <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> offered additional advantages. Lack of experience was a disadvantage; Melgar dissuaded the choice also due to pro-German Larramendi’s leaning during the war. Don Jaime’s special envoy to Madrid returned with good news and in August 1919 the claimant appointed Larramendi his key representative in Spain and effectively the party leader, though not with the title of Jefe Delegado, but as a Secretario General.|$|E

25|$|In July 1894, Holmes {{was arrested}} and briefly incarcerated for the first time, on the charge of selling mortgaged goods in St. Louis, Missouri. He was {{promptly}} bailed out, but while in jail he {{struck up a conversation}} with a convicted outlaw named Marion Hedgepeth, who was serving a 25-year sentence. Holmes had concocted a plan to swindle an insurance company out of $10,000 by taking out a policy on himself and then faking his death. Holmes promised Hedgepeth a $500 commission in exchange for the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> who could be trusted. Holmes was directed to a young St. Louis attorney named Jeptha Howe. Howe was in practice with his older brother, Alphonso Howe, who had no involvement with Holmes or Pitezel or their fraudulent activities. Jeptha Howe, however, found Holmes' scheme brilliant. Nevertheless, Holmes' plan to fake his own death failed when the insurance company became suspicious and refused to pay. Holmes did not press the claim; instead, he concocted a similar plan with Pitezel.|$|E
25|$|The hegemon (ἡγεμών) of {{the court}} was {{responsible}} for the registration of the suits and complaints. After holding a preliminary investigation, he also had to subpoena the litigant parties and the witnesses before the jury. In the morning of the day of hearings, the hegemon had to determine by lot the jury that would judge the case as well as the place where it would convene. After the formation of the jury, the hegemon had to submit the conclusions of his preliminary investigation, announcing and defining the litigation on which the court should decide. Then it was the time for the plaintiff, the defendant and the witnesses to be heard. The arguments were exposed by the litigants themselves, without the legal support <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer,</b> {{in the form of an}} exchange of single speeches timed by water clock. In a public suit each litigant had three hours to speak, whereas they had much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). In this way the judicial cases became a vehement fight of impressions, since the jurors did not constitute a little group of mature citizens, such as the Court of Areios Pagos, which was interested only in the correct application of the law. Additionally, before the Chambers of Heliaia each citizen had to become an effective orator and to act solely in his capacity as citizen, in order to protect his interests and to enforce his views.|$|E
500|$|Weinman never {{disclosed}} {{the name}} of the model for the obverse, and no person ever claimed to have been her. [...] The winged Liberty is widely believed, however, to have been based on a 1913 bust Weinman sculpted of Elsie Stevens, wife of Wallace Stevens. [...] A lawyer and insurance executive, Wallace Stevens later became famous as a poet; Wallace and Elsie Stevens rented an apartment from Weinman from 1909 to 1916. [...] In a draft of his unpublished autobiography, Woolley wrote that Weinman refused to name the model, but told him it was the wife <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> who lived above his Manhattan apartment (Woolley, in a later version, omitted the location, saying only that Weinman said it was the wife <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> friend). [...] Woolley recorded that he was told that the model wore the top of an old pair of stockings to simulate the cap. [...] In 1966, Holly Stevens, Wallace and Elsie's daughter, noted in her edition of her father's letters that Elsie had been the model for Weinman's dime and half dollar. [...] Liberty's features also bear a resemblance to the face of Victory in Weinman's 1909 statuary group erected in Baltimore, the Union Soldiers and Sailors' Monument.|$|E
