He’s noted on several occasions that he’s taken the strategies of the major sports brands, i.e. NASCAR, the NBA, and the NFL, and extracted the best practices to grow the WSOP. He has asserted, moreover, that “ports marketing fundamentally is about the selling of hope. Fans have the hope of their favorite team trading for the right player, drafting the right player, winning a game, winning the season, winning the world championship.” And furthermore that, “he World Series of Poker offers a brand <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> is infinitely more accessible” insofar as anyone can enter the tournament and have a chance to play at the final table.|$|E

This gave many of those aboard a false sense <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the ship might stay afloat long enough for them to be rescued. By 1:30, the sinking rate of the front section increased until Titanic reached a down angle of about ten degrees.|$|E

In 2006, Obama released The Audacity of Hope, a book-length account that expanded upon many of the same themes he originally addressed in the convention speech.|$|E

25|$|By February 1, six Southern {{states had}} {{followed}} South Carolina's lead and passed ordinances of secession, declaring themselves to {{no longer be}} a part of the United States. On February 18 Jefferson Davis was sworn in as the President of the Confederate States. Meanwhile, Washington was astir with talk of coups and conspiracies. Stanton thought that discord would ravage the capital on February 13, when electoral votes were being counted; nothing happened. Again, Stanton thought, when Lincoln was sworn in on March 4 there would be violence; this did not come to pass. Lincoln's inauguration did give Stanton a flickering <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> his efforts to keep Fort Sumter defended would not be in vain, and that Southern aggression would be met with force in the North. In his inauguration speech, Lincoln did not say he would outlaw slavery throughout the nation, but he did say that he would not support secession in any form, and that any attempt to leave the Union was not lawful. In Stanton, Lincoln's words were met with cautious optimism. The new President submitted his choices for his cabinet on March 5, and by that day's end, Stanton was no longer the attorney general. He lingered in his office for a while to help settle in and guide his replacement, Edward Bates.|$|E

British rock star Rod Stewart was so moved by the Marathon <b>of</b> <b>Hope</b> <b>that</b> he was inspired to write and dedicate the song [...] "Never Give Up on a Dream"– found on his 1981 album Tonight I'm Yours– to Fox.

500|$|East Coker gives {{a message}} <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the English {{communities}} would survive through World War II. In a letter dated 9 February 1940, Eliot stated, [...] "We can {{have very little}} hope of contributing to any immediate social change; and we are more disposed to see our hope in modest and local beginnings, than in transforming the whole world at once... We must keep alive aspirations which can remain valid throughout the longest and darkest period of universal calamity and degradation." [...] The poem also relied on the war {{as a way to}} connect to Eliot's idea that there was a united humanity. In particular, Stephen Spender claimed that [...] "the war modified [...] attitude by convincing him that there was a Western cause to be positively defended. And after the war there was a Germany to be brought back within the Western tradition".|$|E
500|$|Generally, Joseph's music gets airplay in {{the adult}} contemporary, smooth jazz, easy listening, and {{beautiful}} music radio formats, and while some is classified in the new age genre, he considers contemporary instrumental to fit his style of playing the best. [...] In discussing Rapture, John Blake of The Atlanta Journal notes that often new age music sounds as if it should be played in a supermarket. The songs can sound like musical cotton candy — soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. [...] "For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake." [...] "The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream." [...] Along the same line, Michael Debbage of Mainly Piano says that Rapture almost single-handedly gave a sense <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> {{there was much more}} that the New Age genre could offer. [...] Cicily Janus remarks that, [...] "Although Bradley has been, at times, pigeon holed into an offshoot of jazz, his message through his music is universal in its appeal and soothing qualities." ...|$|E

2500|$|Parents may grieve due to loss of {{children}} through means other than death, for example through loss of custody in divorce proceedings; legal termination of parental rights by the government, {{such as in}} cases of child abuse; through kidnapping; because the child voluntarily left home (either as a runaway or, for overage children, by leaving home legally); or because an adult refuses or is unable to have contact with a parent.

This was best displayed in his text message announcement of Joe Biden as the vice-presidential candidate. He has also declared, in his book The Audacity <b>of</b> <b>Hope,</b> <b>that</b> he did not experience a religious upbringing. Rather he developed his faith due to the church's ability to motivate social change. Bowdern wrote, [...] "This is best exemplified in his [...] "50 state strategy", meaning that he campaigned in states that historically would never vote for a Democrat.

2500|$|As I've been a {{governor}} {{and seen the}} impact {{that the federal government}} can have holding down the interest of the teachers' unions and instead putting the interests of the kids and the parents and the teachers first, I see that the Department of Education can actually make a difference.

Fox cited the success he claimed countries Republic of Ireland and Spain had in modernizing their economies and raising the standard of living for their citizens by joining what is now the European Union. Vicente Fox also proposed a plan to U.S. President George W. Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien that he said would move the North American continent towards an economic union based on the example of the European Union. Fox's proposal was rejected by President Bush, with Fox later alleging in his book Revolution <b>of</b> <b>Hope</b> <b>that</b> the White House wanted him to [...] "stop raising hackles" [...] by talking about a North American Union.|$|E

And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but you said that you use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I was just wondering what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search.
