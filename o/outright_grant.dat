40|$|Governments and {{universities}} have trouble reconciling the goal of keeping high-er education widely accessible {{with the need to}} retrieve some of its costs from students. Student loans offer a plausible solution to the problem. But loan pro-grams turn out in practice to have been a disappointing instrument of cost recov-ery: analysis of twenty-three programs found that students repay {{only a small portion of}} the value of the original loan. Subsidies, high default rates, and high administrative costs have eroded the value of repayments. Sometimes loan pro-grams have proved as expensive as <b>outright</b> <b>grants.</b> This article argues that most loan programs could be reformed to improve fi-nancial effectiveness—through targeting, charging positive real interest rates, designing repayment plans to take account of the likely pattern of graduate earn-ings, and ensuring that the oversight institutions can and will collect. Or govern-ments could explore alternative devices for cost recovery, such as a graduate tax. This approach levies a higher income tax rate on beneficiaries of government-subsidized higher education and thus preserves the idea, implicit in loan pro-grams, of paying for education with future earnings. As part of an effective tax system, a graduate tax could bring in significantly more revenue than traditional loan programs. In the past thirty years, the most fundamental change in higher educationpolicies throughout the world has been the attempt to democratize access.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a trend toward loan {{guarantee}} programs over other programs that support the credit market. From 1970 to 1998, the real value of outstanding federal loan guarantees rose at an accelerated pace, while the real value of direct loans, the other major government loan program, has remained about the same (see Figure 1). In particular, the Small Business Administration (SBA), which has provided government loan guarantees to small businesses since 1953, has experienced an unprecedented increase in its loan volume over the past three years. In December 1997, with the growing popularity of SBA loans, Congress passed an SBA funding bill that set aside $ 39. 5 billion and $ 11 billion, respectively, for the SBA’s 7 (a) and 504 business loan programs over the next three years. This more than tripled the current 7 (a) level which was $ 10. 3 billion in fiscal year 1997. 1 The surge in loan guarantee programs prompts the question: Are loan guarantees the best way to provide benefits to targeted borrowers or to channel additional resources to targeted sectors? As the following paragraphs show, not in all cases. This article explains that conclusion by examining the economic consequences of three distinct methods of channeling resources to targeted borrowers: direct government lending, loan guarantees, and <b>outright</b> <b>grants.</b> While the logic applies to any credit market segment, the article particularly focuses on the small business sector.

Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson utilized PL 480, now called Food for Peace, as a foreign policy tool as well as a program designed to confer domestic benefits. Johnson expanded the scope of Food for Peace. During the first half of his term, Johnson remained optimistic that PL 480 and the “War on Hunger” could ameliorate world famine. As surplus stocks ran out and population outpaced production, he insisted that recipient countries would need to initiate self-help measures in order to receive aid. ^ The case studies of Vietnam, India, and Israel indicate that the Johnson administration extended PL 480 aid serve the larger foreign policy goal of containment. In all three cases the administration assumed that American assistance would help protect these nations against communist threats in their countries or regions. In negotiating Food for Peace aid, Johnson frequently ascribed greater importance to a country 2 ̆ 7 s strategic position than its need for food aid. The studies also demonstrate the interdependent and pluralistic nature of PL 480 assistance. Discussions of aid often involved other related issues such as population control and water resources. Food aid, in addition, enjoyed popularity with political, farm, and religious constituencies. Lobbying Congress in support of a Food for Peace program that donated commodities for relief and dispatched aid workers to famine-stricken countries, these and other groups illustrated the participation of domestic groups in supporting and carrying out American foreign policy. This study offers a new perspective on these connections and tensions between domestic politics and international relations, focusing on food aid. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{image of}} the American {{entrepreneur}} retains an enduring fascination {{in the minds of}} the public and policy makers alike. For example, testifying several years ago at a congressional hearing on "the entrepreneurial spirit in America," Wisconsin's Senator Robert Kasten said of entrepreneurs: "They create new jobs. They provide new competition to existing businesses. They help to improve product quality, help to reduce prices, add new goods and services never before thought of, advance new technologies, America's competitive stance. " His statement captures the view that entrepreneurial enterprises are valuable sources of technological advance, jobs, and dynamism, a trait commonly attributed to small business as a whole. Our national affection toward entrepreneurs also manifests itself in attitudes towards small business. "Start-up," "family," and other small-scale businesses carry an important weight in discussions of national policy. This durable affection stems in part from the perception that small business is the vehicle by which entrepreneurs provide needed vigor to the economy. In the newly established democracies of Eastern Europe a widely discussed challenge is the need to regenerate a vital entrepreneurial sector. The centralized regime pushed the mass production paradigm to its limit, at times concentrating the entire production of a good in a single factory. The dismal record of poor quality products and stagnant economic growth highlights the need for the competition and vigor provided by start-up enterprises. The national focus on small business is not merely talk. Many government policies are directed toward aiding small businesses. For example, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 (RRA 93) permits the exclusion of 50 percent of capital gains on qualifying investments in start-ups and small businesses held for five or more years. This brief surveys the various notions of "small business," presents criteria that should underlie policies toward business, and reviews the case for public policies to stimulate entrepreneurship and small business. It concludes that it is surprisingly difficult to construct a case in favor of systematically favoring small businesses. Indeed, it is probably not useful to think of creating a "small business climate" through policies like targeted tax breaks, wage subsidies, loan guarantees or <b>outright</b> <b>grants.</b> Instead, policies should be devoted to developing an ehnvironment favorable to innovation, employment, and growth in the economy as a whole. ...|$|R

40|$|One {{rationale}} for debt reduction operations under the Brady Plan has been, by alleviating the debt overhang, to improve investment efficiency. Brady-type debt and debt-service reduction (within a strong policy framework, {{where there is}} a track record of economic adjustment) has been shown to affect development significantly. The principle benefit of eliminating the debt overhang is to improve investment incentives for private investors - direct liquidity relief is secondary. So, evaluating a debt and debt-service reduction operation should involve estimating efficiency gains as well as direct financial savings. The authors present a method (requiring only weak assumptions) for establishing an upper bound on the efficiency impact of debt reductions. The key reference framework for evaluating much more complex Brady-type debt deals is open-market buybacks. Their approach to determining this upper bound hinges on the assumption that efficiency gains on a straight open-market repurchase of debt never exceed the gains to creditors. If an open-market buyback indeed reduces the debt overhang and moves a country toward more (and more efficient) investment, creditors will anticipate this in setting a price for remitting their claims. So, {{at least part of the}} efficiency gains are dissipated in additional capital gains to creditors. To give point estimates to efficiency gains, they develop a simple two-period model of debt overhang and investment and discuss assumptions under which it is possible to obtain a closed-form solution to the model. Their empirical estimates indicate that the general bounds derived in the first step tend to overstate substantially the efficiency gains of debt reduction operations. In Mexico's case, for example, the upper-bound estimate of efficiency gains is US $ 15 billion, but the point estimate is only about US $ 1 billion. What are the policy implications of their low point estimates? The debt-overhang disincentive may not be as important as the broader problem of debtors'credit constraints in international capital markets. How can new loan packages to developing countries be structured to maximize investment incentives? By using loans rather than <b>outright</b> <b>grants,</b> donors can give a country more funds for current investment at lower present dicounted expense. But grants, unlike loans, do not distort investment incentives. In short, if a credit-constrained country starts with no debt overhang, the first tranche of aid should probably be in hard loans. As total transfers increase, if the borrowing country has not gained access to private capital markets, marginal transfers should be grants. The optimal strategy for new flows can involve both increasing grants and decreasing loans. When transfers are expected to be heavy, a case can be made for using grants exclusively.
