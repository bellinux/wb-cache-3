5|$|In Brussels, Rodin {{created his}} first {{full-scale}} work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure {{drew inspiration from}} Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop his head, and his left arm held <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E
5|$|The film's setting, {{which appears}} to be a major city, is never {{identified}} in The Brute Man, but {{it has been suggested that}} it is Manhattan, since that is where House of Horrors took place. Commentators have noted similarities between The Brute Man and other films, including the Charlie Chaplin silent comedy City Lights (1931), and the Universal Pictures horror film Bride of Frankenstein (1935). City Lights, like The Brute Man, included a protagonist (Chaplin's Tramp character) who falls in love with a blind girl and seeks money for an operation to restore her eyesight. Likewise, the scenes between the Creeper and Helen Paige share a similar premise and dialogue as the scenes between Frankenstein's monster and the blind hermit in Bride of Frankenstein. In both films, the protagonists are shunned by society based on their physical appearance, but find companionship in a blind loner who knows nothing about their deformities. In both instances, the protagonist is first drawn to their blind companions by music. The Creeper heard Helen playing the piano, while Frankenstein's monster heard the hermit playing the violin. Commentators have noted other similarities between the two films. For example, the Creeper smashes a mirror after looking at his misshapen face, much like the Monster lashes <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> reflection in a waterfall pool.|$|E

25|$|On 21 April, Napoleon {{attacked}} Johann von Hiller in the Battle of Landshut but the Austrians {{managed to}} avoid being trapped. However, Hiller's left wing lost an estimated 9,000 casualties during the day. Three of d'Aspré's grenadier battalions formed the Austrian rear guard as they retreated to Neumarkt-Sankt Veit. D'Aspre {{was present at the}} Battle of Neumarkt-Sankt Veit on 24 April, when Hiller lashed <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> Bavarian and French pursuers. Kienmayer's force retreated through Braunau am Inn on 26 April. D'Aspré missed the hard-fought Battle of Ebelsberg on 3 May.

500|$|Due to her {{borrowing}} from Virgil, Proba's Christ {{is very similar}} to the Virgilian epic hero. Parallels between the two include both seeking a goal greater than their own happiness, initiating realms [...] "without end", and projecting auras of divinity. According to Elizabeth A. Clark (a specialist in early Christianity) and Diane Hatch (a classicist), Proba's purpose was to [...] "imbue the Christ with heroic virtues" [...] akin to the Virgilian hero. The poet does this in three major ways: First, she describes Jesus as remarkably beautiful, with [...] "a magnificent and commanding presence" [...] similar to that of Aeneas. Second, Proba recasts the crucifixion; Jesus does not go meekly to his death, but lashes <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> persecutors. Her reconfiguration of Jesus's crucifixion is in line with Aeneas' [...] "vengeful action" [...] against Turnus at the end of book twelve of the Aeneid. Finally, Proba transfers to Jesus portions of prophecies scattered through the Aeneid detailing Rome's [...] future via the progeny of Aeneas (thus recasting the oracular episodes in a Christian light).|$|E

500|$|At age 12, Divine and {{his parents}} moved to Lutherville, a Baltimore suburb, where he {{attended}} Towson High School, graduating in 1963. Bullied because of his weight and perceived effeminacy, he later reminisced that he [...] "wasn't rough and tough" [...] but instead [...] "loved painting and I always loved flowers and things." [...] Due to this horticultural interest, at 15 he took a part-time job at a local florist's shop. Several years later, he went on a diet that enabled him to drop in weight from , giving him {{a new sense of}} confidence. When he was 17, his parents sent him to a psychiatrist, where he first realized his sexual attraction to men as well as women, something then taboo in conventional American society. He helped <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> parents' day care business, for instance dressing up as Santa Claus to entertain the children at Christmas time. In 1963, he began attending the Marinella Beauty School, where he learned hair styling and, after completing his studies, gained employment at a couple of local salons, specializing in the creation of beehives and other upswept hairstyles. Milstead eventually gave up his job and for a while was financially supported by his parents, who catered to his expensive taste in clothes and cars. They reluctantly paid the many bills that he ran up financing lavish parties where he would dress up in drag as his favourite celebrity, actress Elizabeth Taylor.|$|E
500|$|Later {{in spring}} training, after some less-than-stellar performances, Robinson was shifted from shortstop to second base, {{allowing}} him to make shorter throws to first base. Robinson's performance soon rebounded. On April 18, 1946, Roosevelt Stadium hosted the Jersey City Giants' season opener against the Montreal Royals, marking the professional debut of the Royals' Jackie Robinson {{and the first time}} the color barrier had been broken in a game between two minor league clubs. Pitching against Robinson was Warren Sandel who had played against him when they both lived in California. During Robinson's first at bat, the Jersey City catcher, Dick Bouknight, demanded that Sandel throw at Robinson, but Sandel refused. Although Sandel induced Robinson to ground <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> first at bat, in his five trips to the plate, Robinson ended up with four hits, including his first hit, a three-run home run, in the game's third inning. He also scored four runs, drove in three, and stole two bases in the Royals' 14–1 victory. Robinson proceeded to lead the International League that season with a [...]349 batting average and [...]985 fielding percentage, and he was named the league's Most Valuable Player. Although he often faced hostility while on road trips (the Royals were forced to cancel a Southern exhibition tour, for example), the Montreal fan base enthusiastically supported Robinson. Whether fans supported or opposed it, Robinson's presence on the field was a boon to attendance; more than one million people went to games involving Robinson in 1946, an amazing figure by International League standards. In the fall of 1946, following the baseball season, Robinson returned home to California and briefly played professional basketball for the short-lived Los Angeles Red Devils.|$|E
