30|$|Answers {{are in the}} {{following}} presented in a summarised form. All four respondents valued the overview functionality of the model positively. Having just recently been confronted with process management as a possible answer to the increased cost containments, they appreciated the possibility to quickly <b>obtain</b> <b>a</b> <b>grasp</b> of what capability areas are crucial and how hospitals evolve in implementing process management. While the model was considered complete {{as it relates to}} content on the given level of granularity all interviewees remarked that a second, more detailed level would provide additional benefits. Regarding the self-assessment, all interviewees were quickly able to locate their respective hospital based on the model. Interestingly, assessments of the respective clinical and administrative managers did not differentiate much. Due {{to the fact that the}} model represents an empirically validated ‘journey’ towards process management, interviewees remarked that they felt able to identify necessary improvement steps based on the difference between their current position and the final stage of maturity. Thus, they attributed the model a normative character. With respect to utility, especially the two clinical managers remarked that—apart from the ‘gap analysis’ based on the maturity stages—they would appreciate additional guidance. Moreover, extending the model towards a tool for hospital-spanning assessments would be highly valuable, as one of the interviewees remarked, since the introduction of DRG also leads to a higher degree of specialisation, which again requires cooperation between hospitals. One evaluation criterion for selecting a cooperation partner may then be his level of competence with regard to process management.|$|E

40|$|This thesis covers two {{topics of}} robotic {{grasping}}: stable grasping and semantic grasping. The {{first part of}} the thesis is dedicated to the stable grasping problem, where we focus on <b>a</b> <b>grasping</b> pipeline that robustly executes <b>a</b> planned-to-be stable <b>grasp</b> under uncertainty. To this end, we first present a learning method which estimates the stability of <b>a</b> <b>grasp</b> based on tactile feedback and hand kinematic data. We then show our hand adjustment algorithm which works with the grasp stability estimator and synthesizes hand adjustments to optimize <b>a</b> <b>grasp</b> towards <b>a</b> stable one. With these two methods, we <b>obtain</b> <b>a</b> <b>grasping</b> pipeline with <b>a</b> closed-loop <b>grasp</b> adjustment process which increases the grasping performance under uncertainty. The second part of the thesis considers how robotic grasping should be accomplished to facilitate a manipulation task that follows the grasp. Certain task-related constraints should be satisfied by the grasp in use, which we refer to as semantic constraints. We first develop an example-based method to encode semantic constraints and to plan stable grasps according to the encoded semantic constraints. We then design a task description framework to abstract an object manipulation task. Within this framework, we also present a method which could automatically construct this manipulation task abstraction from a human demonstration...|$|R

40|$|This paper argues that, Marx’s insistences notwithstanding, {{there is}} an ethical core to Marx’s {{critique}} of capitalism. I attempt to establish this claim through presenting salient points of Marx’s critique. From this basis, I move on to discuss Marx’s conception {{of human nature and}} the way in which it is typically frustrated under pre-communist societies. This frustration is the basis for a moral preference for communism. After pausing briefly to consider the possible criticism that this moral preference is mere ideology, I conclude with the normative heart of the matter. This is addressed by underscoring principal similarities between Marx’s work and Aristotle’s ethical project, insofar as each comprehends an intuitive description of the good life and an analysis of the prerequisites for <b>obtaining</b> it. <b>A</b> <b>grasp</b> of this similarity opens the door to understanding the normative flip side of Marx’s intellectual project...|$|R

Yet, the description of human hand motions is very complex, and methods to reduce this complexity have attracted much attention in the motor control literature.

In this paper, we present a methodology to reconcile these two distinct and apparently incompatible approaches under a unified framework: this allows us to <b>obtain</b> <b>a</b> data-generated <b>grasp</b> taxonomy along with low-dimensional representations {{which could be used}} for human grasping data classification and posture reconstruction, as well as for simplifying grasp planning algorithms and robotic hands programming...|$|R

40|$|Underactuated graspers {{are known}} for their self-adaptability. The final {{configuration}} of the grasper in which it <b>obtains</b> <b>a</b> stable <b>grasp</b> relies on the static equilibrium of the grasper and object. Any external or inertial force that acts on the object disturbs this static equilibrium and causes a change in the configuration of the grasper. The self-adaptability therefore reduces the robustness against external perturbations. This thesis introduces the concept design of an underactuated grasper with the ability to adjust its level of self-adaptability by changing the rotational stiffness of an internal differential mechanism. By implementing a bi-stable mechanism the grasper is able to transfer from a compliant state to a stiff state once the actuator force overcomes a threshold value. Experimental validation of the concept design shows that the lateral compliance of the grasper in the stiff state is reduced by a factor of 7 compared to the compliant state. The lateral pull-out force of the grasper in the stiff state is increased by a factor of 1. 9 compared to the compliant state. As a result a grasper was designed which uses the benefits of self-adaptability to <b>grasp</b> <b>an</b> object and increases its robustness once <b>a</b> stable <b>grasp</b> is <b>obtained</b> without the need of an additional actuator.

40|$|The {{concept of}} underactuation is {{increasingly}} applied to hand prostheses because it minimizes {{the number of}} actuators while the fingers are adaptive to the grasped objects. However, current underactuated grasp mechanisms suffer from an intrinsic stability problem which disables them to <b>obtain</b> <b>a</b> pinch <b>grasp,</b> hence they fail to grasp small objects. In an attempt {{to solve this problem}} joint locks are applied to an underactuated pulley-tendon driven hand. Joint locks might also {{have an effect on the}} power grasp strength. Therefore the effect of joint locks on the pinch grasp performance and power grasp strength of underactuated hand prostheses is investigated. This effect is quantified by two grasp performance metrics: the ability to pinch and the ability to hold. To find the optimal joint lock configurations for pinch grasp performance and power grasp strength, the effect of different joint lock configurations on both performance metrics is calculated using <b>a</b> static <b>grasp</b> model. The results of this model are validated by measurements on a prototype. Both the model and the measurements showed that joint locks do not have a significant effect on the pinch grasp performance when only the range of object sizes for which <b>a</b> pinch <b>grasp</b> equilibrium exists is considered. However, the measurements showed that <b>a</b> pinch <b>grasp</b> is more easily established with joint locks.
