The police soon discover and surround Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), believing them to be criminals, before they realize that the pair are FBI agents. Mulder and Scully claim that they are investigating an alleged werewolf that killed {{a man in the}} area during the last full moon. According to Mulder, the entity that they are tracking only comes out at night. Scully is irritated by the constant presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cops</b> crew, but Mulder is enthused at the prospect of paranormal proof being presented to a national television audience. The agents and the police interview Mrs. Guerrero, who describes the monster to Ricky (Solomon Eversol), a sketch artist. To Mulder's surprise, Mrs. Guerrero describes not a werewolf, but the horror movie villain Freddy Krueger. Ricky expresses a fear of being alone in the dangerous neighborhood, and is found a short time later with serious slashes in his chest. Mulder and Scully find a pink fingernail at the scene. The group also meets Steve and Edy (J. W. Smith and Curtis C.), a couple who witnessed the incident but did not see Ricky's attacker, saying that it appeared he was being attacked by nothing. Scully shows the couple the fingernail, which they identify as belonging to Chantara Gomez (Maria Celedonio), a prostitute.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Arabidopsis COP 9 {{complex is}} a multi-subunit {{repressor}} of photomorphogenesis which is conserved among multicellular organisms. Approximately 12 proteins copurify with <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 complex. Seven of these proteins are orthologues <b>of</b> subunits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recently published mammalian COP 9 complex. Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proteins show amino acid similarity to various subunits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 complex, eIF 3 complex and 19 S cap <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proteasome. We have studied {{one of these}} proteins {{in order to determine}} if it is a component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 complex. Arabidopsis p 105 is highly similar to the p 110 subunit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human eIF 3. The p 105 gene is induced during photomorphogenesis, and RNA and protein analysis reveal different tissue accumulation patterns. p 105 is found in a large protein complex. p 105 interacts in yeast with both COP 9 and FUS 6, two known components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 complex.

40|$|AbstractThe COP 9 complex, genetically {{identified}} in Arabidopsis as a repressor of photomorphogenesis, {{is composed of}} multiple subunits including COP 9, FUS 6 (also known as <b>COP</b> 11) and <b>the</b> Arabidopsis JAB 1 homolog 1 (AJH 1) ([1 – 3]; unpublished observations). We have previously demonstrated <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mammalian counterpart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 complex and purified the complex by conventional biochemical and immunoaffinity procedures [4]. Here, we report <b>the</b> molecular identities <b>of</b> all eight subunits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mammalian <b>COP</b> 9 complex. We show that <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 complex is highly conserved between mammals and higher plants, and probably among most multicellular eukaryotes. It is not present in the single-cell eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, however. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subunits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 complex contain structural features that are also present in <b>the</b> components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proteasome regulatory complex and the translation initiation factor eIF 3 complex. Six subunits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 complex have overall similarity with six distinct non-ATPase regulatory subunits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 26 S proteasome, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 complex and the proteasome regulatory complex are closely related in their evolutionary origin. Subunits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 complex include regulators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun, a nuclear hormone receptor binding protein and a cell-cycle regulator. This suggests that <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 complex is an important cellular regulator modulating multiple signaling pathways...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> cane length on the standing and walking stability of stroke patients. Ten stroke patients were used as subjects and evaluated by using two different cane lengths based on <b>the</b> measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance from distal wrist crease to the ground (WC cane), and the distance from greater trochanter to ground (GT cane). Force plates were used to determine <b>the</b> cen-ter <b>of</b> pressure (<b>COP).</b> <b>The</b> maximum sways, the total travel distances, and the mean travel speeds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> were ana-lyzed for each patient standing and walking with and without canes. It was found that the total travel distance and the mean travel speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> in <b>the</b> medial-lateral (M-L) direction were significantly lower when standing with a cane than when standing without one. It was also found that <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> these parameters and <b>the</b> maximum sways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> in both anteri-or-posterior (A-P) and M-L directions were significantly lower when standing with the WC cane than when standing with the GT cane.

40|$|AbstractThe COP 9 signalosome (originally {{described}} as <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 complex) {{is an essential}} multi-subunit repressor of light-regulated development in plants [1, 2].

No proteins homologous to COP 9 signalosome components were identified in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 signalosome is specific for multi-cellular differentiation [13]. In order to reveal <b>the</b> developmental function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 signalosome in animals, we have isolated Drosophila melanogaster genes encoding eight subunits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> 9 signalosome, and have shown by co-immunoprecipitation and gel-filtration analysis that these proteins are components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Drosophila <b>COP</b> 9 signalosome.
