40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} interactions possibly taking place in red wine between three flavanols (copigments, CP), i. e., two epimeric vinylcatechin dimers (CP 1 and CP 2) and catechin dimer B 3 (CP 3), and a specific pigment resulting from the condensation between the main grape anthocyanin malvidin 3 -O-glucoside (<b>oenin)</b> and catechin, catechin-(4 → 8) -oenin. By comparison with our previous work on <b>oenin</b> itself, the influence of the catechin moiety of the anthocyanin in the binding is established. The thermodynamic parameters show that both vinylcatechin dimers exhibit a higher affinity for catechin-(4 → 8) -oenin, in comparison with proanthocyanidin B 3, as previously observed with <b>oenin.</b> However, the corresponding binding constants are weaker, probably due to steric hindrance in the anthocyanin brought by the flavanol nucleus. Consequently, catechin-(4 → 8) -oenin should be much less stabilized by copigmentation in hydroalcoholic solution than <b>oenin.</b> Quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to interpret the binding data, to specify the relative arrangement of the pigment and copigment molecules within the complexes, and to interpret their absorption properties in the visible range...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{determination}} of proton-transfer rate constants in the ground state of anthocyanins and related flavylium salts is described. The method {{is based on the}} well-known pKa shift of phenols on going from ground to the first excited singlet state coupled to the typically very fast excited state proton transfer and very short lifetimes (picosecond range) occurring in these compounds. Under these conditions, a nanosecond light pulse instantaneously shifts the ground-state equilibrium, after which the ground-state transients can be monitored with nanosecond or microsecond resolution. The method is successfully applied to {{the determination of}} the deprotonation rate constants, kd, of two synthetic flavylium salts and a natural anthocyanin (7 -hydroxy- 4 -methylflavylium chloride (HMF), 4 ′, 7 -dihydroxyflavylium chloride (DHF), and malvidin- 3 -glucoside chloride (<b>oenin),</b> respectively) and the protonation rate constants, kp, of their conjugate quinonoidal bases in the ground state. For all three flavylium cations, the protonation of the ground state base form is essentially diffusion-controlled, and the deprotonation occurs in the submicrosecond range. Our directly determined rate constants are 2 orders of magnitude greater than previous values estimated for <b>oenin</b> by T jump. The flash photolysis approach utilized in the present work seems to be the only technique available for measurement of the kinetics of proton transfer in anthocyanins. In addition, our results show clear laser-induced perturbation of the ground-state protonation of <b>oenin,</b> providing the first direct evidence for excited-state proton transfer as a significant energy dissipation process in natural anthocyanins...|$|E
40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} and flavonoids are known by their antioxidant properties {{and one of}} the most important sources for humans is the diet. Due to the harmful effects of synthetic antioxidants such as BHA and BHT, natural novel antioxidants have become the focus of attention for protecting foods and beverages and reducing oxidative stress in vivo. In the current study, we investigated the total antioxidant, metal chelating, Fe 3 + and Cu 2 + reduction, and free radical scavenging activities of some phenolic and flavonoid compounds including malvin, <b>oenin,</b> ID- 8, silychristin, callistephin, pelargonin, 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 5 -methoxybenzoic acid, 2, 4, 6 -trihydroxybenzaldehyde, and arachidonoyl dopamine. The antioxidant properties of these compounds at different concentrations (10 – 30 [*]μg/mL) were compared with those of reference antioxidants such as BHA, BHT, α-tocopherol, and trolox. Each substance showed dose-dependent antioxidant activity. Furthermore, <b>oenin,</b> malvin, arachidonoyl dopamine, callistephin, silychristin, and 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 5 -methoxybenzoic acid exhibited more effective antioxidant activity than that observed for the reference antioxidants. These results suggest that these novel compounds may function to protect foods and medicines and to reduce oxidative stress in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} neuropathologically {{characterized}} by amyloid beta-protein (A beta) deposition, resulting in neurotoxicity. Herein, {{we focused on}} the prevention of anthocyanins from amyloid-mediated neurodysfunction. The data demonstrated that combined exposure of A beta(1 - 40) and A beta(25 - 35) to Neuro- 2 A cells resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and perturbation of calcium homeostasis. The expressions of LXR alpha, ApoE, ABCA 1, and seladin- 1 genes were significantly clown-regulated upon A beta challenge. beta-Secretase, the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes amyloid precursor protein transform to A beta, was up-regulated by A beta treatment. For the duration of A beta stimulation, malvidin (Mal) or <b>oenin</b> (Oen; malvidin- 3 -O-glucoside) was added, and the protective effects were observed. Mal and Oen showed protective effects against A beta-induced neurotoxicity through blocking ROS formation, preserving Ca(2 +) homeostasis, and preventing A beta-mediated perturbation of certain genes involved in A beta metabolism and cellular defense. The present study implicates anthocyanin as a potential therapeutic candidate {{for the prevention of}} amyloid-mediated neurodysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Ankaferd {{hemostat}} (ABS) is {{the first}} topical haemostatic agent involving the red blood cell-fibrinogen interactions. The antihemorrhagic efficacy of ABS has been tested in controlled clinical trials. The drug induces {{the formation of an}} encapsulated complex protein web with vital erythroid aggregation. The aim {{of this study is to}} detect the essential toxicity profile and the antioxidant molecules inside ABS. Methods. The pesticides were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS. The determination by ICP-MS after pressure digestion was performed for the heavy metals. HPLC was used for the detection of mycotoxins. Dioxin Response Chemically Activated Luciferase Gene Expression method was used for the dioxin evaluation. TOF-MS and spectra data were evaluated to detect the antioxidants and other molecules. Results. TOF-MS spectra revealed the presence of several antioxidant molecules (including tocotrienols, vitamin E, tryptophan, estriol, galangin, apigenin, <b>oenin,</b> 3, 4 -divanillyltetrahydrofuran, TBHQ, thymol, BHA, BHT, lycopene, glycyrrhetinic acid, and tomatine), which may have clinical implications in the pharmacobiological actions of ABS. Conclusion. The safety of ABS regarding the presence of heavy metals, pesticides, mycotoxins, GMO and dioxins, and PCBs was demonstrated. Thus the present toxicological results indicated the safety of ABS. The antioxidant content of ABS should be investigated in future studies...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} anti-inflammatory {{effects of}} pigments from red cabbage, red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var.) juice was prepared, characterized by UV-vis absorption spectra, partially purified by Sephadex LH- 20 column, analyzed by HPLC, and administered to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated murine splenocyte cultures. The {{study showed that}} red cabbage juice (RC) exhibited anti-inflammatory effects against LPS-induced inflammation of splenocytes via increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) - 10 and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 6 secretions. The maximum absorption peaks of RC and its heated products, but not activated charcoal-adsorbed products, appeared at 280 nm with a small shoulder around 310 - 330 nm while there existed a minor peak at 560 nm (range from 480 to 630 nm), reflecting red cabbage juice included phenolics, flavonoids, and anthocyanins. The lyophilized powder of chromatographic fractions F 2, F 3, and F 4 through Sephadex LH- 20 column were rich in phenolics (5. 9 +/- 0. 2 %, 4. 4 +/- 0. 0 %, and 3. 9 +/- 0. 0 %, respectively) and flavonoids (1. 8 +/- 0. 3 %, 1. 8 +/- 0. 3 %, and 1. 1 +/- 0. 3 %, respectively). The results suggest that anti-inflammatory pigment compounds in red cabbage juice were heat stable. Further analysis of chromatograms from H PLC suggests malvidin glycosides including malvidin 3 -glucoside (<b>oenin),</b> malvidin 5 -glucoside and malvidin 3, 5 -diglucoside in red cabbage juice could inhibit IL- 6 secretion of LPS-stimulated splenocytes.

40|$|The aglycons of {{the most}} {{abundant}} anthocyanins in food, cyanidin (cy) and delphinidin (del), were found to inhibit the growth of human tumor cells in vitro in the micromolar range, whereas malvidin (mv), a typical anthocyanidin in grapes, was less active. The aglycons preferentially inhibited {{the growth of the}} human vulva carcinoma cell line A 431, overexpressing the epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR). The glycosides cyanidin- 3 -beta-D-galactoside (cy- 3 -gal, idaein) and malvidin- 3 -beta-D-glucoside (mv- 3 -glc, <b>oenin)</b> did not affect tumor cell growth up to 100 microM. The tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR, isolated from A 431 cells, was potently inhibited by cy and del. Mv and the glycosides cy- 3 -gal and mv- 3 -glc were inactive up to 100 microM. In intact cells the influence of anthocyanin treatment on downstream signaling cascades was investigated by measuring the phosphorylation of the transcription factor Elk- 1. A 431 cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter gene construct whose expression is controlled by MAP kinase pathway dependent phosphorylation of a GAL 4 -Elk- 1 fusion protein. We found that cy and del inhibited the activation of the GAL 4 -Elk- 1 fusion protein in the concentration range where growth inhibition was observed. Thus, the anthocyanidins cy and del are potent inhibitors of the EGFR, shutting off downstream signaling cascades. These effects might contribute substantially to the growth-inhibitory properties of these natural food constituents...|$|E
40|$|Resveratrol is a {{polyphenol}} {{contained in}} red wine {{that has been}} amply investigated for its beneficial effects on organismal metabolism, in particular {{in the context of}} the so-called "French paradox," i. e., the relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease exhibited by a population with a high dietary intake of cholesterol and saturated fats. At least part of the beneficial effect of resveratrol on human health stems from its capacity to promote autophagy by activating the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1. However, the concentration of resveratrol found in red wine is excessively low to account alone for the French paradox. Here, we investigated the possibility that other mono- and polyphenols contained in red wine might induce autophagy while affecting the acetylation levels of cellular proteins. Phenolic compounds found in red wine, including anthocyanins (<b>oenin),</b> stilbenoids (piceatannol), monophenols (caffeic acid, gallic acid) glucosides (delphinidin, kuronamin, peonidin) and flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin, quercetin, myricetin), were all capable of stimulating autophagy, although with dissimilar potencies. Importantly, a robust negative correlation could be established between autophagy induction and the acetylation levels of cytoplasmic proteins, as determined by a novel immunofluorescence staining protocol that allows for the exclusion of nuclear components from the analysis. Inhibition of sirtuin 1 by both pharmacological and genetic means abolished protein deacetylation and autophagy as stimulated by resveratrol, but not by piceatannol, indicating that these compounds act through distinct molecular pathways. In support of this notion, resveratrol and piceatannol synergized in inducing autophagy as well as in promoting cytoplasmic protein deacetylation. Our results highlight a cause-effect relationship between the deacetylation of cytoplasmic proteins and autophagy induction by red wine components...|$|E
