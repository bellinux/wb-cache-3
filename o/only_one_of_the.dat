5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{series to}} include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The {{extent to which it}} is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley {{describes}} it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E
