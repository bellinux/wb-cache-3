25|$|The <b>overall</b> <b>width</b> of each wicket is 9inches (22.9cm). Each stump is 28inches (71.1cm) {{tall with}} maximum and minimum diameters of 1 inches (3.81cm) and 1 inches (3.49cm).

In junior cricket the items have lesser dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The {{submarine}} {{could be}} armed with either two TIIIc torpedoes with neutral buoyancy (achieved {{by limiting the}} number of batteries on board), mines, or a mixture of the two. The torpedoes or mines were accommodated in semi-circular recesses {{in the side of the}} hull. These reduced the <b>overall</b> <b>width</b> of the loaded craft, making land transport easier and also reduced drag in the water, but at the cost of weakening the hull.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} of the T1 is a two-seat configuration, lacking any amenities and luxuries to reduce excess weight. The passenger's seat is set back from the driver's seat slightly, allowing the seats to be placed closer together, thereby reducing the <b>overall</b> <b>width</b> of the T1. Offered are a head protection system, six-point harnesses for the driver and passenger, compatible with a HANS device, and is designed with a central safety cell made of a high-strength steel roll hoop with a fire system. The dashboard is multi-function with race data logging and speed sensors for traction control and launch control.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{there were}} a total of 22 bridges built under or over the motorway, such as a {{principal}} bridge at Samlesbury which carried traffic over the River Ribble and the A59 trunk road, the only junction upon opening; the other principal bridge was at Higher Walton, carrying traffic over the River Darwen and the A675 road.

Perhaps the most successful of the motorised Pashley tricycles was the '3cwt Light Delivery Truck' with a Kendrick wheel layout.

500|$|Like the Tiger I, each {{tank was}} issued with {{two sets of}} tracks: a normal [...] "battle track" [...] and a {{narrower}} [...] "transport" [...] version used during rail movement. The transport tracks reduced the <b>overall</b> <b>width</b> of the load and {{could be used to}} drive the tank short distances on firm ground. The crew were expected to change to normal battle tracks as soon as the tank was unloaded. Ground pressure was 0.76kg/cm2 (10.8 psi).|$|E
500|$|The American Museum of Natural History {{incorporated}} {{the skull and}} jaw fragments into a plaster restoration, modeled after the present-day Cuban crocodile. Colbert and Bird stated this was a [...] "conservative" [...] reconstruction, since an even greater length could have been obtained if a long-skulled modern species, such as the saltwater crocodile had been used as the template. Because it was not then known that Deinosuchus had a broad snout, Colbert and Bird miscalculated the proportions of the skull, and the reconstruction greatly exaggerated its <b>overall</b> <b>width</b> and length. Despite its inaccuracies, the reconstructed skull became the best-known specimen of Deinosuchus, and brought public attention to this giant crocodilian for the first time.|$|E

Compared to its Camry relative, the ES 300 featured separate styling, a different suspension setup with front and rear independent MacPherson strut, and added weight amounting to [...] Much of {{this is due to}} increased dimensions, asphalt insulation in the body panels and additional on-board equipment.

This defines the fullness of the underbody. A low Cm indicates a cut-away mid-section and a high Cm indicates a boxy section shape. Sailboats have a cut-away mid-section with low Cx whereas cargo vessels have a boxy section with high Cx to help increase the Cb.|$|E

2500|$|The CH-53K is {{a general}} {{redesign}} of the CH-53E. The main improvements are new engines and cockpit layout. The CH-53K will have over twice the lift capacity and radius of action of the CH-53E, and a wider cargo hold {{to allow it to}} carry a Humvee internally. The CH-53K will feature new stubby composite sponsons to cut <b>overall</b> <b>width,</b> giving the helicopter a narrower footprint for shipboard operations. [...] It will also be equipped with a new composite rotor blade system, with technology similar to that currently found on the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter.

2500|$|The , [...] lane is bordered {{along its}} length by semicylindrical {{channels}} called [...] "gutters", which {{are designed to}} collect errant balls. The <b>overall</b> <b>width</b> of the lane including the channels is [...] [...] The narrow lane prevents bowling a straight line at the angle required to consistently carry (knock down) all ten pins for a strike. Most skillful bowlers will roll a side spinning (hook shape reaction) ball to overcome this. A foul line is marked at the seam of {{the start of the}} lane and end of the approach. If any part of a bowler's body touches the line itself or beyond (anywhere on the actual lane surface or any adjoining areas including walls and other lanes) after the ball is delivered, the bowl is a foul and any pins knocked over by that delivery are scored as zero (0). The bowler is allowed one shot at a new rack of ten pins if s/he fouled on the first roll of a frame, and if all ten pins are knocked down on this shot, it is scored as a spare. Behind the foul line is an [...] "approach" [...] approximately [...] long used to gain speed and leverage on the ball before delivering it. [...] from the foul line, where the lane terminates, it is joined to a roughly [...] deep by [...] wide surface of durable and impact-resistant material called the [...] "pin deck", upon which each rack of pins is set.|$|E
2500|$|A {{deliberate}} attempt to introduce [...] "modern car lines", the Mark E introduced semi-monocoque construction, both {{to improve the}} resilience {{of the car and}} to allow full-height doors to be fitted on both sides. As announced, the prototype car was completely flat-sided and as with previous models used light alloy for all exterior panels. Beneath the skin, there were two main steel frames, one which made up the principle support for the floor, rear suspension and doors and a second which carried the steering assembly and engine. This second frame was described as [...] "semi-floating" [...] to allow the damping out of engine vibrations and to prevent fractures. Further strength was obtained by separating the bonnet from the front grill, allowing the grill frame to add rigidity {{to the front of the}} car. Track and <b>overall</b> <b>width</b> of the car were the same as the Mark D, but the wheelbase was extended by [...] Though not appreciated at the time, this fundamentally affected the car's stability and made it liable to overturn. Weather protection was more sophisticated, the hood now including a front section that could be rolled back as a sunroof while the detachable side screens incorporate sliding windows. The seat was still a single bench, but the backrest was now split, one third allowing for adjustment to suit driver comfort, whilst the remainder hinged forward to allow access to the boot. Lighting was improved with larger headlamps, flashing indicators and rear number plate light. The fuel tank was increased in size to , but the car retained the Villiers 9E/3 engine with three-speed gearbox. Deliveries of the new car were expected to begin in May 1957.|$|E
