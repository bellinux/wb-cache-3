5|$|In {{addition}} to the floods, strong winds blew away many roofs and some entire houses made of mud, leaving thousands of people homeless. The combined effects of the preceding floods and Eline left about 463,000people displaced or homeless, including 46,000children five years old <b>or</b> <b>younger.</b> Overall, the preceding floods and Eline caused about 700deaths, half of whom in Chokwe. with damage estimated at $500million (2000USD). At least 17people died directly due to Eline, although many bodies were washed away and unable to be counted. The cyclone and the floods disrupted much of the economic progress Mozambique had made in the 1990s {{since the end of}} its civil war.|$|E
5|$|Representations of lions {{date back}} to the early Upper Paleolithic. The lioness-headed ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the Swabian Alb in southwestern Germany, dubbed Löwenmensch (lion-human) in German. The {{sculpture}} has been determined to be at least 32,000years old from the Aurignacian culture, but it may date to as early as 40,000 years ago. The sculpture has been interpreted as anthropomorphic, giving human characteristics to an animal, however, it also may represent a deity. Two lions were depicted mating in the Chamber of Felines in 15,000-year-old Paleolithic cave paintings in the Lascaux caves. Cave lions also are depicted in the Chauvet Cave, discovered in 1994; this has been dated at 32,000years of age, though it may be of similar <b>or</b> <b>younger</b> age to Lascaux.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} {{typically}} found growing in large numbers, sometimes in clumps, though solitary specimens are occasionally encountered. Several bodies can be connected at their bases, <b>or</b> <b>younger</b> bodies can {{grow out of}} the bases of older ones. The youngest fruit bodies are conical in shape. When the body reaches around 2mm in length, {{the tip of the}} cone begins to expand, forming the head. This is the stage at which the hymenium becomes differentiated {{from the rest of the}} body, and the bodies quickly reach their mature form, maturing only through growth after that point. Fruit bodies can be infected by the mould Hypomyces leotiarum.|$|E
5|$|He {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with Djurgården in May 2008. The club's initial plan for Josefson {{was to move}} {{him up to the}} senior team when regular players were out of the lineup with illness or injuries, while his usual team would be the J20-team. He scored his first goal in Elitserien on 23 September in his third game, a 4–1 win against Brynäs IF. Ultimately, Josefson played almost every game of the regular season, and usually played along with Carl Gustafsson and Henrik Eriksson on the 4th line. At the end of the season, Josefson had scored 5 goals and 16 points, a record for players 18 <b>or</b> <b>younger</b> playing with the senior team. Josefson was ranked third in the midterm rankings among European skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau for the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. He was selected {{in the first round of}} the 2009 NHL draft by the New Jersey Devils, 20th overall. Josefson was also drafted in the third round, 61st overall, in the 2009 KHL Junior Draft by SKA Saint Petersburg. He participated at the Devils rookie camp in July 2009. He has been compared with centres Nicklas Bäckström and John Madden.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Abbe {{moved to}} Kyoto {{with his mother}} and his sister Toyoka so that he could attend Busen, {{training}} in both the judo and kendo programmes. Abbe learned kendo under the direction of Busen's head sword instructor, Kinnosuke Ogawa, a master who held the rank of 10th dan. He recalled that his instructor, at the age of 75 years, was so skilled that he could not be touched by any of the students <b>or</b> <b>younger</b> instructors. Every Saturday afternoon at Busen, following tradition, judo tournaments were held. Abbe fought five opponents in succession with each contest lasting five minutes, and he won all or almost all of these matches. In his first year at Busen, he was promoted to 4th dan in judo. In the autumn of his second year there, he was promoted to 5th dan, by which time he was reported to have been fighting 20 opponents in succession.|$|E

Zito became the sixth lefty aged 23 <b>or</b> <b>younger</b> since 1902 to strike out at least 200 batters in a season. After a great rookie season, Zito struggled through {{the early part of the}} 2001 season, posting a 6–7 record with a 5.01 ERA in his first 22 starts. However, he rebounded nicely and by August, he was putting up good pitching numbers. Zito was named Pitcher of the Month in August, going 5–1 with a 1.02 ERA. Zito won Pitcher of the Month again in September, going 6–0 with a 1.89 ERA. During those last two months of the season, Zito went a combined 11–1 with a 1.32 ERA, best in baseball.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{families}} were the norm but legal separations between brothers and even {{father and son}} have been recorded in inscriptions. Women and daughters had rights over property and land as there are inscriptions recording the sale of land by women. The arranged marriage system followed a strict policy of early marriage for women. Among Brahmins, boys married at or below 16 {{years of age and}} the brides chosen for them were 12 <b>or</b> <b>younger.</b> This age policy was not strictly followed by other castes. Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow would immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre) was practiced but the few examples noted in inscriptions were mostly in the royal families. The system of shaving the heads of widows was infrequent as epigraphs note that widows were allowed to grow their hair but decorating it was discouraged. The remarriage of a widow was rare among the upper castes and more accepted among the lower castes.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} for New Zealanders in 2012 was 84 {{years for}} females, and 80.2 years for males. Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant mortality {{is expected to}} decline. New Zealand's fertility rate of 2.1 is relatively high for a developed country, and natural births account for {{a significant proportion of}} population growth. Consequently, the country has a young population compared to most industrialised nations, with 20% of New Zealanders being 14 years old <b>or</b> <b>younger.</b> By 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5.3 million, the median age to rise from 36 years to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18% to 29%. In 2008, the leading cause of premature death was cancer, at 29.8%, followed by ischaemic heart disease, 19.7%, and then cerebrovascular disease, 9.2%.|$|E

5|$|Non-black belts, {{from white}} through to brown, denote the kup ranks.

Black belts denote the dan ranks. A specific dan rank {{is represented by the}} number of white bars embroidered on the black belt. A black belt with no bars is a Junior Black Belt, a rank assigned to members considered too young (typically 15 years <b>or</b> <b>younger)</b> for 1st dan. Junior Black Belt members are tested for 1st dan when they reach 18 years of age. One bar denotes 1st dan, two bars denote 2nd dan, and so on.

5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family {{against the side of the}} Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers <b>or</b> <b>younger.</b> Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E
5|$|The Clinton {{campaign}} had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped {{in a state where}} the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans <b>or</b> <b>younger,</b> college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E
