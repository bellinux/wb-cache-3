But without its original leader and lack of a clearly defined <b>organisational</b> <b>structure,</b> the LPF soon succumbed to highly public internal squabbles. By October2002, the break-up of the government coalition was triggered by the bickering of LPF Ministers Eduard Bomhoff and Herman Heinsbroek.|$|E

5|$|The sixteen contestants {{were divided}} into two tribes of eight: Tagi and Pagong. Both tribes fared equally in {{challenges}} but differed in <b>organisational</b> <b>structure.</b> Pagong was dominated by the younger, more carefree members, whereas four contestants on Tagi—Kelly, Richard, Rudy, and Susan—formed an alliance, choosing to vote as a voting bloc to ensure their safety. When ten players remained—five from each tribe—the tribes merged into one, named Rattana. The alliance strategy proved to be successful, and the four took advantage of the other contestants' lack of voting strategy to gain dominance. There was dissension in the alliance as Kelly was deemed untrustworthy, but she won four consecutive immunity challenges and was ineligible for elimination.|$|E
5|$|On 31 January, US {{ambassador}} Peter Galbraith unsuccessfully {{tried to}} persuade Tuđman's aide Hrvoje Šarinić to accept another extension of the UNPROFOR mandate, explaining that the conflict would inevitably escalate once the UN force withdrew. This rebuff was followed by harsh French and UK diplomatic responses calling on the UN to ignore the Croatian decision, which resulted in Tuđman dismissing any extension of the mandate. The US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Richard Holbrooke, met Tuđman and suggested to him that if UNPROFOR was permitted to stay, Croatia could count on integration into the European Union and NATO. As {{a way out of}} the diplomatic row, Holbrooke proposed that UNPROFOR be replaced by a new mission using the same personnel and <b>organisational</b> <b>structure.</b> Following Croatian agreement, the UNSC adopted Resolution 981 establishing the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO), replacing UNPROFOR in the country.
