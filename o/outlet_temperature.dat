25|$|The gas-cooled {{fast reactor}} (GFR) system {{features}} a fast-neutron spectrum and closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of fertile uranium {{and management of}} actinides. The reactor is helium-cooled and with an <b>outlet</b> <b>temperature</b> of 850°C it is an evolution of the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) to a more sustainable fuel cycle. It will use a direct Brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency. Several fuel forms are being considered for their potential to operate at very high temperatures and to ensure an excellent retention of fission products: composite ceramic fuel, advanced fuel particles, or ceramic clad elements of actinide compounds. Core configurations are being considered based on pin- or plate-based fuel assemblies or prismatic blocks.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} with the classic CANDU design, experimental variants were being developed. WR-1, located at the AECL's Whiteshell Laboratories in Pinawa, Manitoba, used vertical pressure tubes and organic oil as the primary coolant. The oil used has a higher boiling point than water, allowing the reactor to operate at higher temperatures and lower pressures than a conventional reactor. WR-1's <b>outlet</b> <b>temperature</b> was about 490C compared to the CANDU 6's nominal 310C, which means less cooling fluid is needed to remove {{the same amount of}} heat, resulting in a smaller and less expensive core. The higher temperatures also result in more efficient conversion to steam, and ultimately, electricity. WR-1 operated successfully for many years, and promised a significantly higher efficiency than water-cooled versions.|$|E

40|$|The {{double tube}} heat {{exchangers}} {{are commonly used}} in industry due to their simplicity in design and also their operation at high temperatures and pressures. As the inlet parameters like temperatures and mass flow rates change during operation, the <b>outlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> will also change. In the present paper, a simple approximate linear model has been proposed to predict the <b>outlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> of a double tube heat exchanger, considering it as a black box. The simulation of the heat exchanger {{has been carried out}} first using the commercial CFD software FLUENT. Next the linear model of the double tube heat exchanger based on lumped parameters has been developed using the basic governing equations, considering it as a black box. Results have been generated for <b>outlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> for different inlet temperatures and mass flow rates of the cold and hot fluids. The results obtained using the above two methods have then been discussed and compared with the numerical results available in the literature to justify the basis for the assumption of a linear approximation. Comparisons of the predicted results from the present model show a good agreement with the experimental results published in the literature. The assumptions of linear variation of <b>outlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> with the inlet temperature of one fluid (keeping other inlet parameters fixed) is very well justified and hence the model can be employed for the analysis of double tube heat exchanger...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alternative model {{to deal with}} the problem of optimal energy consumption minimization of non-isothermal systems with variable inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The model is based on an implicit temperature ordering and the “transshipment model” proposed by Papoulias and Grossmann (1983).

2500|$|The nominal {{temperature}} of the cooling water at the inlet of the reactor is about [...] and the <b>outlet</b> <b>temperature</b> , at pressure in the drum separator of [...] The pressure and the inlet temperature determine the height at which the boiling begins in the reactor; if the coolant temperature is not sufficiently below its boiling point at the system pressure, the boiling starts {{at the very bottom}} part of the reactor instead of its higher parts. With few absorbers in the reactor core, such as during the Chernobyl accident, the positive void coefficient of the reactor makes the reactor very sensitive to the feedwater temperature. Bubbles of boiling water lead to increased power, which in turn increases the formation of bubbles. After 1986 absorbers were introduced in the fuel assembly, permanently assuring a negative void coefficient at the cost of higher enrichment requirements of the uranium fuel.|$|E
