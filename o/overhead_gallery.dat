2500|$|G.L. Thornton Sharp, of Sharp and Thompson, was the {{architect}} {{responsible for the}} distinctive towers on the bridge and its middle galleries. [...] "Both central piers," [...] Sharp told a reporter, [...] "were designed and connected with an <b>overhead</b> <b>gallery</b> across the road. This helped to mask the network of steel in the truss from the two approaches, and has been treated as an entrance gateway to the city." [...] Along their other axis, the full height of the piers above the water also serve to frame a sea entrance gateway, notably for pleasure craft: [...] "by sea and land we prosper". [...] The piers have provision for a rapid transit vertical lift span beneath the highway deck, never installed.|$|E

50|$|The {{architect}} of the Burrard Bridge was George Lister Thornton Sharp, the engineer John R. Grant. The bridge's two close approach spans are Warren trusses placed below deck level, while its central span is a Pratt truss placed above deck level to allow greater clearance height for ships passing underneath. The central truss is hidden when crossing the bridge in either direction by vertical extensions of the bridge's masonry piers into imposing concrete towers, connected by <b>overhead</b> <b>galleries,</b> which are embellished with architectural and sculptural details that create a torch-like entrance of pylons. Busts of Captain George Vancouver and Sir Harry Burrard-Neale in ship prows jut from the bridge’s superstructure (a V under Vancouver’s bust, a B under Burrard’s).|$|R
2500|$|Ben Barnes, who was {{lieutenant}} governor when the 1969 tort claims measure prevailed, recalled that senators divided 15-15, with one member {{not on the}} Senate floor. A lobbyist who opposed the proposal on behalf of municipal interests was smoking a pipe in the <b>overhead</b> visitors <b>gallery.</b> The pipe {{was said to have}} fallen from his mouth when Barnes cast a rare vote to break the tie and send the measure forward. Dickson later received the pipe as a souvenir. [...] "He was one of the outstanding lawyers who ever served. He understood how to write law," [...] said Barnes.|$|R
5000|$|The church sat on {{that same}} {{property}} for 38 years. However, in the 1930s a change in Porsgrunn's road system left the church in a very inconvenient location, and a planned new Folkets hus would leave it almost boxed in. Therefore, {{it was decided that}} the church be moved to its current location {{on the other side of}} Sverresgate. A new foundation was built across the street, and special iron rails were built, upon which the building would be moved on many iron rollers. In 1937, the church was moved across the street, drawing a large crowd of local residents. One sister of St. Joseph who witnessed the event wrote in her memoirs: [...] "The whole town attended the event with excitement ... Suddenly the Catholic church was the center of all attention, especially when the building stood for a few days in the middle of the street, blocking all traffic." [...] After the church was moved over to the new foundations, a new weaponhouse room was added which included an <b>overhead</b> <b>gallery</b> to provide room for extra seating. The church was consecrated again at its new location on 10 October 1937.|$|E
5000|$|There is a sixteen-sided {{ambulatory}} with a <b>gallery</b> <b>overhead</b> encircling {{the central}} octagonal dome. The plan and decoration owe {{much to the}} sixth-century Basilica of San Vitale, Ravenna. Indeed, Charlemagne visited Ravenna three times, the first in 787. In that year he wrote to Pope Hadrian I and requested [...] "mosaic, marbles, and other materials from floors and walls" [...] in Rome and Ravenna, for his palace.|$|R
6000|$|As he speaks, {{his staff}} {{indicates}} the great mechanical road that runs across the gorge and high <b>overhead</b> through a <b>gallery</b> in the rock, follows it along until it turns the corner, {{picks it up}} as a viaduct far below, traces it until it plunges into an arcade through a jutting crag, and there dismisses it with a spiral whirl. [...] "No!" [...] he says.|$|R
50|$|Built in 1800 the {{building}} {{served as the}} parish church for 137 years. The altar was placed against {{the wall in the}} middle of {{the building}}, seating on three sides, with three <b>galleries</b> <b>overhead.</b> In 1937 the present day church of SS. Peter and Paul was completed, and so the building was converted to use as a parochial hall, and later, a theatre and centre for the arts.|$|R
6000|$|And {{then came}} another wonder. In the <b>gallery</b> <b>overhead</b> the sacks of flour were stacked in long rows. Perhaps a mouse {{had been at}} one of them; anyway the jar of the deep organ note shook down between the cracks of the gallery floor a stream of flour, {{covering}} Father Abram {{from head to foot}} with the white dust. And then the old miller stepped into the aisle, and waved his arms and began to sing the miller's song: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{historic}} {{center is}} characterized mainly by the 16th-century synagogue, {{in which the}} Aron stand on the back wall and the center Tevah; preserved inscriptions on the walls are Bible verses while <b>overhead</b> the women's <b>gallery</b> is reserved for women. Under the Jewish temple are the venues for the ritual bath, the striking of unleavened oven, the kosher butcher, the kosher winery and Dyeing. The ancient Ghetto revolved around the synagogue along the present path Zuccarelli and in some lanes that originate from this road onto the alley Goito you reach the Old Mill Pelliccetti who was serving the Jewish community.|$|R
50|$|At 20:00, unarmed guards {{entered the}} cellhouse, covered by armed guards {{in the two}} gun <b>galleries</b> <b>overhead.</b> They found the hostages; however, one guard was wounded by a gunshot fired {{from the roof of}} one of the cell blocks. They locked the open door to D Block. When the last officer reached safety, the guards opened a massive barrage from machine guns, mortars, and grenades on the prisoners within D Block, where the prison {{authorities}} erroneously thought one of the armed convicts was holed up. They eventually figured out that the rebellious prisoners were confined to the main cellhouse and ceased their attack until further tactics were worked out.|$|R
6000|$|So, shorn of {{all that}} was perilous, and only {{understood}} by the initiated, the play {{took place in the}} Castle Hall, the largest available place, with Queen Mary seated upon the dais, with a canopy of State over her head, Lady Shrewsbury on a chair nearly as high, the Earl, the gentlemen and ladies of their suites drawn up in a circle, the servants where they could, the Earl's musicians thundering with drums, tooting with fifes, twanging on fiddles, <b>overhead</b> in a <b>gallery.</b> Cis and Diccon, on either side of Susan Talbot, gazing on the stage, where, much encumbered by hoop and farthingale, and arrayed in a yellow curled wig, strutted forth Antony Babington, declaiming-- ...|$|R
60|$|Presently we {{recognise}} {{the fellow}} of the earthly Devil's Bridge, still intact as a footway, spanning the gorge, and old memories turn us off the road down the steep ruin of an ancient mule track towards it. It is our first reminder that Utopia too must have a history. We cross it and find the Reuss, for all that it has already lit and warmed and ventilated and cleaned several thousands of houses in the dale above, {{and for all that}} it drives those easy trams in the <b>gallery</b> <b>overhead,</b> is yet capable of as fine a cascade as ever it flung on earth. So we come to a rocky path, wild as one could wish, and descend, discoursing how good and fair an ordered world may be, but with a certain unformulated qualification in our minds about those thumb marks we have left behind.|$|R
60|$|The autumn wore away gloomily enough amid these melancholy conjectures, and Christmas-day came, {{completing}} {{a year of}} her legal widowhood, and two years and a quarter of her life alone. On examining her heart it appeared beyond measure strange that the subject of which the season might have been supposed suggestive--the event in the hall at Boldwood's--was not agitating her at all; but instead, an agonizing conviction that everybody abjured her--for what she could not tell--and that Oak was the ringleader of the recusants. Coming out of church that day she looked round in hope that Oak, whose bass voice she had heard rolling out from the <b>gallery</b> <b>overhead</b> in a most unconcerned manner, might chance to linger in her path in the old way. There he was, as usual, coming down the path behind her. But on seeing Bathsheba turn, he looked aside, {{and as soon as}} he got beyond the gate, and there was the barest excuse for a divergence, he made one, and vanished.|$|R
50|$|Marian Willard Johnson {{wrote of}} her {{experience}} running the Gallery:Valentin and I frequently worked together, each showing {{an aspect of}} an artist’s work. I showed Alexander Calder’s jewelry while Curt showed his mobiles. We made similar arrangements {{with the work of}} Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger and David Smith. I had been in contact with Mark Tobey and Morris Graves since 1939 and was to launch their work during the early forties... The forties was not an easy moment in art. If we sold a Tobey for $350.00 there was rejoicing and celebration with the artist, who got a tremendous lift from such a sale. Our rent was low, our salaries lower, but we built on faith. A few devoted collectors and museum curators kept us afloat. The fifties brought much wider public interest and better prices. Some reputations had been established and the <b>Gallery</b> <b>overhead</b> was assured as was the living of many of our artists...In l952 the Willard Gallery moved to 23 West 56 St.|$|R
50|$|The two {{chambers}} of the Vermont General Assembly {{are on the}} second floor. While both chambers have <b>overhead</b> visitors' <b>galleries</b> accessible on a third-floor mezzanine, visitors are welcome to quietly enter {{and sit in the}} main floor of the chambers. Contrary to the tradition of decorating the upper house in red and the lower house in green, established by the House of Lords and House of Commons in the United Kingdom, Vermont reserves the state colors of green and gold for its upper house, the Vermont Senate. Red and gold is used for the Vermont House of Representatives which meets in Representatives Hall. A large plaster ceiling medallion {{in the center of the}} chamber in the form of a lotus with a center rosette of acanthus leaves hold a two-tiered electrified gasolier manufactured in Philadelphia by Cornelius and Baker. Each petal of the rosette weighs approximately 500 pounds. Brilliant axminster carpets have been recreated for both chambers based on old stereoscope views and small scraps found in an attic. On either side of the rostrum in Representatives Hall, are a series of connected elliptical-backed seats designed to fill the north wall of the chamber. The seats are upholstered and tufted in crimson and are used to seat members of the Vermont Senate during joint sessions of the General Assembly. The seats also accommodate the justices of the State's supreme court for the Governor's State of the State address and the inauguration of governors. Citizens frequently occupy these seats when the House is in separate session, or for large public hearings.|$|R
5000|$|Somewhere in the 1968-1969 timeframe, Muehleisen {{shifted from}} paddleball to racquetball, {{and won the}} first {{national}} championship in 1969, {{at the age of}} 37, by narrowly defeating his protégé, Charlie Brumfield. Brumfield has explained that respect for Muehleisen ran so deep that when Muehleisen shifted sports, a large number of other players in Southern California (including Brumfield himself) also made the shift. Though racquetball was somewhat less gentle, Muehleisen extended etiquette to that sport as well, by establishing the official rules for the sport early on. His dedication to the sport brought him a devoted national following, and for many years, he had his own racquetball club (Muehleisen's Courts) in El Cajon, CA, with a dozen finely built concrete wall racquetball courts. He worked with contractors to build courts at other clubs throughout Southern California, and in the late 1970s there were dozens of clubs sporting [...] "Muehleisen-style courts". That expression came to mean a four-walled racquetball court with smoothly plastered concrete walls, a varnished suspended maple floor, and an <b>overhead</b> viewing <b>gallery.</b> Players tend to favor this style of court as the ball bounces more true than with the hollow panel wall courts that are also common. Muehleisen's courts contributed to Southern California's prominence in early racquetball, and while most of those courts have been converted or destroyed over the years, a few still remain in daily use. When a Los Angeles area club re-purposed their Muehleisen-style courts in 2009, they brought Muehleisen back—78 years old at the time—to video tape him taking the last swing on the courts before they were converted for indoor rock climbing.|$|R
60|$|The miller {{altered the}} {{appearance}} of the mill as little as possible. The big overshot-wheel was left in its place. The young people who came to the church used to cut their initials in its soft and slowly decaying wood. The dam was partly destroyed, and the clear mountain stream rippled unchecked down its rocky bed. Inside the mill the changes were greater. The shafts and millstones and belts and pulleys were, of course, all removed. There were two rows of benches with aisles between, and a little raised platform and pulpit at one end. On three sides <b>overhead</b> was a <b>gallery</b> containing seats, and reached by a stairway inside. There was also an organ--a real pipe organ--in the gallery, that was the pride of the congregation of the Old Mill Church. Miss Phoebe Summers was the organist. The Lakelands boys proudly took turns at pumping it for her at each Sunday's service. The Rev. Mr. Banbridge was the preacher, and rode down from Squirrel Gap on his old white horse without ever missing a service. And Abram Strong paid for everything. He paid the preacher five hundred dollars a year; and Miss Phoebe two hundred dollars.|$|R
