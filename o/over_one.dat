40|$|People often shop when feeling sad, {{but whether}} and why {{shopping}} reduces residual (lingering) sadness {{remains an open}} question. Sadness is strongly associated with a sense that situational forces control the outcomes in one’s life, and thus we theorized that the choices inherent in shopping may restore personal control <b>over</b> <b>one’s</b> environment and reduce residual sadness. Three experiments provided support for our hypothesis. Making shopping choices helped to alleviate sadness whether they were hypothetical (Experiment 1) or real (Experiment 2). In addition, all experiments found support for the underlying mechanism of personal control restoration. Notably, the benefits of restored personal control <b>over</b> <b>one’s</b> environment do not generalize to anger (Experiments 2 and 3), because anger {{is associated with a}} sense that other people (rather than situational forces) are likely to cause negative outcomes, and these appraisals are not ameliorated by restoring personal control <b>over</b> <b>one’s</b> environment...|$|R
