5|$|By the show's tenth {{anniversary in}} 1979, 9 million American {{children}} under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically disadvantaged children; 88% <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> low-income families and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as were younger children. Children whose parents did not read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from disadvantaged households.|$|E

5|$|The 1951 WHO {{publication}} {{was highly}} influential in causing widespread {{changes in the}} practices and prevalence of institutional care for infants and children, and in changing practices relating to the stays of small children in hospitals so that parents were allowed more frequent and longer visits. Although the monograph was primarily concerned with the removal <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> their homes it was also used for political purposes to discourage women from working and leaving their children in daycare by governments concerned about maximising employment for returned and returning servicemen. The publication was also highly controversial with, amongst others, psychoanalysts, psychologists and learning theorists, and sparked significant debate and research {{on the issue of}} children's early relationships.|$|E

On 8 December 2005, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, Ruth Kelly, made the official announcement of the introduction of the database, confirmed by the Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, Beverley Hughes.|$|E

5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> Eastern European orphanages {{indicate}} that {{persistence of the}} inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children {{were significantly more likely}} to exhibit poor peer relationships.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: Dental {{environment}} is a stressful place for children. In many cases, parents transmit their anxiety {{to their children}} in the first dental visit. Mothers as the closest person to the children may have important influence on their children’s behavior in dentistry. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational pamphlet for mothers on children’s behavior in the first dental visit.   Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 238 mothers who had 3 - 7 years old children undergoing dental treatment for the first time. The participants were divided into interventional and control group randomly. Behavior <b>of</b> <b>children</b> was assessed by questionnaire according to 4 point scale of Frankle. The questionnaire contained 5 parts: separation <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> the mother, entering the dental room, opening the mouth, communicating with dentist, getting the prize. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test.   Results: The educational pamphlet was effective on the separation <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> the mother, the cooperation <b>of</b> <b>children</b> in interventional group was better than the control group (P= 0. 006). In interventional group 96. 2 % of and in the control group 90. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>children</b> had good and very good behavior but the difference was not significant (P= 0. 11).   Conclusion: Although the educational pamphlet was effective on the separation <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>from</b> mother.
