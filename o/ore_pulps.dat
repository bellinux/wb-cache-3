40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at a {{comparison}} of the effectiveness of a new axial-flow type of mixer impeller (the Prochem design) with the traditional inclined-blade turbine. The intended application of the mixers was in carbon-in-pulp plants for the extraction of gold from cyanide-leached pulps. The first part of the project involved water and ion-exchange resin, and measurement of the power drawn by the various sizes of impeller to fully suspend the resin. The rate of reaction between the resin and the solution was measured {{as a function of the}} power input to the mixer. In the second part of the project, use was made of activated carbon, silver cyanide solutions, and <b>ore</b> <b>pulps.</b> The rate of absorption of silver from the solutions and pulps was determined, as well as the rate of attrition of the activated carbon caused by the various impellers in clear water. The Prochem design of axial-flow impeller was shown to fully suspend solids at only one-quarter of the power required by an inclined-blade turbine of similar size. These measurements verified the observations of other researchers that the rate of reaction is not affected by the design of impeller provided that all the solids are fully suspended. The Prochem design of impeller therefore achieved the same reaction rate as the conventional turbine at a quarter of the power input. The attrition rates of activated carbon could be correlated, in terms of the energy absorbed, by the same equation for all the impellers. Higher concentrations of activated carbon increased the amount of carbon fines produced. Articl...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of {{recycling}} phosphate ore processing wastewater, the accumulation of inorganic ions and the flotation reagents have a great influence on the flotation performance when they reach to a certain concentration. This paper studied the effect of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, SO 42 - and PO 43 - on the reverse flotation of phosphate ore through the single factor experiment. The experimental results show that Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and PO 43 - have less effect on the flotation performance, and that {{a certain amount of}} PO 43 - in the <b>ore</b> <b>pulp</b> can reduce the dosage of acid and improve the flotation result. SO 42 -has a significant effect on the reverse flotation of phosphate ore and the concentration of SO 42 - should be controlled under 1 g/L in the backwater utilization...|$|R

A comparative investigation for the adsorption of the gold-cyanide complex (Au(CN) 2 -) on nanoporous carbon and carbon spheres was conducted to assess their potential for the aforementioned hydrometallurgical application. The nanoporous carbon used was commercial-based, cylindrically-shaped (size > 1. 4 mm), extruded activated carbon manufactured by steam activation process while micro-sized carbon spheres (diameters 0. 5 to 1 Î¼m) were hydrothermally synthesised using a glucose precursor 2, 3 in a pressurised digestion vessel. Kinetic-based adsorption (i. e. bottle roll kinetic testing) studies were performed with both adsorbents characterised by scanning electron microscopy integrated with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) and surface analysis. Results indicated that adsorption using nanoporous carbon was kinetically more favorable than carbon spheres, which was most probably attributed to the high surface area of the former...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{flotation}} {{process is}} used in extractive metallurgy to concentrate the mineral contents of ores by 'floating' the mineral particles out of an <b>ore</b> <b>pulp</b> with air bubbles. The pulp consists of finely ground ore, water and reagents, whose purpose {{is to make the}} mineral particles attach themselves to the air bubbles passing through the liquid. These bubbles reach the surface of the pulp and form a layer of froth, containing the ore concentrate, which is skimmed off for further processing. In order to optimise the process, it is necessary to have a reliable method o of monitoring liquid level in the flotation cell. The presence of the flotation froth complicates this measurement as it obscures the surface from visual observation and clogs conventional mechanical level measurement systems. The presence of air bubbles in the pulp and foam, makes acoustic systems equally unsuitable due to attenuation effects. The absence of a microwave system for level measurement in flotation cells led to the proposal of this thesis. It is therefore concerned with investigating the feasibility of using a microwave level measurement system for automatic liquid level control in flotation cells...|$|R
40|$|Carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp are {{continuous}} {{processes that}} use activated carbon {{in a cascade}} of large agitated tanks, which {{have been widely used}} to recover or concentrate precious metals in gold extraction plants. In the carbon-in-pulp process adsorption occurs after the leaching cascade section of the plant, and in the carbon-in-leach process leaching and adsorption occur simultaneously. In both processes the activated carbon is moved from one tank to another in countercurrent with the <b>ore</b> <b>pulp</b> until the recovery of the loaded carbon in the first tank. This paper presents a dynamic model that describes, with minor changes, the carbon-in-leach, the carbon-in-pulp, and the gold leaching processes. The model is numerically solved and calibrated with experimental data from a plant and used to perform a study of the effect of the activated carbon transfer strategy on the performance of the adsorption section of the plant. Based on the calculated values of the gold loss in the liquid and of the gold recovered in the loaded activated carbon that leaves the circuit, the results indicate that strategies in which a significant amount of activated carbon is held in the first tank and the contact time between the carbon and the pulp is longer are the best carbon transfer strategies for these processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{leaching}} of a Greek low-grade {{manganese dioxide}} ore, not amenable to conventional mineral processing operations, was studied using a mixed culture of Thiobacillus sp. bacteria. The experiments {{were carried out}} in specially designed continuously aerated and stirred tank reactors arranged in two-tank series. The first tank of each series was loaded with an elemental sulfur culture suspension while the second was loaded with a manganese ore high density slurry. The bacterial culture had been previously adapted to grow on elemental sulfur {{and also in the}} presence of manganese ore and dissolved manganous ion. A two level full factorial design was constructed in order to study the effects of the ferric ion concentration in the leach solution, the 'elemental sulfur weight to ore weight' ratio, the <b>ore</b> <b>pulp</b> density and the composition of the dispersed gas. The responses which were investigated included percentage manganese recovery, co-dissolution of iron and manganese dissolution rate. Parameters with constant values throughout the experiments were the leach solution pH, the nutrient medium composition, the dilution rate and the ore and sulfur grain sizes. It was found that the ferric ion concentration was the most significant factor and had a positive effect on the final percentage extraction of manganese from the ore and also on the rate of manganese solubilization from the ore.

Vibrating lamella {{thickener}} (VLT) {{developed by}} Kunming University of Science and Technology {{is a new}} generation of inclined plate settling device, and in this device such long-standing problems in traditional lamella thickener (LT) as material bonding and blockage between channels in inclined plates, material deposits and blockage in cone bucket, as well as unsteady discharging of high solids underflow, etc. are effectively resolved, through periodic vibration of inclined plate modules, the use of built-in device for removal of deposited material on cone wall and of forced discharging device for high solids underflow. Paste discharging is now a new way for the effective treatment of tailings in recent years, due to its superiority for mining safety and environmental protection. The industrial tests for paste thickening of iron tailings were carried out in a mineral processing plant of Mining Co., Ltd. of Panzhihua Iron and Steel Group, using a ZXNQP- 32 VLT. In the test the size distribution and settling characteristics of the tailings were analyzed, and the main operating parameters in the VLT were tested under the natural settling and flocculated settling conditions, respectively. The results of test indicate that the solids concentration of underflow from the VLT is capable of reaching higher than 70 %; meanwhile, the solids content in overflow from the VLT is as low as less than 300 mg/l while flocculant is added in the <b>ore</b> <b>pulp</b> for pretreatment and such an overflow can be directly discharged into environment or be recycled in the plant.

40|$|AbstractThe complex disseminated {{relationship}} between pyrrhotite and magnetite {{as well as}} poor liberation of finely disseminated sulfurous pyrrhotite was revealed through the mineralogy investigation of certain high-sulfurous iron ore. Grinding process and fineness have been found as significant factors influencing the flotation desulfurization performance of high-sulfurous iron ore. Moreover, the separation tests of multi-stage grinding as well as direct one-stage fine grinding were conducted. The results show that desulfurization effect of the former is much better {{in comparison with the}} latter. For one thing, sliming losses and slime influences on the separation process were relieved when the separation process of multi-stage grinding was adopted. For another, the grinding circulating load was effectively reduced while the number of high quality particles was increased, which benefits the liberation of valuable minerals. In conclusion, a technological flowsheet was presented. As a first step, one-stage low intensity magnetic separation of mineral particles to produce rough concentrate of magnetic iron was applied under the condition of grinding fineness 65 % - 0. 074 mm. The next step was a fine regrinding of the obtained rough concentrate to 90 % - 0. 045 mm. In succession, an activation of <b>ore</b> <b>pulp</b> with combined activators, as well as a reverse flotation of pyrrhotite with combined collectors to produce magnetite concentrate was employed. The reverse flotation consisted of one-stage roughing, three stages of cleaning and one-stage scavenging. Lastly, another low intensity magnetic separation step on the obtained magnetite concentrate was applied to produce the final iron concentrate. The obtained iron concentrate reaches 64. 28 % Fe and 0. 42 % S respectively with iron recovery of 53. 62 % and desulfurization rate of up to 90 %. Technical basis can be provided for the industrial desulfurization application of high-sulfurous iron ore due to the favorable separation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{deleterious}} effects of clays on flotation performance are widely acknowledged but the mechanisms involved are not clearly established. Moreover, the concentrations beyond which clay minerals become problematic are not clearly defined. One major parameter {{is the difference}} between swelling and non-swelling clays which is evaluated in this study. The <b>ore</b> slurry <b>pulp</b> rheology and froth stability were monitored in the absence and presence of different clay minerals. It was found that swelling clays can adversely affect the flotation performance mainly via adsorbing water which changes the rheology and froth stability, reducing both flotation grade and recovery. Non-swelling clays had a lower effect on the rheology. Kaolinite increases the froth stability and reduces the flotation grade but illite showed the least effect on the flotation performance in this study.

The results obtained indicated the predominance of the < 38 Âµm PGM values in the ore and confirmed the need for tertiary milling for better liberation of the PGMs. The grade of the PGM concentrate obtained when dosing at 200 g/t of sodium isobutyl xanthate was highest at 94 g/t and gave the lowest recovery of 53 %. The 180 g/t SIBX dosage resulted in highest PGM recovery of 70 % and lowest grade of 84 g/t, while dosing at 220 g/t SIBX gave average PGM grades of 90 g/t and recoveries of 60 %.

40|$|Numerous organic {{reagents}} {{of diverse}} structural composition {{are employed in}} the froth flotation process for the beneficiation of non-metallic and sulphide ores. Alkyl xanthates are used as collectors for sulphide ores while amines and fatty acids are used for non-metallic ore beneficiation. Although these collector reagents react preferentially with the concerned minerals in the treated <b>ore</b> <b>pulp,</b> excess and unreacted concentration of these organic collectors {{end up in the}} mill process effluents. It has been known that even small concentrations of these organic reagents in water streams are toxic to water life, besides their deleterious influence on end stream processes during recycling. Bioremediation has long been recognised as an inexpensive, flexible and environmentally benign technique for waste water treatment. These organic flotation reagents are amenable to biological degradation. The major objective of this work is the degradation of solubilized collector reagents from aqueous solutions using a microbial technique. Bacillus polymyxa, a Gram-positive, neutrophilic, periflagellated heterotroph that occurs indigenously in soils and certain mineral deposits has been used in the bioremediation studies. Organic flotation reagents namely, dodecyl ammonium acetate (DAA), which is used as a collector for oxides and silicates, sodium isopropylxanthate which finds application in sulphide flotation and sodium oleate, mainly used for oxide and salt-type minerals, have been chosen for the degradation studies. Pure minerals of galena, pyrite, magnetite, quartz and calcite have been typically selected for these investigations. The growth of Bacillus polymyxa {{in the presence of the}}se organic reagents at different concentrations has been assessed and the degradation of these reagents monitored. Attempts have been made to grow the bacterium in the presence of the organic reagents, both in the absence and presence of sucrose, by adaptation technique. Electrokinetic studies on the chosen minerals namely, galena, pyrite, quartz, calcite and magnetite have been carried out both in the presence of the organic reagents and Bacillus polymyxa cells or metabolite. Biological stripping of the adsorbed collector reagents from the mineral surfaces have been examined through FTIR spectroscopy. The progress of bioremoval of the organic reagents along with the generation of newer reaction products has also been monitored through uv-visible spectroscopic technique. The results of this study highlight that Bacillus polymyxa and its metabolic products bring about the degradation of the chosen organic flotation collectors. Further, the bacteria are able to utilise the collector reagents as carbon source for their growth, in the absence of added organic carbon (sucrose). Electrokinetic studies and examination by FTIR spectroscopy reveal that consequent to interaction with Bacillus polymyxa, significant surface modification on the mineral takes place. Probable mechanisms in the biodegradation processes are illustrated. Biological metabolic products responsible for bringing about the bio-deterioration have been analysed and characterised...|$|R
40|$|The {{decomposition}} {{behavior of}} several mining reagents (i. e., xanthate, dithiocarbamate, dithiophosphate and dithiophosphinate) used widely in mineral processing operations was studied. Decomposition {{has been reported}} to generate toxic compounds such as CSâ (carbon disulfide) and COS (carbonyl sulfide), causing severe concerns to SHE (safety, health and environment). With the global trend of becoming sustainable/green and the increasingly strict regulations, the mining industry is facing an unprecedented pressure to handle the problematic reagents that can lead to the adverse impacts. Unfortunately, the interests of the prior research are biased on the performance of the reagents to optimize the efficiency and lower the cost, while the examination of the decomposition behavior is almost neglected. Under the circumstance of poor endeavor found in the prior investigations, the knowledge gap awaits to be filled in a systematic and integrated manner to recommend countermeasures for those problematic reagents. It can be seen from those fragmented studies collected from literature that only a limited understanding of thermal or aqueous decomposition behavior is achieved. It is far from sufficient for industrial guidance of mitigation. One key reason is the lack of robust methods to investigate decomposition under various conditions that are interesting to the mining companies (e. g., the flotation conditions). Consequently, the method development has always been considered of the utmost importance upon the start of this work to align with our overall goal of understanding the decomposition behavior under the various conditions. Three methods under a consistent strategy were designed to examine the decomposition under three conditions from Simple (in aqueous solutions alone), to Complex (in <b>ore</b> <b>pulp</b> under flotation conditions), to Specific (in solution containing metal ions). These three conditions were chosen based on the general interests from several prominent mining companies (Vale, Barrick, Freeport McMoRan and Newmont) to understand the decomposition mechanism and kinetics. The Simple is to serve as control for all other conditions. Besides, most of the prior studies in the literature are only conducted for the Simple condition. Therefore, the Simple is to resolve all discrepancies and conflicts, and provide a relatively comprehensive summary of the decomposition under the control condition. The Complex puts decomposition in a new environment that has never been explored before: the <b>ore</b> <b>pulp</b> under the simulated batch flotation conditions. Conclusions drawn from this part provide the most practical guidance for industrial mitigation. The Specific goes after the Complex to thoroughly understand the effect of a specific factor on decomposition. The decomposition responding to the variation of a certain factor is followed within a closed system with the compositional changes measured in all phases. The integrated analysis enables the correlation of the decomposition behavior to its original causes, which are the interactions of the reagent with other components in the system. Through the systematic investigation of decomposition of various reagents under various conditions, it is concluded that decomposition depends heavily on those parallel or sequential interactions that occur along with the decomposition reaction. For example, the decomposition reaction of xanthate throughout our entire study is regarded as ROCSââ»âCSâ. When xanthate forms xanthic acid, monothiocarbanate or dixanthogen with the change of pH, its breakup into CSâ is altered. When xanthate interacts with CuÂ²âº forming CuâXâ, decomposition is depressed, but with FeÂ³âº forming FeXâ decomposition is promoted. The CSâ generated from decomposition could interact with OH- to form CSâÂ²â» or dissolve in solution or adsorb on minerals, leading to the decrease of CSâ detected. The bonding properties between the âCSâ moiety and other atoms or radicals in the molecule affect the stability of the reagents and the subsequent decomposition. The necessity to include a list of the side-interactions as complete as possible is key to understand and predict the decomposition behavior. With experimental efforts taken to develop methodologies to measure the decomposition under various conditions, the attempt to model the decomposition behavior is also initiated in this work. Based on the conclusions from experimental results, major components determining the output of the final decomposition products are identified. Unsurprisingly, the decomposition reaction together with its parallel and sequential interactions is critical. Simulation using Matlab to assess the decomposition of a simplified system containing SIBX and CuÂ²âº ions has achieved preliminary success by matching well with the experimental measurements. This establishes the groundwork for furthering the simulation of more complex systems and model development. Reagents decompose differently, although they might be applied to function similarly during an operation. As flotation collectors used for sulfide ore beneficiation, dithiocarbamate and xanthate possess some similarities in the decomposition in terms of generating CSâ. Their decomposition also decreases with the chain length. On the other hand, the decomposition of dithiophosphate and dithiophosphinate are different as the breakup of the molecule is mainly at their alkyl chain to generate moieties such as olefins. Compared to the studies carried out to understand the performance of the reagents when being used, research on decomposition requires more attention. Therefore, derivative work can be conducted based on results achieved in this work. For example, it is useful to further examine how reagents decompose after adsorbing on the mineral surfaces. It complements the knowledge to thoroughly understand decomposition at different spots within a complex system. The chemical fate studies of mining reagents with respect to the understanding the decomposition open up the window of developing methodologies to examine adverse behaviors. The experimental setups are applicable to simulate various conditions under which the reagent is being used and generating the adverse impacts. The strategy of analyzing decomposition within a complex system as shown in this study also provides insight into systematically investigating the other types of adverse behaviors...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} to environmental sustainability and improved process economy in sulphide minerals production is recycling of process water in flotation of complex sulphide ores. However process water chemistry {{may be a}} critical issue to flotation efficiency. Process water discharged from sulphide flotation circuits are usually gypsum (CaSO 4. H 2 O) saturated and have a high salinity. The major ionic species contained in the process water are Ca 2 + and SO 42 - ions. As minor species, they commonly contain reduced sulphur compounds (RSC) (sulfoxyanions with sulphur in the oxidation state below (VI) such as SO 32 -, S 2 O 32 -, S 2 O 52 -, and S 4 O 62 -), cations of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, frothing molecules, residual chemical reagents and products of their degradation. However, the key step towards developing scientific approaches of recycling the process water is elucidation of how, in what extent, and why the recycled water components (taken singly or jointly) influence flotation of sulphides. Therefore a research program was initiated to understand {{the influence of the}} major and minor process water species on flotation and how to flexibly control such effects if any. In this work, the influence of major components of calcium and sulphate ions in process water on flotation of chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrite minerals were investigated by Hallimond tube flotation. The surface chemistry and xanthate collector adsorption on the minerals under the influence of process water species were also studied by zeta-potential measurement, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with diffuse reflectance attachment and Xray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopy. The effects of the major components were also investigated on complex sulphide ores flotation using bench scale flotation equipment. The impact of the species in flotation was studied using deionised water, tap water, process water and simulated water containing equivalent amount of calcium and sulphate species in process water. Oxidation of sulphide minerals has been known to be a very critical issue during flotation of sulphide minerals while several authors had reported that pyrite, the most abundant metal sulphide and very common gangue mineral in sulphide ores can generate hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent stronger than oxygen. It was revealed that ferric defects on ground pyrite surfaces can generate OHâ¢ radicals upon interaction with water and combination of two OHâ¢ radicals yields H 2 O 2. However, participation of these species in non-selective oxidation of the sulphide <b>ore</b> <b>pulp</b> components and hence in deteriorating the concentrate grade and recovery of metal-sulphides has not still been explored yet. In an attempt to fill the gap, a preliminary study was done to estimate the concentration of H 2 O 2 in a complex sulphide <b>ore</b> <b>pulp</b> liquid during different times of ore grinding and compare them to oxidation of pulp solid. Study of possible ways of flexibly controlling H 2 O 2 formation through known chemical means was also attempted. Hallimond tube flotation results showed marginally lower recoveries of chalcopyrite and galena in process water and in the presence of calcium and sulphate ions in both deionised and process waters using potassium amyl xanthate as collector. Whereas sphalerite and pyrite floatability were little increased in process water. There is no significant effect of calcium and sulphate ions on sphalerite in deionised water using isobutyl xanthate as collector. Zeta-potential shows the adsorption of calcium ions on the minerals whereby the potential are seen to increase, while sulphate ions have no significant effect. FTIR and XPS studies revealed the presence of surface oxidised sulfoxy species and surface calcium carbonates and/or calcium sulphate on chalcopyrite in the presence of process water and water containing calcium ions. Surface oxidised sulfoxy and carbonate species were seen on galena in the presence of deionised water, process water and water containing calcium and sulphate ions. The studies also showed hydrated surface oxidised species and surface iron and calcium carbonates on pyrite in the presence of process water and water containing calcium ions all at flotation pH 10. 5. These surface species influenced xanthate adsorption on chalcopyrite, galena and pyrite. The presence of surface oxidised sulfoxy and carbonate species at the sphalerite flotation pH 11. 5 were seen in the presence of deionised water, process water and water containing calcium and sulphate ions, but the surface species does not influence xanthate adsorption. Formation of hydrogen peroxide was revealed during grinding of a complex sulphide ore {{for the first time in}} mineral processing application and its formation was reduced by diethylenetriamine (DETA). FTIR spectroscopy of the pulp solid fraction shows varying degree of oxidised surface species which is related to concentration of H 2 O 2 analyzed in pulp liquid. Addition of DETA at low concentration during grinding of complex sulphide ore depresses iron and copper minerals flotation during copper-lead flotation stage, DETA also depresses iron minerals during zinc mineral flotation. Consequently copper minerals flotation to copper-lead products is reduced and they are reporting to zinc products. However zinc minerals flotation to zinc product is improved. Tests performed on two different complex sulphide ores using bench scale flotation equipment showed that chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite minerals recoveries are better in process water than tap water. The results also showed general decrease of the minerals floatability at temperatures lower than 22 oC in either tap water or process water. An analysis of pulp liquid after flotation shows decreased calcium and increased sulphate ions. This indicates that there is adsorption of calcium ions on the minerals and dissolution and release of sulphate ions in solution. The studies showed that the process water can be recycled in flotation with no significant effect on grade and recovery of sulphide minerals.

Abiotic controls were also carried out replacing the inocula by the sterile medium.

The effect of leaching on the mineralogy of laterite ores was investigated by the scanning electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). After 28 days of incubation, the FDA hydrolytic activity was observed in both bioleaching experiments containing limonite (17. 2 Î¼g fluorescein/mL) and saprolite ores (16. 9 Î¼g fluorescein/mL). The leached Ni and Fe in the bioleaching experiments containing limonite ores (30 % Ni and 5. 6 % Fe) was greater than that in abiotic controls (1 % Ni and 0. 1 % Fe) with the pH range of 2. 5 to 3. 5. However, the bacterial consortia were less capable of bioleaching of Ni (2. 5 %) with the similar leached Fe (6 %) from the saprolite ores. In abiotic controls, the medium pH remained relatively constant (pH 6). It was concluded that these bacterial isolated as the consortium were capable of nickel bioleaching (precious metal) more effectively than iron (gangue metal), thus being applicable to the commercial processing of the difficult-to-process low-grade nickel laterite ores in Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|Ok Tedi Mining Limited {{generates a}} copper and gold {{concentrate}} from its porphyry and skarn ore deposits located at Mt. Fublian, Western Province, PNG. The predominant porphyry ore-type is blended with high grade skarn ores to optimize copper and gold feed grades to the concentrator. Current operation (2003) is to blend 80 % porphyry with 20 % skarn ores, {{resulting in an}} acceptable concentrate grade and recovery. However, when the proportion of skarn ore in the plant feed exceeds 20 %, low flotation recovery is often observed. Approximately 20 % of the copper and 30 % gold losses occur through the rougher flotation circuit. However, losses via the cleaner tailing stream are 8 % and 9 % for copper and gold, respectively, and augment value mineral losses to the final tailing. It may {{be noted that the}} cleaner tailing stream contains value minerals which have already been successfully floated in the rougher section of the concentrator, and are therefore recoverable. This study has the objective of determining the reasons for copper and gold loss in the cleaner tailing. The focus is therefore on the cleaner flotation bank and related streams. The project strategy commenced with characterization of the cleaner circuit performance under various operating conditions. This would provide evidence for any proposed mechanisms to explain the losses of valuable minerals to the cleaner tailing. The second part of the project strategy was to evaluate potential methods for improvement of cleaner flotation performance via laboratory flotation tests. To complete the work, plant trials of methods showing benefit in the laboratory were conducted. Characterisation surveys of the cleaner flotation bank were conducted as a function of <b>ore</b> blend, <b>pulp</b> and surface chemistry, mineralogy, flotation kinetics, particle size distribution, cleaner flotation cell hydrodynamic characterisation and residence time. These studies indicated that for greater than 20 % pyrite skarn in the concentrator feed blend, lower than expected gold and copper recoveries were achieved in the cleaner bank. Pulp and surface chemical analytical techniques indicated layers of oxide coatings existed on all particles, depressing flotation. Oxide coatings had also resulted in the copper activation of pyrite (CuS rimming), making separation from copper sulfides difficult. Losses included coarse composite particles, also suggesting possible liberation issues. However, liberated copper sulfides were also lost, supporting the notion of depression via oxide coatings. Residence time calculations for the cleaner flotation bank suggested that the flotation capacity was less than adequate, particularly at high mill throughput rates. Hydrodynamic characterisation indicated improvements in cell hydrodynamics were warranted. In contrast to the oxidised ore feed blend described above, when less than 20 % pyrite skarn was contained in the ore blend, high copper and gold recoveries were achieved in the cleaner bank. Laboratory tests suggested that increasing cleaner feed pH from 10. 5 to 11. 5, and 1 or collector addition to the cleaner feed, would result in improved cleaner flotation performance. These changes were trialed in the plant, with the pH adjustment being successful. High cleaner feed pH continues as a permanent modification to plant operating conditions...|$|R
