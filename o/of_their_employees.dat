5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>employees,</b> an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E

40|$|Employee Suggestion Schemes {{have been}} used in {{organizations}} for a long time {{due to the fact that}} they enable fostering of creative ability of employees. However, they must be used effectively and in a sustainable manner to better the creativity and innovation capacity of organizations in order to improve competitive advantage. Therefore there is a need to understand the maturity of Employee Suggestion Schemes. This paper proposes a new, structured evaluation tool for assessing an organizational Employee Suggestion Scheme maturity. It suggests five building blocks: Leadership and Work Environment, System Capability, System Effectiveness, Organizational Encouragement and System Barriers, each of them characterized by several relevant indicators and an assessment/grading scale in order for an organization to be able to determine the maturity level <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>Employee</b> Suggestion Scheme as: Initial stage, Development stage or Advanced stage. Organizations should apply this tool to assess the maturity level <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>Employee</b> Suggestion Scheme and draw a roadmap for its improvements...|$|R
