25|$|Rollerball pens {{employ the}} same ballpoint mechanics, {{but with the}} use of {{water-based}} inks instead of <b>oil-based</b> inks. Compared to <b>oil-based</b> ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the water-based inks will blot if held stationary against the writing surface. Water-based inks also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to smearing—posing problems to left-handed people (or right handed people writing right-to-left script)—and running, should the writing surface become wet.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1950s Gela's core {{economic}} activities were agriculture and sea-related. In 1960 the Italian oil company Eni chose Gela {{as the site}} of a large <b>oil-based</b> industrial plant that began operation in 1963 and closed down in 2014.|$|E

25|$|Lignin-based {{artificial}} vanilla flavoring {{is alleged}} to have a richer flavor profile than <b>oil-based</b> flavoring; the difference is due to the presence of acetovanillone, a minor component in the lignin-derived product that is not found in vanillin synthesized from guaiacol.|$|E
25|$|Hands {{and faces}} can be marbled {{temporarily}} for {{events such as}} festivals, using a painting process similar to traditional paper marbling, in which paint is floated on water and transferred to a person's skin. Unlike the traditional <b>oil-based</b> technique for paper, neon or ultraviolet reactive colours are typically used, and the paint is water-based and non-toxic.|$|E
25|$|Algae-based {{biofuels}} {{have been}} promoted {{in the media}} as a potential panacea to crude <b>oil-based</b> transportation problems. Algae could yield more than 2000 gallons of fuel per acre per year of production. Algae based fuels are being successfully tested by the U.S. Navy Algae-based plastics show potential to reduce waste and the cost per pound of algae plastic {{is expected to be}} cheaper than traditional plastic prices.|$|E
25|$|Some {{plastics}} are now {{referred to}} as being 'degradable', 'oxy-degradable' or 'UV-degradable'. This means that they break down when exposed to light or air, but these plastics are still primarily (as much as 98 per cent) <b>oil-based</b> and are not currently certified as 'biodegradable' under the European Union directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC). Biopolymers will break down, and some are suitable for domestic composting.|$|E
25|$|Buffalo marketed a 2.5-gallon and 1-quart {{extinguisher}} using M-X liquid discharged {{through a}} low-velocity shower head type nozzle, {{but it was}} met with limited success, as it was going up against Ansul's Met-L-X, {{which could be used}} on more types of metals and was non-combustible. M-X had the advantage of being easy to recharge and non-corrosive, since it was <b>oil-based,</b> but production did not last long due to its limited applications.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{treatment}} {{is similar to}} atrophic rhinitis, namely keeping the nasal mucosa moist with saline or <b>oil-based</b> lubricants and treating pain and infection as they arise; adding menthol to lubricants may be helpful in ENS, as may be use of a cool mist humidifer at home. For people with anxiety, depression, or who are obsessed with {{the feeling that they}} can't breathe, psychiatric or psychological care may be helpful.|$|E
25|$|Buffalo M-X liquid was a {{short-lived}} <b>oil-based</b> extinguishing agent for magnesium fires, made by Buffalo in the 1950s. It {{was discovered by}} the Germans in WWII that a heavy oil {{could be applied to}} burning magnesium chips to cool and smother them, and was easy to apply from a pressurized extinguisher, which was made by the German firm Total. After the war, the technology grab was all-encompassing, and fire extinguishers were no exception.|$|E
25|$|Despite this {{it appears}} that the final {{breakthrough}} of paper depended just as much on the rapid spread of movable-type printing. It is notable that codices of parchment, which in terms of quality is superior to any other writing material, still had a substantial share in Gutenberg's edition of the 42-line Bible. After much experimentation, Gutenberg managed to overcome the difficulties which traditional water-based inks caused by soaking the paper, and found the formula for an <b>oil-based</b> ink suitable for high-quality printing with metal type.|$|E
25|$|Gutenberg is also {{credited}} {{with the introduction of}} an <b>oil-based</b> ink which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. As printing material he used both paper and vellum (high-quality parchment). In the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg made a trial of coloured printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies. A later work, the Mainz Psalter of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under the imprint of his successors Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer, had elaborate red and blue printed initials.|$|E
25|$|One {{rationale}} for ethanol {{production in the}} U.S. is increased energy security, from shifting supply from oil imports to domestic sources. Ethanol production requires significant energy, and current U.S. production derives most of that energy from domestic coal, natural gas and other non-oil sources. Because in 2006, 66% of U.S. oil consumption was imported, compared to a net surplus of coal and just 16% of natural gas (2006 figures), the displacement of <b>oil-based</b> fuels to ethanol produced a net shift from foreign to domestic U.S. energy sources.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to Gutenberg {{printing}}, {{which allowed}} printing {{on both sides}} of the paper from its very beginnings (although not simultaneously until very recent times), East Asian printing was done only on one side of the paper, because the need to rub the back of the paper when printing would have spoilt the first side when the second side was printed. Another reason was that, unlike in Europe where Gutenberg introduced more suitable <b>oil-based</b> ink, Asian printing remained confined to water-based inks which tended to soak through the paper.|$|E
25|$|Iran {{consistently}} {{claimed that}} {{its nuclear program}} is purely for civilian purposes, {{and that it has}} no intention of ever utilizing its peaceful nuclear program to develop nuclear weapons. During the course of Iran's recent history, specifically during the Iran-Iraq war, Iran has experienced significant outages of its commercial electricity grid. Iran has also continuously claimed that it intends to ultimately export part of the electricity produced by its nuclear reactors to its regional neighbors, as a way of diversifying its mainly <b>oil-based</b> economy to more diversified revenue streams.|$|E
25|$|One {{rationale}} {{given for}} extensive ethanol {{production in the}} U.S. is its benefit to energy security, by shifting the need for some foreign-produced oil to domestically produced energy sources. Production of ethanol requires significant energy, but current U.S. production derives most of that energy from coal, natural gas and other sources, rather than oil. Because 66% of oil consumed in the U.S. is imported, compared to a net surplus of coal and just 16% of natural gas (figures from 2006), the displacement of <b>oil-based</b> fuels to ethanol produces a net shift from foreign to domestic U.S. energy sources.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of {{increasing}} oil revenues, Saddam diversified the largely <b>oil-based</b> Iraqi economy. Saddam implemented a national infrastructure campaign that made great progress in building roads, promoting mining, and developing other industries. The campaign helped Iraq's energy industries. Electricity was brought to nearly every city in Iraq, and many outlying areas. Before the 1970s, most of Iraq's people lived in the countryside and roughly two-thirds were peasants. This number would decrease quickly during the 1970s as global oil prices helped revenues to rise from less than a half billion dollars to {{tens of billions of}} dollars and the country invested into industrial expansion.|$|E
25|$|Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg {{introduced}} the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type {{based on a}} matrix and hand mould, adaptations to the screw-press, {{the use of an}} <b>oil-based</b> ink, {{and the creation of a}} softer and more absorbent paper. Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, tin, antimony, copper and bismuth – the same components still used today. Johannes Gutenberg started work on his printing press around 1436, in partnership with Andreas Dritzehen – whom he had previously instructed in gem-cutting – and Andreas Heilmann, the owner of a paper mill.|$|E
25|$|Writing ink {{is usually}} {{water-based}} and {{is much less}} viscous than the <b>oil-based</b> inks used in printing. High quality paper, which has good consistency of absorption, enables cleaner lines, although parchment or vellum is often used, as a knife {{can be used to}} erase imperfections and a light-box is not needed to allow lines to pass through it. Normally, light boxes and templates are used to achieve straight lines without pencil markings detracting from the work. Ruled paper, either for a light box or direct use, is most often ruled every quarter or half inch, although inch spaces are occasionally used. This is the case with litterea unciales (hence the name), and college-ruled paper often acts as a guideline well.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to such obvious dangers as insecticides and weed killers, other common household substances {{that should be}} used with caution in areas where cats may be exposed to them include mothballs and other naphthalene products, as well as phenol based products often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, such as Pine-Sol, Dettol (Lysol), hexachlorophene, etc. which, although they are widely used without problem, have been sometimes seen to be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and {{as little as a}} teaspoonful can be fatal. Essential oils are toxic to cats and there have been reported cases of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, and tea tree <b>oil-based</b> flea treatments and shampoos.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the Burj Khalifa {{began in}} 2004, with the {{exterior}} completed {{five years later}} in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete. The building was opened in 2010 {{as part of a}} new development called Downtown Dubai. It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building is reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an <b>oil-based</b> economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building was originally named Burj Dubai but was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest tower in the world.|$|E
25|$|Gutenberg is also {{credited}} {{with the introduction of}} an <b>oil-based</b> ink which was more durable than previously used water-based inks. Having worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of his knowledge of metals. He also the first to make his type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, known as type metal, printer's lead, or printer's metal, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books, and proved to be more suitable for printing than the clay, wooden or bronze types used in East Asia. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what some considered his most ingenious invention: a special matrix which enabled the moulding of new movable types with an unprecedented precision at short notice. Within a year of printing the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg also published the first coloured prints.|$|E
25|$|East Asian seals are {{carved from}} a variety of hard materials, {{including}} wood, soapstone, sea glass and jade. East Asian seals are traditionally used with a red <b>oil-based</b> paste consisting of finely ground cinnabar, which contrasts with the black ink traditionally used for the ink brush. Red chemical inks are more commonly used in modern times for sealing documents. Seal engraving is considered a form of calligraphy in East Asia. Like ink-brush calligraphy, there are several styles of engraving. Some engraving styles emulate calligraphy styles, but many styles are so highly stylized that the characters represented on the seal are difficult for untrained readers to identify. Seal engravers are considered artists, and, in the past, several famous calligraphers also became famous as engravers. Some seals, carved by famous engravers, or owned by famous artists or political leaders, have become valuable as historical works of art.|$|E
25|$|Facilitating drug {{absorption}} {{by increasing}} its {{solubility in water}} is a common pharmaceutical strategy and also {{has been shown to}} be successful for CoQ10. Various approaches have been developed to achieve this goal, with many of them producing significantly better results over <b>oil-based</b> softgel capsules in spite of the many attempts to optimize their composition. Examples of such approaches are use of the aqueous dispersion of solid CoQ10 with the polymer tyloxapol, formulations based on various solubilising agents, such as hydrogenated lecithin, and complexation with cyclodextrins; among the latter, the complex with β-cyclodextrin has been found to have highly increased bioavailability. |journal=Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=281–287 |year=2008 |pmid=18645245 |doi=10.1159/000129661}}-β-Cyclodextrin Complex |journal=Integrative Medicine |volume=9 |issue=1}} and also is used in pharmaceutical and food industries for CoQ10-fortification. Also some other novel carrier systems, such as liposomes, nanoparticles or dendrimers, may be used to increase the bioavailability of CoQ10.|$|E
25|$|Morris Louis's {{painting}} Where 1960, {{was a major}} {{innovation that}} moved abstract expressionist painting forward {{in a new direction}} toward Color Field and Minimalism. Among Louis's major works are his various series of color field paintings. Some of his best known series' are the Unfurleds, the Veils, the Florals and the Stripes or Pillars. From 1929 to 1933, Louis studied at the Maryland Institute of Fine and Applied Arts (now Maryland Institute College of Art). He worked at various odd jobs to support himself while painting and in 1935 was president of the Baltimore Artists' Association. From 1936 to 1940, he lived in New York and worked in the easel division of the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project. During this period, he knew Arshile Gorky, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jack Tworkov, returning to Baltimore in 1940. In 1948, he started to use Magna – <b>oil-based</b> acrylic paints. In 1952, Louis moved to Washington, D.C. Living in Washington, D.C., somewhat apart from the New York scene and working almost in isolation. He and a group of artists that included Kenneth Noland were central to the development of Color Field painting. The basic point about Louis's work and that of other Color Field painters, sometimes known as the Washington Color School in contrast to most of the other new approaches of the late 1950s and early 1960s, is that they greatly simplified the idea of what constitutes the look of a finished painting.|$|E
