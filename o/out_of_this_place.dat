2500|$|On 12 June 2007, Monkhouse posthumously {{appeared}} on British TV in an advertisement promoting awareness {{of prostate cancer}} for Male Cancer Awareness Week. Using computer animation techniques, Monkhouse was seen in a graveyard next to his own grave (though in reality he was cremated) talking about the disease seriously, interspersed with humorous asides to another camera ("What killed me kills one man per hour in Britain. That's even more than my wife's cooking."). He ended by saying, [...] "As a comedian, I've died many deaths. Prostate cancer, I don't recommend. I'd have paid good money to stay <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place.</b> What will it take you?" [...] before walking away from his grave and disappearing.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the morning}} of September 15, Jackson had {{positioned}} nearly 50 guns on Maryland Heights and {{at the base of}} Loudoun Heights, prepared to enfilade the rear of the Federal line on Bolivar Heights. Jackson began a fierce artillery barrage from all sides and ordered an infantry assault for 8 a.m. Miles realized that the situation was hopeless. He had no expectation that relief would arrive from McClellan in time and his artillery ammunition was in short supply. At a council of war with his brigade commanders, he agreed to raise the white flag of surrender. But he would not be personally present at any ceremony. He was confronted by a captain of the 126th New York Infantry, who said, [...] "For 's sake, Colonel, don't surrender us. Don't you hear the signal guns? Our forces are near us. Let us cut our way out and join them." [...] But Miles replied, [...] "Impossible. They will blow us <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place</b> in half an hour." [...] As the captain turned away in disdain, a shell exploded, shattering Miles's left leg. So disgusted were the men of the garrison with Miles's behavior, which some claimed involved being drunk again, it was difficult to find a man who would take him to the hospital. He was mortally wounded and died the next day. Some historians have speculated that Miles was struck deliberately by fire from his own men.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, take me <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> horrible <b>place,</b> and up {{into the}} world again;' {{and in a moment}} he was, {{standing}} by the river bank, with the purse tightly grasped in his hand.|$|R
60|$|Jack. You young scoundrel, Algy, {{you must}} get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place</b> as soon as possible. I don't allow any Bunburying here.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{might we}} not raise the anchor, and sail <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place,</b> leaving Spike ashore?" [...] {{suggested}} Rose, with more decision and spirit than discretion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed. I've {{been kept}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place</b> long enough--seeing as how the {{original}} owner {{gave me a}} half hold on it long before he died." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not afraid," [...] said Alora, with a laugh, [...] "but if {{it means}} our getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{tiresome}} <b>place</b> and sailing for home, I'm glad that Italy's gone into the war." ...|$|R
60|$|John. Anywhere, to {{save our}} lives; it is time enough to {{consider}} that when we are got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> town. If I am once <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> dreadful <b>place,</b> I care not where I go.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pelagia! Sister! My sister! Have {{mercy on}} me! on yourself! I will hide you! save you! {{and we will}} flee {{together}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> infernal <b>place!</b> <b>this</b> world <b>of</b> devils! I am your brother! Come!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyway, {{that is what}} I mean to do. I have no use for a man {{who sells}} my {{property}} to his friends. You'll get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place</b> to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Help me <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place,</b> sir, will you?" [...] he begged. [...] "As for Fenn {{and that}} other brute, what I {{have to say about}} them will keep." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Who the deuce is it, then? Lottchen never faints on a frolic. Some {{poor little}} girl lost in earnest. I must get her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> gloomy <b>place</b> at once, and find her party afterward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, then," [...] said Jacob Stuck, [...] "I {{would like}} you to help me <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> desert <b>place,</b> if you can do so, for it is a poor spot for any Christian soul to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Arrest!" [...] laughed Almayer, discordantly. [...] "Ha! ha! ha! Arrest! Why, I {{have been}} trying to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> infernal <b>place</b> for twenty years, and I can't. You hear, man! I can't, and never shall! Never!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom," [...] whispered Dick. [...] "I {{guess the}} best we can do is to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place.</b> If folks {{discover}} the trick you played, they'll mob you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place</b> {{as soon as}} we can. It {{is often}} hard {{to go back to the}} right path; but it may always be done,--or at least attempted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{come and}} see us, sir, won't you?" [...] he said to Pen. [...] "You'll talk over the governor, won't you, sir, if I can get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place</b> and down to Clavering?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said. [...] "Thank goodness, I shall get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> frightful <b>place</b> to-morrow, {{and soon}} have once more a roof {{of my own}} over my head. What an {{experience}} I have had since I have been here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Tom rose, {{trembling}} and excited, {{and there}} was an evil light in his eye. He strode to the door and said he must get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> suffocating <b>place</b> for a moment and clear his brain in the fresh air so that he could determine what to do. The door wouldn't open. Roxy smiled grimly, and said: ...|$|R

It was so good of you to think of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Twenty dollars {{will come}} pretty nigh settlin' for all them fellers {{have done to}} me. Now let's try to study up a plan for gettin' <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place.</b> There must be some way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So let us work to plan how we may best get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place.</b> After our {{escape from}} that well at Vannes {{we need not}} despair about {{breaking}} out from this dungeon of Holbeaut." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If that's so {{the sooner}} we get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place</b> the better," [...] and Jim would have headed the boat toward the outlet, but that Jet {{prevented}} him by pulling lustily on the other oar.|$|E

6000|$|The shaken Wilfred was {{led away}} by Father Brown, {{who had an}} easy and {{friendly}} way with him. [...] "Let us get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> horrid <b>place,</b> Mr. Bohun," [...] he said. [...] "May I look inside your church? I hear it's {{one of the oldest}} in England. We take some interest, you know," [...] he added with a comical grimace, [...] "in old English churches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is of no}} moment, now," [...] {{she then}} said, [...] "what {{may have been the}} motive of Mr. John Wallingford. With Miles, I thought him a rough, but an honest man; but honest men may be pardoned for not foreseeing their own sudden deaths.

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} {{that there must be}} some way <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>place,</b> Meinik. Why should they have taken the trouble to cut that long flight of steps through the rock, just to reach this miserable little chamber?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't tell tales {{like these}} in our country, and I'm thankful we can't. Still, I daresay {{it was such}} men as these who bred in us the grit to chase the whales in the Arctic, build our railroads through the snow-barred passes, and master the primeval forest. Now we'll try to forget them, and go back <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> creepy <b>place</b> to the fire again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, horrible!" [...] said Sarah. [...] "All {{that makes}} me shiver, and I am sure I don't need {{anything}} to make me do that.

6000|$|... "Sh! dear!" [...] whispered M. le duc in reply. [...] "We {{must get}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> loathsome <b>place</b> while <b>this</b> hideous row is going on.
