5|$|Female hippos reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{five to six}} years and have a gestation period of eight months. A study of endocrine systems revealed that female hippopotamuses may begin puberty as early as three or four years. Males reach maturity at around 7.5 yr. A study of hippopotamus reproductive behaviour in Uganda showed that peak conceptions occurred during the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season in late winter. This {{is because of the}} female's oestrous cycle; as with most large mammals, male hippopotamus spermatozoa is active year-round. Studies of hippos in Zambia and South Africa also showed evidence of births occurring at the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season. After becoming pregnant, a female hippopotamus will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.|$|E
5|$|The golden-crowned sifaka is a {{seasonal}} breeder, often mating {{during the last}} week of January. Its gestation period is a little less than six months, and its lactation period is five months. Research has indicated that reproduction is strategically linked with forest seasonality. Gestation starts in the later part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season (late January), and continues for approximately 170 days. Parturition occurs {{in the middle of the}} dry season (late June or July). Weaning occurs during the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season, in December, when an abundance of immature leaves is available. It is thought that such reproductive timing exists to ensure adequate protein intake from the immature leaves for both mother and child at the end of the lactation period.|$|E
5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{may also}} play a {{secondary}} role in olfaction, which {{may account for the}} size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the philtrum (a cleft in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> nose, or rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth. This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.|$|E
50|$|This {{measured}} pressure permits {{obtaining the}} pore diameter, which is calculated {{by using the}} Young-Laplace formula P= 4*γ*cos θ*/D in which D is the pore size diameter, P is the pressure measured, γ is <b>the</b> surface tension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> liquid and θ is <b>the</b> contact angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> liquid with <b>the</b> sample. The surface tension γ is a measurable physical property and depends on <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> liquid used. <b>The</b> contact angle θ depends on {{the interaction between the}} material and <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> liquid. In capillary flow porometry, in opposition to mercury intrusion porosimetry, <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> liquid enters spontaneously <b>the</b> pores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample ensuring a total <b>wetting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material, and therefore <b>the</b> contact angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> liquid with <b>the</b> sample is 0 and the previous formula can be simplied as: P= 4*γ/D.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Experiments were {{conducted}} to quantify <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> entrapped air on water infiltration into a loamy sand. Transparent three-dimensional (3 -D) and 2 -D columns were used for experiments carried out for two infiltration conditions: (1) when air was free to move ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> front and leave <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> column (air draining) and (2) when air was confined ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> front and hence could escape only through the soil surface (air confining). The measurement setup was composed of a tension-pressure infiltrometer, an air flowmeter, water manometers, and video-picture cameras. We applied {{both positive and negative}} water pressures at the soil surface and measured the simultaneous changes in <b>the</b> rates <b>of</b> water inflow and air outflow, the air pressure ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> front, and <b>the</b> dynamic behavior and advance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> front. <b>The</b> air pressure ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> front for <b>the</b> air-confining condition was generally found to increase with time rather than reaching a constant level, as observed in other studies by other researchers. The air pressure fluctuated locally because of air escaping from the soil surface. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results we present two empirical equations to predict the maximum air pressure at which air begins to erupt from the soi...|$|R

5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} breeds either {{alone or in}} small colonies {{averaging}} two to five nests in size, though nearly fifty nests are present at one site. It is monogamous and therefore does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate. It is believed to breed cooperatively in Equatorial Guinea, as four different birds were observed feeding one nest. The rockfowl's courtship displays are unknown. The timing of the egg laying in a colony is not synchronized, leading to various stages of development of nestlings within the colony. It {{has been suggested that}} this is to promote cooperative breeding. The laying dates also vary by region, typically coinciding with {{a few weeks before the}} onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season; in areas where the wet season is bimodal, two different breeding seasons occur. However, in mountainous regions such as Mount Cameroon, it breeds during the dry season to avoid the frequent mists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season. Birds in Nigeria lay their eggs between August and November, birds in Gabon lay between November and April, birds in western Cameroon lay between March and November with peaks of June, July, and October, and birds in southern Cameroon have two breeding seasons, a main one from October to December and a secondary one lasting from April to May. In Equatorial Guinea, nesting occurs in mid-February.|$|E
5|$|There are densely forested regions around Gangtok, {{consisting}} of temperate, deciduous forests of poplar, birch, oak, and elm, {{as well as}} evergreen, coniferous trees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> alpine zone. Orchids are common, and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. Bamboos are also abundant. In the lower reaches of the town, the vegetation gradually changes from alpine to temperate deciduous and subtropical. Flowers such as sunflower, marigold, poinsettia, and others bloom, especially in November and December.|$|E
5|$|Active mainly {{during the}} day, the impala may be gregarious or {{territorial}} {{depending upon the}} climate and geography. Three distinct social groups can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-predator strategy. Browsers as well as grazers, impala feed on monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). An annual, three-week-long rut takes place toward the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season, typically in May. Rutting males fight over dominance, and the victorious male courts female in oestrus. Gestation lasts six to seven months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males—forced out of the all-female groups—join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>wetting</b> layer {{serves as}} another {{parameter}} {{that can change}} <b>the</b> physics <b>of</b> a quantum dot.

The electronic structure and strain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantum dot change as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> layer. Theoretically, due to the lattice mismatch, finite thickness wetting layers are not stable and therefore admit some strain on the quantum dot.|$|R

5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during the rainy season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk {{and bring it to}} the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E

These measurements combined with <b>the</b> surface tension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aqueous solutions give an exact idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solutions. A rough measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> power is shown to be given by a measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface tension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aqueous solution.

It is therefore suggested that <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> takes place by penetration and not by spreading. Thus, <b>the</b> adhesion tension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aqueous solutions against oil gives a more correct measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> power. ...|$|R
5|$|Pallid {{sturgeon}} {{are generally}} bottom feeders, skimming the sandy {{reaches of the}} various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though {{little is known about}} the precise eating habits of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders. One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeon revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeon's eating habits as opportunistic. Fish is a more important dietary staple for pallid sturgeon than it is for shovelnose sturgeon. In one study comparing dietary tendencies between adult shovelnose sturgeon and immature pallid sturgeon, the pallid sturgeon was found to consume far greater numbers of small fish such as cyprinids (minnows). In another study conducted in the upper Missouri River region, an examination of the stomach contents of hatchery-reared pallid sturgeon showed that 82% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> weight was small fish and the balance was mosquito-like insects, mayflies, and caddis flies and small amounts of detritus and plant material.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction in most strepsirrhine species {{tends to}} be seasonal, {{particularly}} in lemurs. Key factors that affect seasonal reproduction include the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season, subsequent food availability, and the maturation time of the species. Like other primates, strepsirrhines are relatively slow breeders compared to other mammals. Their gestation period and interbirth intervals are usually long, and the young develop slowly, just like in haplorhine primates. Unlike simians, some strepsirrhines produce two or three offspring, although some produce only a single offspring. Those that produce multiple offspring tend to build nests for their young. These two traits {{are thought to be}} plesiomorphic (ancestral) for primates. The young are precocial (relatively mature and mobile) at birth, but not as coordinated as ungulates (hoofed mammals). Infant care by the mother is relatively prolonged compared to many other mammals, and in some cases, the infants cling to the mother's fur with their hands and feet.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos, CENIPA). Data from the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were downloaded by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States commencing July 20 and 23 respectively. Based on preliminary data from the FDR, on July 25 Airbus cautioned A320 operators to ensure that both thrust levers are set to idle during flare. The transcript of the CVR was released on August 1. It shows that the pilots were aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> runway conditions and the deactivated thrust reverser.

5|$|Then as now, Madagascar was an island, having {{separated}} from the Indian subcontinent less than 20 million years earlier. It was drifting northwards but still 10–15° more southerly in latitude than it is today. The prevailing climate of the time was semi-arid, with pronounced seasonality in temperature and rainfall. Majungasaurus inhabited a coastal flood plain cut by many sandy river channels. Strong geological evidence suggests the occurrence of periodic debris flows through these channels at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season, burying the carcasses of organisms killed during the preceding dry season and providing for their exceptional preservation as fossils. Sea levels in the area were rising throughout the Maastrichtian, and would {{continue to do so}} into the Paleocene Epoch, so Majungasaurus may have roamed coastal environments like tidal flats as well.

5|$|Wildebeest do {{not form}} {{permanent}} pair bonds {{and during the}} mating season, or rut, the males establish temporary territories and try to attract females into them. These small territories are about 3000 m2, with up to 300 territories per km2. The males defend these territories from other males while competing for females that are coming into season. The males use grunts and distinctive behaviour to entice females into their territories. Wildebeest usually breed {{at the end of}} the rainy season when the animals are well fed and at their peak of fitness.
