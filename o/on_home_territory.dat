50|$|Unlike the {{previous}} two seasons, however, {{the end of the}} season was not followed by the need to find a new pitch, in spite of the merger with Belle Vue. The club reconstituted itself as West Gorton Association Football Club, drawing up fixtures largely against the teams which St Mark's had been playing {{the previous}} season, as opposed to the calibre that Belle Vue had faced - though at this stage in the club's existence the difference in standard was small. The season saw West Gorton prove more successful on the pitch than its previous incarnations, winning their first four home games and not losing a single match at the Queens Road ground all season, scoring four times more goals than they conceded <b>on</b> <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As Blackburn {{continued}} {{in their attempts}} to return to the First Division, Eckersley continued to give good service to both club and country, collecting a total of 17 caps, as well as three [...] "B" [...] caps and representing the Football League on six occasions. His final England appearance came on 25 November 1953 in a friendly against Hungary. England lost the match 6-3, with Ferenc Puskás scoring twice and Nándor Hidegkuti converting a hat trick. This was England's second defeat by foreign opponents <b>on</b> <b>home</b> <b>territory</b> after Ireland, and the match changed the face of English football. As well as Eckersley, several other England players were never to represent their country, including Ramsey and Stan Mortensen. Eckersley had the ability to dribble {{all the way up to}} the opposition penalty area. With superb ball control, he was able to let a player pass him; he would then extend his left leg behind the opponent and nick the ball away without fouling the opposing player, thus earning him the [...] "telescopic leg" [...] tag.|$|E

25|$|The medieval Bulgarian {{army was}} the primary {{military}} body of the First and the Second Bulgarian Empires. During the first decades after {{the foundation of the}} country, the army consisted of a Bulgar cavalry and a Slavic infantry. The core of the Bulgarian army was the heavy cavalry, which consisted of 12,000–30,000 heavily armed riders. At its height in the 9th and 10th centuries, {{it was one of the}} most formidable military forces in Europe and was feared by its enemies. There are several documented cases of Byzantine commanders abandoning an invasion because of a reluctance to confront the Bulgarian army <b>on</b> its <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|R

50|$|An {{inconsistent}} 2010/11 saw Lightning finish 5th in {{the league}} and lose the play off final to Guildford Flames. 2011/12 fared no better, with the team again finishing 5th; having led the league in December. The team lost in the playoff quarter finals to eventual winners Slough Jets, despite taking a three-goal lead into the away leg. The 2012/13 season brought upheaval when in January 2013 Nick Poole unexpectedly announced his immediate retirement from playing. Lightning finished in 4th place and lost to Guildford Flames in the play off semi-finals, despite arguably playing the better hockey. The disruption continued in 2013/14 as home games were played in Coventry due to the renovation of the Milton Keynes rink. Due to a lack of practice ice time, the team struggled for consistency but finished in a credible 4th place. They were also the runners up to Basingstoke Bison in the cup. The 2014/15 season started with Lightning continuing to play out of Coventry. Indifferent early form left the team languishing {{near the bottom of the}} league. The refurbishment of the Milton Keynes rink was completed a month into the season and the first game back <b>on</b> <b>home</b> <b>territory</b> was played on the 18th October 2014 against Sheffield Steeldogs in front of a capacity crowd of 2,500. Despite the return to home ice; Lightning continued to perform poorly. The loss of key players through roster changes and a series of injuries increased pressure on an already struggling team saw Lightning finish the season in 7th place, their lowest ever position. Despite poor league performances, Lightning defeated Guildford in the playoff quarter finals before losing to Manchester Phoenix in the semi final game.|$|E
40|$|It's {{a decent}} bet {{that right now}} there are more guilty "robots" roaming the {{internet}} on the lookout for your unguarded e-mail address than there will ever be real robot canines patrolling our homes and gardens. But this book is not primarily driven by the actualities of current or future robots, being more closely aligned with modern science fiction's take on robots as philosophical devices. Just as a confused amnesiac in an art-house movie is a perfect vehicle for extended meditations on the nature of identity, imagined moody androids provide seductive raw material for a good muse on our origins, purpose and morality. Dutifully, David McFarland opens and closes his new book with the imagined moral panic surrounding a humanoid traffic cop. Could one ever really be capable of replacing a person? Could one ever really be culpable, in place of its human designer, if it were to make some fatal error? The scenario is a brief distraction, though, because the book's central concern is not people but animals and the robots that might resemble them: think mechanical sniffer dogs, robot pack mules, carrier cyber-pigeons and maybe K 9. After refocusing on this menagerie, McFarland sets sail for the deep waters surrounding an old question: what would it take for such a machine or animal to have a mind, one that would presumably be alien to our own? By approaching the problem from a bio-robotic direction, his hope is to navigate a route that avoids some of the choppier confusions. McFarland built a career as an Oxbridge roboticist and biologist, interpreting animals as if they were machines and machines as if they were animals. At times, it seems that he is maintaining the distinction only as a courtesy to the reader, having long since convinced himself that you might as well lump them together and proceed accordingly. He's happier equipping a robot guard dog with skunk-inspired stink-squirters than Taser guns, but it is this readiness to reach for an example from the world of animals rather than people that keeps the book on course. Careful use of research on crafty Caledonian crows, doggy dreams, self-sufficient slug-bots and vomiting pigeons allows him to steer clear of questions of (human) conscious experience until the later chapters. McFarland is <b>on</b> <b>home</b> <b>territory</b> dishing up a patented blend of behaviourism (infamously discredited) and economics (infamously dismal). By salvaging a surprisingly defensible hybrid of the two, he is able to use cost-benefit thinking to explain the critical balance of decision-making that a successful autonomous robot or animal must be capable of in order to continually "do the right thing". But before squaring up to McFarland's main event, the book has first to take in a daunting litany of philosophical positions, and while he trawls through them diligently, you get the feeling there is little joy in clearing the ground. Rather, he's fishing around in the science and philosophy of rationality and subjectivity (and tossing most of his catch straight back) in order to demonstrate that what prevents us from readily acknowledging the potential for fully fledged robot minds is just an "alienist" chauvinism that will dissolve as we come to regard robots (and some animals) as "us" rather than "them", despite their "alien lifestyles". This abrupt sociological turn is delayed until the final sentences, leaving the reader to reflect unaccompanied on just how alien a "lifestyle" would need to be before we begin to feel that there might not actually be "something that it is like" to be that alien something or someone, and they begin to feel the same about us...|$|E
50|$|The French Revolution of 1789 {{revived the}} hopes of {{all members of the}} Whig party in Scotland and England, in their {{campaign}} for burgh and county reform. However, as the Revolution progressed and England witnessed the emergence of popular reform societies advocating Parliamentary reform, the aristocratic section of the Whigs began to fear the spread of revolutionary ideology <b>on</b> to <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b> It was in an attempt to forestall such a development that the younger generation of Foxite Whigs in Parliament and the Lords inaugurated in April 1792 the London Association of the Friends of the People. Led by the Scots Lords, Lauderdale and Buchan, this society enjoyed widespread initial support from leading Whigs throughout Britain.|$|R
25|$|On 24 August, Hitler {{approved}} a general plan for seizing Gibraltar. On 23 October, he personally met with Franco at Hendaye, France, and proposed that Spain enter {{the war on}} the Axis side as early as January 1941; Gibraltar would be taken by special Wehrmacht units and turned over to Spain. Franco however refused the offer, emphasizing Spain's need for large-scale military and economic assistance. Hitler took offence when Franco expressed doubts {{about the possibility of}} a German victory in fighting the UK <b>on</b> its <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b> Franco also pointed out that even if the British Isles were invaded and conquered, the British government, as well as most of the British Army and vastly powerful Royal Navy, would probably retreat to Canada and continue the Battle of the Atlantic, with U.S. support.|$|R

40|$|Sardinian Warbler Sylvia melanocephala is the commonest Sylvia warbler in shrubland with a Mediterranean climate {{with mild}} winters (Shirihai et al. 2001). It uses {{a wide range}} of habitats, such as scrublands and maquis, open forests {{containing}} bushy undergrowth, as well as agricultural areas and urban gardens (Cody & Walter 1976, Shirihai et al. 2001). It can breed in forests or maquis that have recently burned (Pons & Prodon 1996) although these {{have been found to be}} lower-quality habitats (Herrando & Brotons 2001). They are a site-tenacious, territorial and monogamous species during the breeding period (Cramp 1985). Although some data exist on the breeding densities and territory size for the species, there is none <b>on</b> <b>home</b> range. <b>Territory</b> is defined as a defended area, dominated and/or exclusive, where the bird drives off his congeneric neighbours or warns them of his territorial status (Maher & Lott 1995); home range is defined as the area traversed by the individual in its normal activ-ities of food gathering, resting, mating and caring for young. The home range of the congeneric Sylvia atricapilla, studied by a capture–recapture method, is seven times bigger than its territory (Ferry et al. 1981).

He led the Sacred Harp Publishing Company into the business of creating recordings of Sacred Harp music, made by groups of experienced singers and serving to this day as a valuable source of information on traditional singing practice. McGraw also made many gestures of friendship to newcomer singers, including those outside the South, and can be considered one of the factors responsible for the extensive geographic spread of Sacred Harp singing in recent decades.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose – The FNEGE {{and then}} EFMD have been {{interested}} in defining a methodology that would make it possible to highlight the impact of a business school <b>on</b> its <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b> This has {{led to the development of}} the “Business School Impact System” (BSIS), which is introduced in this paper. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is structured as follows. The authors first present the methodological issues of the work that led us to develop the “BSIS” (EFMD, 2014). In a second section, the authors present BSIS in more detail. Findings – Based on the exploratory interviews and the literature review, the authors could first identify three main categories of impact: the financial impact; the impact on the regional community; and the impact on attractiveness and image. Originality/value – The first benefit of BSIS is linked to the creation of an information system on impact. Second, the BSIS process increases the awareness inside the business school regarding the significance of this issue. Third, the authors observe that for numerous members of the business school the question of the impact of their activity gives them a better image of their job, of what they are doing and why they are doing it. Fourth, the BSIS report constitutes a powerful tool for communication with the stakeholders. The final benefit lies in the reviewers’ recommendations on how to improve the impact of the business school...|$|R
