40|$|Pivampicillin was {{administered}} as an <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> to five healthy adult horses, and an <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> with ampicillin trihydrate {{was administered}} to three horses, Pivampicillin {{was administered to}} both starved and fed horses, ampicillin trihydrate was administered to fed horses only, The dose of pivampicillin was 19. 9 mg/kg, and the dose of ampicillin trihydrate was 17 mg/kg, Both doses are equivalent on a molecular basis to 15 mg/kg ampicillin, Ampicillin concentrations in plasma were determined up to 24 hours after administration, After administration of pivampicillin to starved and fed horses the mean areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCs) were 23. 0 and 19. 3 mu g. h. ml(- 1), respectively, After administration of ampicillintrihydrate to fed horses the mean AUC was 0. 7 mu g. h. ml(- 1). The peak plasma concentrations were 4. 8, 6. 7, and 0. 1 mu g/ml, after administration of pivampicillin to starved and fed horses and of ampicillin trihydrate to fed horses, respectively, There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in peak plasma concentration or AUC between pivampicillin administered to starved or fed horses, It is concluded that pivampicillin administered as an <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> at a dose of 19. 9 mg/kg gives satisfactory plasma concentrations in both starved and fed horses, whereas ampicillin trihydrate produces negligible plasma concentrations, Pivampicillin binds to feedstuffs at the pH found in the horse's stomach and small intestine. After incubation for 6 h at pH 6, approximately 15 % remains in solution, and after incubation for 3 h at pH 1. 9, approximately 40 % remains in solution, Ampicillin, which binds to feedstuffs to a lesser extent, has a lower bioavailability than pivampicillin, Therefore, binding to feedstuffs {{does not seem to be}} a critical factor in the absorption of aminopenicillins...|$|E

Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted on 100 patients diagnosed to have recurrent minor aphthous ulcers of which, 50 patients were advised to apply 5 % amlexanox <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> directly on the ulcer 4 times a day for 6 days and the other 50 patients were given placebo paste for the same duration. The baseline parameters were recorded on the first visit which includes ulcer size, pain, erythema and exudation. Efficacy and safety evaluations were made on the 4 th day and 6 th day. In total 30 patients with increased frequency of ulcers were advised to use 5 % amlexanox paste for one whole year and the number of ulcers per month was recorded to evaluate any decrease in the recurrence rate. Results: Male patients dominated the study with 73 males and 27 females. The mean age of the total sample was 26. 6 years. The amlexanox group showed marked reduction in ulcer size (P < 0. 001), significant reduction in the visual analog scale scores of pain (P < 0. 001), significant lower scores of erythema and exudation (P < 0. 001) when compared to the placebo group on the 6 th day of follow-up.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the antiparasitic spot-on formulation containing imidacloprid 10 %/moxidectin 1 % (Advocate, Bayer) in the treatment of natural feline infection with the lungworm Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (Nematoda, Strongylida). The efficacy of Advocate administered once was tested in comparison to a control oral formulation containing fenbendazole 18. 75 % (Panacur Intervet) administered over three consecutive days based on larvae per gramme of faeces (LPG), measured on days 28 +/- 2 following treatment and compared to counts on days - 6 to - 2. In total 24 cats treated either with Advocate (n = 12) or with Panacur (n = 12) were included. Mean LPG postbaseline (days 28 +/- 2) were low in both treatment groups, i. e., 0 LPG for Advocate and 1. 3 LPG for Panacur. Reduction of post-baseline larval counts showed Advocate (100 % reduction) to be superior in efficacy compared to the control product (99. 29 % reduction). No treated animals showed adverse events.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A simple, {{reproducible}} {{and efficient}} reversed phase high performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method {{has been developed}} for the estimation of a recently approved anti allergic drug, amlexanox in <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> dosage form. The separations were carried out on a Zorbax Eclipse XBD, C 18 column (150 x 4. 6 mm; 5 µm) at a flow rate of 1. 50 ml/min. by using mobile phase comprising of mixed buffer (pH adjusted to 6. 50) and methanol (50 : 50 v/v). The injection volume was 10 µl and the peaks were detected at 244 nm. The linear dynamic range found {{to be in the}} concentration range of 15 - 35 µg/ml and coefficient of correlation was found to be 0. 999. The %RSD value was below 2. 0 for intra-day and inter-day precision which indicated that the method was highly precise. The LOD (Limit of detection) and LOQ (Limit of quantitation) were found to be 3. 8 ng/ml and 12. 5 ng/ml, respectively which revealed that the method was highly sensitive. The percentage recovery of amlexanox ranged from 99. 31 to 99. 75 %, indicating the accuracy of the method and absence of interference from the excipients present in the formulation. The proposed method was simple, fast, accurate and reproducible and hence can be applied for routine quality control operations of amlexanox in <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> dosage form...|$|E

The only preparations registered to reindeer are those for subcutaneous injection. However, also oral extra-label ivermectin administration is used. Twenty-six, 8 -month-old reindeer calves were randomly allocated into three groups. Group 1 (n&# 8201;=&# 8201; 9) received oral ivermectin mixture (Ivomec&# 174; vet mixt. 0. 8 &# 160;mg/ml, oral ovine liquid drench formulation), Group 2 (n&# 8201;=&# 8201; 9) <b>oral</b> ivermectin <b>paste</b> (Ivomec&# 174; vet 18. 7 &# 160;mg/g equine paste), and Group 3 (n&# 8201;=&# 8201; 8) subcutaneous injection of ivermectin (Ivomec&# 174; 10 &# 160;mg/ml vet inj.), each group at {{a dose of}} 200 &# 160;&# 956;g/kg body weight.

40|$|SUMMARY A single oral dose of {{ivermectin}} paste {{was administered}} to 12 horses with dermatitis and clinical signs typical of onchocerciasis. Two of the horses also had lesions of Queensland itch. Microfilarias of Onchocerca cervicalis were identified in fresh, macerated, skin biopsies from the neck, brisket or umbilical regions of all horses and microfilarias of O. gutturosa from the neck of 2. Eight of the horses developed skin reactions 4 to 24 h after {{the administration of the}} ivermectin, notably weals over the neck, shoulders and flanks and pitting oedema of the ventral midline and intermandibular space. Regression of the onchocerciasis lesions was evident within 7 days of treatment and affected skin had returned to normal within 3 months. The lesions of Queensland itch were not affected by the ivermectin treatment. Microfilarias were present in biopsies of skin, particularly in the superficial dermis, before treatment, but were absent from all skin biopsies taken one week after treatment. In some horses transient skin sensitivity reactions developed. Microfilarias began to reappear in the biopsies of some of the horses 2 months after treatment. It is concluded that the <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> formulation of ivermectin, although not effective against adult onchocerca, is useful for the therapeutic control of microfilarias in the skin lesions of equine onchocerciasis.

40|$|Objectives : Lichen planus (LP) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} mucocutaneous disease. Its treatment is often symptomatic and includes topical and systemic corticosteroids. Although corticosteroid therapy is usually successful, it has {{side effects and}} thus, an alternative treatment is favorable. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the efficacy of topical curcumin and triamcinolone for treatment of oral lichen planus (OLP).   Materials and Methods: In this study, 50 patients (36 women and 14 men) in the age range of 38 to 73 years with OLP were randomly divided into two groups. Each group received 0. 1 % triamcinolone or 5 % curcumin <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> three times a day for four weeks. Assessment of the appearance score and severity of pain was done at baseline and at the end of two and four weeks and recorded in the patients’ questionnaires.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if a single loading dose (LD), 3 × the label dose of firocoxib <b>oral</b> <b>paste,</b> followed by nine maintenance doses at the current label dose achieves and maintains near steady state concentrations. Six healthy, adult mares were administered 0. 3 mg/kg of firocoxib on Day 0, and 0. 1 mg/kg 24 h later on Day 1, and at 24 h intervals from Day 2 to Day 9, for a total of 10 doses. Blood samples were collected throughout the study. The mean firocoxib maximum plasma concentration and standard deviation was 199 ± 97 ng/mL, 175 ± 44 ng/mL and 183 ± 50 ng/mL after the LD, and first and last maintenance doses, respectively. The minimum mean concentration (Cmin) increased from 100 ± 23 ng/mL after the LD to 132 ± 38 ng/mL at Day 7. Then, the Cmin remained constant until Day 9. The average concentration at steady state (Cavg) was 150 ± 45 ng/mL, which compares well to the Cavg (130 ± 36 ng/mL) reported after multiple daily doses at 0. 1 mg/kg. The administration of the single LD allowed achievement of the average steady state drug concentrations faster than a multi-dose regimen without a loading dose. After the LD, firocoxib at 0. 1 mg/kg every 24 h was able to maintain a relatively constant average drug concentration which should produce less variability in onset of action and efficacy. doi: 10. 1016 /j. tvjl. 2013. 07. 03...|$|E
40|$|Objective-To {{determine}} {{prevalence of}} anthelmintic resistance in cyathostome nematodes of {{horses in the}} southern United States. Design-Cross-sectional study. Animals- 786 horses on 44 farms and stables in Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Kentucky, and Louisiana. Procedure-Fecal egg count (FEC) reduction tests were performed on 44 large farms and stables. Horses on each farm were treated with an <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> formulation of fenbendazole, oxibendazole, pyrantel pamoate, or ivermectin at recommended label dosages. A mixed linear model was fitted to the percentage reduction in FEC, accounting for differences among farms, states, ages, treatments, and treatment by state interactions. Results-By use of a conservative measure of resistance (< 80 % reduction), the percentage of farms with anthelmintic-resistant cyathostomes was 977 %, 0 %, 53. 5 %, and 40. 5 % for fenbendazole, ivermectin, oxibendazole, and pyrantel pamoate, respectively. Mean percentage reductions in FEC for all farms were 24. 8 %, 99. 9 %, 73. 8 %, and 78. 6 % for fenbendazole, ivermectin, oxibendazole, and pyrantel pamoate, respectively. Pairwise contrasts between states for each treatment revealed that in almost all instances, {{there were no significant}} differences in results between states. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The prevalence of resistance found in this study was higher than that reported previously, suggesting that anthelmintic resistance in equine cyathostomes is becoming a major problem. Furthermore, data from these 5 southern states, which are geographically and physiographically distinct, were remarkably similar.

40|$|Purpose: Selective {{decontamination}} of {{the digestive}} tract (SDD) {{has been shown to}} decrease the infection rate and mortality in intensive care units (ICUs); Lactobacillus plantarum 299 / 299 v plus fibre (LAB) has been used for infection prevention and does not harbour the potential disadvantages of antibiotics. The objective was to assess whether LAB is not inferior to SDD in infection prevention. Methods: Two hundred fifty-four consecutive ICU patients with expected mechanical ventilation ≥ 48 h and/or expected ICU stay ≥ 72 h were assigned to receive SDD: four times daily an <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> (polymyxin E, gentamicin, amphotericin B), enteral solution (same antibiotics), intravenous cefotaxime (first 4 days) or LAB: two times daily L. plantarum 299 / 299 v with rose-hip. Results: The primary endpoint was infection rate. A difference < 12 % between both groups indicated non-inferiority of LAB. The trial was prematurely stopped after a study reporting increased mortality in critically ill pancreatitis patients receiving probiotics. No significant difference in infection rate [31 % in the LAB group, 24 % in the SDD group (OR 1. 68, 95 % CI 0. 91 - 3. 08; p = 0. 10) ] was found.

At necropsy, tapeworms in equids were identified as attached to the mucosa or unattached and, with a stereoscope, as normal or abnormal. At the time of treatment and at 6 -h intervals thereafter, fecal samples were taken for egg counts. The efficacy of pyrantel pamoate was 96. 6 %; in 1 equid the efficacy was 75. 3 %, and in 8 it was 100 %. “Major fragments” (worms without a scolex) accounted for 10 % of the tapeworms recovered; they {{were not included in}} the efficacy analysis but should be. In 3 untreated equids necropsied, tapeworms were in the cecum, and 21. 3 % were detached.

Methods We performed a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel, multicenter clinical study. A total of 216 patients with minor recurrent aphthous ulcers (MiRAU) were recruited and randomized to amlexanox pellicles or placebo pellicles. Pellicles were consecutively applied four times per day, for five days. The size and pain level of ulcers were measured and recorded on treatment days 0, 4 and 6. Finally, the results were compared with those of our previous 104 cases treated with amlexanox tablets. Results Amlexanox oral adhesive pellicles significantly reduced ulcer size (P= 0. 017 for day 4, P= 0. 038 for day 6) and alleviated ulcer pain (P= 0. 021 for day 4, P= 0. 036 for day 6). No significant difference was observed in the treatment effectiveness between the pellicle and tablet form of amlexanox. Conclusions Amlexanox oral adhesive pellicles are as effective and safe as amlexanox oral adhesive tablets in the treatment of MiRAU for this Chinese cohort. However, pellicles seem to be more comfortable to use when compared with the dosage form of tablets. Therefore, in clinical practice, amlexanox oral adhesive pellicles may be a better choice for RAS patients. Trials registration Nederlands Trial Register NTR 1727. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{current level}} of {{anthelmintic}} resistance in the horse-breeding industry is extremely high and therefore more emphasis is being placed on studies {{that focus on the}} judicious use of anthelmintic products. The aims of the study were to: 1) establish if there is variation in the egg excretion pattern of strongyles between the different age classes of Thoroughbred horses in the Western Cape Province (WCP), 2) test if a selective treatment approach successfully reduces the number of anthelmintic treatments and maintains acceptably low helminth burdens in adult Thoroughbred horses, and 3) evaluate the efficacy of subsampling large horse herds for faecal egg counts (FECs) to monitor the strongyle burden. In 2001 the FECs of 4 adult mare, 5 yearling and 3 weanling herds from 8 different farms were compared in the WCP. Within the mare herds there were generally fewer eggexcreting individuals with lower mean FECs compared with the younger age classes. Individual faecal samples were collected every 3 - 4 weeks from 52 adult Thoroughbred mares from 1 farm in the WCP during a 12 -month period (2002 / 2003). Animals with strongyle FECs &gt; 100 eggs per gram (epg) were treated with an ivermectin-praziquantel combination drug (Equimax <b>oral</b> <b>paste,</b> Virbac). The mean monthly strongyle FEC for the entire group was &lt; 300 epg throughout the study and the number of treatments was reduced by 50 %. Resampling methods showed that an asymptote to mean FEC was reached at 55 animals for each of the pooled weanling, yearling and mare egg counts. Resampling within 4 different mare herds recorded asymptotes of between 24 and 28 animals. Subsampling entire herds for FECs therefore provided an effective approach to treatment management. This study demonstrates that selective treatment is both a practical and an effective approach to the management of anthelmintic resistance...|$|E
40|$|Mebendazole (MBZ) {{has been}} {{licensed}} {{for use in}} horses and donkeys, however there are no data available in the literature regarding its pharmacokinetic disposition and efficacy in donkeys. This {{study was designed to}} determine the plasma disposition, milk excretion and anthelmintic efficacy of MBZ in donkeys naturally infected by Cyathostominae. The animals were allocated to three groups, each of six donkeys. One group was untreated control (C-group) and the others were treated using a paste formulation of MBZ administered per os at the manufacturer's recommended horse dosage of 10 mg/kg body weight (MBZ 1) and at the double horse dosage 20 mg/kg body weight (MBZ 2). Blood and milk samples were collected at various times between 1 h and 120 h post treatment and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector. Individual FECs (Faecal Egg Counts) were performed on each animal before the treatment (day- 3) and weekly from day 7 until day 56 post treatment using a modified McMaster technique. The plasma concentrations and systemic exposure of MBZ in donkeys were relatively lower compared with the other methylcarbamate benzimidazoles. Dose-dependent plasma dispositions of MBZ were observed at the increased dosage (10 mg/kg vs 20 mg/kg) in donkeys. MBZ was not detected in any milk samples at a dosage of 10 mg/kg. However, the parent drug reached 0. 01 μg/ml peak milk concentration at 10. 66 h and AUCmilk/AUCplasma value was 0. 18 ± 0. 02 at a dosage of 20 mg/kg bodyweight. This study indicated that per os administration of MBZ has a minimal disposition rate into the milk and may be used in lactating donkeys with zero milk-withdrawal period. The results of FECRT for both MBZ dosages were efficient (> 95 % efficacy) until day 28. This trial demonstrates that MBZ <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> at horse dosage (10 mg/kg B. W.) was effective and safety for the treatment of Cyathostominae in donkeys. Therefore, similar dosage regimens of MBZ could be used for horses and donkeys...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to mask the bitter taste of praziquantel. The product into which the taste masked {{formulations}} were to be incorporated was an <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> intended {{for the treatment of}} cats. Four different approaches to achieve taste masking were tested. First of all, microspheres with the active ingredient being embedded into a polymer matrix consisting of Eudragit E were produced. Moreover, taste masking as a result of complexation with β-cyclodextrin was tested as the formation of a true inclusion complex of praziquantel in β-cyclodextrin could be demonstrated. Another technique included incorporation into lipid microparticles. Finally, praziquantel being a racemic drug the isolated enantiomers were tested separately for their acceptance. The taste masked formulations were then incorporated into different pastes (bases: water, Miglyol or PEG) according to their properties and the acceptance by cats was tested. A poor result was scored for the Eudragit E microspheres in PEG which was mainly caused by the solubility of the active ingredient in this base. The drug-β-cyclodextrin complex and the lipid particles were both tested in Miglyol and water. In an oily paste rather low acceptance values were scored whereas in an aqueous paste satisfactory levels were reached. These could be increased slightly upon addition of a ﬂavor. This result could be equaled with an in situ formed complex between praziquantel and β-cyclodextrin in an aqueous paste which was desired due to production and registration purposes. The separated praziquantel enantiomers were also tested in water and signiﬁcantly different values were reached for them with (−) -praziquantel being preferred to its (+) -enantiomer. The acceptance level for (−) praziquantel, however, was not signiﬁcantly lower than that of the paste containing β-cyclodextrin and a ﬂavor. Hence, an improvement of the results for (−) -praziquantel might be possible if taste masking agents were added. So in conclusion, taste masking of praziquantel was achieved in form of an aqueous paste containing β-cyclodextrin and a ﬂavor as taste masking agents: the resulting paste is willingly taken by cats and also rated easily applicable by pet owners. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{development}} of anthelmintic resistance (AR) to macrocyclic lactones in the equine roundworm Parascaris equorum {{has resulted in}} benzimidazoles now being {{the most widely used}} substance to control Parascaris infections. However, over-reliance on one drug class is a risk factor for the {{development of}} AR. Consequently, benzimidazole resistance is widespread in several veterinary parasites, where it is associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in drug targets encoded by the beta-tubulin genes. The importance of these SNPs varies between different parasitic nematodes, but it has been hypothesised that they occur, at low allele frequencies, even in unselected populations. This study investigated whether these SNPs exist in the P. equorum population and tested the hypothesis that BZ resistance can develop from pre-existing SNPs in codons 167, 198 and 200 of the beta-tubulin isotype 1 and 2 genes, reported to be associated with AR in strongylids. The efficacy of the <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> formula fenbendazole on 11 farms in Sweden was also assessed. Methods: Two isotype-specific primer pairs were designed, one {{on either side of the}} codon 167 and one on either side of codons 198 and 200. A pool of 100 000 larvae was sequenced using deep amplicon sequencing by Illumina HiSeq. Faecal egg count reduction test was used to assess the efficacy of fenbendazole. Results: No SNPs were observed in codons 167, 198 or 200 of the beta-tubulin isotype 1 or 2 genes of P. equorum, even though 100 000 larvae were sequenced. Faecal egg count reduction testing of fenbendazole showed that this anthelmintic was still 100 % effective, meaning that the likelihood of finding high allele frequency of SNPs associated with benzimidazoles resistance in P. equorum was low. Unexpectedly, the allele frequencies observed in single worms were comparable to those in pooled samples. Conclusions: We concluded that fenbendazole does not exert selection pressure on the beta-tubulin genes of isotypes 1 and 2 in P. equorum. The fact that no pre-existing SNPs were found in codons 167, 198 and 200 in P. equorum also illustrates the difficulties in generalising about AR mechanisms between different taxonomic groups of nematodes...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of an oral treatment with ivermectin (IVM) or moxidectin (MOX) against gastro-intestinal strongyles in naturally infected horses by performing a faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) and by monitoring the egg reappearance period (ERP) after treatment. Therefore, a field efficacy study with a randomised complete block design for each study site was conducted, with the individual animal as the experimental unit. At least 10 study sites in Italy, Belgium and The Netherlands were selected and animals were allocated to one of the two treatment groups based on the pre-treatment faecal egg counts (FEC). Animals were treated on Day 0 with an <b>oral</b> <b>paste</b> containing either IVM (at 0. 2 mg/kg bodyweight) or MOX (at 0. 4 mg/kg bodyweight). After treatment, faecal samples were collected at least every fortnight during 56 days after treatment with IVM and during 84 days after MOX treatment. In total, 320 horses on 32 farms were examined. The FECRT on Day 14 indicated a 100 % efficacy in 59 of the 64 treatment groups and > 92 % efficacy in the remaining 5 groups. The ERP was decreased for at least one of the anthelmintics on 17 out of 32 study sites (15 sites or 47 % for MOX and 17 sites or 53 % for IVM) and on 9 sites (28 %) the ERP was decreased for both anthelmintics. On some of these study sites the efficacy declined at the end of the expected ERP, often with good efficacy 2 weeks earlier. Nevertheless, on 1, 3 and 5 study sites in Italy, Belgium and The Netherlands respectively, an efficacy below 90 % for IVM and MOX was identified as soon as Day 42 or Day 56. In The Netherlands, the efficacy of IVM was below 90 % from Day 28 or Day 35 after treatment on 1 site each. The present study reports a high efficacy of MOX and IVM in a FECRT 14 days after treatment, yet does indicate a shortened ERP for these treatments in more than half of the selected study site...|$|E
