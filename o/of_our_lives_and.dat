25|$|Although it {{is widely}} thought that Another World {{expansion}} to 90 minutes was a cause of ratings erosion, the decision to expand the show was made {{at a time when}} its ratings (and that of NBC's other serials) were already in steady decline. During the period when Another World ran daily for 90 minutes it remained NBC's highest-rated soap opera, as it had been for a decade. In the second half of 1980, after the show returned to 60 minutes, Another World and fellow NBC serials Days <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Lives</b> <b>and,</b> most dramatically, The Doctors, experienced a collapse in ratings from which NBC's daytime lineup never fully recovered. It would not be until 1983 that both Days <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Lives</b> <b>and</b> Another World would recover some of their lost ground.|$|E

25|$|Soap operas were {{originally}} broadcast {{live from the}} studio, creating what many at the time regarded as a feeling {{similar to that of}} a stage play. As nearly all soap operas were originated at that time in New York City, a number of soap actors were also accomplished stage actors who performed live theatre during breaks from their soap roles. In the 1960s and 1970s, new serials such as General Hospital, Days <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Lives</b> <b>and</b> The Young and the Restless were produced in Los Angeles. Their success made the West Coast a viable alternative to New York-produced soap operas, which were becoming more costly to perform. By the early 1970s, nearly all soap operas had transitioned to being taped. As the World Turns and The Edge of Night were the last to make the switch, in 1975.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, The Price Is Right marked its 35th {{consecutive}} {{year on the}} air. It is the longest-running game show of all time in North America, {{and at the time}} was the last surviving show in the daytime game show genre, having survived (at the time) twelve years after its last competitor had been canceled. (CBS later revived daytime game shows in 2009.) Overall, in daytime programming (excluding Saturday and Sunday), The Price Is Right is ranked sixth among the longest-continuing daytime television programs (NBC's Today ranks the longest, followed by four daytime soap operas: Guiding Light, As the World Turns, General Hospital, and Days <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Lives),</b> <b>and</b> moved into fifth in September 2009 after Guiding Light aired its final episode on CBS. It has won its time slot (11:00a.m. Eastern) for the past 25years with its closest competitor (currently ABC's The View) normally getting about half of TPIR's ratings.|$|E
25|$|As {{that year}} began, Another World was {{expanded}} to 60 minutes, {{with their first}} hour-long episode airing on January 6, 1975. Although this did not directly affect As the World Turns, as the two shows were not in competition for {{anything other than the}} overall ratings win, CBS' afternoon lineup suffered some ratings damage as the popular soap put a dent in the ratings of both of CBS' popular afternoon game shows, The Price Is Right and Match Game. NBC, pleased by the success that the expansion of Another World had brought to the network, elected {{to do the same thing}} with Days of Our Lives beginning on April 21, 1975; this put Days <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Lives</b> <b>and</b> As the World Turns in direct competition for ratings. Incidentally, the expansions were occurring seven years after the last two 15-minute serials, Search for Tomorrow and The Guiding Light, expanded to 30 minutes.|$|E

25|$|On April 12, 1999, {{as part of}} a shakeup of the network's daytime {{and early}} morning {{schedules}} (in which NBC also cancelled NBC News at Sunrise – with newcomer Early Today replacing it as the network's early-morning newscast – and picked up the daytime talk show Later Today, a short-lived spinoff of Today), NBC announced that it would not renew Another World, ending the series' run after 35 years once the show's previous renewal agreement ended that June. Many reasons abounded for Another World cancellation, one of the more notable events occurred in the summer of 1998: the network's San Francisco affiliate KRON-TV (now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) – at the time one of NBC's highest-rated stations – stopped airing the show altogether, leaving Days <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Lives</b> <b>and</b> Sunset Beach as the only NBC soaps that the station cleared on its schedule; the move resulted in Another World being unavailable in around two million television households within the large San Francisco–Oakland–San Jose market, resulting in additional erosion of the program's already below-mediocre ratings (it was later picked up by smaller independent station KICU-TV).|$|E
25|$|For {{most of its}} tenure with NBC, KRON was the network's second-largest {{affiliate}} and {{its largest}} on the West Coast. Despite this, KRON occasionally pre-empted NBC programming. One such notable omission was Another World, which would eventually air on the station in the early 1990s; KRON's decision to drop the daytime soap opera {{in the summer of}} 1998 (leaving Days <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Lives</b> <b>and</b> the struggling Sunset Beach as the only network soaps on its schedule) is thought to have hastened NBC's decision to cancel it altogether a year later. Two NBC daytime game shows, 50 Grand Slam and Just Men!, were never seen in the Bay Area. KRON also did not air NBC's soap operas in pattern (for example, KRON-TV aired Days of Our Lives after Another World, rather than the standard slot for NBC affiliates in the Pacific Time Zone—at 2:00 or 3:00p.m. depending on the season and time slot). Channel 4 also pre-empted some of the network's prime time programs. Similar to fellow NBC station KCRA-TV in neighboring Sacramento, KRON-TV stopped airing the Saturday morning T-NBC lineup in the early 1990s. Historically, NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than the other networks, but has recently eased its standards. The network would resort to purchasing stations {{for the sole purpose of}} switching or upgrading them to O status because of this (Miami's WTVJ and Salt Lake City's KUTV are such examples) or find independent stations to air NBC programs that the main affiliate did not air. In the case of KRON, many of the shows it preempted ended up on independent KICU-TV (channel 36). However, despite losing valuable advertising in one of the nation's largest television markets, NBC was very satisfied with KRON-TV, which was one of its strongest affiliates.|$|E

500|$|In 1772, {{many of the}} {{thirteen}} British colonies, in response to unpopular British actions and the negative British reaction to the Gaspee Affair (the destruction by colonists of a grounded ship involved in enforcing customs regulations), elected to form Committees of Correspondence. These allowed communities to formally communicate with each other, raise awareness of incidents occurring elsewhere, and to coordinate actions; as such, they became instrumental in managing the colonial response to enforcement of the Tea Act, the Intolerable Acts, and other unpopular British colonial legislation. The colonists of Massachusetts had not yet taken concerted action to organize themselves militarily against actions of the British regulars, although statements were made about supporting Boston (whose port had been closed earlier in 1774 under the Boston Port Act) [...] "at the risque <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> fortunes." ...|$|E

[...] Here we help the girls with this aim in view.' In 1970, after the Rev. Bill McLeod spoke to some of the seniors and advised those intending to become a nurse or a teacher to learn Greek or Italian (to aid communication with immigrants), Miss Whitlam took up the suggestion: 'We have people with time to do something after the exams {{at the end of each}} year - let's organise Greek classes for them'. In March 1972 the school also produced a newsletter ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ ΝΕΑ providing background on Greek culture and language and a bibliography of relevant books in the school library.|$|E

The song was initially to be included on Cyrus's 2010 album Can't Be Tamed; however, {{it was decided to}} include it on The Time of Our Lives as well as The Last Song because it fit the film's concept well.

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1967, it was decided the Christmas Candle would be renamed the Peace Candle, because the city planned to sell Christmas cards {{depicting}} the structure and hoped Easton would become known as [...] "the Peace Candle city".

[...] On November 27, 1967, about 1,500 people attended the Peace Candle lighting, which would prove to be the final ceremony of its kind for that incarnation of the candle, which would be rebuilt in subsequent years. The bells of six different downtown churches were rung during the ceremony, and people surrounded the Peace Candle holding lit wax candles themselves. Also in 1967, a photo and caption of the Peace Candle was featured in the December 6 issue Weekly Reader, a national children's newspaper circulated in the nation's schools.
