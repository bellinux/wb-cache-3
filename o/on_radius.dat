50|$|Hill size (HS) is a {{measurement}} {{for the size}} of a ski jumping hill. It is calculated based on the technical data of a hill based <b>on</b> <b>radius,</b> angle of inclination and record distance. Since mid-2004, hill size became the official measurement for the size of hills, replacing construction points (also known as K-points, K-spots and critical points), which however remain the basis for issuing points. The distance is measured as a straight line from the takeoff to the knoll, and then follows the landing surface until reaching the hill size point. The world's largest hills are Vikersundbakken in Vikersund, Norway and Letalnica Bratov Gorišek in Planica, Slovenia with hill size of 225 meters. The hills normally mark the hill size physically with a horizontal line across the hill.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of low-cost high-speed modems in the early 1990s, Gandalf increasingly became irrelevant. Even their highest-speed solutions were soon being outperformed by standardized systems like v.32bis. Low-cost terminal adapters based <b>on</b> <b>RADIUS</b> (and similar) technologies connecting to Ethernet further eroded their core businesses, offering features similar to their PACX switches. Gandalf's solutions were decidedly [...] "low tech"; users selected what computer they wanted to connect to by selecting a two-digit number {{on the front of}} the modem, often requiring a [...] "phone book" [...] if more than one host computer was being used. In comparison, the more modern terminal adapters generally included a command line interface that allowed the user to select a host from a directory that appeared on their terminal. Introductions of Ethernet concentrators and ISDN-based versions of their earlier host adapters did little to fix the problem, never becoming very popular in comparison to the standardized solutions from other vendors.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the International Ski Federation {{replaced}} the calculation point as {{the measurement of}} the size of a hill with hill size. The hill size is the length from the takeoff in a straight line to the knoll and then along the level of the landing slope to the hill size point. The hill size point is calculated based on the technical data of a hill based <b>on</b> <b>radius,</b> angle of inclination and record distance. The calculation point or K-point is slightly further up in the hill and denotes the point where the landing slope is the steepest. It is still used for the calculation of distance points, which along with style points determine the winner of an event. For hills up to large, the scoring system grants 60 points to jumps which reach the critical point. For ski flying hills, 120 points are granted for the critical point length. Based on the hill's length, distance points are calculated, which are added for each meter beyond the critical point and subtracted for each point shorter than the critical point. A meter has more distance points in smaller hills. Hills also have a fall line; a jumper who falls or otherwise touches the ground with their body after the fall line is not penalized.|$|E
