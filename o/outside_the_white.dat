5|$|In places closely {{associated}} with Titanic, the sense of grief was deep. The heaviest losses were in Southampton, home port to 699crew members and also home {{to many of the}} passengers. Crowds of weeping women– the wives, sisters and mothers of crew– gathered <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Star offices in Southampton for news of their loved ones. Most of them were among the 549Southampton residents who perished. In Belfast, churches were packed, and shipyard workers wept in the streets. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements, and there was not only a sense of grief but also one of guilt, as those who had built Titanic came to feel they had been responsible in some way for her loss.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth again {{denounced the}} king in Chard {{and was the}} subject of a {{coronation}} in Taunton on 20 June 1685, against the wishes of some of his republican supporters such as Wade. The Taunton Corporation was forced to witness the event at sword point <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Hart Inn, to encourage the support of the country gentry. In Taunton, Monmouth was joined by many new supporters and formed a new regiment of 800 men. The king's force of Dragoons under Churchill continued to close on Monmouth, arriving in Chard on 19 June. With the assistance of the local militias they attempted to stop new recruits arriving in Taunton to join Monmouth. Feversham meanwhile moved with his forces into Bristol, on the assumption that this would be Monmouth's next target, and took overall charge of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Nixon's {{election}} as President in November 1968, he asked Chotiner what job he would like, and Chotiner {{indicated that he}} wanted to be chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), but was told that was impossible. However, Mitchell and soon-to-be White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman wished to see Chotiner given a position <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House, as they saw him as a rival. Accordingly, they proposed that Chotiner be made RNC executive director, to wield the real power with the chairman as figurehead. A reluctant Nixon, who was worried about Chotiner's hatchet-man reputation, finally agreed, and Chotiner wrapped up his affairs in California.|$|E

25|$|Building on McKinley's {{effective}} use of the press, Roosevelt made the White House the center of news every day, providing interviews and photo opportunities. After noticing the reporters huddled <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House in the rain one day, he gave them their own room inside, effectively inventing the presidential press briefing. The grateful press, with unprecedented access to the White House, rewarded Roosevelt with ample coverage.|$|E

25|$|The WAA unsurprisingly {{dedicated}} a {{great deal}} of its political effort to pushing Congress and the Roosevelt Administration to reverse cuts to the WPA budget and to renew financial commitment to relief efforts on behalf of the unemployed. A National Jobs March was called by the WAA during the summer of 1937, but the response was tepid, with only 2,500 people joining the temporary city constructed in WPA-supplied tents near the Lincoln Memorial. Steady rain further demoralized the strikers, who quietly demonstrated <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House and Capitol before fading away.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{official}} announcement, crowds gathered spontaneously to celebrate <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House, where thousands assembled.

From the beginning to the end of Obama's speech, 5,000 tweets per second were sent on microblogging platform Twitter. As news of bin Laden's death filtered through the crowd at a [...] nationally televised Major League Baseball game in Philadelphia between rivals Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Mets, [...] "U-S-A!" [...] cheers began.

500|$|After a {{small family}} reunion {{at the old}} Meeker {{homestead}} near Elizabeth, New Jersey, Meeker headed south towards Washington, D.C. [...] He had hoped to meet President Theodore Roosevelt at his summer home in Oyster Bay, New York, but Roosevelt's staff declined, offering a meeting in Washington instead. [...] Members of the Washington State congressional delegation cleared the way, and Meeker met Roosevelt on November 29, 1907. [...] The President went <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House to view Meeker's wagon and team, and expressed support for Meeker's activities, and for a Meeker proposal for a cross-country highway (there were then none) {{in honor of the}} pioneers. [...] After Washington, the tour wound down: Meeker went home to Puyallup from Pittsburgh by train to see his ailing wife. [...] On his return to the East, he arranged for transport by riverboat and train, with a journey across Missouri by wagon. [...] The expedition was offloaded from the train in Portland, and Meeker proceeded north across Washington State (receiving a much warmer reception) on a slow route, finishing in Seattle on July 18, 1908.|$|E
500|$|Starting with {{information}} received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence {{over the next}} several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area [...] from Islamabad. CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011. Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a [...] "surgical raid" [...] to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs. The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound. DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse, which was buried at sea several hours later. Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square. Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and from many countries around the world.|$|E
50|$|He was {{the first}} newsman to wait <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House to {{interview}} people after their meetings with the president, rather than meeting those people at their hotels or offices later in the day.

Theodore Roosevelt saw him standing in the rain on a cold day and arranged for a small room to be provided for him inside <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House.

500|$|Federal troops {{combed the}} rural area's woods and swamps for Booth {{in the days}} {{following}} the assassination, as the nation experienced an outpouring of grief. On April 18, mourners waited seven abreast in a mile-long line <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House for the public viewing of the slain president, reposing in his open walnut casket in the black-draped East Room. A cross of lilies was at the head and roses covered the coffin's lower half. Thousands of mourners arriving on special trains jammed Washington for the next day's funeral, sleeping on hotel floors and even resorting to blankets spread outdoors on the Capitol's lawn. Prominent abolitionist leader and orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an [...] "unspeakable calamity" [...] for African Americans. Great indignation was directed towards Booth as the assassin's identity was telegraphed across the nation. Newspapers called him an [...] "accursed devil," [...] "monster," [...] "madman," [...] and a [...] "wretched fiend." [...] Historian Dorothy Kunhardt writes: [...] "Almost every family who kept a photograph album on the parlor table owned a likeness of John Wilkes Booth of the famous Booth family of actors. After the assassination Northerners slid the Booth card out of their albums: some threw it away, some burned it, some crumpled it angrily." [...] Even in the South, sorrow was expressed in some quarters. In Savannah, Georgia, the mayor and city council addressed a vast throng at an outdoor gathering to express their indignation, and many in the crowd wept. Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston called Booth's act [...] "a disgrace to the age". Robert E. Lee also expressed regret at Lincoln's death by Booth's hand.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, as women's suffrage faced several important federal votes, a portion of the suffrage movement known as the National Woman's Party led by suffragist Alice Paul became the first [...] "cause" [...] to picket <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. Paul had been mentored by Emmeline Pankhurst while in England, and both she and Lucy Burns led a series of protests against the Wilson Administration in Washington.|$|E
2500|$|The National Woman's Party, {{like the}} Congressional Union, {{was under the}} {{leadership}} of Alice Paul, who learned from militant suffragettes in Britain who used a variety of tactics to gain publicity for the cause of suffrage. Paul's strategy was to use publicity to hold the party in power, the Democratic Party and President Woodrow Wilson, responsible for the status of woman suffrage. [...] Starting in January 1917, NWP members known as Silent Sentinels continued their quest for equality by protesting <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House.|$|E
50|$|Some have {{suggested}} that the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC), the subgroup of the Exclusive Brethren that has attracted the most media coverage, can be categorized as a cult, because of its policy of separating itself from other orthodox denominations and because it prohibits radio and television, limits the use of computers, and/or discourages socializing with people <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> movement. <b>White</b> and non-white marriages within the brethren community are also strictly forbidden.|$|R
