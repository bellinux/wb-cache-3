40|$|Abstract. Molecular motors {{transport}} various cargos along cytoskeletal filaments, {{analogous to}} trucks on roads. In contrast to vehicles, however, molecular motors {{do not work}} alone but in small teams. We describe a simple model for the transport of a cargo by one team <b>of</b> <b>motors</b> and by two teams <b>of</b> <b>motors,</b> which walk into opposite directions. The cooperation of one team <b>of</b> <b>motors</b> generates long-range transport, which we observed experimentally in vitro. Transport by two teams <b>of</b> <b>motors</b> leads {{to a variety of}} bidirectional motility behaviour and to dynamic instabilities reminiscent of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also discuss how cargo transport by teams <b>of</b> <b>motors</b> allows the cell to generate robust long-range bidirectional transport. 1 Introduction: Traffi...|$|R

40|$|Three types <b>of</b> <b>motors,</b> myosins, kinesins, and cytoplasmic dynein, {{cooperate}} {{to transport}} intracellular membrane organelles. Transport of each cargo {{is determined by}} recruitment of specific sets <b>of</b> <b>motors</b> and their regulation. Targeting <b>of</b> <b>motors</b> to membranes often depends on the formation of large multiprotein assemblies and can be influenced by membrane lipid composition. Motor activity can be regulated by cargo-induced conformational changes such as unfolding or dimerization. The architecture and function of motor: cargo complexes can also be controlled by phosphorylation, calcium signaling, and proteolysis. The complexity of transport systems is further increased by mechanical and functional cross-talk between different types <b>of</b> <b>motors</b> on the same cargo and by participation <b>of</b> the same <b>motor</b> in the movement of different organelles...|$|R

5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis <b>of</b> <b>motor</b> symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate <b>of</b> <b>motor</b> decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E
