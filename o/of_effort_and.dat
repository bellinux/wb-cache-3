5|$|In 2013, {{leading up}} to the release of Tales of Symphonia Chronicles, Baba called Symphonia the most {{successful}} title in the series in the west thus far, although the series' main target audience was still in Japan. In an earlier interview, Baba commented that the team behind the series put a large amount <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> development in keeping the series fresh while retaining the base elements across each installment. The positive reaction of gamers in the US to Symphonia influenced the way the various teams developed titles after that point. Speaking in 2014, production manager Denis Lee said that, since Symphonias release, the popularity of the series has grown. In response, Bandai Namco have focused on getting more entries out in western territories. Much of their research about what titles to release or develop in the future revolves around direct conversation with Tales series fans at gaming conventions and special events.|$|E
5|$|The {{purposes}} of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> ingenuity (for the grower). Bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping {{of one or}} more small trees growing in a container, beginning with a cutting, seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development. Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai and a miniature deciduous forest can even be created using such species as Japanese maple, Japanese zelkova or hornbeam.|$|E

25|$|The Luftwaffe's {{general picture}} of the VVS was entirely correct in many aspects in the {{military}} field; this was later confirmed {{in the early stages}} of Barbarossa and in post-war British and American studies, and also in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet sources confirm that the VVS was in a state of reorganisation before the attack, and were retraining on modern machines which made it unready for a major conflict. The deductions about Soviet tactical-operational limitations were to a large degree, accurate. In aircraft types, equipment and training, ground organisation, supply system at the operational level, the dispersal <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> the operational commands immobility, gave the impression of an air force with limited striking power.|$|E
25|$|In late 1944, the German {{defensive}} line now only extended from Denmark to Switzerland. This enabled British bombers to fly toward German territory without interception on the way. The German strength was thus reduced, with more aircraft diverted to reconnaissance over the North Sea {{in an attempt}} to pick up Allied bomber formations. In spite of the problems, the Luftwaffe night fighter force was stronger numerically than ever before. It remained intact and presented a theoretical threat to Bomber Command, particularly when the British made deep penetrations. However, since the first half of 1944, the outlook for the force had changed from increasing efficiency to a probability of declining effectiveness as the cumulative effect of poor training, shortage of fuel, diversion <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> shortage of manpower became perceptible.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 1917 40 Squadron escorted four Sopwith 1½ Strutters to the German {{airfield}} at Douai—the home of Jagdstaffel 11 (Jasta 11) {{commanded by}} Manfred von Richthofen the famed Red Baron. In the fight he evaded enemy aircraft {{but could not}} claim a success. Finally, on 7 May 1917—incidentally the day his inspiration Albert Ball died—he shot down an observation balloon, a respected achievement since the aircraft was heavily defended. 40 Squadron lost a pilot, Captain Nixon to five intercepting Albatros D.IIIs led by Lothar von Richthofen, the former's brother. Despite his growing experience Mannock remained outside the circle of friends in the squadron because of his apparent and initial lack <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> success. He withdrew from their company and concentrated on improving. Alone, his nervousness disappeared and he made friends and acquaintances, but mostly outside the squadron.|$|E

25|$|Educational {{psychology}} {{research on}} motivation {{is concerned with}} the volition or will that students bring to a task, their level of interest and intrinsic motivation, the personally held goals that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure. As intrinsic motivation deals with activities that act as their own rewards, extrinsic motivation deals with motivations that are brought on by consequences or punishments. A form of attribution theory developed by Bernard Weiner describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of shame and embarrassment and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack <b>of</b> <b>effort,</b> <b>and</b> effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of guilt and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.|$|E
500|$|A common mapping (used {{in some of}} the {{examples}} in this article) maps the effort variables (ones that initiate an action) from each domain together and maps the flow variables (ones that are a property of an action) from each domain together. [...] Each pair <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> flow variables is power conjugate. [...] This system is known as the impedance analogy because a ratio of the effort to the flow variable in each domain is analogous to electrical impedance.|$|E

[...] The combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism – which resulted in days <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> thousands of feet of film being wasted, all at enormous expense – often proved taxing for Chaplin who, in frustration, would lash out at his actors and crew.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of James' NBA career, he {{was considered to be}} a poor defensive player, but he improved steadily through the years. Near the end of his first tenure in Cleveland, he became proficient at the chase-down block, which involved coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block their shot. In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions. James was paired with teammates Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, and Miami used him in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme, with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position. Beginning in 2014, some analysts noted a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> expected age-related declines. James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as [...] "chill mode". Writing for ESPN in 2016, Nate Duncan observed that while James tended to take off more plays than in his younger days, he was able to raise his level in that year's Finals and temporarily recapture his Miami form.|$|E
500|$|The inter-Allied cryptologic {{collaboration}} prevented duplication <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> facilitated discoveries. Before fighting {{had started}} in Norway in April 1940, the Polish-French team solved an uncommonly hard three-letter code {{used by the}} Germans to communicate with fighter and bomber squadrons and for exchange of meteorological data between aircraft and land. [...] The code had first appeared in December 1939, but the Polish cryptologists had been too preoccupied with Enigma to give the code much attention. With the German assault on the west impending, however, {{the breaking of the}} Luftwaffe code took on mounting urgency. The trail of the elusive code (whose system of letters changed every 24 hours) led back to Enigma. The first clue came from the British, who had noticed that the code's letters did not change randomly. If A changed to P, then elsewhere P was replaced by A. The British made no further headway, but the Poles realized that what was manifesting was Enigma's exclusivity principle that they had discovered in 1932. The Germans' carelessness meant that now the Poles, having after midnight solved Enigma's daily setting, could with no further effort also read the Luftwaffe signals.|$|E
500|$|In 2006–07, James' averages {{declined}} to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, {{stemming from a}} lack <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>and</b> focus. The Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins {{for the second consecutive}} year and entered the playoffs as the East's second seed. In Game 5 of the Conference Finals, James notched 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, against the Pistons. After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance [...] "one of the greatest moments in postseason history" [...] and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as [...] "Jordan-esque". In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history. The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals. During the championship round, James struggled, averaging 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting, and Cleveland was eliminated in a sweep.|$|E
