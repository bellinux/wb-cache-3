5|$|When the Balkan Wars {{broke out}} in October 1912, these {{airplanes}} performed a number of reconnaissance and bombing missions; the most notable was a sortie against the Ottoman fleet anchorage in the Dardanelles, where First Lieutenant Michael Moutoussis and Ensign Aristeidis Moraitinis spotted the Ottoman fleet and dropped four bombs. This mission {{is regarded as the}} first naval-air operation in military history and was widely commented upon in the press, both Greek and international. Meanwhile, the Hellenic Navy, in the process <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> its air arm, bought a fleet of Sopwith Gunbus seaplanes (also known as Greek Seaplanes).|$|E

5|$|Alan Pattillo, a {{longtime}} scriptwriter and director for APF, was appointed the company's first official script editor in late 1964. This move was aimed {{to reduce the}} burden on Gerry Anderson who, while reserving his producer's right to overall creative control, had grown weary of revising scripts himself. Direction of episodes was assigned in pairs: veterans Pattillo and David Elliott alternated with the less-experienced Desmond Saunders and newcomer David Lane for each month's filming. Due to the difficulties <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> takes, progress was slow: even on a productive day, it was rare for the crew to complete more than two minutes of puppet footage. In a contemporary interview, Hill noted that Thunderbirds contained several times as many shots as a typical live-action series. He explained that rapid editing was necessary {{on account of the}} characters' lack of facial expression, which made it difficult to sustain the viewer's interest {{for more than a few}} seconds per shot.|$|E
5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E
5|$|Bjaðmunjo Mýrjartaksdóttir (also {{known in}} Old Norse as Bjaðmynja; and in Gaelic as Ben Muman, Bé Binn, Blathmuine, and Bláthmín; fl. 1102/1103) was a {{daughter}} of a Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. In 1102 whilst still a child, {{she was married to}} Sigurðr, son of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway. At this time, Magnús appears to have been in the process <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> his son as king over the Earldom of Orkney, the Kingdom of the Isles, and the Kingdom of Dublin. The marriage itself temporarily bound Muirchertach and Magnús together as allies before the latter's death the following year. Sigurðr thereupon repudiated Bjaðmunjo, and left for Scandinavia, where he proceeded to share the Norwegian kingship with his brothers.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth of}} commercialism in English {{football}} {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s {{paved the way for}} Arsenal and other prominent clubs to seek the possibility <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> a new top-flight division. Unhappy with how income was distributed to the lower leagues and wanting to exploit television rights, Arsenal and 21 other First Division clubs handed a notice of resignation from the Football League by August 1991. The breakway division, entitled the Premier League, was administered by The Football Association and received financial backing from Sky Television. Arsenal finished 10th in the inaugural season; the club did well in other competitions, winning a unique FA and League Cup double. They were victorious in the 1994 Cup Winners' Cup Final, and came close to defending the trophy in 1995, before losing to Real Zaragoza.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove the}} {{soundness}} of the IAe 33 design, two gliders built under contract by another expatriate, Reimar Horten, were constructed {{and used for}} aerodynamics testing in 1948–1949, including flights by Tank himself. These tests revealed significant problems with lateral stability, resulting in modifications to the tail {{to address this problem}} before construction began on two prototype airframes. Due to the lack of modern machinery, the all-metal fabrication relied heavily on handcrafting, and fabricating the prototypes was a labor-intensive procedure. President Perón envisioned that a benefit <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> an aviation factory in Argentina would be to introduce production standards comparable to world-class manufacturing facilities. However, Tank realized that production tools and jigs were not feasible at this stage and relied instead on essentially hand-built examples. The first airframe (No. 01) reserved for static testing, was subsequently destroyed during the tests.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and {{keyboard}} player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he {{did not wish to}} continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Albert Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.|$|E

The Government of Karnataka announced the launch of a 24/7 dedicated helpline (1091) to be operated by the state police to register sexual abuse complaints from women. It also is checking the possibility <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> fast-track courts to dispose of pending cases pertaining to crimes against women. The Government of Tamil Nadu also announced a 13-point action plan to ensure safety of women in Tamil Nadu and said that incidents of sexual assault would be treated as a grave crime, and probes would be entrusted to top police officials. The chief minister also said that daily hearings would be conducted in all sexual abuse cases in the state for speedy trials at specially constituted fast-track courts, and women prosecutors would be appointed as government counsels. The Jammu and Kashmir government also announced plans to change the state's laws against sexual offences and gender crimes. The Government of Himachal Pradesh decided to set up state and district-level committees to review progress of all cases of crimes against women.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication in Sabah and Sarawak were {{originally}} administered by Posts and Telecommunication Department until 1967, and {{maintained by the}} British Cable & Wireless Communications before all telecommunications management in the state been takeover by Peninsular-based company. The British telecommunication company have establish a submarine cable that linking Kota Kinabalu with Singapore and Hong Kong. Following {{the expansion of the}} Peninsular-based company on 1 January 1968, Sabah Posts and Telecommunication Department was merged with the Peninsular telecommunication department to formed Telecommunications Department Malaysia. All operations under Telecommunications Department Malaysia was then transferred to Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Berhad (STM) which become a public listed company in 1991 with the federal government retained a majority shareholding. There are also other telecommunication companies operating in the state although only providing cellular phone facilities. In 2006, the state has the lowest Direct Exchange Line (DEL) penetration rate, with cellular and internet dial-up penetrations rate only 6.5 per 100 inhabitants. Most residents from the low income groups would rather use mobile phones internet or use internet at their offices instead <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> internet access at home as the Malaysian main internet provider of Telekom Malaysia were unable to build high speed low cost internet due to the high cost of equipment which are mostly sourced from abroad. Until the end of 2014, there were only 934 telecommunication hotspots in Sabah. Due to this, the government are working to increase the penetration and capability of internet connection as well {{to bridge the gap between}} Sabah and the Peninsular. The mobile telecommunications in Sabah are mostly use 4G and 3G and there is free rural Wi-Fi services provided by the federal government known as the Kampung Tanpa Wayar 1Malaysia (KTW) although Malaysia's public internet speeds are among the slower than many other countries.|$|E
