5|$|Maria: or, The Wrongs <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> is the 18th-century British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft's {{unfinished}} novelistic {{sequel to}} her revolutionary political treatise A Vindication of the Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> (1792). The Wrongs <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> was published posthumously in 1798 by her husband, William Godwin, {{and is often}} considered her most radical feminist work.|$|E
5|$|Twentieth-century feminist critics {{embraced the}} work, {{integrating}} {{it into the}} history of the novel and feminist discourse. It is most often viewed as a fictionalized popularization of the Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman,</b> as an extension of Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman,</b> and as autobiographical.|$|E

5|$|Johnson offered Wollstonecraft {{work as a}} translator, {{prompting}} her {{to learn}} French and German. More importantly, Johnson provided encouragement at crucial moments during the writing of her seminal political treatises A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> (1792).|$|E
5|$|Like other Jacobin novels, The Wrongs <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> {{relies on}} a web of suggestive {{character}} names to convey its message: Jemima is named for Job's daughter; Henry Darnford's name resembles that of Henry Darnley, the second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots; and George Venables shares a name with the notorious womanizer George, Prince of Wales. Wollstonecraft added {{to the reality of}} her philosophical text by quoting from familiar literature, such as Shakespeare, alluding to important historical events, and referencing relevant facts. The Wrongs <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> comments on the state of women in society by rewriting earlier texts with a feminist slant, such as Henry Fielding's Tom Jones; Fielding's Mrs. Fitzpatrick becomes Wollstonecraft's Maria. These rhetorical strategies made the philosophical elements of the novel more palatable to the public.|$|E
5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> is that women should be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman.</b>|$|E

5|$|Pollin {{dismisses the}} first of these, as have most later biographers, arguing that Imlay had access to her mother's {{writings}} and Godwin's Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> which openly discuss the circumstances of her birth. Imlay herself even makes this distinction in letters to her half-sister Mary Godwin.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> after reading Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord's 1791 report to the French National Assembly, which stated that women should only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> hurriedly to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it.|$|E
5|$|Although much of Thoughts {{is devoted}} to platitudes and advice common to all conduct books for women, a few {{passages}} anticipate Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in A Vindication of the Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> (1792), such as her poignant description of the suffering single woman. However, several critics suggested that such passages only seem to have radical undertones in light of Wollstonecraft's later works.|$|E

5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|During 1913-19, advocates <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> {{suffrage}} drew on {{the educational}} and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying tactics of the women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings {{to the task of}} political persuasion. The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.|$|E
5|$|In 1790, {{at the age}} of thirty-one, Wollstonecraft made a {{dramatic}} entrance onto the public stage with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a work that helped propel the British pamphlet war over the French revolution. Two years later she published what has become her most famous work, A Vindication of the Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman.</b> Anxious to see the revolution firsthand, she moved to France for about two years, but returned in 1795 after revolutionary violence increased and the lover she met there, American adventurer Gilbert Imlay, abandoned her and their illegitimate daughter, Fanny Imlay. Shortly after her return to Britain, Wollstonecraft attempted suicide in May; Imlay, however, managed to save her.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, in {{the spirit}} of the nation's centennial celebrations, Stanton and Susan B. Anthony decided to write a more {{expansive}} history of the women's rights movement. They invited Lucy Stone to help, but Stone declined to be part of the project; she was of the opinion that Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the divisive split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and, in 1881, they published the first volume of the History <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> Suffrage, and placed themselves at each of its most important events, marginalizing Stone's contribution.|$|E
5|$|In {{her later}} works, such as A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> (1792), Wollstonecraft {{repeatedly}} {{returns to the}} topics addressed in Thoughts, particularly the virtue {{of hard work and}} the imperative for women to learn useful skills. Wollstonecraft suggests that the social and political life of the nation would greatly improve if women were to acquire valuable skills instead of being mere social ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Original Stories is {{primarily}} about leaving the imperfections of childhood behind {{and becoming a}} rational and charitable adult; it does not romanticise childhood as an innocent and ideal state of being.

5|$|The Wrongs <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> usually uses third-person narration, {{although}} large {{sections of}} Maria's and Jemima's tales are in first-person narrative. The narrator often relates Maria's feelings to the reader through the new technique of free indirect discourse, which blurs {{the line between the}} third-person narrator and the first-person dialogue of a text. Wollstonecraft juxtaposes the events of the novel with both Maria's own retelling of them and her innermost feelings. The first-person stories allow Maria and Jemima to address each other as equals: their stories of suffering, while still allowing each character to retain an individualized sense of self, are a levelling and bonding force between the two.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, when Wollstonecraft {{published}} the Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman,</b> she extended {{many of the}} arguments she had begun in Rights of Men. If all people should be judged on their merits, she wrote, women {{should be included in}} that group. In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft did not {{employ the}} formal argumentation or logical prose style common to 18th-century {{philosophical}} writing when composing her own works. The Rights <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> {{is a long}} essay that introduces all of its major topics in the opening chapters and then repeatedly returns to them, each time from {{a different point of}} view. It also adopts a hybrid tone that combines rational argument with the fervent rhetoric of sensibility.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{declaration}} of the year 1975 as the year <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and that decade as women's decade, several issues related to women came into focus of scholars.

In India, migration <b>of</b> <b>women</b> was mainly attributed to marriage and patrilocal form of residence. Employment <b>of</b> <b>women</b> was either not given importance or was understated due to several cultural factors. The paper reviews existing literature on internal migration <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in India and finds that women migration in India have been studied from the angle of mainly survival strategies <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> linked to push factors at areas of origin. ...|$|R
