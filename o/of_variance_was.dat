50|$|At first, the {{analysis}} included structural features (design of the flying task {{and the crew}} itself) that were assessed using methods that included surveys, interviews, and reviews of training and procedure manuals. Once the data analysis began, a {{one-way analysis of variance}} showed that the airlines had nearly no variation on measures of crew structure and behavior. These results were quite contradictory to what had been expected, but fortunately, Hackman had also collected data on a number of individual and contextual factors, just in case. At the individual level, it appeared as though the airlines once again did not vary significantly, but at the organizational level the source <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> <b>was</b> found. It turned out that the variability in crew success was related to each crew's organizational context. A total of five key features were determinants of crew success: adequacy of material resources, clarity of performance objectives, recognition and reinforcement for excellent crew performance, availability of educational and technical assistance, and availability of informational resources. If the researchers had chosen to collect data at just one level of analysis (e.g. the group level) the study would not have produced significant results.|$|E

30|$|For the {{narrative}} task, the assumptions were first checked.

The assumption of sphericity was tested by Mauchley’s sphericity test.
