5|$|According to <b>other</b> <b>reports,</b> a {{motivating}} {{factor was}} {{the desire to}} establish a historic district in Ypsilanti, to prevent the city from replacing historic buildings on North Huron Street and in Depot Town with new construction. A group of Ypsilantians applied to the state for funding to publish a guidebook to the city's historic homes, and were told that no money was available for that purpose, but that there was funding available to stage a festival. A $15,000 grant from the state helped to fund the 1979 Ypsilanti Yesteryear Heritage Festival.|$|E
5|$|Communications with severed with towns {{along the}} southwestern {{coastline}} as roads and rail lines were washed away. Thousands of residents sought refuge by moving to higher ground. The Korean relief center reported that 762homes were destroyed and another 11,700flooded {{due to the}} storm. <b>Other</b> <b>reports</b> indicated that upwards of 5,900homes were destroyed. More than 191,000acres (77,300hectares) of farmland was washed out. Throughout South Korea, 113people lost their lives. Most of the deaths resulted from landslides, swollen rivers, and collapsed embankments. Total damage in the country amounted to $134million, with agriculture accounting for at least $24million. Additionally, 28,000people were left homeless. The disaster relief agency Hope Bridge provided 7.5billion won ($10.2million) in aid to areas affected by the storm.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Dartmouth College case (supra), there are <b>other</b> <b>reports</b> of certificates of division that were issued but never decided by the Supreme Court. After the indictment of Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy, for treason, William Wirt Henry reports that a certificate of division was issued on Davis's motion to dismiss the indictment {{on the grounds that}} he owed no allegiance to the United States after the secession of his state. Reportedly, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase sided with Davis, while District Judge John Curtiss Underwood sided with the government. No response from the Supreme Court to that certificate is reported, but Davis's bail was eventually absolved, and he was released.|$|E

5|$|Like {{almost any}} herbivore, they consume other plants if {{presented}} with them, but their diet in nature consists {{almost entirely of}} grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. Hippos are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' feces to digest vegetation. Hippos have (rarely) been filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are <b>other</b> <b>reports</b> of meat-eating, and even cannibalism and predation. The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behaviour or nutritional stress.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Alberti {{worked in}} journalism as well, at the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres {{newspaper}} {{created by the}} Junta. The ruling that created this newspaper gave Alberti the duty of selecting the news reports to publish. This duty was exclusive of Alberti and not shared with {{the other members of}} the Junta. Some historians also consider that Alberti may be the real author of the newspaper's editorials, as they were not signed and the style is not similar to <b>other</b> <b>reports</b> by Mariano Moreno, who is usually considered the author.|$|E

5|$|The Shaoguan {{incident}} was a civil disturbance {{which took place}} overnight on 25/26 June 2009 in Guangdong province, China.

Groups of Han set upon Uyghur co-workers, leading to at least two Uyghurs being killed (although <b>other</b> <b>reports</b> indicate a higher death toll), and some 118 people injured, most of them Uyghurs.|$|E
5|$|The temple complex {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1875 CE {{on the basis}} of antiquities found in the Punjab and its subordinate units. Temple is in the village of Masrur, Tehsil Dehra. However, the next published information about the existence of this temple complex was about nearly four decades later in the Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) of 1912–13 as travel information of H.L. Shutterleworth, a British explorer, when he was exploring the Himalayas in 1913. Following this there were many <b>other</b> <b>reports</b> on the art and architecture of this temple complex by other historians. The conservation of the temple complex became the responsibility of ASI from 1914.|$|E
5|$|There was {{initially}} confusion as various conflicting reports of Nhung's demise surfaced, one source telling journalists that Nhung {{lived in a}} cottage within the grounds of Minh's villa and shot himself outside his house. These informants speculated that Nhung committed suicide {{to avoid having to}} live to see Minh being demoted or humiliated. The time of this incident was reported to be 21:00. <b>Other</b> <b>reports</b> at the time said that Nhung was found dead as a result of strangulation at the Joint General Staff headquarters. According to variations of this line, Nhung either hanged himself in custody or was murdered by an unknown hand.|$|E

5|$|Before {{contact with}} Christian missionaries during both the Dutch and Qing periods, Taiwanese aborigines held {{a variety of}} beliefs in spirits, gods, sacred symbols and myths that helped their {{societies}} find meaning and order. Although {{there is no evidence}} of a unified belief system shared among the various indigenous groups, there is evidence that several groups held supernatural beliefs in certain birds and bird behavior. The Siraya were reported by Dutch sources to incorporate bird imagery into their material culture. <b>Other</b> <b>reports</b> describe animal skulls and the use of human heads in societal beliefs. The Paiwan and other southern groups worship the Formosan hundred pacer snake and use the diamond patterns on its back in many designs. In many Plains Aborigines societies, the power to communicate with the supernatural world was exclusively held by women called Inibs. During the period of Dutch colonization, the Inibs were removed from the villages to eliminate their influence and pave the way for Dutch missionary work...|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1917, {{divisions}} {{had begun}} appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one hand, and the Berlin Committee and the German high command on the <b>other.</b> <b>Reports</b> from German agents working with Ghadarites in Southeast Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganisation, as well as unrealism in gauging public mood and support within the Ghadarite organisation. The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China's participation {{in the war in}} 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly. Infiltration by British agents, change in American attitude and stance, and the changing fortunes of the war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded.|$|E
5|$|Joe Mercer, who {{was then}} {{coaching}} the England schools team, urged Busby to sign Edwards, who was also attracting interest from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa. Edwards signed for United as an amateur on 2 June 1952, but accounts of when he signed his first professional contract vary. Some reports state that it occurred on his 17th birthday in October 1953, but others contend that it took place a year earlier. Those accounts that favour the earlier date usually state that a club official, either Busby himself or coach Bert Whalley, arrived at the Edwards family home soon after midnight to secure the youngster's signature as early as possible, but <b>other</b> <b>reports</b> claim that this occurred when he signed his amateur contract. Wolves manager Stan Cullis was indignant at missing out on a highly touted local youngster and accused United of improperly offering financial inducements to Edwards or his family, but Edwards maintained that he {{had always wanted to}} play for the Lancashire team. To guard against the possibility that he might not make a success of his football career, he also began an apprenticeship as a carpenter.|$|E

5|$|The 1804 Antigua–Charleston {{hurricane}} {{was first}} sighted on 3September as it swept past Saint Barthélemy, Saint Kitts, and Antigua, drifting toward the west-northwest and soon approaching Puerto Rico and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The storm reached the Bahamas while turning northward on 4September, nearing the northern Floridan coast by 6September. It remained offshore on 7September, gradually approaching the coast throughout the day, and eventually made landfall that evening along {{the coasts of}} Georgia and South Carolina. Observations in Savannah, Georgia, indicated north-to-northeast winds throughout 8September, though <b>other</b> <b>reports</b> recorded northeast-to-easterly gusts; at Charleston, South Carolina, however, winds, initially northeast-to-east, curved southeastward later in the storm. Little information exists on the hurricane's whereabouts between North Carolina and New England, with a single report at Norfolk, Virginia of east-northeasterly winds veering east-to-east-southeast from 7to 9September, suggesting the disturbance's passage west of there. A severe gale arrived in New England on 11and 12September, though the long pause between {{the departure of the}} hurricane from the Carolinas and its arrival in the northeastern United States evidences the possibility that the two systems may have been unrelated.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} from the Terrapins caused Dunn to sustain large losses. Although by late June the Orioles were in first place, having won over two-thirds of their games, the paid attendance dropped as low as 150. Dunn explored a possible move by the Orioles to Richmond, Virginia, {{as well as the}} sale of a minority interest in the club. These possibilities fell through, leaving Dunn with little choice other than to sell his best players to major league teams to raise money. He offered Ruth to the reigning World Series champions, Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, but Mack had his own financial problems. The Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants expressed interest in Ruth, but Dunn sold his contract, along with those of pitchers Ernie Shore and Ben Egan, to the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL) on July 4. The sale price was announced as $25,000 but <b>other</b> <b>reports</b> lower the amount to half that, or possibly $8,500 plus the cancellation of a $3,000 loan. Ruth remained with the Orioles for several days while the Red Sox completed a road trip, and reported to the team in Boston on July 11.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris is traded {{mainly for}} its purported {{medicinal}} properties, for the pet trade, or, {{to a lesser}} extent, as food for local consumption. According to a 2003 report, the animals were sold for 30,000–50,000 Vietnamese đồng (US$1.50–2.50 or €1.10–1.80). <b>Other</b> <b>reports</b> have found them to cost US$2–10. In Cambodia, the species is used in Traditional Khmer Medicine. Surveys conducted at Cambodian markets showed that the species was the third most common mammal for sale, offered at prices ranging from US$0.85–6.25 (€0.65–4.70). In Vietnam, the pygmy slow loris is used for food, medicine, and often as a pet and {{is among the most}} frequently sold species. Formerly, hundreds of pygmy lorises were traded monthly in major markets, but recently numbers seem to have decreased, due to shortages in supply. In southern Vietnam, lorises are among the most popular wildlife dishes in wildlife meat restaurants.|$|E
