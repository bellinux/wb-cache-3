2500|$|The Model T Ford railcars {{worked on}} the two branch lines for {{the latter half of}} the 1920s, but not to any notable degree of success. This was in part due to their wheel arrangement; bogies give a more {{comfortable}} ride than the two separate axles used by these particular railcars. The railcars were also prone to overheating as the luggage bags hung from the bonnet blocked the motor's ventilation, and this led some members of the public to nickname the railcars [...] "tea pots" [...] or [...] "coffee pots". Other nicknames were [...] "glasshouses" [...] and [...] "pie carts". On the Waikaia Branch, the Model T Ford railcars were unpopular with the local residents and were neither successful themselves nor able to generate enough traffic to warrant replacement with a more popular carriage service. On the Wyndham Branch, they failed to achieve the desired success as well, and were unable to keep the section from Wyndham to Glenham <b>open.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Glenham was closed on 14 July 1930, and the railcars were removed from service the next year. Their retirement meant that the numbers RM 4 and RM 5 were free to be re-used later – in 1936 they were allocated to the first two Wairarapa railcars, the first truly successful railcar type in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|The company ran out {{of money}} during construction, and the Great Western Railway {{purchased}} it and completed the line about 1882. By then the intended mineral flows were being adequately handled on other routes, and the GWR did not <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> traffic, although in 1885 a short length at the southern end was opened to connect mineral workings.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} finally {{inspected}} by Major Marindin of the Board of Trade on 3 August 1894 (after some earlier visits) and on 7 August authority to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> passenger operation was received. Maximum speed {{was to be}} limited to 25 mph. Opinion had been expressed within the company that a limited opening to Gareloch at first would be preferable, but the politics of securing the Government support for the Mallaig line meant that no hesitation could be displayed.|$|E
50|$|On 1 October 1910, <b>the</b> Bodensee-Toggenburg-Bahn <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Nesslau, via St. Gallen and Wattwil.|$|R
5000|$|... the Leven and East of Fife Railway {{was created}} in 1861 by an {{amalgamation}} {{of the first two}} companies. It <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Anstruther in 1863; ...|$|R
50|$|In 1994 <b>the</b> {{operator}} FerriMaroc <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Port of Almeria. Before {{that date}} one could only sail {{to the area}} via Melilla or via the ferry-terminal in Al Hoceima.|$|R
50|$|Approval to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> {{passenger}} traffic was refused; the Company tried to appeal against this, but failed; subsequent inspection visits {{took place on}} 31 July, 28 August and 26 September 1872, without success. Creditors demanded payment, and one unfortunate contractor went into bankruptcy, having accepted the Company’s shares in payment: those shares were now worthless. In December 1872 it was calculated that the Company had expended £77,490 and had {{nothing to show for}} it; and the line was now estimated to require £90,548 to complete.|$|E
5000|$|Plans for {{the future}} of NWP freight are hazy, as plans and rumors about {{reconstruction}} of the line north have been spread for years. While SMART will eventually extend commuter service to Cloverdale, NCRA and NWPco have both publicly announced plans to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the Skunk Train connection and major yard facility in Willits, although no timeline has been established. Both agencies plans are dependent on state and federal grants, and the success of the SMART train. [...] There are no established plans to reopen the Eel River Canyon segment, however, multiple tourist companies have expressed interested in possibly opening an excursion and dinner train that would traverse Humboldt and Arcata bays, but have been faced by many legal hurdles and financial issues.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} seven years, the CMK was used mostly for freight traffic. In 1980, the line carried 73 freight trains and only 4 {{passenger}} trains daily. This changed in the mid-1980s, when the government in Warsaw decided to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> more passenger trains. On 1 June 1984 the first express trains (Górnik, from Warszawa Wschodnia to Gliwice, and Krakus, from Warszawa Wschodnia to Kraków Główny) began traveling on the CMK, with speed of up to 140 km/h. Two years later the maximum speed was raised to 160 km/h. The CMK, however, was designed for speeds of up to 250 km/h, and after several repairs and replacement of tracks, on 11 May 1994, an Italian Pendolino train reached the speed of 250.1 km/h (near Biała Rawska), which remained the speed record for train travel in Mid-Eastern Europe until November 2013. This single achievement, however, {{did not mean that}} trains began regular services with speeds of up to 250 km/h. Before 2009 the Polish State Railways owned no rolling stock capable of such speeds, and numerous improvements in the infrastructure would be required. The CMK line also lacked cab signalling which is required on high-speed rail lines, where trains travel at speeds which make observation of lineside signals unreliable.|$|E
50|$|The Ashio Railway Co. <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Ashio-Motoyama (2km beyond Mato) in 1911/12 {{to service}} the Ashio Copper Mine, and leased <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> JNR in 1913. Passenger {{services}} were introduced in 1914, and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was nationalised in 1918.|$|R
50|$|The West Highland Railway <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> {{passengers}} on 7 August 1894; {{later it was}} operated by the North British Railway, until in 1923 it {{became part of the}} London and North Eastern Railway. In 1948 <b>the</b> <b>line</b> became part of the Scottish Region of British Railways following nationalisation.|$|R
50|$|Voices in the Family Dr. Dan Gottlieb, {{psychologist}} and family therapist, along with guest experts, <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> callers to discuss {{issues that affect}} individuals and society, with special focus on family issues.

50|$|They <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Sunbury on 13 January 1859, {{despite having}} {{to build a}} {{temporary}} timber bridge due to the mason's strike. Cornish, however died on 31 March 1859, leaving Bruce to complete the contract. Bruce moved his main works to Castlemaine by 3 March 1859 and in 1860 established a large foundry to manufacture railway rolling stock.|$|R
5000|$|In 1905 {{a second}} track was {{completed}} on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> between Stuttgart West station and Böblingen. The Schönbuch Railway (Schönbuchbahn) was planned {{to run from}} Böblingen to Tübingen via Dettenhausen. <b>The</b> branch <b>line</b> connected <b>the</b> villages of the Schönbuchlichtung to Böblingen. On 16 October 1910, <b>the</b> State Railways <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Weil im Schönbuch. The first trains reached Dettenhausen on 29 July 1911.|$|R
50|$|The Blyth, Seghill and Percy Main Railway <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Blyth on 3 March 1847 and {{the first}} station was at Croft Street (now King Street). On 1 May 1867 a new station was <b>opened</b> to replace <b>the</b> {{original}} station. It was {{at the north end}} of Turner Street (now part of Regent Street) on the site now occupied by Morrisons supermarket and the Community Hospital.|$|R
5000|$|In western Münsterland, at the {{beginning}} of the 1860s there were efforts to promote the local economy by building a railway link from Münster via Gronau to Enschede. Construction began in June 1872, but the Münster-Enschede railway companyran into financial difficulties in 1874. The KWE therefore took over its management and on 30 September 1875 it <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Enschede. This <b>line</b> used <b>the</b> KWE station.` ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2007 Spa Valley Railway {{marked the}} tenth {{anniversary of the}} {{re-opening}} of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> by transforming Groombridge into a busy interchange station with trains arriving or departing every 15 minutes. The funds raised from this event went towards the [...] "Return to Eridge" [...] appeal to raise £500,000 for the extension to the Uckfield mainline at Eridge. <b>The</b> heritage railway <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Eridge in 2011.|$|R
25|$|The Brooklyn Elevated Railroad <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> {{passengers}} at 16:00 on May 13, 1885, with a five-cent fare for trains {{every five}} minutes. <b>The</b> original <b>line</b> ran from York and Washington Streets (near the Brooklyn Bridge) along York Street, Hudson Avenue, Park Avenue, Grand Avenue, Lexington Avenue, and Broadway to Gates Avenue. The three stations on Park Avenue had island platforms, {{while all the}} other stations had two side platforms.|$|R
50|$|The transiting freight {{disappeared}} in 1930 when <b>the</b> Ring <b>Line</b> <b>opened.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> Vigerslev and Nørrebro closed, (except {{for the first}} few hundred meters of <b>the</b> Vigerslev <b>line,</b> which served as stabling tracks for S-trains until around 1995), and Frederiksberg was now a dead-end station with only <b>the</b> <b>line</b> towards Vanløse left. It was still an important freight station, so <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Vanløse was doubled and acquired a complex junction with <b>the</b> ring <b>line.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 14 March 2015, Shin-Takaoka station <b>opened</b> on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> {{coincide}} with <b>the</b> {{extension of the}} Hokuriku Shinkansen to Kanazawa Station.|$|R
50|$|Two railway {{companies}} originally {{served the}} town - the Maryport and Carlisle Railway (M&C), which <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Carlisle in stages between 1840 and 1845, and the Whitehaven Junction Railway which ran southwards to Workington and Whitehaven and <b>opened</b> in 1847. <b>The</b> latter company {{was taken over}} by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1866, but the M&C remained independent right up until absorption into the LMS in January 1923.|$|R
2500|$|To {{better use}} <b>the</b> Rive-Droite <b>line,</b> a [...] long branch was built from Saint-Cloud to Saint-Nom-la-Bretèche {{at the cost}} of the French State. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> was {{declared}} of public utility in 1880 and the Chemins de fer de l'Ouest <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> l'Étang-la-Ville in 1884. Passenger services were extended to Saint-Germain Grande-Ceinture in 1889, services were then reported back to Saint-Nom-la-Bretèche in 1894 when passenger services on the Chemin de fer de Grande Ceinture were stopped.|$|R
50|$|Newport {{railway station}} opened on 1 March 1859 as Geelong Junction, being renamed Williamstown Junction in January 1869 and Newport on 1 November 1881. The Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Newport in 1857 from Geelong, but it ran along North Road to a {{temporary}} terminus at Greenwich as <b>the</b> <b>line</b> on <b>to</b> Melbourne {{was not yet}} complete. In October that year <b>the</b> <b>line</b> towards Williamstown was completed, and so <b>the</b> Geelong <b>line</b> was connected <b>to</b> it.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 October 1884, the MDR and <b>the</b> MR jointly <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> eastwards <b>to</b> Mark Lane station (closed 1967), thereby {{completing}} the [...] "Inner Circle".|$|R
5000|$|The Swindon and Highworth Light Railway between Highworth Junction on the Great Western Main Line and Highworth {{was built}} through Stanton Fitzwarren in 1879-81 but the {{original}} company was unable <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{and sold it}} to the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1882. In 1883 <b>the</b> GWR finally <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> traffic, with three intermediate stations including [...] British Railways withdrew passenger services in 1953, apart from workmen's trains that it continued to run until 1962. Most of <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> including <b>the</b> section through Stanton, was then dismantled.|$|R
50|$|In 1884 {{a branch}} of the London and North Western Railway's network from Bangor was <b>opened.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> closed <b>to</b> {{passengers}} in 1951 and to freight in 1963.|$|R
50|$|On 2 June 1884 Fordham {{became a}} railway {{junction}} {{when the first}} section of <b>the</b> Mildenhall branch <b>opened.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> through <b>to</b> Mildenhall <b>opened</b> on 1 April 1885.|$|R
50|$|An {{engine shed}} was opened at Exeter by the Bristol and Exeter Railway when it <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> here in 1844. A second {{facility}} was {{added a few}} years later by the South Devon Railway and the two were combined under the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1876. The Bristol and Exeter had been worked by the GWR until 1849 but then purchased its own locomotives. Temporary workshops for these were built at Exeter but a permanent facility at Bristol was opened in 1851.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} 1 March 1866 that the Tendring Hundred Railway <b>opened</b> up <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> {{passenger}} services with its Wivenhoe <b>line</b> (subsequently extended <b>to</b> Walton-on-the Naze and Clacton).|$|R
50|$|William Hanson, Manager for Railways, {{selected}} a route for a horse-drawn tramway terminating at Hoyles Plains, later renamed Hoyleton. The enabling Act provided for a tramway of 28 miles 41 chains (45.9 km) in length to a gauge of , <b>the</b> first <b>line</b> in South Australia built to that gauge. Subsequently, the Government agreed that <b>the</b> <b>line</b> should be {{operated by a}} private body. The successful tenderer was one Paul Badcock who <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> traffic on 4 January 1870. Horses were worked in three relays between the stations on the route.|$|R
50|$|Vivid, which <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> from Leicester <b>to</b> Rugby, was a contractor's locomotive.|$|R
50|$|When <b>opened,</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> Aylesbury from Princes Risborough was broad gauge. To avoid mixed gauge track {{when the}} {{standard}} gauge Aylesbury and Buckingham {{arrived at the}} station in 1868, the section to Princes Risborough was converted to standard gauge, and therefore until {{the rest of the}} Wycombe Railway was converted in 1870 there was no access {{to the rest of the}} GWR system. The GWR provided motive power and trains to both the Wycombe Railway and the A&B, and ran a shuttle service from Princes Risborough to Verney Junction.|$|R
50|$|The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> from Varanasi <b>to</b> Lucknow in 1872.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Nord Company <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> from Épinay <b>to</b> Persan-Beaumont via Montsoult in 1877.|$|R
50|$|The {{business}} on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> increased {{very well and}} in fact a second engine had to be procured to handle the traffic. The directors wanted to start passenger operation too, and the necessary signalling (by McKenzie and Holland) and station accommodation were being provided. Now an inspection of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> by <b>the</b> Board of Trade inspector was required, and the notice {{was given to the}} BoT on 29 June 1875. In fact the inspecting officer failed to visit within the ten day timescale allowed and <b>the</b> Directors <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> passengers on 12 July 1875.|$|R
