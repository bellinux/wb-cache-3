5|$|Miyazaki's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>and</b> traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, {{and the difficulty of}} maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014. In 2002, American film critic Roger Ebert suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history, praising the depth and artistry of his films.|$|E

5|$|The first fish {{descriptions}} from Puerto Rico {{were compiled}} by Cuvier and Valenciennes in 1828. They reported 33 taxa for the archipelago. Puerto Rico has few native freshwater fish species; however, {{there are over}} 30 introduced species, mainly originating from Africa, South America and the southeastern United States, have established populations, and 60 marine species use Puerto Rico's freshwater bodies intermittently during the year. Introductions have been intentional and accidental. The purposes of intentional introductions have been sport fishing for recreation and food, mosquito control, and to provide baitfish for largemouth bass. Accidental introductions, such as the sailfin armored catfish (Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus), are mainly attributed {{to the release of}} aquarium fish. Since 1936, the Puerto Rican Department <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>and</b> Environmental Resources runs a hatchery at the municipality of Maricao. About 25,000 fish, including largemouth bass, peacock bass, and channel catfish, and some turtle species are raised annually to stock Puerto Rico's reservoirs and rivers.|$|E
5|$|This mamba preys {{primarily}} on adult birds, eggs and rodents. This species {{has also been}} documented to prey on bats. It is also believed that this species eats arboreal lizards as well, but {{this has not been}} documented. The preliminary evidence suggests that this species displays a sit-and-wait strategy of foraging. However, this evidence does not preclude active foraging by this species. One witness observed a specimen systematically hunt sleeping bats (J. Ashe, pers. comm. 1991). They have also been known to raid the nests of young birds. Sit-and-wait tactics may be successful with highly mobile prey, such as adult birds or rodents. Documented prey include the sombre greenbul, which occur in dense portions <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>and</b> cultivated vegetation along Kenya's coastline. Ionides and Pitman (1965) reported a large Bushveld gerbil in the stomach of a green mamba in Tanzania. Although the Bushveld gerbil does not occur in Kenya, green mambas will prey on any of the seven species of gerbil that inhabit various portions of its range.|$|E

Modern polish formulas were introduced early in the 20th century and many of those original formulations are still in use today. Today, shoe polish is usually made from a mix <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>and</b> synthetic materials, including naphtha, turpentine, dyes, and gum arabic, using straightforward chemical engineering processes. Shoe polish is usually flammable, can be toxic, and, if misused, can stain skin. It should be used in a well-ventilated area with care taken to protect clothes, carpet and furniture.|$|E
5|$|When Voight began {{research}} at Mount Merapi in Java, Indonesia, in 1988, {{it was largely}} unknown to volcanologists. It had been omitted in the Smithsonian Institution's 1981 publication Volcanoes of the World, despite being densely populated, having close to a million people on its slopes as of 1996. Voight set up meters to record movement within the volcano, and educated local scientists on volcanic monitoring. In July 1989, he obtained a $250,000 grant from the National Science Foundation's Division <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>and</b> Manmade Hazard Mitigation for his proposal to predict eruptions at Merapi. After his funding ran out, he temporarily abandoned his research. An eruption from the volcano in 1994 produced pyroclastic flows that killed 63 people, including guests at a wedding ceremony. Returning to Merapi the following year, Voight compared data from the dead and survivors, including {{the extent of their}} burn areas, clothing worn, and lung damage. He concluded that protective, long-sleeved clothing and masks enhance chances of survival when exposed to eruptive activity.|$|E
5|$|The Australian raven can {{be found}} in a wide range <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>and</b> {{modified}} habitats. It requires available water and trees (or buildings) to roost in or perch on. Preferred habitats include eucalypt-dominated sclerophyll forest, and farmland adjacent to trees. It is also found in heath and mangroves. In areas where it occurs with the little raven, namely over much of central New South Wales, Victoria and into South Australia, the Australian raven is restricted to more forested areas while the latter species prefers more open areas. Similarly, in inland Australia it can share range with the little crow, as the two do not appear to compete. However, the ranges of similar-sized forest raven and Torresian crow only narrowly overlap with the Australian raven as all three compete with each other. In central and western regions, Australian ravens and Torresian crows vie for the scattered uncommon trees and outcrops, and only one or the other are found there. It co-occurs with the forest raven in northeastern New South Wales from Port Stephens northwards. The Australian raven has adapted very well to human habitation in some cities and is the most common corvid in Canberra, Sydney and Perth; in Melbourne and Adelaide it is replaced by the little raven, and by the Torresian crow in Brisbane. Its large range, abundance and increasing population mean it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
