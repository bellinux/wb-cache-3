40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a check valve for use in a sorption compressor that will drive a 10 mW 4. 5 K Joule-Thomson cryocooler. For the check valve extremely low backflow rates are tolerable at an <b>operating</b> <b>temp.</b> of the valve of 50 K. To fulfill these requirements, the sealing mechanism of the valve is based on a full metal to metal contact. In order to obtain sufficiently low leak rates, both parts were machined to a surface flatness in the order of 100 nm. In addn., the closing plate (boss) of the valve deforms (bends) slightly under pressure, forming itself to the opposite valve seat and thus reducing the gap between these parts. The measured leak flow at 50 K was 1. 6 micro g/s helium. apprx. 16 bar pressure difference, which is well below the aim of 3 micro g/s. The valve was subjected to an accelerated lifetime test of 300, 000 cycles. It was obsd. that the leak flow through the valve during this test steadily decreased to a level of 0. 15 micro g/s after 100, 000 cycles. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} uncertainty in optimizing water networks in process industries. Due {{to the fact that}} wastewater flow rates as well as the levels of contaminants may vary widely as a result of changes in operational conditions and/or feedstock and product specifications, optimal wastewater network designs should be resilient and able to accommodate such changes. Uncertainties considered in this study are derived from actual operational practice of major water-using units in a typical oil refinery of 400, 000 barrels/day throughput. Rather than directly varying the concns. and mass loads, only seasonal effects have been considered in this research to illustrate applications of the models. Sensitivity analyses reveal that introducing uncertainty in operating conditions results in considerable changes in the connectivity of the units involved in wastewater reuse. The proposed stochastic optimization model produces a flexible wastewater network which is capable of accommodating uncertainties in <b>operating</b> <b>temp.</b> In the presence of uncertainties, the optimal network minimizes the impact on the reuse connectivity (topol.) by providing 32. 2 tons/h of freshwater in addn. to the condensing steam. The stochastic approach adopted in this research {{has been found to be}} effective in handling uncertainties and has resulted in flexible and resilient wastewater networks with low expected value of perfect information.

40|$|A closed-cycle {{gas flow}} system for cooling a high-crit. temp. d. c. -superconducting quantum {{interference}} device (SQUID) magnetometer {{by means of}} a cryocooler has been designed, constructed and tested. The magnetometer is aimed to measure heart signals with a sensitivity of 0. 1 pT/Hz 1 / 2. The required <b>operating</b> <b>temp.</b> of the SQUID is 30 - 70 K with a stability of 0. 5 K. Allowing for a cool-down time of about one hour a cooling power of at least 0. 2 W is required (sensor mass. apprx. 2 g). Further requirements for the system are a low vibration level and a low magnetic interference. In the design, helium gas is forced to flow in a closed cycle {{by means of a}} gas-flow pump. The gas is cooled by a Leybold Heraeus RG 210 cooler, transported through a gas line, and cools the SQUID in a glass-epoxy heat exchanger. The return gas is used to thermally insulate the supply gas. Because the gas-flow pump has to operate at room temp., a counterflow heat exchanger has been incorporated. Based on the experience with this cooling system, a much smaller configuration using a miniature Stirling cryocooler will be designed. The design and construction of the present closed-cycle system is described and first test results are presented. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of mol. spintronics, the use of {{magnetic}} mols. for information technol. is a main target and the observation of magnetic hysteresis on individual mols. organized on surfaces is a necessary step to develop mol. memory arrays. Although simple paramagnetic mols. can show surface-induced magnetic ordering and hysteresis when deposited on ferromagnetic surfaces, information storage at the mol. level requires mols. exhibiting an intrinsic remnant magnetization, like the so-called single-mol. magnets (SMMs). These have been intensively investigated for their rich quantum behavior but no magnetic hysteresis has been so far reported for monolayers of SMMs on various nonmagnetic substrates, most probably owing to the chem. instability of clusters on surfaces. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic CD synchrotron-based techniques, pushed to the limits in sensitivity and <b>operated</b> at sub-kelvin <b>temps.,</b> we have now found that robust, tailor-made Fe 4 complexes retain magnetic hysteresis at gold surfaces.

40|$|At the University of Twente, a fetal {{heart monitor}} {{based on a}} high-TC SQUID {{magnetometer}} system is under development. The purpose of this system is to measure a fetal heart signal in a clin. environment. For cooling a first demonstrator version, a closed-cycle Joule-Thomson cooler from APD Cryogenics - the Cryotiger? - was selected. In this work, the Cryotiger is characterised with respect to three noise generating mechanisms: electromagnetic interference, mech. vibrations and temp. fluctuations. The electromagnetic interference of the cold tip was below the resoln. of our 3 -axis fluxgate magnetometer (7 pT/?Hz). The interference from the compressor, however, requires it to be placed 2 m or more from the sensor head {{in order to remain}} below the environmental power line disturbances. As mech. vibrations of a magnetometer in a background field - the earth magnetic field - will result in an apparent field at the frequency of vibration, we require the rotation of the cold tip to remain below 200 micro rad in the frequency band of interest (0. 5 - 100 Hz). This was checked by applying a magnetic field to a SQUID magnetometer mounted on the cooler's cold tip. In this way, rotations of 3 micro rad and translations of 40 nm of the Cryotiger were measured; both at a frequency of 49 Hz. A further issue with respect to our application is the fluctuation in <b>operating</b> <b>temp.</b> Under no-load operation, the temp. occasionally increased from around 70 K to about 82 K.

Since such a magnetometer should be simple to use, the cooling of the system can be realized most practically {{by means of a}} cryocooler. A closed-cycle gas flow cooling system incorporating such a cooler has been designed, constructed, and tested. The aimed resoln. of the magnetometer is 0. 1 pT Hz- 1 / 2. The required <b>operating</b> <b>temp.</b> for the SQUIDs is 30 to about 77 K with a stability of 2 * 10 - 4 K Hz- 1 / 2. After a cool-down time of 1 - 2 h, a stationary cooling power of at least 0. 2 W is required. In the design, helium gas is cooled by a Leybold Heraeus RG 210 cryocooler, transported through a gas line, and subsequently passed through a heat exchanger on which SQUIDs can be installed. The lowest obtainable SQUID heat exchanger temp. is 31 +- 2 K. This can be reached in roughly 2 - 3 h with an optimal mass flow with respect to the cooling power of 6 * 10 - 6 kg s- 1. At this mass flow the cooling power at the SQUID heat exchanger is 0. 2 W at 42 K and roughly 1. 2 W at 77 K. A temp. stability of 0. 05 K was measured at a SQUID heat exchanger temp. of 54 K and a mass flow of 3 * 10 - 5 kg s- 1. The experience gained with this large cooling system will be used in the design of a smaller configuration cooling system, incorporating miniature Stirling cryocoolers.
