50|$|The history, {{character}} and <b>on-going</b> <b>activity</b> of the Rangers is {{closely linked to}} its American founder, Tha-U-Wah-A-Pah (the assumed Karen pseudonym, henceforth TUWAP of Dave Eubank): a Fuller Theological Seminary-educated Pastor and ex-member of the U.S. Special Forces. Having already spent {{a number of years}} as a missionary in Burma, in 1996, following a chance meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy, TUWAP was inspired to initiate a ‘Global Day of Prayer’ http://www.prayforburma.org/IDX/Prayer/Day_of_Prayer/ and help to strengthen unity between the majority Burman population and the various minority ethnic groups. TUWAP was then in Burma during the Army Offensives of 1997, distributing medicine to those displaced by the conflict, and it was during this time that he decided to employ his broad mixture of skills to bring a unique brand of humanitarian relief to a greater number.|$|E
40|$|Bradycardia can be {{evoked by}} {{stimulation}} of both myelinated and non-myelinated vagal efferent fibres. The <b>on-going</b> <b>activity</b> and synaptic inputs to cardiac vagal preganglionic neurones with myelinated axons {{have been studied}} in detail, {{but there is little}} information regarding cardiac preganglionic neurones with non-myelinated axons. In the present study, the on-going discharge and afferent inputs to cardiac vagal efferents with non-myelinated axons were studied in anaesthetized rats and cats. Extracellular recordings were made from vagal preganglionic neurones in the dorsal vagal motor nucleus (DVMN) of anaesthetized rats following electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve. Based on calculated axonal conduction velocities, fifty-six neurones had non-myelinated axons. Sixteen of these C fibre neurones had <b>on-going</b> <b>activity</b> but this showed no relationship to central respiratory drive, lung inflation or the cardiac cycle. Activity of twenty-one of these fifty-six neurones was increased at short latency following right atrial injections of phenylbiguanide (PBG). Eight presumed cardiac vagal preganglionic neurones were also recorded in the DVMN. Five of these were activated by PBG administration, and the one neurone with resting activity showed no indication of respiratory-related activity. Finally, twenty-one single C fibres were recorded in peripheral branches of the cardiac vagus. They had a low rate of <b>on-going</b> <b>activity,</b> and in twelve fibres this on-going discharge was analysed in detail. <b>On-going</b> <b>activity</b> in seven of these fibres showed no relationship to central respiratory drive, lung inflation or the cardiac cycle, whereas the other five had prominent relationships with both central respiratory drive and lung inflation, and two of these also showed a relationship to heart period. PBG administration evoked an increased activity in fourteen of the fifteen fibres tested, and the latencies of nine of these responses (1. 3 ± 0. 5 s) were within the pulmonary circulation time. In anaesthetized cats, extracellular recordings were made in the DVMN from thirty-three cardiac vagal preganglionic neurones with C fibre axons. The <b>on-going</b> <b>activity</b> of these neurones, when present, never exhibited an on-going- or reflexly induced respiratory rhythm, nor any indication of an input from the arterial baroreceptors. Right atrial injection of PBG evoked a short-latency response in four of the five spontaneously active neurones but was without effect on the eight neurones tested which did not exhibit <b>on-going</b> <b>activity.</b> In conclusion, the majority of cardiac vagal preganglionic neurones located in the DVMN have C fibre axons, show no obvious input from central or peripheral respiratory- or cardiac-related inputs, but are activated by stimulation of pulmonary C fibre afferent fibres...|$|E

The closure of the Site is complex, in that it houses over 700 facilities, 19, 600 kilograms of Special Nuclear Material (Plutonium and Uranium), and over 160, 000 cubic meters of Transuranic, Low Level, and Hazardous Waste.

40|$|Cellular {{mechanisms}} {{of the actions}} of angiotensin II (ANGII) within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) were studied using rat brain slices in 78 neurones recorded in the whole-cell configuration. Twenty-nine per cent of cells had an <b>on-going</b> <b>activity</b> and with only one exception these cells responded to tractus solitarii (TS) stimulation with a monophasic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). In approximately half of the silent cells, TS stimulation evoked an EPSP-inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) complex. The ANGII (200 or 1000 nM) effect on TS-evoked EPSPs depended on the cell subpopulation. In cells with <b>on-going</b> <b>activity,</b> ANGII (1000 nM) increased evoked EPSP amplitude by + 70 ± 13 % (means ± s. e. m., n = 5) but reduced it (200 and 1000 nM) in silent cells where both evoked EPSPs and IPSPs were present. ANGII either increased TS-evoked IPSP conductances in cells where they were detectable or revealed an evoked IPSP (200 nM ANGII: IPSP conductance increased from 70 ± 29 to 241 ± 34 pS; n = 11). All ANGII effects were prevented by the ANGII type 1 (AT 1) receptor blocker losartan. Since 200 nM ANGII did not increase responses to iontophoretically applied GABA, the effect of ANGII on TS-evoked IPSPs may occur presynaptically. The neurokinin type 1 (NK 1) receptor antagonist CP- 99, 994 (5 μM) blocked the ANGII-induced increase in EPSPs but had no effect on TS-evoked IPSP potentiation by ANGII. Thus, ANGII can potentiate both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission within different subpopulations of NTS neurones. Potentiation of evoked EPSPs, but not of IPSPs, involves activation of NK 1 receptors. The balance of these actions of ANGII could be reflex specific: for the baroreflex circuitry the inhibitory action might predominate while the peripheral chemoreceptor reflex may be facilitated due to enhanced excitatory transmission...|$|E
