5|$|Although {{scientists}} began observing reduced {{populations of}} several European amphibian species {{already in the}} 1950s, awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern-day mass extinction only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus {{recognized as one of}} the most severe examples of the Holocene extinction, with severe implications for global biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|So far, the {{investigation}} {{had been on}} the natural frequency of transient oscillation of a resonant circuit resulting from a sudden stimulus. More important {{from the point of view}} of filter theory is the behaviour of a resonant circuit when driven by an external AC signal: there is a sudden peak in the circuit's response when the driving signal frequency is at the resonant frequency of the circuit. James Clerk Maxwell heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on dynamos, and was also aware of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866. Maxwell explained resonance mathematically, with a set of differential equations, in much the same terms that an RLC circuit is described today.|$|E
5|$|The Arcturus did not {{encounter}} the thick mats of sargassum in the Sargasso Sea that Beebe {{was hoping to}} study, but Beebe and his crew experienced great success dredging creatures from the sea {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin and Saba. In the Pacific, they encountered a strange boundary between two currents of very different temperatures, containing a vast diversity of life on the border between the two. He sailed along the border between the currents for several days to document it, theorizing that it could be the cause of the unusual climate which South America had recently been experiencing. Beebe's study of these currents, and their effect on the climate of South America, is the earliest known study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> known as El Niño.|$|E

5|$|When {{speaking}} of {{language as a}} general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory. Debates {{about the nature and}} origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants, and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant {{scientists in the}} United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially white flowers, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers. Soon after, a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa, {{although it was not}} immediately recognized as related. Further investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called co-suppression of gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.|$|E
