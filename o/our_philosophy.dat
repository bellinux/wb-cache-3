The two had both served as coaches on the 1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada. The two coaches first met in Washington D.C. while trying to recruit players from the same high school. Thompson was quoted saying that coach Smith [...] "knows <b>our</b> <b>philosophy</b> and I know his philosophy." [...] Smith talked of Thompson saying he was a personal friend of his and that he would maintain contact with him whether or not Thompson was still coaching.|$|E

500|$|Felix Bohatsch of Broken Rules {{reported}} in May 2009 that {{sales of the}} PC version were [...] "not at a level we were expecting". No digital rights management (DRM) protection {{was placed on the}} game because [...] "we ... believe that any game will be cracked, no matter how we try to protect it, so <b>our</b> <b>philosophy</b> is that adding DRM or anything similar only annoys the people who actually pay for it." [...] The bootlegging rate was approximately 95.5%, meaning [...] "for every game [...] there are 22 cracked version [...] being played". Bohatsch speculated that the poor sales were partly caused by the levels demonstrated in the free game demo, which did not focus enough on the game's puzzles. More than 370,000 units of the game were sold as part of the third Humble Indie Bundle.|$|E
500|$|The company's online {{advertising}} program in Spain described the BK XXL line as being made [...] "with two enormous portions of flame-broiled meat {{that will give}} you all the energy you need to take the world by storm." [...] This claim combined with the television advertising were the prime motivators behind the Spanish government's concerns with the XXL sandwich line. The government claimed that campaign violated an agreement with the government to comply with an initiative on curbing obesity by promoting such a large and unhealthy sandwich. In response to the government's claims, Burger King replied in a statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years. <b>Our</b> <b>philosophy</b> can be summed up with the motto 'As you like it,' in which our customers' taste trumps all."

[...] However, there were many more errors and substandard performances: quarterback John David Booty, who broke a bone in the middle finger of his throwing hand in the firsthalf, had fourpasses intercepted in the secondhalf. [...] The offensive line had been suffering since losing twostarters in oneplay during the previous week's game at Washington, but the effect was severe against Stanford; the offensive line gave up foursacks, one more than the Trojans had surrendered all season, and USC gained only 95yards rushing. [...] Key receiver Patrick Turner dropped several passes, the defense gave up 17points in the fourthquarter and USC had an extra-point attempt blocked, a point which became a crucial difference. [...] Like their previous game against Washington, USC out-gained Stanford by 224yards (459 to 235) but made many crucial turnovers and penalties. [...] In the press conference following the game, Coach Carroll summarized his concerns: [...] "It's real clear that we have fallen {{out of line with}} <b>our</b> <b>philosophy</b> that has guided this program for years; we're turning the ball over too much." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the 2006 introduction of the BK XXL product line in Spain, the Spanish Health Ministry publicly claimed {{that the company had}} violated a voluntary agreement between the company and the Spanish Federation of Hoteliers and Restaurateurs, a group to which Burger King belongs, that called on its members to refrain from advertising large portions of food. The Minister of Health, Elena Salgado, claimed that the new promotion and the new sandwiches, averaging over 970 calories each, violated the accord. The head of Spain's food regulatory body, Felix Lobo, stated a legal case could be made against Burger King for [...] "illegally failing to comply with a contract". In a {{response to}} the Government's allegations, the European offices of Burger King released this statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years. <b>Our</b> <b>philosophy</b> can be summed up with the motto 'As you like it,' in which our customers' taste trumps all." [...] The company also explained that it had always worked [...] "to reduce the risk of illness provoked by an inadequate diet and to promote a balanced... diet."

Nor am I disinclined to invent a species of machinery for this purpose; being anxious to fulfil, with hairsbreadth accuracy, all the requisitions that are made of epic poets, even on the side of form. Besides, this machinery, which, in a subject so modern, in an age so prosaic, appears to present the greatest difficulty, might exalt the interest in a high degree, were it suitably adapted to this same modern spirit. Crowds of confused ideas on this matter are rolling to and fro within my head; something distinct will come out of them at last.|$|R
