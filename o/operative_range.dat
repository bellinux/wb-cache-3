40|$|Description of the subject. The paper {{presents}} and discusses {{a method for}} fractionating bulk soil organic carbon (SOC) in meaningful SOC fractions to better assess SOC status and its related soil ecosystem functions. Objectives. The objective is to perform an evaluation of ecosystem functions of soil organic matter at plot scale and {{compare it to the}} normal <b>operative</b> <b>range</b> of the local agro-ecological region. Method. By separating carbon associated with clay and fine silt particles (stable carbon with slow turnover rate, < 20 µm) and carbon non-associated with this fraction (labile and intermediate carbon with higher turnover rates, ≥ 20 µm), effects of management can be detected more efficiently at different scales. Conclusions. Soil organic carbon fractions, used as proxies for soil ecosystem functions, can be helpful because they represent SOC functional pools. This paper proposes to apply fractionation on samples taken at plot and regional scale. It is therefore possible to establish a normal <b>operative</b> <b>range</b> for a specific agro-region for comparison with the values in individual plots. This allows drawing a baseline for SOC fractions status in a specific agricultural unit. This approach provides valuable information to study and evaluate the impact of agricultural management in the context of enhancing soil quality and functions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{fluidized}} bed coating of metal substrates with high performance thermoplastic powders (polyftalamide, PPA). Two different experimental scenarios were investigated: the conventional hot dipping fluidized bed (CHDFB) process and the electrostatic fluidized bed (EFB) coating process. The preliminary experimental plan was scheduled employing design of experiment (DOE) technique. Three experimental factors and <b>operative</b> <b>ranges</b> large enough for practical purposes were considered in both of the examined scenarios. In particular, coating time and airflow rate were chosen as experimental factors in both CHDFB and EFB. The third factor was the preheating temperature of metal substrates in CHDFB and the applied voltage in EFB. A general linear model based upon analysis of variance (ANOVA) {{was used to evaluate}} the significance on coating processes of each experimental factor. Main effect plots (MEPs) and interaction plots (IPs) of coating thickness were drawn. Trends consistent with the settings of the operative parameters were displayed. The experimental trends were first modelled by numerical regression of the experimental data and, subsequently, by using artificial neural network. The reliability of the neural network solution and of the built ad hoc regression models was comparatively evaluated. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network trained with back propagation (BP) algorithm was found to be the most valuable in fitting the coating thicknesses trends for both the coating processes. Examining the developed models outside the <b>operative</b> <b>ranges</b> they were designed for, the good generalization capability and high flexibility of the neural network solution was definitely stated.

These patients were admitted to and treated in the Chinese PLA General Hospital from September 1983 to June 2010. Lymph nodes were found in 294 patients after radical resection. Univariate,multivariate,and chromatographic analyses were done to analyze {{the effect of the}} following nine clinicopathological variables: age,gender,tumor size,location,macroscopic type,depth of invasion,lymphatic vessel involvement,smoking,and tumor family history. Results The incidence rate of lymphatic metastasis in poorly differentiated early gastric cancer was 19. 0 %(56 / 294),from which the incidence rates of lymphatic metastasis for mucosal(M) and submucosal(SM) cancer were 4. 4 %(6 / 136) and 31. 6 %(50 / 158). The logistic regression analysis showed that tumor sizes of > 1. 5 cm(P= 0. 049,OR= 2. 437),submucosal invasion(P= 0. 000,OR= 6. 681),lymphatic vessel involvement(P= 0. 000,OR= 8. 469) are independent risk factors for lymphatic metastasis. Moreover,the chromatographic analysis showed that M lymphatic metastasis was influenced by tumor size(P= 0. 028) and lymphatic vessel involvement(P= 0. 005),whereas SM lymphatic metastasis was influenced by lymphatic vessel involvement(P= 0. 000).

40|$|Abstract — Quadratic systems play an {{important}} role in the modeling of a wide class of nonlinear processes (electrical, robotic, biological, etc.). For such systems it is of mandatory importance not only to determine whether the origin of the state space is locally asymptotically stable, but also to ensure that the <b>operative</b> <b>range</b> is included into the convergence region of the equilibrium. Based on this observation, this paper considers the following problem: given the zero equilibrium point of a nonlinear quadratic system, assumed to be locally asymptotically stable, and a certain polytope in the state space containing the origin, determine whether this polytope belongs to the region of attraction of the equilibrium. The proposed approach is based on polyhedral Lyapunov functions, rather than on the classical quadratic Lyapunov functions. An exam-ple shows that our methodology may return less conservative results than those obtainable with previous approaches. I...|$|E

It includes about 1200 user loads, 70 km of MV lines, 6 feeders, a thyristor voltage regulator (TVR) and 6 distributed energy sources (5 generator sets and 1 photovoltaic plant). Network topology can be changed by 106 breakers.

The complex band structures and energy velocity for the one-dimensional diatomic periodic chains are computed considering both the Kelvin Voigt and the Standard Linear Solid models. It is proven that unusual dispersive behaviors already observed by other researchers when using the Kelvin Voigt model, such as wavenumber-gaps and strong band shifting, are only caused by its nonphysical rigid behavior at high frequencies, since they disappear once the Standard Linear Solid model is adopted.

It argues that a distinction must be made between the ultimate aims and the immediate objectives of 2 ̆ 7 religious 2 ̆ 7 terrorists, and that while the ultimate aims will be religiously formulated, the immediate objectives will often be found to be almost purely political. This distinction is illustrated with reference to such premodern religious terrorists as the Assassins and Zealots. Immediate objectives, are for many purposes more important than ultimate aims. Although the immediate objectives of al-Qaeda on 9 / 11 cannot be established with certainty, it is highly probably that the intention was to provoke a response from the US {{that would have a}} radicalizing impact on al-Qaeda 2 ̆ 7 s constituency. Reference to public opinion in the Middle East, especially in Egypt, shows that this is indeed what has happened.
