40|$|Introduction: The Department of Health and Human Services and Food and Drug Administration {{described}} {{guidelines for}} exception from informed consent (EFIC) research. These guidelines require community consultation (CC) events, which allow {{members of the}} community to understand the study, provide feedback and give advice. A real-time gauge of audience understanding would allow the speaker to modify the discussion. The objective of the study is to describe the use of audience response survey (ARS) technology in EFIC CCs. Methods: As part of the Rapid Anticonvulsant Medication Prior to Arrival Trial (RAMPART), 13 CC events were conducted. We prepared a PowerPoint™ presentation with 4 embedded ARS questions,according to specific IRB guidelines to ensure that the pertinent information would reach <b>our</b> <b>targeted</b> <b>audience.</b> During 6 CCs, an ARS was used to gauge audience comprehension. Participants completed paper surveys regarding their opinion of the study following each CC.  Results: The ARS was used with minimal explanation and only one ARS was lost. Greater than 80 % of the participants correctly answered 3 of the 4 ARS questions with 61 % correctly answering the question regarding EFIC. A total of 105 participants answered the paper survey; 80 - 90 % of the responses to the paper survey were either strongly agree or agree. The average scores on the paper survey in the ARS sites compared to the non-ARS sites were significantly more positive. Conclusion: The use of an audience response system during the community consultation aspects of EFIC is feasible and provides a real-time assessment of audience comprehension of the study and EFIC process. It may improve the community’s opinion and support of the study. [West J Emerg Med. 2014; 15 (4) : 414 - 418. ...|$|R

The Geosciences and Environmental Sciences Librarian and the Biosciences Librarian have done away with long lists of difficult to organize links and have opted to manage their recommended web resources with del. icio. us instead. Del. icio. us allows easily accessible bookmarking combined with user-friendly script generation for incorporation into otherwise static web pages. Other benefits of using del. icio. us include organizing links through tagging and bundling, fast-tracked updating of newly discovered websites, providing a simple method of sharing links between users, and demonstrating how a web 2. 0 tool {{can be used to}} <b>our</b> <b>targeted</b> <b>audience</b> of researchers. Organizing del. icio. us accounts for use on SRGs is easy but can take several forms and incorporate different utilities (tag and link rolls, tag bundling, RSS feed generation, and integration in Facebook, etc.).

40|$|Abstract Dissemination is now {{acknowledged}} {{as an important}} component of the research process, in particular for European Union (EU) funded research projects. This article builds on the authors' experience during the EU project DEVOTES (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status) and aims to assist other scientists to develop a successful dissemination strategy to communicate project achievements. We provide a critical review of the different tools used for outreach to <b>our</b> <b>target</b> <b>audiences,</b> from the academia to the policy makers, and the general public, and try to assess their impact. An effective dissemination strategy and plan should have a clear objective, be designed before the start of the project, identify the target groups and define the methods or tools to be used according to target groups and objectives. The DEVOTES dissemination strategy included two complementary approaches of communication with stakeholders: (i) traditional (e. g., peer reviewed publications, stakeholders workshops, and participation in scientific conferences), and (ii) new (e. g., social networks, smartphone applications) media tools. For each dissemination approach, we defined production targets (e. g., number of articles to be published, individual visitors on the website, etc.) to be achieved by the end of the project, and impact measurements (e. g., citation indices for peer reviewed articles) to monitor the successful implementation of DEVOTES Dissemination. This allowed us to identify which tools had been more (e. g., website) or less useful and relevant (e. g., Facebook) during the project. We conclude that impact measurements cannot be easily identified for all dissemination actions. However, for those that were possible, the DEVOTES dissemination targets were successfully achieved. Overall, the use of the tools and activities outlined in this article, combined with the constant evaluation of the dissemination goals throughout the project duration and the assessment of the effectiveness of the different tools, is essential for the achievement of an effective and timely communication of research results...|$|R
