5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file <b>out</b> <b>slowly</b> (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E
5|$|Maho is Shuichi's sister. She is {{one year}} older than Shuichi is, and at the {{beginning}} of Wandering Son, she is in the sixth grade of elementary school. Maho shows a strong interest in clothes, and spends much of her money on new apparel. She is a big fan of a teen fashion model named Maiko, and to meet her, Maho auditions for the same modeling agency as Maiko. After she is hired and becomes recognized as a model, Maho enjoys being asked her autograph by complete strangers. While her modeling career initially starts <b>out</b> <b>slowly,</b> Maho soon gains confidence in her abilities, and becomes friends with Maiko and two other models, Anna Suehiro and Tamaki Satō. In contrast to her younger sibling, Maho is very out-spoken and tends to be rough with Shuichi, even hitting or slapping Shuichi on occasion, and she often forces things on Shuichi with little consideration of Shuichi's opinion. She does not like Shuichi's cross-dressing and gets angry and disturbed when she finds Shuichi dressed as a girl. In junior high school, Maho becomes attracted to her classmate Riku Seya, and eventually starts dating him.|$|E

25|$|After three downs, the Buckeyes punted. Groom {{kicked the}} ball 44 yards where Roscoe Parrish made a fair catch at the Miami 48-yard line.

Three plays later, Dorsey sidestepped blitzing safety Donnie Nickey and threw to Parrish for a 25-yard {{touchdown}} to put Miami up 7 - 0 (after Todd Sievers’s extra point) with 4:09 {{left in the first}} quarter.|$|E
25|$|The game started <b>out</b> <b>slowly,</b> with {{a series}} of punts by both teams. On Missouri's third possession, a {{combination}} of Chase Daniel passes and Tony Temple rushes carried the Tigers down to the Oklahoma 11yard drive, where the Sooners' defense stepped up and forced a 28yard Jeff Wolfert field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Oklahoma's Allen Patrick returned the ball to the OU 33yard line. A couple of Sam Bradford passes combined with a Chris Brown rush found the Sooners at 2nd and 7 on their own 46-yard line, when Bradford connected with Malcolm Kelly for a 47yard gain. Oklahoma ran two plays that served to move the ball to the 5yard line before time expired in the first quarter.|$|E

The lead extended to double digits by the first half but the US a team really get going in the third quarter with both offense and defense. Hungary would only score 7 points in the third quarter, while the USA scored 16 consecutive points in five minutes. Jones was the leading scorer with 15 points, one of four USA players with double digit points. The team held Hungary to 27% field-goal shooting for the game.

25|$|The {{first meeting}} of the Dáil coincided with an {{unauthorised}} shooting of two RIC men in Tipperary, now regarded as {{the outbreak of the}} Irish War of Independence. From 1919 to 1921 the Irish Volunteers (now renamed as the Irish Republican Army, being deemed by the Dáil to be the army of the new Irish Republic) engaged in guerrilla warfare against the British army, the RIC and paramilitary police units known as the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries. The violence started <b>out</b> <b>slowly,</b> with only 19 deaths in 1919, but escalated sharply from the second half of 1920 and {{in the first six months}} of 1921 alone there were 1,000 deaths on all sides. The principle political leader of the republican movement was Éamon de Valera – the President of the Republic. However he spent much of the conflict in the United States, raising money and support for the Irish cause. In his absence, two young men, Michael Collins and Richard Mulcahy rose to prominence as the clandestine leaders of the IRA – respectively Director of Intelligence and Chief of Staff of the guerrilla organisation.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{game was}} against the team from France. The USA team started <b>out</b> <b>slowly,</b> hitting only one of their first six shots at the basket. France pulled out to a 14–5 early lead, hitting two-thirds of their shot attempts in the first quarter, and extended the lead to a 13-point margin during the first half. The USA team came back, but was still down 30–25 at halftime. The USA team cut into {{the lead in the}} third quarter, but with one quarter to go, France led 49–47. Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, who would score nine of her thirteen points in the final quarter, helped the USA take the lead, and the USA team pulled out to an eleven-point lead with just over six minutes to play. However, France hit consecutive three-pointers as part of a 9–0 run to bring the margin down to two points. With just over a minute to play, the score was even at 64 points apiece. Bria Hartley passed to Breanna Stewart, who was fouled going for the basket. She sank both free throws. After a turnover by France, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis scored with 23 seconds to go to give the USA a four-point lead. France did not score again, and the USA won the game 70–64.|$|E

25|$|During the 1996–97 season, Kariya became {{team captain}} {{following}} Randy Ladouceur's retirement in the off-season, {{and led the}} Ducks to their first post-season appearance, after recording the franchise's first winning record of 36–33–13, good enough for home ice {{in the first round}} as the number four seed against the Phoenix Coyotes. The Ducks trailed 3–2 going into Phoenix for game six. Kariya scored in overtime to force the franchise's first game 7 which they won. In the second round, however, they lost to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Red Wings in a four-game sweep. After the season, Wilson was fired after saying he would like to coach the Capitals. Pierre Page succeeded him. The Ducks started <b>out</b> <b>slowly</b> in 1997–98, in part because Kariya missed the first 32 games of the season in a contract dispute. He came back in December, but on February 1, he suffered a season-ending concussion when the Chicago Blackhawks' Gary Suter cross-checked him in the face. With Kariya playing only a total of 22 games that season, the Ducks missed the playoffs and fired Page. The Ducks followed that season up by finishing sixth in the Western Conference in 1998–99 with new head coach Craig Hartsburg. However, they were swept by the Detroit Red Wings again, this time in the first round.|$|E
500|$|... "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] {{runs for}} 5:14 (5minutes, 14seconds). It is played in common {{time in a}} key of A. The song begins {{with the sound of}} rain hitting a roof, which fades in over the first {{fourteen}} seconds alongside the bass and a processed drum loop beat by Mullen which reverberates in the background. Thirty-two seconds into the song, Mullen's drums enter, playing a sporadic beat every four to five seconds. At the fifty-second mark the drums play a more regular beat, and the Edge's guitar, accompanied by Eno's synthesizer, enters. The first verse begins at 1:28, and introduces the chord progression of A5–E5–Fm–D–A5, which is played in the verses. At 2:41 Eno's keyboards enter, and the song begins to follow a D–D5–A5 chord progression, while Bono begins falsetto vocals. The second verse then begins at 3:01. The lyrics end at 3:37, and the song returns to the chord progression of D–D5–A5. The harmony gradually grows in volume until 4:33, at which point the song enters into a coda; the keyboards come to a finish and the guitar returns to playing A notes before fading over the next eight seconds alongside the bass. The synthesizer, drums, and drum loop conclude the song, fading <b>out</b> <b>slowly</b> over the last thirty-one seconds.|$|E
500|$|The {{roller coaster}} has a simple layout with a 180 ft drop at 87 degrees, meaning {{it does not}} have a true {{vertical}} drop. [...] The car slowly ascends 60 feet at a 45 degree angle to build tension, then levels <b>out,</b> <b>slowly</b> travelling around a curve on a unique chain system, seen only on Oblivion, as the cars approach the drop. As each car reaches the drop it is held by a holding chain for a maximum of five seconds, giving the rider {{a clear view of the}} long drop, before a brake is released allowing the car to drop into the tunnel. This is followed by a highly banked turn that climbs up and makes the train lie on its side as it goes through. Then after dropping out of the turn the train climbs over a small rise in the track to the brakes, slowing down, and then pulls around back to the station. The open design cars accommodate sixteen passengers in two rows of eight. The back row is slightly raised to give passengers a clear view of the drop. A pre-recorded and disembodied voice saying 'don't look down' was played just before release. In 2004, this sound effect was removed due to sound restrictions on the park and instead the words [...] "Don't look down" [...] have been painted on the floor of the guest observation area where the ride enters the ground. The words are clearly visible to riders when the train is hanging over the edge of the drop.|$|E

500|$|On January18, 1873, Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Archibald Loudon Snowden {{complained that}} the [...] "3" [...] in the date, as struck by the Mint, too closely resembled an [...] "8", {{especially}} on the smaller-sized denominations. [...] In response, Pollock ordered Chief Engraver William Barber to re-engrave the date, opening {{the arms of the}} [...] "3" [...] wider on most denominations, including the three-dollar piece. [...] Both the Closed3 and Open3 varieties are extremely rare, though the official mintage of 25pieces for 1873 is understated, since more specimens than that are known to exist. In 1875 and 1876, no pieces were struck for circulation, with only pieces in proof condition being made available to collectors. [...] The official mintage is 20for 1875 and 45for 1876, though an unknown number of pieces may have been later illicitly restruck for each date. Numismatic writer R.W. Julian believes that there were no later restrikes, but as proof pieces were not counted until sold, employees substituted common-date pieces when unsold coins were to be melted. These pieces had been made available to the public only as part of a proof set of all gold denominations, at a price of $43 (a premium of $1.50 over face value). Julian suggests that the relatively large mintages of almost 42,000 in 1874 and some 82,000 in 1878 were struck in anticipation of the resumption of specie payments, but when this finally occurred at the end of 1878, [...] "there was a loud yawn from the public and the Mint kept most of the pieces on hand, paying them <b>out</b> <b>slowly</b> as stocking stuffers.|$|E

Hitting 3000 metres in 7:38.93, even the British commentators announcing the race counted him out. With four laps to go (8:40.00), Haile needed a sub-4-minute final 1,600 metres for the record.

[...] Woody Herman remembered that [...] "Woodchopper's Ball" [...] started <b>out</b> <b>slowly</b> at first. [...] "t was really a sleeper. But Decca kept re-releasing it, and over a period of three or four years it became a hit. Eventually it sold more than five million copies—the biggest hit I ever had."
