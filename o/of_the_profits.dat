5|$|Because of {{the tight}} rationing, a black market {{in food and}} other {{consumer}} goods emerged. Food {{on the black market}} was extremely expensive. Prices could be 650 percent higher than in legal shops and rose constantly during the war. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>profits</b> to be made, the black market spawned large and well-organised networks. Numerous members of the German administration were involved in the black market, stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E

5|$|Remington and Innes later {{met with}} Menage and, in 1882, devised {{a plan to}} sell King's land to Menage for {{development}} without telling King. Menage also negotiated a separate deal with Innes (likely behind Remington's back) where he agreed to pay him one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>profits</b> made from the land as a finder's fee and in exchange for Innes' help keeping Remington and King at bay. Menage proceeded to develop the land into housing and profited handsomely.|$|E

Eager for a repeat success, the company that released Paris Hilton's celebrity sex tape obtained the footage, edited it, and released it under the name 1 Night in China. The video sold over 100,000 copies, with both Laurer and Waltman earning a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>profits.</b> Laurer, however, maintained that she did not earn any money from the release.

Alperson from Grand National Films, a newly established, {{independent}} studio, approached him to make movies for $100,000 a film and 10% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>profits.</b> Cagney made two films for Grand National: Great Guy and Something to Sing About. He received good reviews for both, but overall the production quality was not up to Warner Bros. standards, and the films did not do well. A third film, Dynamite, was planned, but Grand National ran out of money.|$|E
5|$|Lapensée was {{reputed to}} have scored over 150 goals {{and led her}} team to be unbeaten {{throughout}} 1916 and 1917, when records indicate that they won 45 of their 46 games. However, after demanding a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>profits</b> from the games, Lapensée disappeared from the sport in 1918, still aged under 20. There {{were a number of}} rumours: that she had died in the 1918 flu pandemic, that she had travelled to New York to undergo a sex-change, or that she had always been a draft dodging man, though none provided any credible evidence. A 1940 profile of her father refuted all those claims, detailing her as living as a woman in New York.|$|E
5|$|Money No Enough was {{produced}} by JSP Films on a budget of S$850,000. The production crew included Deri Ng as first assistant director, J.P. Tan as producer, Kamis as cinematographer, A.

After the Board of Film Censors reviewed and approved Money No Enough, distributor Shaw Organisation released the film on 21 screens on 7 May 1998 and 18 April 2008.

This causes Homer to have four simultaneous heart attacks. While in the hospital, Lisa apologizes to Homer for not accepting the money. He tells her that he understands what she did, but says that the $12,000 would have been a big financial help. Lisa replies that 10% of $120 million is actually $12 million.

5|$|The {{success of}} that initial shoot {{convinced}} Poole to plan two more segments and seek theatrical {{distribution for the}} completed work. He hired Tommy Moore and Casey Donovan for the third segment, Inside. When Fisk's scene partner from Bayside heard about the potential distribution deal, he refused to sign release forms until he was guaranteed 20% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>profits.</b> Instead, Poole decided to scrap the segment and re-shoot with Fisk and Donovan. The resulting footage was so good that Poole decided to use Donovan for the second segment as well, entitled Poolside, and construct the loose storyline around him. The three segments were filmed on a budget of $8,000 over three successive weekends in August 1971 in the gay resort area of Cherry Grove, New York, on Fire Island.|$|E
5|$|The two {{companies}} attempted {{to reach a}} new agreement for ten months before it fell through in January 2004.

More importantly, as part of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their old agreement, including The Incredibles (2004) and Cars (2006).
