The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that in this business, you're <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> other fellow thinks you are.

[...] Many soft signs have norm-referenced criteria, {{while others are}} determined through clinical judgment.

The Edge staff said that [...] "Stealth games are <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> flexibility of their encounters, and in that regard Black Flag is the most generous Assassin's Creed game to date." [...] However, some also criticized the stealth for being frustrating, due to its clunky and poorly defined controls. Reviewers noted that fighting as Edward was similar to previous games, with some criticizing it for being monotonous, too easy, and lacking nuance. However, it was also praised for being [...] "an effective and violent power trip," [...] and for being [...] "fluid and lively." [...] Some also complained about the enemy A.I. for lacking intelligence. The simplified crafting system was praised for improving over Assassin's Creed IIIs, with reviewers noting it took inspiration from Far Cry 3.|$|E
