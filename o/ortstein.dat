40|$|Spodosol soil of Typic Placorthod {{sub-group}} of East Barito District {{is one of}} {{the problem}} soils with the presence of hardpan layer, low fertility, low water holding capacity, acid reaction and it is not suitable for oil palm cultivation without any properly specific management of land preparation and implemented best agronomic practices. A study was carried out to evaluate the soil characteristic of big hole (A profile) and non big hole (B profile) system and comparative oil palm productivity among two planting systems. This study was conducted in Spodosol soil at oil palm plantation (coordinate X = 0281843 and Y = 9764116), East Barito District, Central Kalimantan Province on February 2014, by surveying of placic and <b>ortstein</b> depth and observing soil texture and chemical properties of 2 (two) oil palm 2 ̆ 7 s soil profiles that have been planted in five years. Big hole system of commercial oil palm field planting on Spodosol soil area was designed for the specific purpose of minimizing potential of negative effect of shallow effective planting depth for oil palms growing due to hardpan layer (placic and <b>ortstein)</b> presence as deep as 0. 25 - 0. 50 m. The big hole system is a planting hole type which was vertical-sided with 2. 00 m x 1. 50 m on top and bottom side and 3. 00 m depth meanwhile the 2 : 1 drain was vertical-sided also with 1. 50 m depth and 300 m length. Oil palm production was recorded from year of 2012 up to 2014. Results indicated that the fractions both big hole profile (A profile) and non big hole profile (B profile) were dominated by sands ranged from 60...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Horizons {{with varying}} degrees of {{cementation}} are a common feature of the soils from the coastal tablelands of Northeastern Brazil. In most cases, these horizons are represented by the following subsurface horizons: fragipan, duripan, <b>ortstein,</b> and placic. The aims of this study were to analyze differences regarding the development and the degree of expression of cementation in soils from the coastal tablelands of Northeastern Brazil: Planossolo Háplico (p-SX), Espodossolo Humilúvico (p-EK), Espodossolo Ferrihumilúvico (p-ESK), and Argissolo Acinzentado (p-PAC) pedons. The pedons studied displayed features related to drainage impediments. The cemented horizons from p-SX and p-EK had the same designation (Btgm), displaying a duric character that coincided with gleization features and are under podzolized horizons. In the p-ESK, the podzolization process is of such magnitude that it leads to the cementation of its own spodic horizons, which were both of the <b>ortstein</b> type (Bhsx and Bsm). In the p-PAC cementation is observed in two placic horizons and in the Btx/Bt horizon, {{as well as in the}} upper parts of the Bt/Btx horizon. Analysis of the micrographies from the cemented horizons showed predominance of a low porosity matrix. Such porosity is relatively greater in the horizons of &# 8220;x&# 8221; subscript than in the horizons with duric character. The Fe segregation lines were notable in the cemented horizons from p-EK and p-PAC, which corroborates the presence of placic horizons in such pedons. The preponderance of kaolinite in the clay fraction was widely verified in all the cemented horizons analyzed. Water immersion tests were the criteria adopted to define the duric character of the Btgm horizons from p-SX and p-EK, and in the Bsm horizon from the p-ESK. These tests were also used to confirm field morphology. In most cases, the maximum values of Fe, Al, and Si, determined by different extractions, occurred in positions overlaying the cemented horizons, whether they were spodic or not. The extracts of the aqueous solution displayed a noticeable accumulation of Si in the cemented horizons, except in the p-PAC. The presence of argillans in all cemented horizons allows them to be defined as illuvial, with the exception of the placic horizons, regardless of the presence of podzolization processes. The cemented horizons were preponderantly apedal, with a matrix of little porosity. The Fe, Al, and Si contents extracted by acid ammonium oxalate were effective at highlighting the influence of compounds with a low degree of crystallinity in the morphology of cemented horizons...|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} {{involved in}} Spodosol (Podzol) formation are still being debated. The pedogenic processes in a Spodosol, 10, 700 years-old, at Sotkamo that has been cultivated for about 50 years were studied by characterizing the morphology and analyzing the major chemical properties, texture and mineralogy. Before cultivation, organic acids produced by decomposition of organic matter from pine litter in O and A horizons had weathered primary minerals in A and E horizons releasing Al and Fe. Percolating waters moved the organo-metallic complexes from A and E horizons to Bhsm and Bs horizons where the complexes coated and bridged sand grains eventually forming cemented <b>ortstein.</b> Because of the high biotite content of the parent material, the index of accumulation of Fe and Al in the Bhsm horizon (Al + 0. 5 Fe = 4. 1 %) was the highest reported in Spodosols of Finland. The data support the theory of downward movement of Al and Fe as organo-metallic complexes with formation of some ferrihydrite but little or no formation of imogolite type materials. Little, if any, podzolization has likely occurred since the initiation of cultivation because, after agricultural liming and consequent increase of pH in the Ap horizon, organic compounds are likely to chelate Ca and Mg rather than Al and Fe. ...|$|E
40|$|In Podzols, {{organic matter}} (OM) is {{stabilized}} mainly by interaction with minerals, {{as a direct}} consequence of pedogenic processes. Metal-organic associations strongly affect OM surface features, particularly microporosity. Cemented <b>ortstein</b> horizons (CM) may form during podzolization, accompanied by a spatial arrangement of OM on mineral surfaces, which differs from that in non-cemented horizons (N-CM). To investigate the metal-organic associations and their changes during pedogenesis, we selected both N-CM and CM podzolic horizons, isolated NaClO-resistant OM and compared the specific surface area (SSA) before and after OM oxidation. The SSA was assessed by using N- 2, to detect the pores in the range of micropores (< 2 nm) and mesopores (2 - 50 nm), and CO 2, to measure a smaller microporosity (< 0. 5 nm), which is not accessible to N- 2. Only the N-CM samples showed the typical increase in N- 2 -SSA after the removal of labile OM, while a decrease was found in all CM horizons. The CO 2 -SSA revealed a large number of small micropores characterizing OM, both before and after oxidation. The smallest micropore classes (< 0. 5 nm) were, however, more abundant in NaClO-resistant OM, which had therefore a larger number of N- 2 -inaccessible surfaces than the labile pool. The N- 2 -SSA data thus indicated a more homogeneous coverage of mineral surfaces by stabilized OM in CM samples. Because of the abundance of small micropores, OM in these podzolic B horizons had extremely large CO 2 -SSA values (about 800 m(2) g(- 1)), with sharp differences between the NaClO-labile OM (290 - 380 m(2) g(- 1)) and the NaClO-stabilized pool (1380 - 1860 m(2) g(- 1)), thus indicating very reactive illuvial organic materials...|$|E
40|$|Drastic {{reductions}} in NO 3 - leaching {{have been observed}} after harvesting of mature red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) stands. Our objective was to examine whether these reduction were linked to changes in soil N dynamics. Adjacent alder and Douglas fir [Pseudotsuga menziessii (Mirbel.) Franco] stands on young glacial soils (Alderwood; a loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic, <b>ortstein</b> Aquic Haplorthod) in western Washington were harvested and replanted with either alder or Douglas fir seedlings; reference plots were established in nearby undisturbed stands. Three years after site conversion, when NO 3 - leaching declined most drastically in the harvested alder plots, net N mineralization and net nitrification in the upper soil were determined seasonally by in situ incubation using the buried-bag technique. There were no significant increases in soil NH 4 -N during incubation, indicating that nitrification rates closely followed net N mineralization in all plots. In the N-poor soils of the harvested and uncut Douglas fir plots, nitrification was consistently 3 ̆c 2 3 ̆eµg N g– 1 per 30 d. In the N-rich alder reference plot, nitrification was highest in summer (52 µg N g– 1 per 30 d), lowest in winter (4 µg N g– 1), and intermediate in spring (20 µg N g– 1). Seasonal fluctuations in nitrification diminished in the harvested alder plots. Nitrification rates were significantly lower than in the uncut alder plot in summer only (5 – 9 µg N g– 1 per 30 d), but this difference was insufficient {{to account for the}} lower NO 3 - leaching rates in the conversion plots. Soils in the harvested plots were drier and experienced greater temperature extremes, but these changes did not correlate well with the variability in N-mineralization rates between uncut and harvested alder plots. Nitrification was positively correlated to soil temperature in the uncut alder plot only. The establishment of red alder seedlings did not appear to have influenced the N dynamics in either N-poor or N-rich soils...|$|E
40|$|Poster presentado en EGU General Assembly 2014, held 27 April - 2 May, 2014 in Vienna, AustriaSoil is {{the largest}} carbon {{reservoir}} of terrestrial ecosystems, this reservoir is not inert, but it is constantly in a dynamic phase of accumulation an depletion. After the addition, in the soil, of organic residues of different origin and nature, two processes can occur in charge of SOM (Soil Organic Matter) during the pedogenesis: mineralization and humification. The accumulation of SOM in soil {{is controlled by the}} balance between carbon inputs and losses through mineralization and/or leaching. In particular the humification process leads to the formation of organic compounds (in some cases even complex organo-mineral) chemically stable able to distribute itself in the soil second rules of site-specific pedogenesis. The transport process along the profile can take very different forms which may extend in the formation of Bh horizons of accumulation in depth also strongly cemented (so-called <b>ortstein).</b> The transport process along the profile occurs for the occurrence of certain conditions such as deposition of high amounts of organic residues {{on the top of the}} profile, high porosity of the soil for the presence of coarse solid fractions (coarse sands or skeleton) that determinate a strong infiltrating capacity of the circulating waters, extreme temperatures can slow or stop the process of mineralization and/or humification in one intermediate step of the degradation process releasing organic metabolites with high or medium solubility and high loads of percolating water related to intense rainfall. The nature of the forest cover influence the quantity and quality of the organic materials deposited with marked differences between coniferous and deciduous especially in relation to resistance to degradation and production of intermediate metabolites. Two soils from Campania region located in Monte Santa Croce (Caserta, Italy) with andic properties, different forest cover (pine and chestnut) and that meets the requirements of the place and pedological formation suitable for the formation and accumulation of SOM in depth (Bh horizon) were studied. The content of the different soil C fractions was assessed for each soil profile and included: total extractable C, (TEC), total organic C (TOC), total extractable lipds (TEL), humified C (humic and fulvic acids, HA & FA) and non humic C (NHC), lignin C, cellulose C. Also were calculated parameters of humification, humification degree (DH), humification rate (HR), total level of humification (HU) and humification index (HI). The results are discussed in terms of how soil use and vegetation influences the identified C pools, and the humification indexes. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
