5|$|The Philippine Football Association {{partnered with}} San Miguel Brewery to seek foreign {{assistance}} in developing football in the country. In the early sixties, British coaches Alan Rogers and Brian Birch {{were brought in}} and funded by San Miguel to train referees, coaches and players in the country. Due to lack of facilities, the two coaches organized a five-a-side football competition which was played in a field with the same size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>basketball</b> court. The two were later relieved and Danny McClellan and Graham Adams were tasked train national and youth players.|$|E
5|$|From 1999 to 2001 a 40-year-old {{homemaker}} named Debbie Swenson perpetrated a ruse {{under the}} identity Kaycee Nicole, a 19-year-old woman in Kansas who shared {{the details of}} her battles with leukemia online. The Guardian newspaper reported that millions of Internet users read the fictional blog, as well as Swenson's own blog, in which she posed as Kaycee Nicole's mother, describing the trials of living with an intelligent and optimistic daughter who was dying. On May 16, 2001, Kaycee Nicole's death of an aneurysm was announced, shocking her readers and causing them intense grief. Soon however, Swenson caused skepticism in online communities. Although many cards and gifts had been previously sent, she refused to accept more. People began to learn that no one named Kaycee Nicole lived in Kansas, had been enrolled in schools, or admitted to local hospitals, and no obituary had been printed. The photo representing the girl was found to be that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>basketball</b> player from Gracemont, Oklahoma, who was alive. After repeated questioning, Swenson posted that she had woven the stories of three cancer patients to create the character of Kaycee Nicole, who had never existed.|$|E

25|$|The {{buoyant force}} is usually small {{compared}} to the drag and Magnus forces and can often be neglected. However, in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>basketball,</b> the buoyant force can amount to about 1.5% of the ball's weight. Since buoyancy is directed upwards, it will act to increase the range and height of the ball.|$|E
25|$|A popular {{demonstration}} {{involves the}} bounce of multiple stacked balls. If {{a tennis ball}} is stacked on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>basketball,</b> {{and the two of}} them are dropped at the same time, the tennis ball will bounce much higher than it would have if dropped on its own, even exceeding its original release height. The result is surprising as it apparently violates conservation of energy. However, upon closer inspection, the basketball does not bounce as high as it would have if the tennis ball had not been on top of it, and transferred some of its energy into the tennis ball, propelling it to a greater height.|$|E
500|$|Edge {{compared}} {{the game to}} a more pleasurable version of [...] final scene. The magazine also {{compared the}} feeling of prioritization as a swarm of enemies appear to the feeling of clutter when stacking Tetris blocks haphazardly. Edge also called the red screen and sound effect that flashes upon the player's death [...] "brash and lo-fi and unexpectedly poignant", for which they noted Rogers's interest in noise rock and credited the effect as [...] "a beguiling personal signature". Alternatively, Paste Joe Bernardi thought the sound did not accomplish what it intended. Joseph Leray of TouchArcade noticed how the guitar sound in Gears of War was reaffirming but the opposite in Ziggurat. Edge noted that nuances such as gravity's influence on the arc of uncharged shots make Ziggurat more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>basketball</b> or golf-like sport skill than a [...] "2D Halo". Edge awarded the game a 9 of 10, adding that it [...] "prized immediacy" [...] {{in a manner that}} matched the iOS platform.|$|E

500|$|The Rockets' current logos and uniforms were {{introduced}} in the 2003–04 season, created by New York-based agency Alfafa Studio in association with Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka. The logo is a stylized 'R' {{in the shape of}} a rocket during takeoff, surrounded by a red orbit streak that can be interpreted as the central circle <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>basketball</b> court. Said [...] "R" [...] inspired the team's new custom typeface, designed so that every single digit could be read well from a distance, whether in the arena or on television. Red once again became the dominant color, with silver and black as secondary. In 2009, the Rockets invoked the championship years with an alternate red uniform, featuring gold numbers and side stripes. The Rockets had two sleeved alternate jerseys for the 2015–16 season, an alternate silver-colored uniform whose design referenced the design of NASA's Gemini-Titan rocket, and a red and gold jersey featuring the nickname [...] "Clutch City". For the 2016–17 season, the Rockets began to wear a black alternate uniform.|$|E

[...] The impact is believed to have damaged one comparatively large reinforced carbon-carbon panel on {{the leading edge of the}} left wing, believed to be about the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>basketball</b> which then allowed super-heated gas to enter the wing superstructure several days later during re-entry. [...] This resulted in the destruction of Columbia and the loss of its crew.

2500|$|High-level waste (HLW) is {{produced}} by nuclear reactors. The exact definition of HLW differs internationally. After a nuclear fuel rod serves one fuel cycle and {{is removed from the}} core, it is considered HLW. Fuel rods contain fission products and transuranic elements generated in the reactor core. Spent fuel is highly radioactive and often hot. HLW accounts for over 95 percent of the total radioactivity produced in the process of nuclear electricity generation. The amount of HLW worldwide is currently increasing by about 12,000 metric tons every year, which is the equivalent to about 100 double-decker buses or a two-story structure with a footprint the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>basketball</b> court. A 1000-MW nuclear power plant produces about 27 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel (unreprocessed) every year. [...] In 2010, there was very roughly estimated to be stored some 250,000 tons of nuclear HLW, that does not include amounts that have escaped into the environment from accidents or tests. [...] Japan estimated to hold 17,000 tons of HLW in storage in 2015. [...] HLW have been shipped to other countries to be stored or reprocessed, and in some cases, shipped back as active fuel.|$|E
