5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceived</b> {{threat from}} Chinese {{submarines}} while in transit and from North Vietnamese swimmers with limpet mines while in harbour, Sydney was always escorted {{by at least}} one other RAN vessel. While in harbour, boats from Sydney and her escort would patrol around the troopship, while divers regularly inspected the hull, propellers, and anchor chain for explosives. On seven voyages, Sydney carried four Westland Wessex helicopters for anti-submarine surveillance, sourced from 725 or 817 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|In April 1849, the Ipswich Express and Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper {{reported}} on a case in a village near to Rayleigh in which a girl had been afflicted with fits. Her family believed that a witch was to blame, with Murrell being called in to free her <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceived</b> bewitchment. He commissioned the local blacksmith to create an iron witch bottle, into which he placed toe-nail clippings and locks of hair belonging to the putative victim. The bottle was then placed into the hearth and heated until it exploded, with this supposedly defeating the witch's machinations.|$|E
5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceived</b> object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of}} the eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E

50|$|To summarize, <b>the</b> color <b>of</b> {{an object}} {{is a complex}} result of its surface properties, its {{transmission}} properties, and its emission properties, all of which contribute to <b>the</b> mix <b>of</b> wavelengths in <b>the</b> light leaving <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object. <b>The</b> <b>perceived</b> color is then further conditioned by <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ambient illumination, and by <b>the</b> color properties <b>of</b> other objects nearby, and via other characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceiving</b> eye and brain.|$|R

Although a box office hit, it received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its atmosphere and tension, and others criticizing its script and characters.

The main results were summarized as follows: (1) <b>The</b> low group <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general <b>perceived</b> control showed higher degree of unsatisfaction for past, present, and future than the high group.
