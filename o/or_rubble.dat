5|$|Jupiter-family comets and long-period comets {{appear to}} follow very {{different}} fading laws. The JFCs are active {{over a lifetime}} of about 10,000 years or ~1,000 orbits whereas long-period comets fade much faster. Only 10% of the long-period comets survive more than 50 passages to small perihelion and only 1% of them survive more than 2,000 passages. Eventually most of the volatile material contained in a comet nucleus evaporates, and the comet becomes a small, dark, inert lump of rock <b>or</b> <b>rubble</b> that can resemble an asteroid. Some asteroids in elliptical orbits are now identified as extinct comets. Roughly six percent of the near-Earth asteroids {{are thought to be}} extinct comet nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth-century {{interiors}} could {{often be}} lavish and eclectic. The origins of this style were in Scott's Abbotsford, where the author began {{the incorporation of}} actual old architectural fragments and pieces of furniture on a lavish scale (the effective beginning of 'antique' collecting in Scotland). He also initiated the treatment of new surfaces so as to resemble old ones, with new wood darkened to resemble old oak. The Adam solution of a castellated exterior with a neo-classical interior was abandoned and in Baronial revival houses this change was extended to create a synthesised Victorian style that combined elements of the Renaissance, such as plastered <b>or</b> <b>rubble</b> walls, unpainted stone fireplaces and pitch pine timberwork, with seventeenth-century style plaster ceilings. To this were added symbols of landed power and national affiliation, including displays of tartan, weaponry and stuffed animals' heads. Integrated into these traditional materials and styles were modern fittings such as sprung upholstery, gaslighting and water-closets.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the most}} highly skilled Chacoans shaped and set stone; others carried {{supplies}} and mixed mortar. The width of a given wall was determined by its place in a structure. The first story of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called core-and-veneer, but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically quite small, to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing is often called the core. In most walls, the core consisted of roughly shaped stone <b>or</b> <b>rubble</b> laid {{at the same time}} as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and the core packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the width of the wall itself, not from the strength of the core.|$|E

25|$|Timber crib dams were erected {{of heavy}} timbers or dressed logs {{in the manner}} of a log house and the {{interior}} filled with earth <b>or</b> <b>rubble.</b> The heavy crib structure supported the dam's face and the weight of the water. Splash dams were timber crib dams used to help float logs downstream in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
25|$|A {{bulldozer}} is a crawler or {{a continuous}} tracked tractor, {{equipped with a}} substantial metal plate or blade, used to push large quantities of soil, sand, <b>or</b> <b>rubble</b> during construction work. In 1923, a farmer named James Cummings and a draftsman named J. Earl McLeod co-invented and created the first designs. A replica is {{on display at the}} city park in Morrowville, Kansas where the two built the first bulldozer.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from their}} immense size, Chinese walls were also {{structurally}} {{different from the}} ones built in medieval Europe. Whereas European walls were {{for the most part}} constructed of stone with gravel <b>or</b> <b>rubble</b> filling and limestone mortar, Chinese walls had tamped earthen cores which absorbed the energy of artillery shots. Walls were built using constructed wooden frameworks which were then filled with layers of earth tamped down to a highly compact state, and once that was completed the frameworks were removed for use in the next wall section. Starting from the Song dynasty these walls were improved with an outer layer of bricks or stone to prevent erosion, and during the Ming, earthworks were interspersed with stone and rubble. Most Chinese walls were also sloped rather than vertical to better deflect projectile energy.|$|E

50|$|The {{southern}} stargazers are benthic marine {{fish that}} are reef-associated. They live {{most of their}} lives inshore. Stargazers can be found at depths of 230 feet in areas that have sandy, silty, <b>or</b> soft <b>rubble</b> bottoms.|$|R
40|$|Ice surface {{characterization}} {{data were}} recorded during March 1987 in the Labrador Sea marginal ice zone, {{at the onset}} of spring melt. Measured data are used as input parameters in a simple scattering model to simulate the effects of temporal variations in material properties upon C-band scattering signatures. Snow moisture and surface roughness have a significant effect upon sigma(0) HH and large differences are predicted between undeformed floe surfaces and deformed <b>or</b> <b>rubbled</b> ice areas. The model reproduces a calibrated synthetic-aperture-radar (SAR) -derived signature obtained during the experiment with a reasonable degree of certainty. Predictions also simulate a trend observed in SAR images of increasing backscatter contrast between deformed and undeformed ice over period of surface warming...|$|R

500|$|The blacknose shark (Carcharhinus acronotus) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, {{belonging}} to the family Carcharhinidae, common in the tropical and subtropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean. This species generally inhabits coastal seagrass, sand, <b>or</b> <b>rubble</b> habitats, with adults preferring deeper water than juveniles. A small shark typically measuring [...] long, the blacknose has a typical streamlined [...] "requiem shark" [...] shape with a long, rounded snout, large eyes, and a small first dorsal fin. Its common name comes from a characteristic black blotch {{on the tip of}} its snout, though this may be indistinct in older individuals.|$|E
2500|$|The shallow mainshock {{occurred}} in a highly populated area [...] south of Sana'a. The primary event and its aftershocks created a zone of destruction between Ma'bar and Dhamar, where older villages were heavily damaged, with adobe <b>or</b> <b>rubble</b> masonry homes suffering the most. Homes and villages that were adjacent to steep slopes or cliffs were susceptible to rockfalls and landslides, but damage was much less pronounced away from the epicentral area, and modern city centers with properly engineered structures were only slightly affected.|$|E

2500|$|The {{extension}} of North Capitol Street led to significant changes at Prospect Hill Cemetery. [...] A new retaining wall {{topped by a}} wrought iron fence and new main gate were constructed on North Capitol Street. Several sets of remains had to be reinterred to accommodate the new construction. Changes in the 1910s to Lincoln Road NE required {{the construction of a}} new wall and fence on the east side of the cemetery. Most of the original walls were torn down around 1917, and a new wall constructed. Portions of the wall consisted of ashlar granite blocks of various shades and colors, both coursed and randomly set. Other portions consisted of rusticated <b>or</b> <b>rubble</b> rock of various types (such as granite, greenschist, mica-schist, and other rock). The walls were topped with wrought iron fencing and cast iron finials.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{began on}} Black Eagle Dam in 1890. GFWPTC {{engineers}} designed a rock-and-timber crib weir overflow dam, in which dressed and shaped heavy timbers formed a closed structure filled with rock <b>or</b> <b>rubble.</b> The dam {{was not a}} large one. The goal was to merely create a pond behind the dam, which would create enough water pressure (or [...] "head") to turn turbines and generate electricity. The dam was built {{at a cost of}} about $515,000 (roughly $12,335,000 in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars) on the upstream brink of the falls (to create the deepest reservoir possible). Construction bids were opened on February 5, 1890, with the request for bids specifying that all work must be finished by December 1, 1890. All the bids were rejected, and mechanical engineer Maurice Parker was employed to design and construct the dam. Coffer dams were constructed in April 1890 to divert the river from the work areas. Work on the dam itself began on April 15. A shanty town named [...] "River Bank" [...] was constructed just upstream of the construction site on the north bank for the river to house the Croat, Scandinavian, Slovak, and Welsh workers who helped construct the dam. (Most of these workers helped found the town of Black Eagle, and earthen foundations for the shanty town can still be seen.) The red sandstone riverbed was leveled as much as possible, and large timbers bolted and cemented (perpendicular to the river's flow) to the rock. Each timber was [...] from the next one downstream, and six cribs were built to form a dam [...] deep at its base. The dam's downstream face had a pitch of 1.05:1. From the crest of the dam, a face (at a pitch of 1:08:1) extended for about [...] before it became vertical. A [...] masonry wall was built on the south end of the dam to form the foundation of and to protect the powerhouse, and the construction worked inward from either end of the dam. Every [...] across the face of the dam, a [...] floodwater spillway made of concrete was created (for a total of eight spillways). Flashboards [...] in height were installed along the entire top of the dam to add water storage capacity. The dam was [...] high and [...] long.|$|E
