40|$|A recent {{development}} in wireless communications is Cognitive Radio (CR) technology, an innovative design approach {{which allows the}} realization of optimal allocation of the scarce radio resources such as the spectrum. Successful resource allocation in CR systems has to overcome the uncertainty of spectrum bands availability {{as well as the}} chaotic wireless propagation environment. Previously, most research in resource allocation in CRs has mainly concentrated on the spectrum opportunity discovery aspect while the robust QoS performance problem has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we jointly consider the power control and spectrum band discovery problems under uncertain CR <b>operative</b> <b>environments.</b> This problem setting is a direct analogy of the portfolio optimization (PO) concept. In PO, once the variance of return is known, then an investor can use the information to find a wealth allocation strategy so as to minimize the investment risk. Similarly, in uncertain CR scenarios, once the variance of a QoS parameter (e. g., throughput) is known, then a power allocation strategy can be obtained leading to reliable communication. The resulting power strategy also marks out the subbands to be used - essentially achieving soft spectrum sensing. In this work, we shall use the concept of portfolio optimization to jointly achieve power control and subband allocation over uncertain CR environments. The limitations of the approaches are investigated through the sensitivity analysis of the solutions obtained. A raw data processing approach will also be given leading to an alternative algorithm for stable data processing. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approaches. © 2009 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

Typically, enhanced growth rates, reproduction and survivorship are observed in response to increased resource availability {{in a variety of}} desert plants and short‐lived animals. We examined the thermal ecology and reproduction of US federally threatened Mojave desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii), long‐lived and large‐bodied ectotherms, at opposite ends of a 250 ‐m elevation‐related rainfall cline within Ivanpah Valley in the eastern Mojave Desert, California, USA. Biophysical <b>operative</b> <b>environments</b> in both the upper‐elevation, “Cima,” and the lower‐elevation, “Pumphouse,” plots corresponded with daily and seasonal patterns of incident solar radiation. Cima received 22 % more rainfall and contained greater perennial vegetative cover, which conferred 5 °C‐cooler daytime shaded temperatures. In a monitored average rainfall year, Cima tortoises had longer potential activity periods by up to several hours and greater ephemeral forage. Enhanced resource availability in Cima was associated with larger‐bodied females producing larger eggs, while still producing the same number of eggs as Pumphouse females. However, reproductive success was lower in Cima because 90 % of eggs were depredated versus 11 % in Pumphouse, indicating that predatory interactions produced counter‐gradient variation in reproductive success across the rainfall cline. Land‐use impacts on deserts (e. g. solar energy generation) are increasing rapidly, and conservation strategies designed to protect and recover threatened desert inhabitants, such as desert tortoises, should incorporate these strong ecosystem‐level responses to regional resource variation in assessments of habitat for prospective development and mitigation efforts...|$|R

Patient risk factors and surgical, anaesthetic and nursing skill will always be fundamental, but more subtle factors may be of particular importance when aiming for very high levels of performance. To put it crudely, good surgical skills coupled with basic team performance and basic equipment may enable a surgeon to achieve a 90 % success rate in a high-risk operation. However, refinements in surgical skill may be a relatively small element in the drive to reduce mortality from 10 % to 1 %. Optimizing the pre- and postoperative care, the surgical environment, attention to ergonomics and equipment design, understanding the subtleties of decision making in a dynamic environment, enhancing communication and team performance may be more important than skill when reaching for truly high performance. Looking to the future, and the wider issues of patient safety, we believe that an open and comprehensive examination of the quality of care through out the patient-hospital interface and the performance of surgical teams and <b>operative</b> <b>environment</b> will be a powerful stimulus to safety culture and improvements in the wider healthcare system. © The Royal Society of Medicine Press Ltd 2005...|$|E

Reoperation for bleeding is an event associated with considerable morbidity risk. Hence, our primary objective was {{to develop and implement}} a formal operative checklist to reduce technical reasons for postoperative bleeding. MethodsFrom January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012, 5812 cardiac surgical procedures were performed at Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, OH). A multidisciplinary team developed a simple, easy-to-perform hemostasis checklist based on the most common sites of bleeding. An extensive educational in-service was performed before limited, then universal, checklist implementation. Geometric charts were used to track the number of cases between consecutive reoperations for bleeding. We compared these before (phase 0) and after the first limited implementation phase (phase 1) and the universal implementation phase (phase 2) of the checklist. ResultsThe average number of cases between consecutive reoperations for bleeding increased from 32 in phase 0 to 53 in both phase 1 (P = . 002) and phase 2 (P = . 01).
