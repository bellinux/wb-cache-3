40|$|The {{worst-case}} {{complexity of}} cut elimination in sequent calculi for first order based logics is investigated {{in terms of}} the increase in logical depth of the deduction. It is shown that given a calculus satisfying a general collection of sufficient conditions for cut elimination and given a deduction with cuts, there exists a cut free deduction with a logical depth, in the worst case, hyper-exponentially greater than the logical depth of the <b>original</b> <b>deduction.</b> Moreover an interesting relation, {{as far as we know}} not yet reported in the literature, between this complexity and the greatest cut length of a pair of introduction rules in the calculus for a constructor, is established. By the cut length of a pair of introduction rules of a constructor it is meant the minimal length of a cut sequence for that pair, where a cut sequence for a pair of introduction rules is a sequence formed by premises of that rules, without contexts, that when combined in a deduction using a generic cut rule, respecting the sequence order, lead to the empty sequent. The non-elementary bound in the worst case complexity of the cut eliminatio...|$|E

In particular, some expansions of unified Voigt functions are given in terms of the <b>original</b> functions.

50|$|Even if Metamath is {{used for}} {{mathematical}} proof checking, its algorithm is so general we can extend the field of its usage. In fact Metamath could be used with every sort of formal system: the checking of a computer program could be considered (even if Metamath's low level would make it difficult); it could possibly even be a syntactic checker for a natural language (same remark). Because Metamath has a very generic concept of what a proof is (namely a tree of formulas connected by inference rules) and no specific logic {{is embedded in the}} software, Metamath can be used with species of logic as different as Hilbert-style logics or sequents-based logics or even with lambda calculus. In contrast, it is largely incompatible with logical systems which use other things rather than formulas and inference rules. The <b>original</b> natural <b>deduction</b> system (due to Gerhard Gentzen), which uses an extra stack, {{is an example of a}} system that cannot be implemented with Metamath. In the case of natural deduction however it is possible to append the stack to the formulas (transforming the natural deduction formulas into a sort of sequent) so that Metamath's requirements are met.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{language}} understanding {{has been}} a persistent challenge to researchers in various computer science fields, {{in a number of}} applications ranging from user support systems to entertainment and online teaching. A long term goal of the Artificial Intelligence field is to implement mechanisms that enable computers to emulate human dialogue. The recently developed ALICEbots, virtual agents with underlying AIML scripts, by A. L. I. C. E. foundation, use AIML scripts - a subset of XML - as the underlying pattern database for question answering. Their goal is to enable pattern-based, stimulus-response knowledge content to be served, received and processed over the Web, or offline, in the manner similar to HTML and XML. In this thesis, we describe a system that converts the AIML scripts to Prolog clauses and reuses them as part of a knowledge processor. The inference mechanism developed in this thesis is able to successfully match the input pattern with our clauses database even if words are missing. We also emulate the pattern deduction algorithm of the <b>original</b> logic <b>deduction</b> mechanism. Our rules, compatible with Semantic Web standards, bring structure to the meaningful content of Web pages and support interactive content retrieval using natural language...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{deduction}} {{is known}} as an optimization technique in logic programming. In the context of abductive logic programming, however, we present in this paper that normal partial deduction does not preserve explanations for abductive reasoning. Then we provide an alternative method of partial deduction, called abductive partial deduction, which is shown to preserve the meanings of abductive logic programs. A method of partial abduction is also introduced as an optimization for abductive reasoning in logic programs. 1 Introduction Partial deduction [Kom 92] is an optimization technique in logic programming, which performs deduction {{on a part of}} a program while retaining the meaning of the <b>original</b> program. Partial <b>deduction</b> is used in various extensions of logic programming, and is known to preserve the semantics of normal logic programs [TS 84, LS 91, Seki 91, Seki 93] and disjunctive logic programs [SS 94, BD 94]. Abductive logic programming [KKT 92] is one of the extensions of logic progra [...] ...|$|R
