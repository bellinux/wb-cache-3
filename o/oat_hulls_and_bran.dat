40|$|Six {{dietary fiber}} sources, wheat bran, corn bran, soy <b>bran,</b> <b>oat</b> <b>hulls,</b> rice <b>bran,</b> <b>and</b> {{cellulose}} were examined {{with regard to}} their abilities to bind copper, zinc, and iron. Their chemical composition, some of their physical properties, and their in vivo action on mineral status in tissues of chicks were investigated. Also, a comparison of the physicochemical properties of neutral detergent treated (NDF) and pepsin-pancreatin treated (EIR) residues was made. The release of endogenous copper, zinc, and iron from the fiber sources was pH dependent. Greater amounts of minerals were released into solution at pH 0. 65 than into solution at pH 6. 8. After a sequential treatment of pH 0. 65 solution, neutralization, then pH 6. 8 buffer, the mineral levels in the residues were similar to those remaining in the residues after the near neutral treatment. This indicated that the minerals were rebound after the pH of the solution was raised from acidic to near neutral. The amount of zinc in the residues from the sequential treatment correlated positively to protein and phytic acid contents and negatively to NDF and EIR contents. Neither copper nor iron showed any significant correlations. Hydrogen ion buffering capacities were determined for three preparations of the six fiber sources: (1) untreated, original material; (2) NDF-treated; and (3) EIR-treated materials. The buffering capacities were expressed as functions of the slopes of titration curves, where the smaller the slope, the greater the buffering capacity. The treated preparations had lower buffering capacities than did the untreated preparation. The treatments reduced the amounts of digestible/soluble components, especially protein in the fiber sources. Protein content was strongly correlated to buffering capacity for the untreated and the EIR-treated preparations but not for the NDF-treated preparation. Wheat <b>bran,</b> soy <b>bran,</b> <b>oat</b> <b>hulls,</b> <b>and</b> cellulose were subjected to NDF and EIR treatments, and the residues were used as column material for cation exchange experiments. A factorial experiment was performed using fibers by treatments by three solutions. The solutions were copper alone, zinc alone, and copper-zinc in combination. Cation exchange capacities (CEC) and protein contents were also determined. The CEC values for the residues from the two treatments for wheat <b>bran</b> <b>and</b> cellulose were similar but were very different for the soy bran (EIR-treated CEC was higher than NDF-treated) <b>and</b> <b>oat</b> <b>hulls</b> (NDF much greater than EIR). More mmoles of copper were bound than zinc whether presented alone or in equimolar combination. Protein content correlated to mmoles mineral bound for only the NDF-treated residues and only when the minerals were presented singly. These in vitro experiments demonstrated the intrinsic differences of the fiber sources. One fiber source may be beneficial to nutritional status while another may be detrimental. The fiber isolation technique produced residues with different compositions and different physical properties. Future biochemical investigations of dietary fiber must acknowledge the possible divergence from physiological reality which results from the isolation methodology. The chick feeding study used diets which had the fiber sources added to be equivalent to the addition of 6 % dietary fiber (as NDF). At this level, all the fiber sources, except rice bran, resulted in adequate growth and adequate deposition of tissue minerals. The chicks on the rice bran diet had lowered feed intakes, significantly reduced growth and significantly lower tibia zinc, iron, and manganese levels. One factor in the rice bran diet, which may have influenced the status of the chicks, was its phytic acid content which was the highest of the fiber sources. This in vivo experiment again indicates the dissimilarity in effects of the dietary fiber sources...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that dietary fiber’s protective effect {{against the development}} of colon cancer, diverticular disease, and atherosclerosis {{may be due to}} the adsorption and/or dilution of intestinal sterols such as bile acids and neutral sterols and their bacterial metabolites by component(s) of fiber. Dietary fiber is made up of four major components-cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin. There is evidence that hemicellulose and pectin may induce an increase in fecal bile acid excretion in man which may be accompanied by a decrease in serum cholesterol. Natural fibers, such as rolled oats, alfalfa, guar gum, and Bengal gram have been shown to have hypocholesterolemic properties and alfalfa, wheat straw, and some other fibers bound considerable amounts of bile acids in vitro.

The purpose of the present work is to explore biomass gasification and in particular pyrolysis behavior of corn kernels, <b>oat</b> <b>hulls,</b> <b>and</b> paper sludge. For the materials, low temperature gasification behavior was studied. Here, tests were performed with pyrolysis temperatures from 400 - 800 °C, at 1 atm and a rapid heating rate.

40|$|This {{research}} project examined {{how to treat}} raw oat material for oat-based food products in order to sustain or increase the levels of phenolic compounds. The focus was mainly on the avenanthramides, which are potentially health beneficial bioactive components found exclusively in oats. A proposed enzymatic decrease in avenanthramide levels when non heat-treated milled oats are steeped in water was investigated. The decrease was strongly suggested {{to be caused by}} a polyphenol oxidase. Although the avenanthramides are only found in oats, the polyphenol oxidase enzyme that acted on avenanthramides was also found to be present in wheat, barley and rye. The effects of a highly controlled steeping and germination process on levels of phenolic compounds and related enzyme activities in oats were studied. The process resulted in increased levels of avenanthramides and some unknown compounds to various extents depending on cultivar. This increase was suggested to be partly due to enzymatically catalysed de novo biosynthesis. Whether germination was the reason behind elevated levels of avenanthramides in one harvest year compared with another, in the same oat genotypes, were investigated. The differences in avenanthramide levels between the two years could not be explained by preharvest sprouting of the oat grains in the field. The content and location of tricin was studied in various oat samples. Tricin was found to be localised to <b>oat</b> <b>hulls</b> <b>and</b> was detected and quantified in a minority of all oat samples analysed. The overall conclusion was that germination of oats can be a good method to sustain or increase avenanthramides and other potentially health beneficial phenolic compounds. It is important to inactivate the polyphenol oxidase present in oats and other cereal grain ingredients included in oat-based food products, since it may otherwise decrease the levels of avenanthramides in these products. <b>Oat</b> <b>hulls</b> may be a good source of tricin if high-tricin cultivars are chosen...|$|R

From a total of eight bacterial strains tested (three strains of Bacteroides succinogenes, four strains of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and one strain of Ruminococcus albus), only three strains of ruminococci were able to utilize the hemicelluloses for growth. Hemicellulose fermentation mixtures were analyzed for total pentose, residual hemicellulose (pentose precipitated in 80 % ethyl alcohol), and ethyl alcohol-soluble pentose. The three strains of ruminococci were able to partially utilize the different hemicelluloses as energy sources, as determined by total pentose loss, and they were capable of almost complete degradation of the original hemicellulose from an ethyl alcohol-insoluble to ethyl alcohol-soluble form. The extent of both degradation {{and utilization}} varied markedly between the three strains and different substrates.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} processing and properties of PNCs using a polyfurfural alcohol (PFA) matrix. The precursor for PFA, furfuryl alcohol (FA) is sourced from feedstocks rich in hemicellulose, such as corn cobs, <b>oat</b> <b>hulls</b> <b>and</b> wood. To exploit FA as a polymerizable solvent, cellulose whiskers (CW) and montmorillonite clay (MMT) {{were used as}} the nanoparticle phase. Results from PNC processing show that CW and MMT can be dispersed in the PFA matrix by means of insitu polymerization, {{without the use of}} surfactants or dilution in solvents. Both CW and MMT nanoparticles catalyze the polymerization of furfuryl alcohol (FA). Moreover, the insitu intercalative polymerization of FA in the interlayer galleries of MMT leads to the complete exfoliation of the MMT in the PFA matrix. CW and MMT both function as effective matrix modifiers, increasing the thermal stability of PFA nanocomposites compared to pure PFA polymer. The increased thermal stability is seen as significant increases in the onset of degradation and in residual weight at high temperature. This research also explored the surface functionalization of Cu, Ni and Pt substrates by self-assembly of a range of difunctional linker molecules. Characterization by XPS and PM-IRRAS indicate that diisocyanides and dicarboxylic acids both form chemically "sticky" surfaces after self-assembly on Cu and Ni. Sticky surfaces may provide a means of increasing nanoparticle dispersion in metal nanocluster filled PNCs, by increasing their interaction with the matrix polymer. Another potential application for sticky surfaces on Cu is in the ongoing miniaturization of circuit boards.

40|$|Equilibrium {{moisture}} content is an importantphysicochemical property of hygroscopicmaterials, including rice. EMC data are necessaryfor the optimization of most postharvest operations. In drying processes, the EMC represents the limiting MC that rough rice can reach under a given drying air temperature and RH. The EMC also affects {{the rate of}} moisture transfer from rice kernels to the surrounding drying air, which subsequently affects head rice yield (Kunze, 1979; Chen et al., 1997). In an early investigation of rice sorption, Karon and Adams (1949) observed that there were differences in sorption behavior of rice fractions. The EMC of milled rice at 25 °C was {{higher than that of}} rough rice, <b>hulls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bran.</b> Juliano (1964) reported that at higher RHs waxy rice had higher EMCs than nonwaxy rices. He further observed that the EMC of rice was not correlated to the rice protein content. The hygroscopic behavior of rough rice has also been studied by Breese (1955) who showed that the desorption-adsorption hysteresis of rice was greater than one percentage point across the RH range of 20 to 80 %, but exceeded 1. 5 percentage points when RHs were between 50 to 70 %. Kachru and Matthes (1976) confirmed the existence of sorption hysteresis in rough rice. They showed that the hysteresis effect tended to disappear after the rice samples were subjected to three or four sorption cycles. A number of models have been developed to quantitatively describe the EMC of rice and other grai...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{were made}} of {{suitable}} methods of producing plastics from furfural and hydrolyzed cornstalks. It was found that hard, black plastics with a pleasing appearance, high impact strength, and satisfactory water resistance can be produced from a mixture of hydrolyzed cornstalks, furfural, aniline and lime. This material absorbed slightly more {{than one percent of}} water in twenty-four hours but it was not discolored, swollen or cracked from the immersion in water. It was estimated that the raw material costs of this plastic would be less than three cents a pound;It was found that hard, black plastics with a pleasing appearance, fairly high impact strength, and satisfactory resistance to water can be produced from a mixture of hydrolyzed <b>oat</b> <b>hulls,</b> furfural, aniline, <b>and</b> lime. This material absorbed more than one percent of water in twenty-four hours, but it was not discolored, swollen or cracked from the immersion in water. The method and extent of hydrolysis is important in determining the properties of the material made from the hydrolyzed hulls. It is believed that the hydrolysis could be carried out in such a manner that considerable quantities of furfural could be recovered from the <b>hulls</b> <b>and</b> still leave a residue suitable for the preparation of cheap plastics. It was estimated that the raw material costs of plastics from <b>oat</b> <b>hulls,</b> without recovery of furfural, would be slightly more than 3. 5 cents per pound;It was found that resins can be produced from combinations of furfural, lignin, and aniline or urea. These resins can be mixed with a suitable filler and molded under eat and pressure to hard, black, materials that have a pleasing appearance. It is believed that the optimum conditions for the preparation of such resins were not found in this study. The materials produced, however, did have moderate strength and satisfactory water resistance;It is believed that the plastics produced from hydrolyzed cornstalks, hydrolyzed <b>oat</b> <b>hulls,</b> or lignin had properties such that they could be produced to compete with some of the plastics now used commercially...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of dietary fiber on methanogenic diversity and community composition in the hindgut of indigenous Chinese Lantang gilts to explain the unexpected findings reported earlier that Lantang gilts fed low-fiber diet (LFD) produced more methane than those fed high-fiber diet (HFD). In total, 12 Lantang gilts (58. 7 ± 0. 37 kg) were randomly divided into two dietary groups (six replicates (pigs) per group) and fed either LFD (NDF= 201. 46 g/kg) or HFD (NDF= 329. 70 g/kg). Wheat bran was the main source of fiber for the LFD, whereas ground rice hull (mixture of rice <b>hull</b> <b>and</b> rice <b>bran)</b> was used for the HFD. Results showed that the methanogens in the hindgut of Lantang gilts belonged to four known species (Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, Methanobrevibacter wolinii, Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Methanobrevibacter smithii), with about 89...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{we have discovered}} that hulling of oats considerable improves its digestibility in equine diets (Särkijärvi & Saastamoinen 2003). However, hulling methods are variable and may lead to various outcomes. The more intensive the hulling is, the better the end product, but also the higher {{is the level of}} costs. In order to evaluate the appropriate hulling intensity, we wanted to study the effect of <b>oat</b> <b>hulls</b> on the diet digestibility. Eight mature Finnhorse mares were used in a study where effects of <b>oat</b> <b>hulls</b> on the apparent digestibility of nutrients was studied. Diets were based on dry hay and four different oat feeds (71 : 29 on dry matter basis). Oat feeds were based on hulled oats where four different amounts of <b>oat</b> <b>hulls</b> were added. The <b>oat</b> <b>hull</b> additions were: 1) 0 % hulls, 2) 8 % hulls, 3) 16 % <b>hulls</b> <b>and</b> 4) 24 % hulls. The last treatment represented the hull content of regular oats. Both, <b>hulled</b> oats <b>and</b> <b>oat</b> <b>hulls,</b> were first ground separately to a fine meal and then pressed into pellets, in order to prevent feed selection by horses. Treatments were assigned in a duplicated 4 x 4 Williams square design. A preliminary feeding of 16 days was followed by 5 day collection in each period. Faecal samples were taken twice a day during the collection period. Chromium mordanted straw was a marker for the estimation of digestibility. The inclusion of <b>oat</b> <b>hulls</b> did not affect digestibilities of diet nutrients statistically significantly. The digestibilities of nitrogen free extract and crude protein were slightly higher at 0 % inclusion, and the digestibilities of crude fat and crude fibre were better for 16 and 24 % inclusion rates, but as mentioned, the differences were not statistically significant. Probably the fine milling of the grain material has improved the digestibility of fibre of the <b>oat</b> <b>hulls</b> so tremendously, that the impairing effect of fibre did not show in diet digestibilities.

40|$|Efforts {{to deliver}} {{essential}} micronutrients through existing rice fortification methods are challenged by poor consumer acceptance of fortified rice, production costs, and equipment availability. Current research efforts seek {{to explore the}} potential of parboiling to improve nutrient delivery. This study investigates factors that affect iron transfer into the kernel endosperm via parboiling by evaluating the impact of varied milling durations, iron concentrations in the soaking water, and parboiling conditions upon iron penetration into the rice kernel. Long-grain rice grown in Arkansas was parboiled as rough, brown, and milled rice under various soaking and steaming temperature conditions. Visual quality of the milled parboiled rice was evaluated using a colorimeter utilizing the L* a* b* color scale. Compositional analyses quantified the impact of parboiling conditions upon the iron content of various rice kernel components. This work demonstrates that <b>hull</b> <b>and</b> <b>bran</b> layers of the rice kernel act {{as a barrier to}} iron uptake via parboiling fortification. Hybrid CL XL 745 and pureline Diamond rice cultivars exhibited differences in iron uptake and response to parboiling conditions. Parboiling brown and milled rice resulted in increased fortification efficiency compared to rice parboiled in the rough rice form. Parboiled conditions (soaking temperature and inclusion of a steaming step) were critical determinants of iron penetration into the rice kernel and of parboiled rice color. Milling studies indicated that iron fortificants primarily deposit in the external kernel layers. Optimization of this fortification method may be particularly advantageous in regions of the world where rice is a staple crop and where it represents a major source of daily caloric intake. Understanding the impacts of parboiling soaking and steaming steps may allow rice processors to deliver increased nutrition via parboiled rice...|$|R
40|$|Seed {{dormancy}} {{and resistance}} to decay are fundamental survival strategies, which allow a population of seeds to germinate {{over long periods of}} time. Seeds have physical, chemical, and biological defense mechanisms that protect their food reserves from decay-inducing organisms and herbivores. Here, we hypothesize that seeds also possess enzyme-based biochemical defenses, based on induction of the plant defense enzyme, polyphenol oxidase (PPO), when wild oat (Avena fatua L.) caryopses and seeds were challenged with seed-decaying Fusarium fungi. These studies suggest that dormant seeds are capable of mounting a defense response to pathogens. The pathogen-induced PPO activity from wild oat was attributed to a soluble isoform of the enzyme that appeared to result, at least in part, from proteolytic activation of a latent PPO isoform. PPO activity was also induced in wild <b>oat</b> <b>hulls</b> (lemma <b>and</b> palea), non-living tissues that cover and protect the caryopsis. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that seeds possess inducible enzyme-based biochemical defenses arrayed on the exterior of seeds and these defenses represent a fundamental mechanism of seed survival and longevity in the soil. Enzyme-based biochemical defenses may have broader implications since they may apply to other defense enzymes as well as to a diversity of plant species and ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} wheat <b>bran</b> <b>and</b> <b>oat</b> <b>hulls</b> to bind copper and zinc {{using a new}} chromatographic {{technique}} was investigated and compared to a centrifugation method. Also investigated was the bioavailability of copper which had been exogenously bound to wheat bran then fed to mice <b>and</b> rats. Wheat <b>bran</b> bound 6 mg Cu/g fiber when pH was raised to 7. Less binding occurred at lower pHs. Seven mg of zinc bound to wheat bran at pH 5 while only a trace bound at pH less than 2. <b>Oat</b> <b>hulls</b> bound 3 mg Cu/g fiber at pH 5, and less than 1 mg of zinc bound per g of <b>oat</b> <b>hull</b> at pH 6. Binding for both fibers depended {{on the level of}} mineral added to the fiber slurry during incubation. But only wheat bran binding capacity was influenced by pH. The two methods used did not compare favorably, in all cases, to the amount of mineral bound to fiber. Copper when bound to wheat bran, was utilized in both species, with differences occurring between species was noted. Rats fed the copper bound diet compared favorably with rats fed the copper-adequate diet as determined by body weight, weight gain, heart weight, liver copper concentration and heart copper concentration. Mice, on the other hand showed similar liver and heart concentrations of copper for mice fed either the copper-bound diet or the copper-adequate diets. The in vitro results showed that binding of copper or zinc to wheat bran occurred at a pH similar to the intestinal pH <b>and</b> wheat <b>bran</b> binds more copper <b>and</b> zinc than <b>oat</b> <b>hulls.</b> <b>Oat</b> <b>hulls</b> may prove to be a better dietary fiber source for those people who need to increase their dietary fiber, because <b>oat</b> <b>hulls</b> do not appear to bind copper or zinc and would not likely impair their absorption. Although wheat bran had a high binding capacity for copper, this binding did not significantly inhibit copper absorption as determined in animal studies suggesting that fiber-mineral binding (at least for copper bound to wheat bran) does not cause mineral deficiency symptoms as claimed by many researchers...|$|R
