40|$|Sixty-one bullous disease sera {{containing}} IgG anti-BMZ antibodies {{were examined}} by indirect immunofluorescence on intact skin and skin separated through the lamina lucida by incubation in 1. 0 M NaCl. All sera produced an indistinguishable pattern of linear immunofluorescence on intact skin at dilutions of 1 : 10 or higher. <b>On</b> <b>separated</b> skin, antibodies bound {{to either the}} epidermal (epidermal pattern), dermal (dermal pattern), or epidermal and dermal (combined pattern) sides of the separation. The binding patterns were consistent <b>on</b> <b>separated</b> skin from several donors and titers of antibasement membrane zone antibodies <b>on</b> <b>separated</b> skin were comparable to those on intact skin. Sera from 3 patients with herpes gestationis (HG), 36 patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP), and 1 patient with clinical and histologic features of epidermolysis bullosa aequisita (EBA) showed an epidermal pattern. Sera from 9 patients with BP showed a combined pattern and sera from 6 patients with EBA and 6 patients with clinical and histologic features of BP showed a dermal pattern. Indirect immunoelectron microscopy of selected sera showed antibodies producing the epidermal and combined patterns were anti-lamina lucida antibodies and those producing the dermal pattern were anti-sublamina densa antibodies. These results show indirect immunofluorescence <b>on</b> <b>separated</b> skin is a dependable method for differentiating bullous disease anti-lamina lucida and anti-sublamina densa antibodies and that differentiating between the antibodies is essential for accurate diagnosis in some patients. The results also suggest BP anti-lamina lucida antibodies may {{have more than one}} antigenic specificity...|$|R

In both events, a 'training' round takes place on the opening day, as well as a 'trial' round before each competition; these non-scoring rounds are essentially practice or warm-up sessions, and athlete participation is optional.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that any linear code allows for a {{decoding}} strategy that treats errors and erasures separately over an error-erasure channel. In particular, a carefully designed parity-check matrix makes efficient erasure correction possible through iterative decoding while instantly providing the necessary parity-check equations for independent error correction <b>on</b> demand. The <b>separating</b> redundancy of a given linear code {{is the number of}} parity-check equations in a smallest parity-check matrix that has the required property for this error-erasure separation. In a sense, it is a parameter of a linear code that represents the minimum overhead for efficiently separating erasures from errors. While several bounds <b>on</b> <b>separating</b> redundancy are known, there still remains a wide gap between upper and lower bounds except for a few limited cases. In this paper, using probabilistic combinatorics and design theory, we improve both upper and lower bounds <b>on</b> <b>separating</b> redundancy. Comment: 10 pages, 3 table...|$|R
5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds <b>on</b> <b>separate</b> layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E

Towards the end of 1970, the Army funded work on TOW missile guidance and night sighting systems. Prototypes #6 and #9 were also tested and evaluated at Yuma Proving Ground from 30 January to 23 December 1971, to determine if stability and control systems were sufficient. Deficiencies were identified in lateral directional stability, uncommanded motion during maneuvering, high vibration, and poor directional control during sidewards flying.|$|E

Westaway and Haigh worked on Gunship, a synthwave group devoted to film music, and completed production of the score to Grzegorz Jonkajtys and Bastiaan Koch's short film, The 3rd Letter, with Audrey Riley. The film received several awards from film festivals worldwide. Simpson began work on solo material. In December 2010 he released an EP entitled When We Were Lions through PledgeMusic, an organisation which helps artists raise money to record music from fans. His debut album, Young Pilgrim, was released in August 2011. Simpson's solo work differed from his previous efforts, featuring a sound described as closer to folk music than to rock or pop.|$|E

5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken <b>on</b> <b>separate</b> days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E

5|$|Other dinosaurs {{from these}} {{formations}} include the genasaur Lesothosaurus, the basal sauropodomorph Massospondylus, and the theropod Megapnosaurus. The Lower Elliot Formation shows the largest known heterodontosaurid diversity of any rock unit; besides Heterodontosaurus, it contained Lycorhinus, Abrictosaurus, and Pegomastax. Yet {{another member of}} the family, Geranosaurus, is known from the Clarens Formation. The high heterodontosaurid diversity have led researchers to conclude that different species might have fed <b>on</b> <b>separate</b> food sources in order to avoid competition (niche partitioning). With its highly specialised dentition, Heterodontosaurus might have been specialised for tough plant material, while the less specialised Abrictosaurus might have predominantly consumed softer vegetation. The position of the individual heterodontosaurid specimens within the rock succession is poorly known, making it difficult to determine how many of these species really were conspecific, and which species existed at separate times.|$|E

5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living <b>on</b> <b>separate</b> birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E
