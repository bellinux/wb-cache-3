5|$|In June 1854, McClellan {{was sent}} {{on a secret}} {{reconnaissance}} mission to Santo Domingo {{at the behest of}} Jefferson Davis. McClellan assessed local defensive capabilities for the secretary. (The information was not used until 1870, when President Ulysses S. Grant unsuccessfully attempted to annex the Dominican Republic.) Davis was beginning to treat McClellan almost as a protégé, and his next assignment was to assess the logistical readiness of various railroads in the United States, <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>with</b> an eye toward planning for the transcontinental railroad. In March 1855, McClellan was promoted to captain and assigned to the 1st U.S. Cavalry regiment.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, the Blues {{were invited}} {{to compete in the}} Setanta Sports Cup {{scheduled}} to take place in June 2015. The club declined <b>once</b> <b>again,</b> <b>with</b> inconvenient fixture scheduling still remaining a concern. The competition was ultimately cancelled, when suitable fixture dates could not be agreed upon. With the Blues top of the table after 10 games of the 2015–16 NIFL Premiership season, Feeney's reign came to an end in October 2015, when he resigned to become assistant manager (and subsequently the manager) of English Football League Two side Newport County.|$|E
5|$|Queen's went on {{the attack}} <b>once</b> <b>again,</b> <b>with</b> Christie going on a run but losing {{possession}} to Hargreaves. After around 30 minutes of play, Hargreaves passed the ball to his teammate Douglas {{who went on to}} score Rovers' first goal. Queen's Park then committed the second handball of the game, giving Rovers a free kick. Brown took the ball up the wing, and centred it towards Forrest, who turned the ball {{into the back of the}} Queen's Park goal and put Blackburn two ahead. In response, Queen's Park's attacks on the Blackburn defence increased, and they scored through Christie before half time.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific blue-eye (Pseudomugil signifer) is {{a species}} of fish in the family Pseudomugilidae native to eastern Australia.

5|$|Boult's {{recordings}} {{fall into}} three main periods. In the first, from 1920 {{to the end}} of the 1940s, he recorded almost exclusively for HMV. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was less in demand by the major labels, and although he made a substantial number of discs for Decca, he recorded mostly for smaller labels, chiefly Pye Nixa. His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>with</b> HMV. With his regular collaborators the producer Christopher Bishop and the engineer Christopher Parker he made more than sixty recordings, re-recording much of his key repertoire in stereo. He also added many works to his discography that he had not recorded before.|$|E
5|$|Davenport {{experienced}} {{an economic and}} building boom in the 1920s and early 1930s. The Kahl Building and the Capitol Theatre, the baseball stadium, the Parker Building, and the Blackhawk Hotel {{are a few of}} the buildings built during this time period that are still standing. The Great Depression brought economic tough times to the city. The inclusion of new factories in the 1940s and 1950s helped turn the economy around after World War II. Davenport was on hard times <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>with</b> the farm crisis of the 1980s, when the Caterpillar Plant closed, costing 35,000 jobs. The city was rejuvenated once again in the 1990s and present by renovations and building additions.|$|E

5|$|During the {{pre-season}} for the 2016–17 campaign, Holtby {{was ruled}} out for eight–ten weeks after breaking his collarbone {{for a second}} time when he was involved in a cycling accident in Switzerland. In December, he received his first career red card when he was dismissed for violent conduct after striking Dominik Kohr in a 1–0 win over Augsburg. He subsequently received a two-match suspension for his indiscretions. Holtby made his 300th senior career appearance on 1 April 2017, and marked the occasion by netting an extra-time winner in a 2–1 man of the match performance against Köln. He then recorded two assists in the final two matches of the season to help Hamburg avoid the relegation play-offs <b>once</b> <b>again,</b> <b>with</b> the club beating Wolfsburg on the final day to steer themselves clear of the drop.|$|E
5|$|In the 1969 season, after a {{slow start}} and despite diminished speed and acceleration, Sayers {{led the league in}} rushing <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>with</b> 1,032 yards. He {{averaged}} 4.4 yards per carry and was the only player to gain over 1,000 rushing yards that year. He moved into second place on the Bears' all-time rushing yards list, passing Bronko Nagurski. Sayers was recognized as the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year by United Press International. The Bears, long past the Halas glory years, finished in last place with a franchise-worst 1–13 record. In his fourth and final Pro Bowl appearance, Sayers was the West's leading rusher and its leading receiver. For the third time in as many Pro Bowl performances, he was named the back of the game.|$|E

5|$|Together {{these two}} units {{remained}} linked until 4 September 1939 when, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel William Jeater, the 2nd Battalion was once again raised as a separate unit {{as part of an effort}} by the Australian government to hastily expand the Militia following the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, although mobilised and assigned to the 1st Brigade, the battalion did not see active service overseas and was instead used as a garrison force in Australia until 2 December 1943 when it was merged <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>with</b> the 41st Battalion, forming the 41st/2nd Battalion. They remained linked until 17 December 1945, when they were disbanded as part of the demobilisation process.|$|E
5|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} {{season in the}} national league in 2011, where it did not qualify for the following season's continental tournaments, Atlético finished as runner-up in the 2012 Campeonato Brasileiro, qualifying for the Copa Libertadores {{for the first time}} in twelve years. The team entered the competition in the second stage, and was drawn into Group 3, together with Argentine club Arsenal de Sarandí, Bolivia's The Strongest, and São Paulo <b>once</b> <b>again.</b> <b>With</b> a squad composed of Ronaldinho, Jô, Diego Tardelli, Bernard and a returning Gilberto Silva, Atlético dominated the group, winning its first five matches. São Paulo inflicted the team's only loss in the last match, but Atlético had already secured the best performance of the competition's group stage, which meant the second legs in further rounds would be played at home. São Paulo, as the worst runner-up of the group stage, was also the team's opponent in the round of 16. Atlético won the first leg, played at the Morumbi, after a 21 comeback; in the second leg, played at the Estádio Independência (the club's new first-choice home ground since the previous year), the team won 41 with a hat-trick by Jô to advance.|$|E

5|$|Aston Villa {{won their}} sixth FA Cup in 1920. For the {{remainder}} of the inter-war years though, Villa were on a slow decline that would lead to them being relegated to the Second Division in 1936 {{for the first time in}} their history. They returned to the top-tier of English football by the outbreak of the Second World War. As with many clubs, the war brought much change to Villa Park and remainder of the 1940s were spent rebuilding the team. By 1957, Villa were a Cup winning side <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>with</b> the clubs seventh FA Cup win. Even though Villa won the inaugural League Cup in 1960, the club were to enter into a very unsuccessful period. The 1960s saw much change at Villa Park. By the end of the 1960s, Villa were languishing in the Second Division and fan pressure led to the resignation of the Board and the introduction of Doug Ellis as Villa Chairman.|$|E
5|$|Ef: The Latter Tale begins <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>with</b> Yuko Amamiya and Yu Himura in {{the middle}} of a reunion in a church during Christmas time. Yuko tells Yu how she has {{influenced}} people in two separate stories (from Ef: The First Tale). After she is done with this, she asks him to tell her about the people he has influenced. Yu starts to tell his first story, that of Chihiro Shindo; the third chapter begins. Like Yuko, Yu also abruptly appears out of nowhere and disappears just as mysteriously. He often gives advice and warnings to Renji and others. Yu is close to Chihiro and takes care of her. After the conclusion of the third chapter, the story goes back to Yuko and Yu with Yu ending his recount of the third chapter, and goes on to talk about how he and Yuko were separated in the past. Yu starts his recount of the events from the fourth chapter. At the end of the fourth chapter, the story shifts one final time back to Yuko and Yu. Up to this point the two have been recounting individual tales to each other. The meaning of the overall title Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two is revealed to be in connection with Yuko and Yu.|$|E
5|$|He {{remained}} at the club as a player but was rarely selected for the team, and in January 2005, he went on loan to Hull City, where he was reunited <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>with</b> Peter Taylor. He made ten appearances for Hull, who gained promotion to the Football League Championship (the new name for what had been previously been called the First Division), while Gillingham were relegated from the same division. He returned to the Gillingham team {{at the start of}} the 2005–06 season and made a further 17 appearances, the final one in a 3–0 home win against Port Vale on 10 December 2005. At forty years and four months of age, he was the oldest player ever to represent the club. He rounded out his Gillingham career by returning to Priestfield Stadium for a testimonial match in July 2006. He is widely regarded as a club legend by Gillingham fans, who in 2005 voted him the team's best ever player in a local radio poll, and he was also named Gillingham's greatest ever player by the Professional Footballers' Association in November 2007.|$|E
