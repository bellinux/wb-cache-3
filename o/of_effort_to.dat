The castle was constructed by hand, using workers digging with wooden shovels, and probably without pickaxes. It is estimated that the motte would have taken around 24,000 man days <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> build.|$|E

25|$|During the 1960s, the moped craze {{arrived in}} the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Mopeds had been {{produced}} for years in France and Italy, but were largely unknown in other countries.

The new moped designs were really low-powered motorcycles, equipped with pedals largely to meet legal requirements. Most could be pedaled only with difficulty over short distances on level ground.|$|E

25|$|The {{determinants}} of job performance consist of factors {{having to do}} with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance, job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of what needs to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen). The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.|$|E
25|$|With the National Golf Links course, Macdonald began {{collaborating with}} Seth Raynor, {{who would later}} become a famous golf {{architect}} (a term coined by Macdonald in about 1910) in his own right. The pair would collaborate {{on a number of}} courses over the years, including The Creek Club and Piping Rock Club in Locust Valley, New York, the Yale University golf course, the Old White Course at The Greenbrier, and Mid Ocean Club in Bermuda (a course conceived to escape the reach of Prohibition). One of the most famous was the Lido Golf Club, a course which took an enormous amount <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> construct and had several unique holes, and was considered at least on par with the National Golf Links while it existed (a course by the same name exists on its location today, but it was built by Robert Trent Jones in 1947).|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have noted}} some peculiarities in the mummification process {{used on the}} Lady. The {{evisceration}} {{of the body and}} the stuffing of the torso with embalming materials were standard parts of the mummification process used during the entire reign of the 18th dynasty. This was not the case with the intact skull base and lack <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> remove the brain, seen {{in the case of the}} Lady. This process had been used on early rulers of the 18th dynasty, as seen in the mummies currently identified with Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III. By the time of the later rulers of the 18th dynasty, when the Lady lived and died, the process had changed. All mummies from this later era contain some treatment of the brain, in attempts to remove it from the body. The mummification process used on the Lady seems like a throwback to an earlier era. Another peculiarity is the evidence that the people behind the mummification process were trying to repair and cover injured areas of the body. They used subcutaneous fillings and packs to remodel the injured left side of the face, the contralateral side of the face, and the right hip region. This was not part of the regular efforts of an embalmer.|$|E

When fans' vocal impatience for A Dance with Dragons peaked shortly after, Martin issued a statement called [...] "To My Detractors" [...] on his blog that received media attention. The New York Times noted that it was not uncommon for Martin to be mobbed at book signings either.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jonathan Collier, who is a huge boxing fan. Knowing that {{the people on the}} {{internet}} would [...] "give them grief", the writers went to a lot <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> explain how Homer would be able to challenge for the Heavyweight Title. A lot of the scenes involving Homer fighting hobos were pitched by John Swartzwelder. Lucius Sweet is a parody of boxing promoter Don King, and is voiced by Paul Winfield, who had previously played King in HBO's 1995 biopic Tyson. In the script, Sweet was described as [...] "A Don King type who looks and sounds exactly like Don King". The similarity is even pointed out by Homer with the line, [...] "He is exactly as rich and as famous as Don King ‚Äì and he looks just like him, too!". King was asked to guest star, but turned the part down. Drederick Tatum is a parody of Mike Tyson. The name came from George Meyer, who went to high school with a boy named Drederick Timmins, which Meyer thought was a cool name. Tatum having done time in prison is a reference to the fact that, {{at the time of the}} episode's production, Tyson had just recently been released from prison after serving three years for rape. Homer is at one point referred to as [...] "The Southern Dandy" [...] as a reference to the old-time boxers and wrestlers who had similar nicknames.|$|E

Gardiner stressed Cromwell‚Äôs dynamic and mercurial character, and his role in dismantling absolute monarchy, while underestimating Cromwell‚Äôs religious conviction.
