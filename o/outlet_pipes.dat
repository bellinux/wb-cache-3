25|$|The GT-R reappeared in 1999, with {{a revised}} chassis and other updates. The R34 turbos {{received}} a ball bearing core. The R34 N1 turbos had a metal exhaust wheel, and ball bearing center section. The turbo <b>outlet</b> <b>pipes</b> were changed from cast to formed metal outlets. The intercooler outlet side and rear turbo dump pipe had temperature probes fitted in the V-spec models. The biggest feature and most significant feature to the R34 GT-R that wasn't seen {{on any other}} model skyline was the display unit {{at the top of}} the dashboard. This display unit was very significant for the car at its time. This display showed many of the cars engine stats including boost pressure, oil temp, water temp and more. As a 1999 car this kind of technology was very rare and advanced at the time. The display was capable of showing the G-force that the car was under when driving and there was also a lap timer that could be started by a button that was located near the gear lever. There was a computer jack lead hidden underneath the left passenger side skirt that could be used to transfer driving data from the car to a laptop. This could only be done with a Japanese version of Windows and Japanese software, which today is very hard to come by.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates thermal {{performance}} {{and characteristics of}} spiral-tube ground heat exchanger (GHE) for {{ground source heat pump}} in laminar and turbulent flows. The {{thermal performance}}s are evaluated by numerical method using a CFD code. Various models of spiral-tube GHEs installed in a borehole and backfilled with silica-sand were simulated. In comparison with the conventional U-tube GHE, the performance of spiral-tube GHE increases by 62. 7 % in the laminar flow and by 33. 5 % in the turbulent flow. Due to the interest in applying the GHE in concrete foundation piles, the spiral-tube GHE installed in a concrete pile is also simulated. Its performance shows a slight better performance of 5 % in the laminar flow and 6 % in the turbulent flow compared with that of a borehole backfilled with silica sand. Furthermore, the performance of spiral-tube GHEs with <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> installed inside and outside the spiral tube in the borehole, and varying spiral pitches of p = 0. 05 m; 0. 1 m and 0. 2 m are investigated. The effects of <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> positions on the performances are shown. The spiral-tube with <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> installed outside gives a better performance, of 2 % in the laminar flow and 10 % in the turbulent flow, than that of the <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> installed inside. Water temperature distributions of the both spiral-tube GHEs are presented. Varying the spiral pitch significantly affects the performance of the spiral-tube GHEs.

40|$|With {{regard to}} the reactor coolant pump and high {{flow-rate}} circulating pump, the requirements on the compactness of the structure, safety, and hydraulic performance are particularly important. Thus, the mixed-flow pump with cylindrical casing is adopted in some occasions. Due to the different characteristics between the special cylindrical casing and the common pump casing, {{the influence of the}} special casing on a mixed-flow pump characteristics was numerically investigated to obtain better performance and flow structure in the casing. The results show that the models with cylindrical casing have much worse head and efficiency characteristics than the experimental model, and this is caused by the flow in the pump casing. By moving the guide vanes half inside the pump casing, the efficiency gets improved while the low pressure zone at the corner of <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> and pump casing disappeared. When the length of pump casing increases from the size equal to the diameter of <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> to that larger than it, the efficiency drops obviously and the flow field in the <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> improved without curved flow. In addition, the length of the pump casing has greater impacts on the pump performance than the radius of it...|$|R

40|$|Peatlands are {{important}} carbon stores {{and many have}} natural pipes (tunnels) that transport water and carbon. Pipes are often viewed as passive and slowly changing features of peatland landscapes, particularly for sites that are relatively undisturbed by land management. However, {{there is a lack}} of data on pipe morphology change over time. This paper presents the first survey of natural <b>pipe</b> <b>outlets</b> in a peatland in which morphological changes in <b>pipe</b> <b>outlets</b> through time were measured. Three surveys of natural <b>pipe</b> <b>outlets</b> between 2007 and 2010 were conducted in a 17. 4 ha, relatively undisturbed, blanket-peat-covered catchment in northern England. 27 of the 91 <b>pipe</b> <b>outlets</b> mapped in the first survey had perennial discharge and these outlets were significantly larger and shallower than those from ephemerally-flowing pipes. The cross-sectional area of 85 % of <b>pipe</b> <b>outlets</b> changed (increased or decreased) during the study, with 20 % of <b>pipe</b> <b>outlet</b> areas changing by more than 50 cm (equivalent to a median 207 % change in area for this upper fifth of pipes) up to a maximum of 312 cm for one <b>pipe</b> <b>outlet.</b> During the study, 18 <b>pipe</b> <b>outlets</b> completely infilled, while four new ones appeared.
