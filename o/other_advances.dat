An Essay on the Shaking Palsy described the characteristic resting tremor, abnormal posture and gait, paralysis and diminished muscle strength, {{and the way}} that the disease progresses over time. Early neurologists who made further additions to the knowledge of the disease include Trousseau, Gowers, Kinnier Wilson and Erb, and most notably Jean-Martin Charcot, whose studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of the disease. Among <b>other</b> <b>advances,</b> he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia. He also championed the renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{containerization}} and <b>other</b> <b>advances</b> in shipping were impeded by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), {{which was}} created in 1887 to keep railroads from using monopolist pricing and rate discrimination but fell victim to regulatory capture. By the 1960s, ICC approval was required before any shipper could carry different items in the same vehicle or change rates. The fully integrated systems in the United States today became possible only after the ICC's regulatory oversight was cut back (and abolished in 1995); trucking and rail were deregulated in the 1970s and maritime rates were deregulated in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Late in {{the colonial}} era a few silversmiths {{expanded}} operations with manufacturing techniques and changing business practices They hired assistants, subcontracted out piecework and standardized output. One individual {{in the vanguard of}} America's shift towards more industrial methods was Paul Revere, who emphasized the production of increasingly standardized items later in his career {{with the use of a}} silver flatting mill, increased numbers of salaried employees, and <b>other</b> <b>advances.</b> Still, traditional methods of artisan remained, and smiths performed a great deal of work by hand. The coexistence of the craft and industrial production styles prior to the industrial revolution is an example of proto-industrialization.|$|E
25|$|The {{breast cancer}} {{movement}} {{has resulted in}} widespread acceptance of second opinions, the development of less invasive surgical procedures, the spread of support groups, and <b>other</b> <b>advances</b> in patient care. The movement successfully separated diagnostic biopsy from mastectomy surgery; before about 1980, it was common to perform the biopsy and, if a quick review of tissues indicated a probable need, a mastectomy in the same surgery. The one-step surgery prevented women from seeking different opinions about their treatment, and sent them into the surgery without knowing whether their breasts would be removed that day. In response to women's concerns over lymphedema after routine removal of lymph nodes during mastectomy, the more limited approach of sentinel node biopsy was developed. Advocacy efforts also led to the formal recommendation against the routine use of the Halsted radical mastectomy in favor of simple mastectomies and lumpectomies.|$|E

25|$|During this time, the {{downtown}} district was consolidated into a commercial, financial and administrative center, {{with the establishment}} of various portals and locales around Ahumada Street and a Civic District in the immediate surroundings of the Palace of La Moneda. The latter project involved the construction of various modernist buildings for the establishment of the offices of ministries and other public services, as well as commencing the construction of medium-rise buildings. On the other hand, the traditional inhabitants of the center began to migrate out of the city to more rural areas like Providencia and Ñuñoa, which hosted the oligarchy and the European immigrant professionals, and San Miguel for middle-class families. Furthermore, in the periphery villas were built various partners from various organizations of the time. Modernity expanded in the city, with the appearance of the first theaters, the extension of the telephone network and the opening of the Airport Los Cerrillos in 1928, among <b>other</b> <b>advances.</b>|$|E
25|$|At about 6:30 in {{the morning}} of December 2, the Americans {{advanced}} up the trail but were met with a steady volley of fire, resulting in them only being able to climb around 300 feet. The Americans abandoned the idea of a frontal assault and took cover in the zigzag trail. Texan sharpshooters stationed themselves on a hill overlooking the trenches and proceeded to whittle down the Philippine rear guard with measured volleys. Nevertheless, the Filipinos continued to hold their ground, utilizing focused volley fire that repelled <b>other</b> <b>advances</b> by the Americans. Therefore, March sent elements of their force with an Igorot villager named Januario Galut to determine the Filipino positions and outflank the defenders. While the flanking movement was still in progress, three American soldiers rushed to the battlefield but found themselves receiving Filipino fire. Two died, being the only Americans killed in the encounter, while the third was badly wounded.|$|E

The two sides were evenly matched technologically, and the Turks had to build barricades [...] "in order to receive… the stones of the bombards." [...] Because the Empire at this time was facing economic problems, Pope Pius II promoted the affordable donation of cannon by European monarchs {{as a means of}} aid. Any new cannon after the 1422 siege were gifts from European states, and aside from these, no <b>other</b> <b>advances</b> were made to the Byzantine arsenal.|$|E

500|$|From the 1960s commercially {{available}} systems were introduced. Soon, <b>other</b> <b>advances</b> in electronics and piezoelectric materials enabled further improvements {{which meant that}} ultrasound was quickly adopted for use in medicine due to its rapid, accurate diagnostic capabilities which offered the possibility of prompt treatment. Alongside the improving imaging technology, acoustic Doppler velocimetry and medical ultrasonography color Doppler were developed, which have {{had a significant impact}} on many specialties, including radiology, obstetrics, gynecology, angiology and cardiology, and have provided even greater scope for ultrasound investigations. Since 1970, real-time scanners and pulsed Doppler, have enabled the use of [...] ultrasound to study the function of the venous system. The first demonstration of color Doppler was achieved by Geoff Stevenson.|$|E

Their psychology, in many ways, seems to be similar to humans. Entirely new breeds or [...] "lines" [...] of brown rats, such as [...] the Wistar rat, have been bred for use in laboratories.

2500|$|The amplifying {{vacuum tube}} {{revolutionized}} electrical technology, creating the {{new field of}} electronics, the technology of active electrical devices. [...] It made possible long distance telephone lines, public address systems, radio broadcasting, talking motion pictures, practical audio recording, radar, television, and the first computers. [...] For 50 years virtually all consumer electronic devices used vacuum tubes. [...] Early tube amplifiers often had positive feedback (regeneration), which could increase gain but also make the amplifier unstable and prone to oscillation. [...] Much of the mathematical theory of amplifiers was developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories during the 1920s to 1940s. [...] Distortion levels in early amplifiers were high, usually around 5%, until 1934, when Harold Black developed negative feedback; this allowed the distortion levels to be greatly reduced, {{at the cost of}} lower gain. [...] <b>Other</b> <b>advances</b> in the theory of amplification were made by Harry Nyquist and Hendrik Wade Bode.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Other</b> <b>advances</b> {{improved}} plant {{efficiency and}} eliminated production errors. Eli Lilly, grandson {{of the company}} founder, introduced a method for blueprinting manufacturing tickets in 1909. This process, which created multiples copies of a drug formula, helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors. In the 1920s Eli introduced the new concept of straight-line production, where raw materials entered {{at one end of}} the facility and the finished product came out the other end, in the company’s manufacturing process. Under Eli’s supervision, the design for Building 22, a new 5-floor plant that opened in Indianapolis in 1926, implemented the straight-line concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs. One historian noted, [...] "It was probably the most sophisticated production system in the American pharmaceutical industry." [...] This more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce. Instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell, Lilly's regular workforce produced less-costly medicines in off-peak times using the same manufacturing facilities.|$|E
