The company built Freight Optimizer and Rail Optimizer, two cloud-based platforms that use data mining to predict prices and optimize its network; last-mile technology to manage customer experience in real-time; and an expedite bid system to automatically match loads to carriers through a web-based auction portal. XPO has also developed logistics technology - including advanced robotics - for <b>omni-channel</b> <b>distribution,</b> reverse logistics, transportation management, LEAN manufacturing support, aftermarket support, and supply chain optimization.|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{importance}} of of developing point approach {{as the basis for the}} development of <b>omni-channel</b> <b>distribution</b> strategy. With this approach, the distribution channel is understood as a series of point making the product (service) available for consumption to consumer, as a result of the operations with the distribution flows, points can be controlled by one or more market players. In the article the logistics flows and distribution flows are systematized using Euler circles. Said synthetic distribution flows: physical possession and movement; ownership, service, risk, payment, promotion, contacts and negotiations, ordering. Synthetic flows are distributed on the base: material, information and finance flows. The author also shows a diagram of the distribution channels, taking into account the effect of distribution points at various stages of the decision making process consumer purchase. This prompted a further stage in the decision-making process ? the stage of registration of the order by the consumer. ?????? ?????????? ???????? ?? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ???????, ??? ?????? ??? ?????????? ????-????????? ????????? ?????????????. ??? ????? ???????, ????? ????????????? ?????????? ??? ?????????????????? ?????, ?? ??????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????

30|$|In SCE, smart {{technology}} is the dominant medium for information exchange and it is accelerating the paradigm shift. The necessity for multiple distribution platforms beyond the Internet, mobile devices, and the physical store, {{is to be able}} to achieve preemptive <b>distribution.</b> <b>Omni-channel</b> creates an innovative and seamless consumer experience where consumers can start their journey in one channel and complete it in another through a continuous stream of activity that presents no barriers. Consumers want both responsive and adaptive interactions with content delivered in a way that best suits them as individuals and their particular device (The Guardians, 2013). A fully implemented omni-channel strategy seamlessly offers integrated and interchangeable distribution platforms for searching, shopping, ordering, purchasing, pickup, delivery, and returns. To achieve this, all operational points in the entire value chain must be seamlessly integrated and ‘un-siloed’ (Lewis, 2014). Successful examples of seamless integrated operations include Bonobos (Brooks Brothers), Top Shop (Nordstrom), and Sephora (JCPenney).|$|R
30|$|The growing {{importance}} of online sales means that traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers {{need to create}} new distribution systems to serve customers through multiple channels. Building an effective and efficient <b>omni-channel</b> (OC) <b>distribution</b> system, however, leads to multiple challenges. The questions arise for example, from where online orders should be fulfilled, how delivery and return processes can be organized, and which context-specific OC distribution systems exist. Answering these questions retail research and practice require an overall view of the distribution concepts for direct-to-customer and store deliveries in OC retailing, including the associated return processes. This overall picture is still missing in the literature. We conducted an exploratory study to close this observable gap in the literature. This exploratory study is based on semi-structured interviews with major OC retailers in German-speaking countries and was complemented by market data research and discussions with further {{experts in the field}} of OC retailing. Based on the results of the study, the forward distribution system in OC retailing is characterized by the sources (supplier DCs, retailer DCs, stores) and destinations (home, store) which describe the options for store delivery, home delivery, and store pickup. Return processes are likewise characterized by the sources (store, home) and destinations (store, DC, return center). This framework forms the foundation for analyzing contextual criteria, identifying when the different conceptual designs are applied, determining industry-specific characteristics, and illustrating ways to further advance OC retailing. The present paper, therefore, contributes to the literature in three main areas: (1) it identifies and systematizes the forward and backward concepts in OC retailing, (2) it reveals application and development areas for achieving excellence in OC fulfillment and logistics, and (3) shows the need for developing sector- and context-specific OC distribution systems.|$|R
40|$|The Habilitation thesis (Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches) {{focuses on}} recent {{advances}} {{of research on}} the horizontal collaboration in logistics for sustainable transport and logistics. Firstly, past and recent challenges and evolutionary organisations in logistics are discussed. These challenges have resulted from changes in business environments and sustainability constraints. Evolutionary organisations are then proposed to deal with the challenges and constraints, e. g., from in-house logistics to outsourced logistics, and horizontal collaborative and interconnected logistics. Nowadays, in new business environments such as omni-channel retailing, logistics is characterised by high frequency, fragmented flows, short delivery times, <b>omni-channel</b> <b>distribution,</b> and uncertainty and is thus inefficient and unsustainable. In this context, new logistics systems need to be more efficient, responsive, sustainable, and resilient. Secondly, we investigate a recent innovative organisation in logistics, i. e., horizontal collaborative and interconnected logistics, which is currently an important research topic in the field of sustainable logistics. A state of the art review of the research topic has been conducted. A dual-axis analysis framework is proposed to position and analyse the contributions from international and national research communities. My research and contributions to the topic are also discussed {{on the basis of the}} framework. Finally, research perspectives and research program for the future logistics are outlined, as well as my future research interests. To cope with the new challenges and constraints, we argue that the future logistics system should have the ability of self-organisation, based on some essential functionalities, that are openness, intelligence, and decentralised control. This system is so-called Self-organising logistics system (SoLS). A theoretical framework is given to describe the system, as well as to point out some research perspectives...|$|E
