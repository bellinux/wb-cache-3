In 2002, Mancera was a review committee member of the Criminal Procedure Code for the Federal District, and around the same time, he began working in government after Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico City's Secretary of Public Security, invited him to be his adviser. After Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the mayor <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> City, named Ebrard as Social Development Secretary of the city, Mancera was assigned Legal Director of the Social Development Secretariat. In 2006, Mancera was named Assistant Attorney General <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> City.|$|E

The weak low pressure area off South Carolina drifted southward, with its associated deep convection increasing in organization on August 4. By 1800UTC on August 5, the system had acquired sufficient organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Three, while located about 175miles (280km/h) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Allen again {{weakened}} to a Category4 storm due to friction with Mexico and an eyewall replacement cycle, but restrengthened into a Category5 hurricane for a {{third time}} as it moved over the open waters of the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> keeping this intensity for nearly a full day and with a pressure drop to , the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Shortly before landfall, a dry air mass in the western Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> caused the storm to weaken substantially. Allen made landfall north of Brownsville, Texas as a Category3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). It became extratropical on August 11.|$|E

5|$|As the eye moved onshore in Florida, the {{convection}} in the eyewall strengthened due {{to increased}} convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north. Andrew steadily re-intensified over the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25. As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest. This caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest, and winds decreased as Andrew approached the Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|As the {{previous}} storm was dissipating, another tropical storm developed to its west. Lasting only two days, it dissipated on August22 about halfway between Hawaii {{and the west}} coast <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E

5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{issuance}} of the first advisory on Ignacio, the government <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> issued a tropical storm watch from Santa Fe to La Paz, with the watch upgraded to a warning nine hours later. The warning was extended on both coasts from Bahia Magdalena to San Evaristo the next day. About 48hours before Ignacio made landfall, a hurricane warning was issued from Santa Fe to La Paz, and 21hours later extended to Bahia Magdalena and San Evaristo. The government <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> also issued a tropical storm warning for the mainland from Atlana to Topolobampo {{in the state of}} Sinaloa.|$|E
5|$|Convection {{continued}} but the cyclone was encountering extensive easterly to north-easterly {{wind shear}} which stinted {{the strengthening of}} this storm throughout its history. The cyclone initially headed toward the west-northwest around a subtropical ridge that was centered over the western Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> The depression moved north west, parallel with the west coast <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> due to being steered by the mid/upper-level ridge. On August 31, it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette, 85miles (137km) south of Acapulco.|$|E

5|$|Even faster {{weakening}} ensued through October24 as {{the hurricane}} traversed the Sierra Madre mountains; its eye disappeared from satellite imagery {{within hours of}} moving ashore. The system weakened below hurricane strength by 03:00UTC as it passed west of Guadalajara. Patricia accelerated inland between a trough over Northwestern Mexico and the ridge over the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Convection dramatically decreased in organization and the low- and mid- to upper-level circulation centers of the cyclone soon decoupled. The system degraded into a tropical depression by 12:00UTC as little organized convection remained, and the storm dissipated shortly thereafter over central Mexico. Unimpeded by the mountains <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> the mid- to upper-level circulation of Patricia, accompanied by considerable moisture, continued northeast and interacted with a cold front over the western Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> The new system produced flooding rains across large areas of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, the cyclone's {{motion was}} altered by Hurricane Flossie off the Pacific coast <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Initially, deep {{convection}} fired up gradually as the depression slowly tracked westward in the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> At 1200UTC on August10, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle, {{as the storm}} curved southward. Gabrielle then strengthened slowly over the warm sea surface temperatures in a low wind shear environment, although land interaction slowed the intensification somewhat. The storm shifted once again onto a west-northwest course on August11, moving very slowly towards the coast.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Beatriz was a Category1 {{hurricane}} {{that killed}} four people after brushing the western coast <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> in June 2011. Originating {{from an area}} of disturbed weather on June19, several hundred miles south <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> Beatriz gradually intensified. Gaining latitude, the system became increasingly organized and reached hurricane status {{on the evening of}} June20. The following morning, Beatriz attained winds of 90mph (150km/h) as it passed roughly 15mi (20km) <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Due to its interaction with land, the hurricane abruptly weakened hours later. Early on June22, Beatriz dissipated over open waters. Prior to Beatriz's arrival in Mexico, hurricane watches and warnings were issued for coastal areas. Hundreds of shelters opened across the states of Colima and Guerrero. Heavy rains from the storm triggered significant flooding along the Sabana River in Acapulco, killing four people. However, the overall effects of Beatriz were limited and the rains were largely beneficial in mitigating a severe drought.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the storm, the government <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> issued a hurricane warning from Puerto Arista to Punta Maldonaldo and later from Salina Cruz to Acapulco. A tropical storm warning was also issued from Sipacate, Guatemala to Puerto Arista, Mexico. The threat of the hurricane prompted officials to order the evacuation of 3,000people along the southern coast <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> to 500 emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|In mid-June, a mid-level {{center of}} {{circulation}} formed {{in association with}} a quasi-stationary cold front that stretched across northern Florida and the extreme northeast Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> On June20, a weak and disorganized {{area of low pressure}} developed in conjunction with the front and it passed by Tampa Bay, Florida the following day. Upon moving into the eastern Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> there was little convection on observed on satellite imagery, although a distinguishable wind-shift was noted by an offshore buoy. However, by June23, the presence of deep convection atop a circulation had become well-defined enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify the disturbance as a tropical depression, while centered 330mi (535km) southwest of Cape Coral, Florida. Moving generally west to west-northwestward across the central Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> the National Hurricane Center sent a reconnaissance plane into the tropical depression at 1500UTC on June24, at which time winds of 60mph (95km/h) were found. About three hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonnie.|$|E
