The simplest approach to harmonic tuning is to concentrate on the ammunition. The internal ballistics of a given cartridge will determine its dwell time, or the time it takes from ignition to exiting the barrel. By experimentally matching the dwell time to the barrel's frequency, the best load for a particular firearm may be found.

50|$|Fireworks have {{remained}} popular in today's age {{due to the}} spectacle of colors and sounds they are so renowned for. The component of a rocket that produces these stars, reports ("bangs"), and colors is typically located just below the nosecone section of a rocket. After the rocket engine has consumed all of its fuel an internal fuse is lit that delays {{the release of the}} stars, or other effect. This delay allows for coasting time where the rocket continues its ascent. As gravity will eventually pull the firework back to earth, it slows and eventually reaches an apex (highest point: where velocity of the rocket is zero) and begins its descent. The delay usually lasts just before this apex, at an <b>optimum</b> <b>velocity,</b> where a small explosion shoots the firework's stars in desired directions and thus producing a brilliant effect.

40|$|Determination of optimal {{acidizing}} conditions through laboratory {{experimental study}} {{is crucial for}} designing matrix acid stimulation jobs in the field. <b>Optimum</b> interstitial <b>velocity,</b> vi-opt (the velocity of injected fluid that yields the minimum volume of acid needed to propagate wormholes) can be determined though curve fitting of experimental data. This <b>optimum</b> interstitial <b>velocity</b> coincides with the minimum volume of acid required for wormhole breakthrough, and therefore, the most efficient stimulation design. <b>Optimum</b> interstitial <b>velocity</b> determines the injection rate for a treatment, and the optimum pore volume to breakthrough, PVbt-opt, suggests the total volume of acid needed. Studies of carbonate matrix acidizing {{have focused on the}} role of many parameters, such as acid concentration, acid type, temperature, and core dimensions. However, under the same experimental conditions, different limestone rocks exhibit different optimal conditions. It is important to explore how changes in rock properties, such as permeability and pore structure, can also impact the efficacy of matrix acidizing techniques. In this work, a series of linear coreflood experiments on relatively homogenous Indiana limestone and Desert Pink limestone cores were performed at ambient temperature. Cores of 1. 5 -in. diameter by 8 -in. long were acidized using 15 % hydrochloric acid. The average permeabilities of the cores tested were 6, 11, 33 and 239 mD with varied porosity. The effects of permeability and porosity were isolated using thin section analysis to study pore structure. Based on experimental results, a detailed explanation of the pore structure and permeability effects on <b>optimum</b> interstitial <b>velocity</b> is presented. The coreflood acidizing results show that at low permeabilities, <b>optimum</b> interstitial <b>velocity</b> increases with permeability. When permeability of the rock reaches a certain value, the effect of permeability on the optimum injection condition diminishes. In addition, the optimum pore volume to breakthrough increases across the entire range of permeabilities tested. This work also briefly quantifies the differences in pore structure of the samples, leading to recommendations for future work. The implications and applications of this work are far-reaching; better understanding of optimal acidizing conditions based on the studied rock properties has significant potential economic and operational impact...|$|R

50|$|The Van Deemter {{equation}} in chromatography {{relates the}} variance {{per unit length}} of a separation column to the linear mobile phase velocity by considering physical, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties of a separation. These properties include pathways within the column, diffusion (axial and longitudinal), and mass transfer kinetics between stationary and mobile phases. In liquid chromatography, the mobile phase velocity is taken as the exit velocity, that is, {{the ratio of the}} flow rate in ml/second to the cross-sectional area of the ‘column-exit flow path.’ For a packed column, the cross-sectional area of the column exit flow path is usually taken as 0.6 times the cross-sectional area of the column. Alternatively, the linear velocity can be taken as the ratio of the column length to the dead time. If the mobile phase is a gas, then the pressure correction must be applied. The variance per unit length of the column is taken as the ratio of the column length to the column efficiency in theoretical plates. The Van Deemter equation is a hyperbolic function that predicts that there is an <b>optimum</b> <b>velocity</b> at which there will be the minimum variance per unit column length and, thence, a maximum efficiency.

40|$|AbstractA {{mathematical}} model of time-of-flight mass analyzers employing uniform electric fields is presented that allows “exact” calculations of flight times as functions of mass-to-charge ratio, initial velocity and position, applied voltages, and instrument geometry. An “approximate” equation {{based on a}} series expansion of the “exact” result is derived which allows focusing conditions and limits on resolution to be determined for different instrument geometries and operating conditions. The fundamental theory is applied to predicting resolution and mass accuracy in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight. In this case higher order velocity focusing can provide excellent correction for the initial velocity distribution of a selected mass-to-charge ratio, but the focusing is mass-to-charge ratio dependent. There is generally a trade-off between ultimate resolution at a particular mass-to-charge ratio and resolution and mass accuracy over a broad mass range. In most practical applications the latter is more important.
