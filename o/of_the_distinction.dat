5|$|The Court neither {{expressly}} rejected nor {{affirmed the}} abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> in Anisminic {{and its effect}} on the effectiveness of ouster clauses.

The Court did refer to Anisminic but only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all.

25|$|Irish {{independence}} in 1921 was marked more by continuity with the British legal system than with change. The legal profession remained divided between barristers (or abhcóidí in Irish) and solicitors (or aturnaetha in Irish). There was some blurring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between their roles over the years. Notably, under Section 17 of the Courts Act 1971, solicitors were granted {{a right of}} audience in all courts, although in practice relatively few solicitors act as advocates for their clients in the Superior Courts.|$|E
25|$|However, not all Canadians {{believed}} that the Japanese Canadians posed a threat to national security, including select senior officials of the RCMP, Royal Canadian Navy, Department of Labour and Fisheries, among other government agencies. Notable individuals including Hugh Llewellyn Keenleyside, Assistant Under-Secretary at External Affairs during the internment of Japanese Canadians. Ann Sunahara argues that Keenleyside was a sympathetic administrator that advocated strongly against the removal of Japanese Canadians from the BC coast. He, unsuccessfully, tried to remind other government officials <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between Japanese foreign nationals and Canadian citizens in regards to personal and civil rights.|$|E

25|$|Old Norse had {{a stress}} accent which {{fell on the}} first syllable. Several {{scholars}} have proposed that Proto-Norse also had a separate pitch accent, which was inherited from Proto-Indo-European and has evolved into the tonal accents of modern Swedish and Norwegian, which in turn have evolved into the stød of modern Danish. Another recently advanced theory is that each Proto-Norse long syllable and every other short syllable received stress, marked by pitch, eventually leading {{to the development of}} the Swedish and Norwegian tonal accent distinction. Finally, quite a number of linguists have assumed that even the first phonetic rudiments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> didn't appear until the Old Norse period.|$|E

Sibiu was declared the European Capital of Culture of 2007, along with Luxembourg (the bearer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> in 1995). Luxembourg chose {{to share this}} honourable status with Sibiu {{due to the fact}} that many of the Transylvanian Saxons emigrated in the 12th century to Transylvania from the area where Luxembourg is today. Sibiu, or Hermannstadt in German, was built by the Transylvanian Saxons, was for many centuries the cultural centre of that group, and was a predominantly German-speaking city until the mid 20th century. Many Germans left the city after World War II, and especially in 1990, within months of the fall of the Iron Curtain.|$|E
25|$|Regulation of adrenarche and its {{relationship}} to maturation of the hypothalamic-gonadal axis is not fully understood, and some evidence suggests it is a parallel but largely independent process coincident with or even preceding central puberty. Rising levels of adrenal androgens (termed adrenarche) can usually be detected between 6 and 11 years of age, even before the increasing gonadotropin pulses of hypothalamic puberty. Adrenal androgens {{contribute to the development of}} pubic hair (pubarche), adult body odor, and other androgenic changes in both sexes. The primary clinical significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between adrenarche and gonadarche is that pubic hair and body odor changes by themselves do not prove that central puberty is underway for an individual child.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} a new interpretation of Richard Rorty’s notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> private-public <b>distinction.</b> <b>The</b> first section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{article provides}} a short theoretical overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public-private <b>distinction</b> in Rorty’s political thought and clarifies the Rortian terminology. <b>The</b> main portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article {{is dedicated to}} <b>the</b> critique <b>of</b> Rorty’s private-public distinction, divided into two thematic sections: (i) <b>the</b> private-public <b>distinction</b> as undesirable and (ii) <b>the</b> private-public <b>distinction</b> as unattainable. I argue that Rorty’s formulation provides plausible answers to <b>the</b> first kind <b>of</b> criticism, {{but not to the}} second. Finally, a reformulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> private-public <b>distinction</b> will be suggested, which both mitigates <b>the</b> second line <b>of</b> criticism and better coheres with Rorty’s general theory...|$|R

25|$|In Yee Yut Ee, the High Court neither {{expressly}} rejected nor {{affirmed the}} abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors {{of law in}} Anisminic {{and its effect on}} the effectiveness of ouster clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction {{on the part of the}} decision-maker, which was the legal position prior to Anisminic. Although the Court did refer to Anisminic, it did so only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between number and magnitude, {{geometry}} {{became the only}} method that could take into account incommensurable ratios. Because previous numerical foundations were still incompatible {{with the concept of}} incommensurability, Greek focus shifted away from those numerical conceptions such as algebra and focused almost exclusively on geometry. In fact, in many cases algebraic conceptions were reformulated into geometrical terms. This may account for why we still conceive of x2 or x3 as x squared and x cubed instead of x second power and x third power. Also crucial to Zeno’s work with incommensurable magnitudes was the fundamental focus on deductive reasoning that resulted from the foundational shattering of earlier Greek mathematics. The realization that some basic conception within the existing theory was at odds with reality necessitated a complete and thorough investigation of the axioms and assumptions that underlie that theory. Out of this necessity, Eudoxus developed his method of exhaustion, a kind of reductio ad absurdum that “…established the deductive organization on the basis of explicit axioms…” as well as “…reinforced the earlier decision to rely on deductive reasoning for proof.” This method of exhaustion {{is the first step in}} the creation of calculus.|$|E
25|$|Second, the Zabbaleen are {{the group}} that {{actually}} collects the garbage on donkey-pulled carts, separate out recyclables, breed pigs, {{an important component of}} their recycling system, and engage in a highly efficient process of recycling, whereas the Wahiya do not. The Zabbaleen also sell the sorted secondary materials such as paper, tin, glass, plastic materials, rags, and aluminum cans to intermediaries. Because Cairenes are generally not aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between the wahiya and the Zabbaleen (also called zarraba), they continue to refer to both groups as Zabbaleen. It should be noted, however, that these two groups are distinct, serving different functions in the informal economy of collecting Cairo’s municipal solid waste (MSW). In response to government pressures to upgrade and modernize the refuse collection system, the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen made an agreement which resulted in the establishment of the Environmental Protection Company, as a private-for-profit company in 1989. Within the framework of the EPC, the wahiya contracted groups of Zabbaleen to collect and dispose of MSW. The Wahiya continued to collect the user fees from tenants, but also resumed the responsibility to cover hauling costs out of the fees they collected for the first time. The formation of the EPC was significant in that it established the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen as key participants in the collection of MSW, even though responsibility for MSW had been shared between the municipal sanitation service and the Zabbaleen since many prior decades.|$|E
