5|$|Self-referencing is {{a feature}} {{specific}} to Kiarostami's cinema. Stephen Bransford contends that Kiarostami's films {{do not contain}} references {{to the work of}} other directors, but do include a myriad <b>of</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> his own work. Bransford believes his films are often fashioned into an ongoing dialectic: one film reflecting on and partially demystifying an earlier film.|$|E
5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to {{the context in which the}} mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue <b>of</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to the sophistication of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E
5|$|The Sundanese author M.A.Salmoen classifies Joehana as a realist. Rosidi {{writes that}} {{a sense of}} realism was {{promoted}} in Joehana's writings through the use <b>of</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> existing (and often popular) brands of products, including cigars, salted fish, and biscuits (though, as Joehana wrote for persons in contemporary Bandung who were expected to know these products, they are not given any in-text explanation). Joehana used real-life Bandung locations in his novels, and local figures prominent in the news (such as the pickpocket Salim) are mentioned in passing. There is also {{the possibility that the}} use of such names are a form of product placement, in which Joehana was paid to include the names of the products in his novels; this payment may not have been direct, but in the form of goods or services, or a donation to Sarekat Rakyat.|$|E

5|$|To {{appeal to}} Degrassi's {{established}} audience, a number <b>of</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> events which occurred in Degrassi Junior High, Degrassi High and School's Out were {{written into the}} episode. Throughout those two series, Joey would frequently wear a fedora which became that character's trademark prop. The fedora made a reappearance in this episode, and was worn by Manny, Spike, Snake, Caitlin and Lucy, but not Joey, and it appeared in every scene which featured a character from the old series. The accident in School's Out when Wheels hit Lucy while drink-driving was discussed twice, first at the bar when the characters were discussing their lives, and a second time when Wheels came to the reunion to apologize to Lucy. Finally, Joey and Caitlin made amends; their relationship had ended when he cheated on her with Tessa in School's Out.|$|E
5|$|Leif's {{successful}} expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to {{also make}} the journey. The first apparent contact between the Norse and the indigenous people, who the Norse later referred to as skrælingjar, was made by his brother Thorvald, and resulted in hostilities and killing. In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements in Vinland, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries. The casual tone <b>of</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries, or that it {{was assumed to be}} public knowledge, or both. Knowledge of the Vinland journeys might have spread around medieval Europe, as writers such as Adam of Bremen made mention of remote lands to the west. It has been suggested that the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have heard stories of it.|$|E

25|$|Believers in the {{authenticity}} of the Zohar countered that the lack <b>of</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> the work in Jewish literature were because bar Yohai did not commit his teachings to writing but transmitted them orally to his disciples over generations until finally the doctrines were embodied in the Zohar.
