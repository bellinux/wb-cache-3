Just under two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> can be identified by name. This is possible since, unlike other Allied aces, a substantial proportion of McCudden's claims were made over Allied-held territory. The majority of his successes were achieved with 56 Squadron RFC and all but five fell while flying the S.E.5a.|$|E

5|$|In {{a series}} of appeals, defense {{attorneys}} presented mitigating evidence of the troubled upbringing of Gardner, who had spent nearly his entire adult life in incarceration. His request for commutation of his death sentence was denied in 2010 after the families <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> testified against him. Gardner's legal team took the case {{all the way to}} the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to intervene.|$|E
5|$|Medical experiments, {{many of them}} pseudoscientific, were {{performed}} on concentration camp inmates beginning in 1941. The most notorious doctor to perform medical experiments was SS-Hauptsturmführer Dr. Josef Mengele, camp doctor at Auschwitz. Many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> died or were intentionally killed. Concentration camp inmates were made available for purchase by pharmaceutical companies for drug testing and other experiments.|$|E

5|$|A week later, Marsh's {{action was}} again under {{scrutiny}} {{when he played}} his second shield match against Victoria in Melbourne. While Richard Callaway—the New South Wales umpire officiating the match—was satisfied with Marsh's bowling action, his Victorian counterpart Bob Crockett was concerned with the twisting of the bowler's wrist. Crockett no-balled Marsh {{three times in the}} match, but was reluctant to elucidate on the reasons for his call. Marsh took 3/39 and 3/51 respectively, dismissing Test batsmen Peter McAlister, Warwick Armstrong, Jack Worrall and Frank Laver. Marsh bowled three <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his young female victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes {{for hours at a}} time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims,</b> and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment {{for a period of time}} as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.|$|E
5|$|In the Third Test in Cape Town, Macartney scored 44, {{before taking}} 5/44 {{in the second}} innings to ensure that Australia would only have to chase a solitary run. He bowled three <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> and removed Billy Zulch twice. The hosts {{struggled}} against the dual spin of Macartney and Mailey. Australians went on to secure a ten-wicket victory. Macartney finished the Test series with seven wickets at 14.86. He totalled 492 runs at 70.28 and 14 wickets at 17.14 for the tour, against topping the batting averages.|$|E

5|$|Johnston {{could not}} {{maintain}} his {{form in the}} 1952–53 home series against South Africa. In the three matches leading up the Tests, he took only six wickets at 44.83 for Victoria. Johnston took match figures of 3/83, 2/114 and 2/97 as the first three Tests were won, lost and won, respectively. In the meantime, he took his career-best performance at first-class level, taking 8/52 in the first innings of a match against Queensland, which remained his best first-class innings analysis. He added 2/59 in the second innings to help set up a nine-wicket win. In the return match, he took 4/92 and 6/54 {{to set up a}} seven-wicket win, with six <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> being Test players.|$|E
5|$|On 4/5 May the Luftwaffe hit Exeter severely. That night MacLachlan claimed {{destroyed}} two He 111s of Küstenfliegergruppe 506. He trailed the German bombers back to France {{and attacked}} {{them where they}} believed they were safe. In fact both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> were Ju 88s which crashed near Dinard. From Feldwebel Robert Bogel's Wrk Nr. 1528, only the gunner was able to bail out, while observer Leutnant zur See (naval rank) Roman Wallner and Obergefreiter Johan Beibl were killed. There was only one survivor from Unteroffizier Josef Palmer's Ju 88D-4 Wrk Nr. 1154; Unteroffizier Karl Schorn managed to bail out but Leutnant zur See Ernst Tramp and Richard Staub were killed.|$|E
5|$|Three court {{appointed}} psychiatrists found Kemper to {{be legally}} sane. One of the psychiatrists, Dr. Joel Fort, investigated his juvenile records and the diagnosis {{that he was}} once psychotic. He also interviewed Kemper, including under truth serum, and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in cannibalism, alleging that Kemper sliced flesh from the legs <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims,</b> then cooked and consumed these strips of flesh in a casserole. Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully cognizant in each case, and stated that Kemper enjoyed {{the prospect of the}} infamy associated with being labeled a serial killer.|$|E

5|$|Victoria won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. Illingworth {{came to the}} crease at 7/109 and scored 22 before being {{dismissed}} at 8/154 his team were bowled out for 214. He then took 3/43, all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> being top seven batsmen, as the hosts bowled Tasmania out for 119 to take a 95-run lead. He then made four as Victoria made 8/286 declared, leaving Tasmania with a target of 392. Illingworth took his career best figures of 4/28, removing Tasmania's first four batsmen, as his team took a 190-run win.|$|E
5|$|With matters {{now turned}} to actual bowling, Lindwall's {{classical}} bowling action evoked as much public interest as his captain's batting. In a match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge he took 6/14, {{to gain a}} psychological blow for the forthcoming Test at the same venue. Three <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> were castled by his yorker. In the following match he twice skittled Sussex with match figures of 11/59, five of whom were bowled by yorkers, as the hosts were bowled out for 86 and 138 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Johnston practised {{his pace}} bowling with new vigour, {{and at the}} start of the 1947–48 season, the fruits of his labour {{provided}} immediate dividends. In the opening match of the season, he delivered an opening burst of 3/0 for Victoria against the touring Indian team, removing Vinoo Mankad, Khandu Rangnekar and leading batsman Vijay Hazare, all for ducks. He took three more wickets in the second innings, to end with a match total of 6/96, including Hazare for the second time. Johnston was then called into an Australian XI that played the Indians before the Tests, in what was effectively a dress rehearsal. Although the hosts lost, Johnston took 6/141, all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> being frontline batsmen. In the last outing before the Tests, Johnston took 3/40 and 5/37 to set up a nine-wicket win over New South Wales, including the wickets of Test openers Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris with the new ball {{at the start of}} the match.|$|E

5000|$|Death always kills <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> in {{particularly}} gruesome ways. <b>His</b> primary method <b>of</b> {{killing is}} to thrust his razor sharp {{fingers into the}} body <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> and then squeeze the heart until it bursts, aided by his ability to [...] "phase" [...] through physical matter like a ghost.|$|R
5|$|McCabe {{was unable}} to {{translate}} the success into the Test arena, where McCabe struggled despite his team's 50 sweep over South Africa. McCabe warmed up for the series by scoring 37 and 79 not out and totalling 3/108 in a state match against the tourists. After managing only 27 in an innings victory in the First Test, McCabe saved his most productive Test of the summer for his home crowd for the Second Test at Sydney. He took 4/13 in the first innings, bowling or trapping all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> leg before wicket, and then compiled 79 as Australia cruised to another innings win. McCabe scored 22 and 71 and took two wickets in the Third Test win in Melbourne, but managed only two runs and three wickets {{in the last two}} Tests, which Australia won by an innings. McCabe ended the series with 201 runs at 33.50 and nine wickets at 22.77. McCabe ended the season with 783 runs at 87.00 and 19 wickets at 23.94.|$|E
5|$|Miller took 2/32 in 11 overs, bowling both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> as {{the hosts}} were {{dismissed}} for 270 {{on the first}} day. The Victorian paceman also {{had a chance to}} bowl at Bradman—who made a hundred—for a period. On the second day, Miller came to the crease at 2/171 to join Ken Meuleman after the openers had laid the platform with an opening stand of 158 runs. The pair added 26 runs before Meuleman fell at 3/197 and was replaced by Hassett. The pair batted {{until the end of the}} day as Victoria reached 3/285 at stumps to take first innings points, with Miller on 56 and Hassett 43. The next day, they continued to 188 and 114 respectively, their 224-run partnership ending when Phil Ridings bowled Hassett. This precipitated a collapse of 7/39 as Victoria finished at 548. Amid the visitors' faltering innings, it had taken a run out to remove Miller.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December, {{he claimed}} two {{victories}} (nos 7–8). In the Gjirokastër area, Pattle shot down an IMAM Ro.37bis from 42a Squadriglia, 72o Gruppo, and Sergente Luigi Del Manno and his observer, Tenente Michele Milano, were both killed. In the afternoon, Pattle shot down another Ro.37bis from 72oGruppo near Permet, killing Capitano Fuchs and Sergente Vescia. On 4 December 1940, the RAF claimed nine Fiat CR.42s destroyed and two probables. Pattle — whose own aircraft {{was hit in}} the main fuel tank and a wing strut — claimed three CR.42s plus another and a Fiat CR.42 as probable victories — he had seen two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> bail out. According to Italian combat records, 150° Gruppo, involved in that combat, lost just two CR.42s. Tenente Alberto Triolo and Sottotenente Paolo Penna were killed in action.|$|E
