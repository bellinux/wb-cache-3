30|$|The LTE release 8 and 9 employ {{messages}} for ICIC {{that can be}} exchanged between eNB's via the X 2 interface, {{such as the following}} three indicators [38]: (1) Relative narrowband transmit power (RNTP) indicator is used by a certain cell to inform neighboring cells which DL RB's it is using to serve UE's within and transmit power level for the corresponding RB's. (2) <b>Overload</b> <b>indicator</b> (OI) is used to inform neighboring eNB's on a certain eNB's self-estimated interference level on UL RB's. When other eNB's receive this information, they would attempt to reschedule or reduce activities on those RB's. (3) High interference indicator (HII) allows one eNB to warn neighboring eNB's that certain UL RB's will be heavily loaded in the near future to serve its own cell-edge UE's. Other eNB's would abstain from using those RB's to avoid mutual interference.|$|E

40|$|The Rane ME 15 S microGraphic Equalizer is a two-channel, 2 / 3 -octave {{design with}} 20 mm sliders {{in a single}} rack space unit. It {{features}} a Range switch for high slider resolution in the ± 6 dB mode, equivalent resolution to 45 mm sliders found on double rack-space models. The ± 12 dB mode provides {{a wide range of}} control over system audio. The active filter sections feature Rane’s innovative constant-Q (constant bandwidth) design. Constant-Q means the bandwidth of each individual filter is guaranteed to be narrow enough to prevent unwarranted interaction between filters, yet wide enough to produce exactly the type of correction curve demanded by even the most unusual acoustic surroundings. This differs dramatically from conventional designs of the past, encumbered with the unfortunate characteristic of changing bandwidth when changing boost/cut amounts. Front panel controls and indicators include an overall rotary Level control for each channel as well as <b>Overload</b> <b>indicators.</b> Passive pushbutton Bypass switches feature LED indicators, avoiding ambiguity by being on when the unit is Bypassed.

30|$|ICIC is a SON function, {{which aims}} to {{minimize}} interference among cells using the same spectrum. It involves the coordination of physical resources between neighboring cells to reduce interference from one cell to another. ICIC {{can be done in}} both uplink and downlink for the data channels physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) and physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) or uplink control channel physical downlink control channel (PDCCH). ICIC can be static, semi-static, or dynamic. Dynamic ICIC relies on frequent adjustments of parameters, supported by signaling among cells over X 2 interface. To support proactive coordination among cells, the high interference indicator (HII) and the relative narrowband transmit power (RNTP) indicators have been defined, while to support reactive coordination, the <b>overload</b> <b>indicator</b> (OI) has been introduced [33]. Parameters that may be tuned are the transmission power, the pilot power, antenna parameters (azimuth and tilt), and the support of coordinated almost blank subframes (ABS).|$|E
30|$|In a 3 rd Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution-Advanced (3 GPP LTE-A) uplink, the {{orthogonality}} {{provided by}} single carrier-frequency {{division multiple access}} (SC-FDMA) removes intra-cell interference—i.e., the interference between users in the same cell [1]. However, the inter-cell interference problem remains to be solved because the band allocated to a user in a cell {{can be used by}} another user in any of the neighboring cells. In a conventional homogeneous network—i.e., a network based on macro cells only—fractional power control (FPC) is used to cope with inter-cell interference [1, 2]. The impact of the FPC scheme on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) was evaluated in [3, 4] in detail. The FPC scheme partially compensates for the pathloss such that users with high pathloss will operate at a low SINR requirement, thus reducing interference caused to the neighboring cells. In the <b>overload</b> <b>indicator</b> (OI)-based uplink power control proposed in [5], the base station measures the uplink interference and sends the OI to the neighboring base stations to broadcast its interference situation. Based on the number of OIs received, the target’s received power is dynamically adjusted to control the uplink transmission power and avoid system interference.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: Os Transtornos Mentais Comuns (TMC) acometem mais frequentemente as mulheres. A baixa gratificação e a falta de visibilidade na realização do trabalho doméstico constituem quadro determinante para esse adoecimento psíquico. OBJETIVOS: Avaliar a associação entre sobrecarga doméstica e a ocorrência de transtornos mentais comuns em mulheres da zona urbana do município de Feira de Santana - BA. METODOLOGIA: Estudo epidemiológico de corte {{transversal}} incluindo 2. 057 mulheres com 15 anos ou mais de idade, selecionadas através de amostragem aleatória por conglomerado. O indicador de sobrecarga doméstica foi criado a partir das atividades domésticas: lavar, passar, limpar e cozinhar, ponderadas pelo número de moradores do domicílio. Os transtornos mentais comuns foram avaliados através do SRQ- 20. RESULTADOS: Mulheres com alta sobrecarga doméstica apresentaram prevalência de TMC mais elevada do que as mulheres com baixa sobrecarga: 45, 6 % contra 36, 2 %. A análise de regressão logística múltipla confirmou associação entre sobrecarga doméstica e TMC (RP: 1, 23; IC 95 %: 1, 05 - 1, 44), ajustada pelas variáveis renda, escolaridade e atividades de lazer. CONCLUSÃO: Os achados sustentam a hipótese de que o trabalho doméstico, em elevada sobrecarga, está associado a transtornos mentais. INTRODUCTION: Common {{mental disorders}} (CMD) are more frequent in women. Low reward {{and lack of}} visibility in performing housework are the determining factors for these psychological illnesses. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between housework overload and the occurrence of common mental disorders in women living in the urban zone of the municipality of Feira de Santana, Bahia.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a user evaluation study exploring the usefulness of personalized access to scholarly journals and services with regard to the information behaviour of scientists. The aim was to investigate what factors would be critical to personalization, what personalization features would be relevant and to what extent profile and behaviour based personalization would be acceptable. Three providers of personalized access to scholarly journals and services formed the basis of the study. The user group was fourteen doctoral students. Personalization was found to be associated with expectations of increased efficiency compared to traditional searching, emphasizing the need for functionality oriented features such as search alerts. Profile based personalization was to some extent positively associated with reduction of information <b>overload.</b> Various quality <b>indicators</b> were found to affect the perceived reliability of a service, making trust a critical theme when establishing a personalized user experience.

40|$|We {{explored}} whether teams develop shared perceptions {{regarding the}} quantity and quality of information and the extent of participation in decision making provided in an environment of continuous change. In addition, we examined whether change climate strength moderated relationships between change climate level and team outcomes. We examined relationships among aggregated change information and change participation and aggregated team outcomes, including two role stressors (i. e., role ambiguity and role <b>overload)</b> and two <b>indicators</b> of well-being (i. e., quality of worklife and distress). Questionnaires were distributed in an Australian law enforcement agency and data were used from 178 teams. Structural equation modelling analyses, controlling for a marker variable, were conducted to examine the main effects of aggregated change information and aggregated change participation on aggregated team outcomes. Results provided support for a model that included method effects due to a marker variable. In this model, change information climate was significantly negatively associated with role ambiguity, role overload, and distress, and significantly positively associated with quality of worklife. Change participation climate was significantly positively associated with quality of worklife. Change climate strength did not moderate relationships among change climate level and team outcomes. © 2009 Psychology Press...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Work stress has a {{substantial}} impact on employees, organisations and economies; {{especially in the}} fragile economic environment since the ‘Great Recession’ of 2008; which has seen employment levels drop and employees willing to endure more stress at work to avoid retrenchment. These impacts include serious health and financial consequences. Attempts should therefore be made to effectively manage and address work stress to lessen these dire consequences. Many models have been developed and theorised to assist in explaining work stress, the pinnacle of these being the job demands-resources (JD-R) model. In JD-R theory, the dual process explains that work-related well-being follows the following processes: An energetic, also called the health impairment process, in which job demands leads to ill health outcomes through burnout; and then a motivational process which presents that job resources leads to positive organisational outcomes, e. g. organisational commitment, through engagement. The main objectives of this research were 1) to investigate a JD-R model in a large South African sample with a categorical estimator; 2) to investigate the reversed causal hypotheses of burnout and engagement in job demands-resources theory over time; 3) to investigate the likelihood of reporting treatment for health conditions based on burnout and engagement, and 4) to investigate the link between burnout and objective financial outcomes, i. e. by medical aid provider expenditure. To achieve the first objective a cross-sectional design was used (n = 15 633) covering numerous sectors in South Africa. A dual process model was specified with job demands (work overload) leading to ill health through burnout, and job resources (colleague and supervisor support, communication, growth opportunities and role clarity) leading to organisational commitment through engagement. Results of structural equation modelling indicated that the proposed JD-R model was a good fit to the sample. Furthermore, burnout was found to mediate the relationship between job demands and ill health with a medium effect. Engagement was found to mediate the relationship between job resources and organisational commitment with a large effect. The second objective, concerning reversed causality, was achieved with a longitudinal design (n = 593). The hypothesized model included burnout and engagement at time one, and at time two work <b>overload</b> as <b>indicator</b> of job demands, and colleague and supervisor support, communication, growth opportunities and role clarity as indicators of job resources. Results indicated that burnout had a significant negative reversed causal effect to supervisor support and colleague support. Engagement showed only one significant result, i. e. a small negative reversed causal relationship with supervisor support. To achieve the third objective, a cross-sectional design was used (n = 7 895). Results for logistic regression analyses showed that an increase in burnout {{was associated with a}} significant increase in the estimated odds for reporting an affirmative answer for receiving treatment for any of the health conditions, i. e. cardiovascular conditions, cholesterol, depression, diabetes, hypertension and irritable bowel syndrome. In contrast, an increase in engagement was associated with a decrease in affirmative reporting for cardiovascular conditions, cholesterol and depression; but not for diabetes, hypertension or irritable bowel syndrome. Addressing the link between burnout and financial outcomes was the fourth objective; and met with a cross-sectional design (n = 3 182). Participants were divided into a high and low burnout group based on the comorbidity of exhaustion and cynicism Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was implemented, controlling for age and gender, to investigate the difference in medical aid provider expenditure of the two groups. Results revealed that expenditure in the high burnout group was consistently more in all cases, compared to the low burnout group. By way of conclusion, the implications of the research were discussed and recommendations for managers and for future research were made. Doctora...|$|R
30|$|In the literature, several {{power control}} schemes have been proposed. Fractional power control (FPC) has been {{selected}} for the {{physical uplink shared channel}} (PUSCH) in LTE [10, 11]. A performance analysis of open-loop FPC is presented in [12, 13]. Such an analysis is extended in [14 - 16] to closed-loop behavior. Later studies have evaluated more sophisticated power control schemes for LTE, which take into account interference and load conditions [17, 18]. In [19], a parameter sensitivity analysis for the standardized FPC algorithm is carried out based on system-level simulations. As a result, a suboptimal parameter configuration is suggested for interference-limited and noise-limited macro-cellular scenarios. However, finding the best parameter configuration for every cell in the network is a more challenging task, since the underlying problem is a large-scale non-separable non-linear optimization problem. In [20], the adjustment of ULPC parameters in a single cell is formulated as a classical optimization problem with average throughput and cell throughput as alternative figures of merit. The latter analysis is extended to a multi-cell scenario in [21] by formulating ULPC as a non-cooperative game model. Then, a heuristic iterative optimization algorithm is proposed, where cells report UL power settings to the network management system and exchange power and interference information with their neighbor cells. In [22], a self-planning method is proposed for selecting the best parameter settings in FPC on a per-cell basis in an irregular LTE scenario. The proposal is based on an exhaustive search approach using Taguchi’s method over a system-level simulator. A more computationally efficient planning method is presented in [23]. The core of the method is an analytical model that predicts the influence of the nominal power (a.k.a. power offset) and path-loss compensation factor on call acceptance probability for a given spatial user distribution. A suboptimal value of these parameters is computed on a per-cell basis by a randomized local greedy search algorithm. Alternatively, other studies consider tuning algorithms for the network operational stage. For instance, a self-tuning algorithm is proposed in [24] to dynamically adjust nominal power parameter based on <b>overload</b> <b>indicator</b> [25] so as to control the overall interference in the network. Similarly, in [26], a self-tuning algorithm for FPC is proposed based on fuzzy-reinforcement learning techniques. These self-tuning algorithms, conceived to be executed during network operation, can also be applied to network planning, provided that a system performance model is available. However, most self-tuning algorithms rely on iterations that require evaluating system performance for many different parameter settings. This iterative process is straight-forward for live networks due to the availability of performance measurements. However, {{this is not the case}} of network planning, where computations required to measure the quality of a new parameter plan at every iteration may jeopardize method scalability when large scenarios are considered. For this reason, most ULPC planning methods in the literature rely on simple analytical models for system performance assessment. To the authors’ knowledge, few of them can handle irregular scenarios at a low computational cost and none of them considers closed-loop performance.|$|E
40|$|Florida International University's (FIU) Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) {{evaluated}} five saws {{for their}} effectiveness in cutting up specially prepared fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. These crates were built as surrogates for crates that presently hold radioactive contaminated glove boxes at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos facility. The Adamant circular saw was assessed on August 14, 2001. During the FIU test of efficacy, {{a team from}} the Operating Engineers National Hazmat Program (OENHP) evaluated {{the occupational safety and}} health issues associated with this technology. The Adamant was only used during a limited ''test'' on a regular plywood crate due to safety considerations of the tool for this application. The Adamant circular saw, a counter-rotating twin-cutter, constructed with blades that work differently than conventional cutting wheels with twin blades, each rotating in opposite directions. It is used to cut wood and metals. Each blade is approximately 8 3 / 4 inches in diameter with a maximum cutting depth of 2 1 / 2 inches. The machine has two rotation speeds: 1, 900 and 2, 900 rotations per minute (rpm). The saw is operated with an interlocked, guarded trigger switch located at the end of the saw opposite the cutting blades. To operate the saw, the safety interlock must be depressed prior to powering the saw with the trigger control. The saw is supported by a handle at the front of the saw near the cutting blades. The top part of the blades is guarded near the handle, with approximately three-fourths of the face of the blades exposed. The Adamant circular saw is an innovative technology used to cut metals and wood. Its safety features include: interlocking switch for powering the saw, <b>overload</b> <b>indicator</b> and shutoff, and an electronic brake that stops the engine immediately when the start button is released. The top part of the blades is guarded near the motor. With approximately three-fourths of the face of the blades open, the operator is exposed to the potential risk of serious and minor cuts and abrasions when using and handling the saw. There is also potential for damage to the blades if the saw is not stored properly. Without guarding on the lower part of the blades, these can be damaged if the saw is dropped or rested on the cutting blades. Based upon the industrial hygiene sampling conducted for the other four saws demonstrated at FIU, noise levels, nuisance dust, and airborne fiberglass may be a problem when using this technology for the cutting of fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. No industrial hygiene sampling was conducted while the Adamant saw was in use. Engineering controls should be used to eliminate these problems whenever possible. Where this is not possible, administrative controls, training, and proper personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used. Respirators should be used if engineering controls do not sufficiently control the dust or fiberglass generated. Respirators should be equipped with an organic vapor and acid gas cartridge with High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, since during the demonstration, the workers complained of an odd smell, which may have been the breakdown of the fiberglass...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Mitral {{regurgitation}} (MR) in dogs is characterised on radiographs {{by increasing}} {{size of the}} heart, called “general heart enlargement. ” The appearance suggests that the right heart chambers may be enlarged, {{but there is no}} agreement on this, or if present, its cause. Concurrent enlargement of the right heart chambers in MR would have to be explained by pathophysiologic mechanisms that might affect prognosis and treatment. Aim. To determine presence or absence of echocardiographic changes that indicate right sided heart enlargement in relation to severity of MR. Materials and methods. Two-dimensional (2 -D) echocardiograhic frames of 54 dogs with varying degrees of MR were measured to determine ratios of dimensions of left and right sides of the heart: dimensions of right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) in transverse short axis view above mitral valve (MV) at end diastole (ED), dimension of right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) on long axis at the MV at ED, on transverse section, the septal-free wall angle (SFWA) at ED and ES where the endocardium of RV joined LV. An eccentricity index (EI) of the LV at end diastole (ED) and end systole (ES) was measured to detemine the degree of flattening of the interventricular septum as a measure of RV <b>overload.</b> As the <b>indicator</b> of MR severity, left atrium/aorta root (LA/ Ao) was measured at beginning of diastole. Radiographs of 42 dogs were available. Heart size was measured by the vertebral heart scale (VHS) method. Dimensions were compared with LA/Ao and VHS by regression. The effect of severe LA and heart enlargement on EI were compared with none-moderate enlargement. EI at ED and ES were compared. Results. The longitudinal and transverse dimensions of right and left side and the SFWA were so variable that although the right side and angle did not increase, no conclusions could be made. ED EI showed no increase in eccentricity with increasing size of LA or VHS. ES EI increased with LA /Ao and VHS, due to increases in some severly enlarged hearts. Five hearts had greater eccentricity at ES, indicating pressure overload on the RV. Three hearts had eccentricity only at ED, indicating volume overload. Conclusions. No evidence for a consistent effect of increasing sevrity of MR on the right ventricle was found. In “general heart enlargement” on radiographs, {{it is unlikely that the}} right side of the heart enlarges in proportion to severity of MR. The convexity on radiographs is probably caused by the right heart chambers being displaced by enlarged left side of heart. The RV may be volume or pressure overloaded in some cases of MR...|$|R
