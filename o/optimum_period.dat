The research was done in Sawiran orchard, Dawuhan Sengon village, Purwodadi subdistrict, Pasuruan residence, with height 800 m on sea. The research application was done in December 2009 to April 2010. The research was done by experiment method. Grouped random design arranged in factorial with two factors.

This creates a situation that is the opposite of what the Interstate Agreement was intended to do: The Agreement is based on a legislative finding that [...] "charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, information or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation." [...] Art. I. As has been explained:"The inmate who has a detainer against him is filled with anxiety and apprehension and frequently does not respond to a training program.

This study clarifies the impact of citemene system on the environment by analyzing 1) ecological fallow periods, 2) effects of burning on vegetation, and 3) <b>optimum</b> fallow <b>periods</b> in both the tree-cutting area and the garden area. 1) In the tree-cutting area, a fallow period of 30 years is required to reach a proto-climax stage of the woodland after cutting and burning trees (ecological fallow periods). In the garden area, fallow period should be more than 50 years. 2) At the early stage of regeneration, the miombo woodland species dominated the tree-cutting area, while species of the open woodland and chipya forest dominated in the garden area. The difference in vegetation between the two areas tended to become reduced as the fallow <b>period</b> increases. 3) <b>Optimum</b> fallow <b>periods</b> which may supply enough biomass for finger millet production and make sustainable utilization of miombo woodland possible, were estimated to be 16 years for the tree-cutting area and about 35 to 40 years for the garden area. A fallow period shorter than the <b>optimum</b> fallow <b>period,</b> is likely to diminish wood biomass and yield of finger milet. To avoid such situations, the Bemba have traditionally moved villages or built seasonal dwelling for citemene cultivation which are far from the settlement...|$|R

With this system, the <b>optimum</b> <b>periods</b> for eliciting differences between vaccinated and control measures varied according to the sign used; it was later for follicles than for inflammation or inclusions.

40|$|The {{addition}} of lime into soils {{has been widely}} used to stabilize the expansive sub-grade soils when the road pavements are constructed on them. It is common practice to apply a half of the required lime amount and allow a certain time period for lime to react with soils (Amelioration period) before applying the rest of lime and compacting the sub-grade. The <b>optimum</b> amelioration <b>period</b> is essential to minimize the construction delay and to gain the higher strength.
