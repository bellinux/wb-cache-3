Laird recalled, [...] "I heard her sing an odd phrase or two and thought, 'God that's a big voice out <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>little</b> girl,'" [...] The next summer, she played Dainty June in summer stock, and in 1962 she recorded her first single. In 1964, she played Liesl in The Sound of Music and Jenny in Riverwind in summer stock at the Mt. Gretna Playhouse (Pennsylvania), and Riverwind again at the Bucks County Playhouse in 1966. Upon graduation from high school, she started working steadily, appearing Off-Broadway in the musicals The Penny Friend (1966) and Curley McDimple (1967) and as a standby on Broadway in The Girl in the Freudian Slip (1967). She made her Broadway debut in Johnny No-Trump in 1967, and next {{appeared as}} George M. Cohan's sister Josie opposite Joel Grey in George M! (1968), winning the Theatre World Award.|$|E
500|$|When Joan Baez {{first met}} Dylan in April 1961, {{she had already}} {{released}} her first album and was acclaimed as the [...] "Queen of Folk". On hearing Dylan perform his song [...] "With God on Our Side," [...] Baez later said, [...] "I never thought anything so powerful could come out <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>little</b> toad". In July 1963, Baez invited Dylan to join her on stage at the Newport Folk Festival, setting the scene for similar duets {{over the next two}} years. By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the U.K, their romantic relationship had begun to fizzle out, as captured in D. A. Pennebaker's documentary film Dont Look Back. Baez later toured with Dylan as a performer on his Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975–76, and sang four songs with Dylan on the live album of the tour, [...] Baez appeared with Dylan in the one-hour TV special Hard Rain, filmed at Fort Collins, Colorado, in May 1976. Baez also starred as 'The Woman In White' in the film Renaldo and Clara (1978), directed by Dylan and filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue. Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 with Carlos Santana.|$|E
500|$|Production of Crash Bandicoot: Warped {{began on}} January 1998, with Naughty Dog given only ten {{and a half}} months and a budget of 2.2 million to {{complete}} the game. Crash Bandicoot - Time Line ] |publisher=Naughty Dog |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }} Programmers Andy Gavin, Stephen White and Greg Omi created three new gameplay engines for the game. Two of the three new engines were three-dimensional in nature and were created for the airplane and jet-ski levels; the third new engine was created for the motorcycle levels in the style of a driving simulator. The new engines combined make up a third of the game, while the other two-thirds of the game consist of the same engine used in the previous games. Jason Rubin explained that the [...] "classic" [...] engine and game style was preserved due {{to the success of the}} previous two games and went on to say that [...] "were we to abandon that style of gameplay, that would mean that we would be abandoning a significant proportion of gamers out there." [...] An arbitrary plane z-buffer was created for the jet-ski and flooded Egyptian hallway levels of the game. To create a completely fluid feel for the water on these levels, an environment map that reflects the sky was fitted onto the surface of the water. A real shadow was given to the Crash character at the request of the Sony Computer Entertainment America producers, who were [...] "sick <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>little</b> discus that's following him around." [...] To create an [...] "arcade" [...] experience in the airplane levels and to differentiate them from flight simulators, the enemy planes were programmed to come out in front of the player and give the player ample time to shoot them before they turn around and shoot the player rather than come up behind the player and hit them from behind. The Relic system was introduced to give players a reason to return to the game after it has been completed.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Iranian {{expatriate}} Azar Nafisi {{published the}} memoir Reading Lolita in Tehran about a covert women's reading group. In an NPR interview Nafisi contrasts the sorrowful and seductive sides of Dolores/Lolita's character. She notes [...] "Because {{her name is}} not Lolita, her real name is Dolores which as you know in Latin means dolour, so her real name is associated with sorrow and with anguish and with innocence, while Lolita becomes a sort of light-headed, seductive, and airy name. The Lolita of our novel is both of these {{at the same time}} and in our culture here today we only associate it with one aspect <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>little</b> girl and the crassest interpretation of her." [...] Following Nafisi's comments, the NPR interviewer, Madeleine Brand, lists as embodiments of the latter side of Lolita, [...] "the Long Island Lolita, Britney Spears, the Olsen twins, and Sue Lyon in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita".|$|E
2500|$|The jury {{took just}} 16 minutes to convict Nodder of Tinsley's abduction. In his summary to the court, Justice Swift paid {{reference}} to Nodder's {{refusal to testify}} at this trial, stating: [...] "Nobody knows what has become <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>little</b> girl... Whatever happened to her, how she fared, who looked after her, where she slept. There is one person in this court who knows, and he is silent... he is silent! He says nothing to you at all... He sits there and never tells you a word. In passing sentence, Justice Swift added: [...] "What you did with that little girl, what became of her, only you know. It may be that time will reveal the dreadful secret you carry in your breast. I cannot tell, but, I am determined that, as far as have part or lot in that dreadful tragedy, I will keep you in custody." [...] He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, to be served at Lincoln Prison.|$|E
