5|$|Grills {{are made}} of several types <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> (often silver, gold or platinum) that are {{sometimes}} inlaid with precious stones; they are generally removable, though some may be permanently attached to the teeth.

5|$|Mouthpieces are {{generally}} made of hard rubber, although some inexpensive mouthpieces {{may be made}} of plastic. Other materials such as crystal/glass, wood, ivory, and metal have also been used. Ligatures are often made <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> and plated in nickel, silver, or gold. Other materials include wire, wire mesh, plastic, naugahyde, string, or leather.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} selected analytical techniques and their applications in the quantitative mapping/(bio) imaging <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> in biological samples. This work presents the advantages and disadvantages as well as the appropriate methods of scope for research. Distribution <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> in biological samples is currently one of the most important issues in physiology, toxicology, pharmacology, and other disciplines where functional information about the distribution <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> is essential. This issue is a subject of research in (bio) imaging/mapping studies, which use a variety of analytical techniques for the identification and determination of metallic elements. Increased interest in analytical techniques enabling the (bio) imaging <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> in a variety of biological material has been observed more recently. Measuring the distribution <b>of</b> trace <b>metals</b> in tissues after a drug dose or ingestion <b>of</b> poison-containing <b>metals</b> allows for the studying of pathomechanisms and the pathophysiology of various diseases and disorders related to the management <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> in human and animal systems...|$|R

5|$|Tellurium and {{tellurium}} compounds {{are considered}} to be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care, although acute poisoning is rare.

5|$|The Deseret {{alphabet}} was purposely {{designed so}} as to not have ascenders and descenders.

30|$|The {{concentrations}} <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> {{in water}} and O. niloticus fish are generally accepted by the international legislation limits. Generally, the value <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> detected in water was lower than those recorded by EPA (2002) for the permissible limits <b>of</b> heavy <b>metals,</b> whereas the concentrations <b>of</b> heavy <b>metals</b> detected in O. niloticus muscles were within the permissible concentrations (PL) recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Mokhtar, 2009).|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> in the sediments of Pampulha Lake {{was investigated}} {{in order to determine}} the bioavailability <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> in these sediments for the cultivation of vegetables such as lettuce. The chemical analyses <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> and As were accomplished by the k 0 neutron activation technique. The plans for recovering this lake foresee the removal of the deposited sediments and transport of the discarded material to a specific area after the dam. The present study suggests that this strategy of discarding sediments doesn't imply any risk for the local population, in relation to the bioavailability <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> in these sediments...|$|R
5|$|The {{absorption}} band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength {{when they are}} involved in more covalent interactions.

5|$|The main armour {{used was}} chainmail hauberks, usually knee-length, with slits to allow riding, some with sleeves to the elbows. Some hauberks {{may have been}} made of scales {{attached}} to a tunic, with the scales made <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> horn or hardened leather. Headgear was usually a conical metal helmet with a band <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> extending down to protect the nose. Horsemen and infantry carried shields. The infantryman's shield was usually round and made of wood, with reinforcement <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b> Horsemen had changed to a kite-shaped shield and were usually armed with a lance. The couched lance, carried tucked against the body under the right arm, was a relatively new refinement and was probably not used at Hastings; the terrain was unfavourable for long cavalry charges. Both the infantry and cavalry usually fought with a straight sword, long and double-edged. The infantry could also use javelins and long spears. Some of the cavalry may have used a mace instead of a sword. Archers would have used a self bow or a crossbow, and most {{would not have had}} armour.|$|E

50|$|It is {{now known}} that aqueous {{concentrations}} <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> are poor predictors of the bioavailability <b>of</b> a particular <b>metal.</b> Further, as the biotic ligand model addresses, the binding <b>of</b> trace <b>metal</b> to a site is not only dependent on the concentration <b>of</b> the <b>metal</b> in question.|$|R

5|$|A remake <b>of</b> <b>Metal</b> Gear Solid, titled Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, was {{developed}} by Silicon Knights {{under the supervision of}} Hideo Kojima and released for the GameCube in North America, Japan, and Europe in March 2004. While Twin Snakes was largely developed at Silicon Knights, its cutscenes were developed in-house at Konami and directed by Japanese film director Ryuhei Kitamura, reflecting his dynamic signature style, utilizing bullet time photography and choreographed gunplay extensively. While the storyline and settings of the game were unchanged (although a select few lines of dialog were re-written more closely resembling the original Japanese version), a variety of gameplay features from Sons of Liberty were added such as the first person aiming and hanging from bars on walls. Another change in the English voice acting was the reduction of Mei Ling's, Naomi's and Nastasha's accents, as well as the recasting of Gray Fox from Greg Eagles, who still reprises the role of the DARPA chief, to Rob Paulsen. The graphics were also updated to match those <b>of</b> <b>Metal</b> Gear Solid 2.|$|E

5|$|Art historians {{disagree}} on when and why onion domes became a typical feature of Russian architecture. Byzantine churches and {{the architecture of}} Kievan Rus were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum.
