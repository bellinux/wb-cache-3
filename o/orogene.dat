Simultaneously with the immersion of the horsts, ongoing and intense erosion is denuding the mountains and supplies the basin with clastic sediments.

40|$|In {{the central}} part of the axial zone of the Pyrenees five {{distinct}} phases of folding have been distinguished from the study of minor structures. Traces of a very early phase have been found only in the northern and southern part of the region, which appear on the map as oblique fold structures, and are most prominent from the divergency of lineations and fold axes in these parts of the region. The present aspect of the mountain chain is primarily due to the effects of the main phase in which strong compression produced tight but non isoclinal folds with axial plane slaty cleavage. In the Garonne Dome the slaty cleavage was initially flatlying, in general parallel to the bedding, but occasional folds with crosscutting cleavage have been found. Steep slaty cleavage folds of the Devonian overlying the flatlying slaty cleavage folds of the Cambro-Ordovician of this dome form a beautiful example of disharmonie folding. The main phase slaty cleavage has been found to be folded in the greater part of the area investigated, generally by small minor accordion folds. In several areas two phases of refolding have been distinguished, one with a trend diagonal to the <b>orogene,</b> one parallel, E—W. The intensity of the refolding is strongest in the oldest strata of the sequence. The succession of phases is evident from the folding of the planes of reference and twisting of the lineations. The patterns of the stereographic plots of data do not always show clear evidence of the succession.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{comprehensive}} data collection mainly from non-destructive XRF core scanner measurements and oxygen isotope data {{have been applied}} for reconstructing and interpreting paleoenvironmental changes in Neogene sediments of the South Atlantic. The obtained data document the geochemical reorganization in the world oceans across the middle to late Miocene transition (basin-to-basin fractionation) which mainly is contributed to the uplift of the Central American Seaway and expansion of the Antarctic ice-sheet. Detailed comparison of carbonate sedimentation patterns from different regions and different water depth clearly show that the carbonate crash events differ substantially in timing and magnitude. In addition, the congruent variability of shallow and deep water carbonate records contradict the assumed gradients between intermediate and deep-water masses as predicted by modeling studies. Furthermore, the present study suggests that interactions exist between the geochemical reorganization of the world oceans and climate events during the Neogene. For example, the close timing of aridification in South Africa and Patagonia, strengthening of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, begin of Benguela upwelling, intensification of Southern Hemisphere winds and expansion of the Antarctic ice-sheet point to a common driving mechanism. The configuration of ocean gateways and sills (i. e. Central American Seaway, Greenland-Scotland Ridge) seem to {{play a key role}} in the observed changes in ocean chemistry.

40|$|Abstract: Documenting {{the timing}} and {{kinematics}} of deformation in orogens is critical to unraveling their history. Ani-sotropy of magnetic susceptibility defines the orientation of magnetic fabrics in the Eocene Cooper Mountain pluton in the North Cascade Mountains of Washington. The magnetic foliation typically has a steep dip and a northwest strike; the magnetic lineation plunges moderately to shallowly northwest or southeast. The remanent magnetization was mea-sured {{to determine if the}} Cooper Mountain pluton has been tilted following emplacement. The remanence has two components. The characteristic remanence typically unblocks at 370 °C in most specimens, but at 580 °C in others. The two components are carried by pyrrhotite and magnetite. Mean directions of these components are indistinguish-able from each other and from the North American expected Eocene direction. The paleomagnetic results and 47 Ma 40 Ar– 39 Ar total fusion ages from biotite suggest that there has been no remagnetization or significant reorientation of the pluton since emplacement. Therefore, the in situ magnetic fabrics from the pluton can be used to understand the ki-nematics. Discordance of the fabrics with the pluton margin and near concordance with regional structures suggests that they have a tectonic origin. Thus the Cooper Mountain pluton is syntectonic rather than posttectonic. The mag-matic fabric is slightly oblique to the length of the Cascade orogen, which can be explained if it formed as a conse-quence of regional dextral shear during transpression.

This outstanding 500 km crustal structure defines an obvious and sharp morphotectonics feature easily recognizable on satellite imagery. Inherited from the Palaeozoic <b>orogenes,</b> the Sayan fault has been working as a left-lateral transform fault during the opening of the Baikal Rift in the Cainozoic time. Despite a very low instrumental seismic activity and few historical earthquakes, Holocene morphotectonics features along the fault attests of its activity and its capacity of producing strong earthquakes. The Sayan fault represents therefore a strong hazard for the city of Irkoutsk, which is located 70 km northwards of its south-eastern tip, and where more than one million people are living. In order to quantify the present kinematics of the fault, to estimate its slip rate and the potential magnitude of earthquakes, we carried out a morphotectonics study within its south-eastern part, between the Baikal Lake and the Irkut River (the only part of the fault relatively accessible, while further west the fault stands in a mountainous area covered with dense forest without any easy access). A reconnaissance trip allowed us finding out a small catchment basin cut by the fault and showing a cumulative offset of several tens of meters. We surveyed the site with a total station to produce a Digital Elevation Model, and we collected samples of the offset surface and the trapped sediments for radiocarbon and OSL dating. In progress analyses should allow us to provide a first estimate of the left-lateral slip rate along the Sayan fault...|$|R
40|$|A large {{proportion}} of the Pliocene and Quaternary basin fill in the Gulf of California is composed of relatively fine-grained mud turbidites which have sedimentary structures that are more subtle than those of sandy turbidites in flysch deposits. Basal contacts are sharp, sometimes accompanied by thin, laminated, muddy sands; the silty body commonly appears massive, and the tops consist of a thin zone with faint burrow traces. The composition, physical properties, tex-tures, and sorting of biogenic components document graded intervals. The composition of these beds reflects source areas ranging from thick, hemipelagic diatom ooze blankets to muddy delta foreslopes. In the Guaymas Basin, these sources lead to two end member types: I, Pale olive to moderate olive brown, nannofossil-bearing diatom ooze to mud, cm-to-decimeter thick; and II, dark to medium olive gray to medium gray, terrigenous, silt-rich muds, from decimeters to over 12 meters thick, with low percentages of biogenic components. Type I is probably redeposited from intrabasinal bathyal slope regions, whereas Type II represents more distal transport from outer, muddy deltaic slopes. The tops of some Type I beds are pure diatom ooze layers, the result of hydraulic sorting. In core sections recovered undisturbed by the hydraulic piston corer, mass physical property gradients for turbidites (water content, wet-bulk density, porosity, shear strength, and shrinkage) are clearly distinguished from the host sediment by their higher bulk densities and lower porosities. Basal parts of turbidites have the lowest porosities but are highly permeable and so function as conduits for pore fluids and are sites for early silica and carbonate diagenesis. This type of mud turbidite facies, commonly with intercalated mud flows, is found in the internal tectonic zones of many <b>orogenes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The crustal {{structure}} of the transition zone between the Eastern Alps and {{the western part of}} the Pannonian depression (Danube basin) is traditionally interpreted in terms of subvertical Tertiary strike-slip and normal faults separating different Alpine tectonic units. Reevaluation of approximately 4000 -km-long hydrocarbon exploration reflection seismic sections and a few deep seismic profiles, together with data from approximately 300 wells, suggests a different structural model. It implies that extensional collapse of the Alpine <b>orogene</b> in the Middle Miocene was controlled by listric normal faults, which usually crosscut Alpine nappes at shallow levels, but at depth merge with overthrust planes separating the different Alpine units. The alternative structural model was tested along a transect across the Danube basin by gravity model calculations, and the results show that the model of low-angle extensional faulting is indeed viable. Regarding the whole lithosphere of the western Pannonian basin, gravity modelling indicates a remarkable asymmetry in the thickness minima of the attenuated crust and upper mantle. The approximately 160 km lateral offset between the two minima suggests that during the Miocene extension of the Pannonian basin detachment of the upper crust from the mantle lithosphere took place along a rheologically weak lower crust...|$|E

Among the most notable features in this region are Moho depths below the Carpathians range, generally between 32 and 37 km (but with some reported values as high as 45 km), and consolidated sediments in the Black Sea reaching thickness from 3 to 12 km.

40|$|The Poitou high of Western France is {{situated}} at the junction between the Paris Basin, the Aquitaine Basin, and two major Variscan metamorphic massifs (Armorican and Central massifs). This area steps over the southern Variscan suture, separating allochtonous units in the south from autochtonous units to the north. We performed joint studies on the metamorphic basement and the Mesozoic sedimentary cover, in the aim to understand {{the influence of the}} structural inheritance of the Variscan <b>orogene</b> on the onset of the Mesozoic basin subsidence. The basement's structure below relatively thin sedimentary cover was reconstructed from geological knowledge and geophysical methods (ground gravimetry and airborne magnetism, BRGM dataset). Palaeogeography and sedimentary geometries were recomposed from field studies and well logs issued from water wells. Mesozoic sedimentation on the Poitou high started during Lower Jurassic (Lias). Our data demonstrate that Liassic subsidence pattern is closely linked to the Variscan orogenic heritage. The autochtonous, poorly deformed thick crust on the northern Poitou high did not subside during most of Lias. On the opposite, in the allochtonous southern part, onset of subsidence took place since the early Liassic times. The first deposits are observed along narrow areas, elongated along N 160 oriented geophysical anomalies. This structural direction corresponds to Late Carboniferous to Permian tardi-orogenic extension. On the opposite, N 110 syn-orogenic structures do not influence the distribution of Lias sediments. Onset of sedimentation, fault plays and subsidence patterns during Lias extension, are thus closely related to the variscan heritage, and particularly with the extensive tardi-orogenic history...|$|E
40|$|The North Atlantic Caledonides are a continent-continent {{collision}} type orogeny {{found in}} WesternScandinavia, Svalbard, Greenland and the British Isles. They {{are thought to}} have formed {{as a result of a}} complex history consisting of repeated ocean opening and closure. The tectonostratigraphy of the Scandinavian Caledonides consists of four allochthons that overlay the crystalline, autochthonous basement. The allochthons {{are thought to have}} been transported hundreds of kilometers eastward during the Scandian collision. To investigate the complex history of the Scandinavian Caledonides, a scientific drilling initiative called the Collisional Orogeny in the Scandinavian Caledonides (COSC) project began in 2014. The first phase of the project was to drill a borehole to approximately 2500 m depth, to sample a thick section of the Lower Seve Nappe of the Middle Allochthon, as well as the underlying thrust zone. The current hypothesis is that the Middle Seve Nappe has been juxtaposed with the Lower Seve Nappe while still in the subduction channel. Both Seve nappes were emplaced onto the underlying units somewhat later. To test this hypothesis, Rb-Sr dating and Ar-Ar dating has been conducted on white and dark mica found in samples taken from the shear zones. Rb-Sr dating yielded an age of 413 ± 12 Ma and Ar-Ar dating yielded an average age of 424. 1 ± 2. 9 Ma. Since the Rb-Sr and Ar-Ar ages overlap, it is interpreted that the crystallization age of the samples is recorded in both cases. Likely, the rocks cooled rather quickly, resulting in a negligible difference in Rb-Sr and Ar-Ar ages. Comparing these results to previous age dating work completed in the same area illustrate a complex subduction/exhumation history. At c. 455 Ma, the Middle and Lower Seve nappes were subducted beneath an island arc and peak pressure metamorphic conditions were reached. Shortly afterwards,exhumation of the subducted sheet began, as a result of the buoyancy of the subducted crust, as well as tectonic under pressure caused by wedge extraction. At c. 424 Ma, the Middle Seve was juxtaposed over the Lower Seve while still in the subduction channel, and at c. 424 - 421. 2 Ma both the Middle and Lower Seve nappes were exhumed and transported eastward, where they were thrust above the underlying Särv Nappe and Lower Allochthon, creating the lower shear zone which is the focus of this study. Data from this study will help to establish a coherent model of mid-Palaeozoic mountain building, and provide insight on how this mountain chain, as well as its Himalaya-Tibet analogue have formed. Den kaledoniska bergskedjan är en kontinent-kontinent kollison <b>orogenes</b> som återfinns i västra Skandinavien, Svalbard, Grönland och på de brittiska öarna. Bergskedjan har formats som ett resultat av en komplicerad historia av repeterad öppning och stängning av Iapetushavet. Skandinaviska kaledoniderna består av fyra allochthoner som täcker urberggrunden. Allochthonerna tros ha blivit transporterade hundratals kilometer i östlig riktning under den Skandiska kollisionen. För att kunna utreda den komplicerade historia som de skandinaviska Kaledoniderna har så har ett borrningsprojekt tagits fram under år 2014 med namnet “Collisional Orogeny in the Scandinavian Caledonides” (COSC). Det första skedet i projektet var att borra ett 2500 meter djupt borrhål för att ta prover från den undre Seveskollan som belägen i den mellersta allochthonen, samt den underliggande överskjutningszonen. Hypotesen är att den mellersta Seveskollan har placerats intill den undre Seveskollan då de befann sig i en subduktionskanal. Både mellersta och undre Seveskollan har placerats uppepå den underliggande bergsenheten något senare. För att testa hypotesen har Rb-Sr och Ar-Ar datering utförts på prover med vitt glimmer som tagits från skjuvzonen. Kompositionskartor av vitt glimmer påvisar inga uppenbara tecken på zonation, vilket innebär att glimmerkornen nyligen bildats eller omkristalliserats under skjuvning. Rb-Sr dateringen gav en ålder på 413 ± 12 miljoner år och Ar-Ar dateringen gav en ålder på 424. 1 ± 2. 9 miljoner år. Detta tolkas som åldern på de omkristalliserade glimmerkornen. Resultatet har jämförts med tidigare åldersdateringar i samma område och påvisar en komplicerad subduktionshistoria. För 460 miljoner år sedan subducerade mellersta och undre Seveskollan under en öbåge. För ungefär 440 miljoner år började upplyftandet av de subducerade skollorna som ett resultat av bärkraften av den subducerande jordskorpan, även av tektoniska rörelser orsakad av en kilutdragning.

A more precise stratigraphic assignment is impossible, {{because of the}} lack of fossils and traceable stratigraphic horizons. The Cambro-Ordovician rocks have undergone four Hercynian deformation phases. Each phase was accompanied by the formation of cleavages (slaty, fracture or crenulation cleavage). In the Vail Ferrera area these four deformation phases are well developed. Their relative age relationships were known from other parts of the Central Pyrenees and could be established in many outcrops. The first deformation, accompanied by a regional synkinematic metamorphism and caused by a N-S compression, divided the <b>orogene</b> into (1) the infrastructure (e. g., the Aston massif) with medium to high grade metamorphism and a flat cleavage plane, and into (2) the suprastructure (e. g., the Salat Pallaresa anticlinorium), with low grade metamorphism and a steep cleavage plane. The second phase produced N-S trending folds and was caused by an E-W compression. The third phase made a conjugate fold system in a NW-SE and a NE-SW direction; the asymmetry proves that an E-W compression caused these folds. The fourth phase was produced by a renewed N-S compression and a vertical E-W cleavage was formed. Finally blockfaulting occurred by which the Mérens fault, which seperates the Aston massif from the Hospitalet massif, was formed. A literature study, concerned with the different types of deformation, shows that the direction of the extension can be parallel or perpendicular to the fold axis with transitions in between.

La zona Ossa-Morena (ZOM) del herc&# 237;nico peninsular posee unas caracter&# 237;sticas peculiares que la diferencian netamente de los otros dominios internos de la Cadena. Se trata de un dominio cortical (microcontinente ?) adosado a la corteza de la Zona Centro-Ib&# 233;rica (ZCI) desde el Paleozoico Inferior. Durante la colisi&# 243;n continental herc&# 237;nica (Palezoico Superior) la ZOM responde de diferente forma que las zonas adyacentes (ZCI) debido a su diferente constituci&# 243;n (menor espesor) y peculiar evoluci&# 243;n preherc&# 237;nica (rifting ordov&# 237;cico). Esta zona y sus equivalentes en otros dominios del herc&# 237;nico peninsular y europeo, tienen fuertes implicaciones en el desarrollo del or&# 243;geno herc&# 237;nico. Parte de la corteza continental de la ZOM fue, junto con la corteza oce&# 225;nica desarrollada localmente en su interior durante el rifting ordov&# 237;cido, obducida sobre los dominios internos (ZCI) en zonas de colisi&# 243;n frontal (e. g. NW peninsular y Macizo C&# 233;ntral Franc&# 233;s) y fuertemente estirada en zonas de colisi&# 243;n oblicua (e. g. ZOM del SW peninsular y dominios norarmoricanos) ...|$|E
40|$|Mt. Vulture volcano {{is located}} in the most {{external}} part of the Apennine <b>orogene</b> (southern Italy), almost {{at the edge of the}} Apulian foreland. The volcanic activity occurred up to 130 Kyrs ago. The volcano is formed by a main feldspar-bearing series of pyroclastic rocks and subordinate lava flows, ranging in composition from basanite and foidite to phonolites (Schiattarella et al., 2005). Rare lava flows and dykes, with distinctly more silica-undersaturated composition melilitites, melilite ankaratrites, and the ‘Melfi’ haüynophyre, were also emplaced. Carbonatite-melilite magmas fed the final phase of volcanism producing maar-type craters. The large Na and S contents of the Vulture magmas (Marini et al., 1994) result in the the widespread presence of sodalite-group phases among the feldespathoids (De Fino et al., 1982; Di Muro et al., 2004). Most groundwaters are characterized by gas bubbling. In order to investigate the origin of solutes a total of 25 springs and wells were analyzed for the major and minor element contents, the isotopic composition of carbon in the total dissolved carbon (TDC) and sulfur in the aqueous sulfate. The chemical data suggest that the effects due to water-rock interaction are largely controlled by the input of CO 2. The dissolution of CO 2 in the water causes a substantial increase in its acidity, thus promoting the alteration of the rocks. Good correlations exist among alkalinity, electric conductibility and Na +, Ca 2 +, SO 4 2 - concentrations. The alkaline-earthbicarbonate and alkaline-bicarbonate compositions of the waters are in keeping with the major role played by CO 2 in the alteration processes. The G 13 C values of TDC corroborate the involvement of two carbon sources. The first one is biogenic CO 2, while the second one is magmatic. The G 34 S values of SO 4 2 - are all positive and similar to those measured by Marini et al. (1994) in the haüynophyre magma, thus supporting for aqueous sulfate a main origin from leaching of volcanites. In few springs, however, some contribution of SO 4 2 - from dissolution of Triassic evaporite at depth cannot be excluded...|$|E
40|$|The {{age of the}} non-metamorphic {{sedimentary}} {{series in}} the Cantabrian mountains ranges from the Cambrian through the Tertiary. The Lower Palaeozoic deposits mainly show a sandy or quartzitic facies, and were deposited in an extensive Cambro-Ordovician geosyncline of which only the miogeosynclinal part is accessible for investigation, the orthogeosynclinal part now being covered by the Mesozoic-Tertiary deposits of the Spanish Meseta. The Caledonian orogeny is expressed in phenomena resulting from igneous activity. The Hercynian orogeny started with epeirogenetic movements during the Upper Devonian (Bretonic phase of Stille). The uplift caused a varying hiatus on which Upper Famennian transgressive sediments are found unconformably overlying anything between the Lower Famennian and the Middle Cambrian. The E-W-trending León line {{played an important role}} during these epeirogenetic movements. In the Asturides north of it, a Central Asturian dome shows an almost constant amount of uplift. Over a very wide area the Upper Famennian rests unconformably on the Lower Ordovician quartzite. Two main stratigraphic and tectonic units are distinguished: 1. The Isidro-Tarna-Ponton subarea. 2. The Mampodre-Fontasguera-Ten subarea. The Upper Famennian transgression was followed by the sedimentation of a uniform limestone during the Visean and Namurian. In the Central Asturian dome region a period of non-deposition or slow sedimentation set in after the sedimentation of the Namurian limestone. Locally, even this limestone was deposited under such conditions. South of the León line, the sedimentation continued with a thick series of mainly clastic deposits (San Emiliano Formation). During the Upper Namurian-Lower Westphalian, tectonic forces (Sudetic phase of Stille) caused nappe and overthrust structures south of the León line, whereas the areas north of this line, the Central Asturian dome region included, acted as a marginal trough to this <b>orogene.</b> The Asturian folding phase started in the Upper Westphalian, during which the Carboniferous basins north of the León line became folded. In the Central Asturian dome region, for example, SW-NE-moving thrust sheets developed, and were refolded in a predominantly E-W direction. Stephanian intramontanous coal basins are found in the present area along the León line. These basins were folded in an E-W direction at some time between the Triassic and Upper Stephanian (Saalic phase of Stille). Features indicative of a Würm glaciation are frequently found in the area under consideration...|$|E
40|$|The Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) Central and East Tennessee (TN) Districts contain {{economically}} significant lead-zinc deposits {{that occur}} in the Early Ordovician carbonates of the Knox Group. Although both districts share similar host rock, have similar temperatures of formation, and typically fill open spaces of collapse breccias or replace their host carbonates, previous studies may suggest that these ores did not form from the same mineralizing fluids and may have different Pb sources. Nu Plasma MC-ICP-MS Pb isotopic analyses on sulfides from Central and East TN were conducted and the metal sources evaluated. Results were plotted on covariation diagrams with respect to the average crustal growth curve from Stacy and Kramers (1975) and the <b>orogene</b> curve from Zartman and Doe (1981). Lead isotope data from both Central and East TN plot beyond the present day age (0 m. y. ago) indicative of a crustal source of Pb-Zn. Central TN 206 Pb/ 204 Pb, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb, and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios range from 19. 334 - 20. 128, 15. 548 - 16. 034, and 38. 837 - 40. 034 respectively. Eastern TN 206 Pb/ 204 Pb, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb, and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios range from 19. 341 - 19. 455, 15. 638 - 15. 789, and 39. 045 - 39. 591 respectively. Pb isotope ratios from the Young Mine in the East TN District plot within ranges defined by other East TN District samples from previous studies. Three Pb isotope ratios from the Elmwood Mine in the Central TN District plot near these East TN samples, while the remaining Elmwood samples remain suspect to analytical error as they plot away from any other recorded Central TN deposits. It appears that the thick, black, metal-rich shales of the Appalachian Basin have been the source of the Pb-Zn and ore fluids of MVT deposits that formed the East TN deposits. When East TN Pb data from this study are compared to Central TN Pb data from previous studies, Central TN Pb is commonly more radiogenic, suggestive of a mineralizing fluid with different compositions. Further analysis of Central TN Pb deposits is needed to further constrain this source...|$|E
40|$|A {{synthesis}} {{of the development of}} the Variscan <b>orogene,</b> of which the present Cantabrian Mountains form only a part, was given by Matte (1968). Wagner (1970) presented a general outline of Carboniferous stratigraphy in this area. For purposes of a general background it is sufficient to state that from the Lower Cambrian {{until the end of the}} Devonian, sedimentation in this area was typical of a stable shelf environment. Formations can be traced over tens to hundreds of kilometres and most sediments are evidently shallow water deposits. This entire sedimentary pile has a thickness in the order of 2 to 3 km. Towards the end of the Devonian, uplift and erosion (de Sitter, 1965; van Adrichem Boogaert, 1967), resulted in an important hiatus in the central Asturian area and along part of the Leon line. This uplift was followed by another period of very uniform sedimentation during which limestones were deposited in most of the Cantabrian Mountains. This relatively uniform picture changed drastically during the lower and middle Westphalian, when the important Curavacas folding phase (Palentian phase of Wagner & Wagner-Gentis, 1963) occurred. The sediments deposited after these tectonic movements are partly preserved in a number of so-called "basins" (de Sitter, 1965). These "basins" (Fig. 2) are mainly tectonic units which are merely fragments of the originally much more extensive sedimentary basins. These Upper Carboniferous sediments contrast strongly with the earlier ones in that they are typified by great lateral and vertical variability and by their great thickness. The Westphalian alone, for instance, is over 4000 m thick in many places. SUBJECT OF STUDY In these Westphalian deposits marine and non-marine strata show rapid lateral and vertical transitions into one another. In the marine parts of the sequences limestones are common. Some of these limestones can be traced for several kilometres; others, however, abruptly wedge out or interfinger with siliciclastic deposits. Isolated lenses, sometimes forming a distinct band, may also occur. The cause(s) of these irregularities in the limestone deposits was (were) the original subject of this study. It was soon realized that these causes could not be understood unless the limestones were studied together with the surrounding siliciclastics on a regional scale. The Pisuerga area, from which published paleontological data were available, was selected for this study. ...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the fact}} that the {{available}} chronology and stratigraphy of the Neogene-Quaternary sedimentary succession within the Eastern Southern Alps is very detailed, we investigated the external sector of the Eastern Southern Alps and performed a detailed structural and stratigraphic mapping of the Tortonian-Quaternary sedimentary units outcropping within a 120 km-long zone along the foothills of the mountain chain in Veneto and Friuli regions. The Eastern Southern Alps is a major strucural subdivision of the broader Alpine Chain and it is conventionally delimited to the north by the Periadriatic Lineament. From a tectonic point of view, the Eastern Southern Alps correspond to a distinct late Oligocene-Quaternary <b>orogene.</b> This south-verging fold-and-thrust belt was generated during the complex crustal collision and indentation of the Adria promontory underneath the Alpine chain. Due to the relatively large distribution of conglomeratic bodies within the considered stratigraphic interval, we focused our attention on numerous deformed pebbles characterised by pitted surfaces. These structural features are classically related to small-scale pressure-solution processes mainly occurring along those particle contacts that are roughly oriented perpendicular to the direction of maximum compression. Based on the careful analysis of the shape and orientation of the indented features on the pebbles' surface and following a statistical approach based on as many as possible measurements for each site, the mean orientation of the maximum compressive stress axis (σ 1) is obtained by contouring the data on a stereonet and calculating the density peak. Our reconstruction of the late Tortonian-Quaternary Tectonic Stratigraphy in the Eastern Southern Alps has emphasized the occurrence of four distinct deformational events. It is noteworthy that these events do not represent 'simple' local variations of the stress field because for all datasets the corresponding sites of measurements are spread along the entire 120 km-long investigated area and in many cases, the same localities and sedimentary units are affected by more than one dataset (viz. stress field). In particular, the four events could be recognized and distinguished based on i) a different mean direction of compression and ii) their timing of activity. Accordingly during Late Neogene-Quaternary the stress trajectories of the Eastern Southern Alps were affected by repeated rotations with rapid flipping of the principal horizontal stresses. We refer to this behaviour as Twist Tectonics. The tectonic evolution of the Eastern Southern Alps has been compared with Neogene-Quaternary the convergence direction between Adria-Africa and Europe plates showing a good fitting with both timing and directions of compression of the major deformational events. However, since late Messinian, the Northern Apennines were close enough to the Eastern Southern Alps in order to perturb the stress field and generate short-lived (1 - 2 Ma) rotations of the stress trajectories (Twist Tectonics) possibly due to accomodation processes of the Adria indenter and overlapping effects of the two 'remote' engines (Africa and Apennines) ...|$|E
