5000|$|Train surfing (also {{known as}} train hopping or train hitching) {{is a type}} of parkour that is the act of [...] a [...] on the outside of a moving train, tram or another rail transport. In a number of countries, the term train hopping is often {{confused}} with the term freight hopping, which means riding on the outside of a freight train, while train surfing can be practiced on any type of train. This type of travelling can be dangerous and even life-threatening, because there is a risk of death or serious injury from falling off a moving train, electrocution from power supply (overhead catenary wire, current collectors, resistors, etc.), colliding with a railway infrastructure (bridges, tunnels, platforms, railway signals or other trains) while riding outside <b>off</b> <b>structure</b> gauge on the side or on the roof of a train, or unsuccessful attempts to jump on a moving train or off it. Today, the practice is forbidden by statutes on many railroads in the world. Despite this, it is still practiced, especially on those railroads where the trains are overcrowded.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on the dynamics of industry structure has generated very few robust empirical predictions. The paper shows that if one particular assumption is made about the pay <b>off</b> <b>structure</b> of an investment project, three well known games, a modified ''Grab the Dollar'' game, an auction and a stochastic race all have identical (robust) empirical predictions. The assumed structure of pay offs applies particularly well to the chemical sector. The theoretical implication is that small firms {{are more likely to}} install new capacity than their larger competitors, leading to a tendency of firm sizes to converge. We show that the conventional empirical approach using discrete choice models is inappropriate in this context, due to Galton''s Fallacy. Using a novel method to study empirical firm dynamics, by analysing dynamically evolving cross-section distributions and by that exploiting time series and cross-section information more fully than standard cross-section regressions, we show that there is a strong tendency of firm sizes to converge in the chemicals sector...|$|E
40|$|Contraction {{of muscle}} {{involves}} the cyclic interaction of myosin heads on the thick filaments with actin subunits {{in the thin}} filaments. Muscles relax when this interaction is blocked by molecular switches on either or both filaments. Insight into the relaxed (switched <b>OFF)</b> <b>structure</b> of myosin has come from electron microscopic studies of smooth muscle myosin molecules, which are regulated by phosphorylation. These {{studies suggest that the}} OFF state is achieved by an asymmetric, intramolecular interaction between the actin-binding region of one head and the converter region of the other, switching both heads off. Although this is a plausible model for relaxation based on isolated myosin molecules, it does not reveal whether this structure is present in native myosin filaments. Here we analyse the structure of a phosphorylation-regulated striated muscle thick filament using cryo-electron microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstruction and atomic fitting studies suggest that the 2 ̆ 7 interacting-head 2 ̆ 7 structure is also present in the filament, and that it may underlie the relaxed state of thick filaments in both smooth and myosin-regulated striated muscles over a wide range of species...|$|E
40|$|We report our {{finding of}} a two scale cut <b>off</b> <b>structure</b> in the {{infrared}} nonperturbative dynamics of Pade couplant QCD, in the flavor states N_f< 8. We argue that these two NPQCD momentum scales Q_c(Y_ 1) and Q_c(Y_ 2) can be identified as the scales of onset of chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement in QCD, and as the cut off boundaries of a strongly interacting infrared quark gluon phase of Quantum Chromodynamics, intermediate between the hadronic phase of QCD and the weakly coupled perturbative QCD regime. We investigated the pattern of variation with flavor number N_f< 8, of these domain boundaries of the intermediate nonperturbative infrared QCD, {{and found that the}} two scales are correlated, with a correlation factor Q_c(Y_ 2) /Q_c(Y_ 1) that rises to a peak at N_f = 2 from N_f = 0, but falls off rapidly to zero for 4 < N_f< 8. We concluded firmly that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement while being two distinct QCD phenomena caused by two independent component QCD forces Y_ 1 and Y_ 2, are nevertheless closely related phenomena of infrared nonperturbative QCD dynamics. Their correlation leads us to a finding that quark confinement is most favored in the N_f = 2 flavor state of QCD, but becomes rapidly less probable for N_f≥ 4, this finding being exactly as one observes in nature.

40|$|In {{cooperative}} breeding systems, {{some individuals}} help to raise offspring {{that are not}} their own. While early explanations for such altruistic behaviour were predominantly based on kin selection, recent evidence suggests that direct benefits may be important in the maintenance of cooperation. To date, however, discussions of cooperative breeding have made little reference to more general theories of cooperation between unrelated individuals (while these theories rarely address cooperative breeding). Here, we attempt to integrate the two fields. We identify four key questions {{that can be used}} to categorise different mechanisms for the maintenance of cooperative behaviour: (1) whether or not individuals invest in others; (2) whether or not this initial investment elicits a return investment by the beneficiary; (3) whether the interaction is direct, i. e. between two partners, or indirect (involving third parties) and (4) whether only actions that increase the fitness of the partner or also fitness reducing actions (punishment) are involved in the interaction. Asking these questions with regards to concepts in the literature on cooperative breeding, we found that (a) it is often straightforward to relate these concepts to general mechanisms of cooperation, but that (b) a single term (such as ‘pay-to-stay’, ‘group augmentation’ or ‘prestige’) may sometimes subsume two or more distinct mechanisms, and that (c) at least some mechanisms that are thought to be important in cooperative breeding systems have remained largely unexplored in the theoretical literature on the evolution of cooperation. Future theoretical models should incorporate asymmetries in power and pay <b>off</b> <b>structure</b> caused for instance by dominance hierarchies or partner choice, and the use of N-player games. The key challenges for both theoreticians and empiricists will be to integrate the hitherto disparate fields and to disentangle the parallel effects of kin and non-kin based mechanisms of cooperation...|$|E

A detailed geochemical study was performed on potential source rocks in the Bonaparte Basin (Australian North West Shelf) and the Gippsland Basin (Australian southeastern margin). Both of these basins have {{been the focus of}} attention for extensive exploration activity that has led to the discovery of numerous economic gas and oil accumulations. The hydrocarbon generation characteristics of potential source rocks in each of these two basins remain uncertain. This study involved the integration of several techniques {{and approaches}}, such as Rock-Eval pyrolysis and open-system pyrolysis-gas chromatography (Py-GC) to assess the petroleum potential and to define petroleum organo-facies. Pyrolysis experiments under open-system conditions were applied to simulate the timing of hydrocarbon formation for a range of source rocks in these Australian basins. The bulk kinetics of petroleum formation were determined by pyrolysis experiments under closed-system conditions to predict and provide insights on phase behaviour and compositional properties of generated hydrocarbons. Two case studies were carried out within the Bonaparte Basin (the Vulcan Sub-basin and the Laminaria High), from which 61 and 14 source rock samples were analysed, respectively. Py-GC results indicate that the overall molecular compositions of the organic matter preserved in the Bonaparte Basin do not differ significantly between the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous kerogens. The low abundance of phenolic compounds in these kerogens indicates a contribution from marine material. In contrast, the Middle Jurassic Plover Formation is more enriched in straight chain hydrocarbons with a higher carbon-number range and exhibits higher phenolic and aromatic content, suggesting high input of terrigenous organic matter in the source facies. Additionally, there is a significant variation in petroleum-type organofacies, which ranges from gas/condensates to Paraffinic-Naphthenic-Aromatic. This variability in organic richness, petroleum potential and organic facies type is interpreted to be {{a direct result of the}} varied sedimentary environments in which these facies were deposited, reflecting the transition from fluvial-deltaic during the Middle Jurassic, to open marine settings during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous in response to fault activity and regional subsidence. Similarly, bulk and compositional kinetic analyses reveal variable degrees of heterogeneity in thermal stability and composition. The compositional kinetic model predictions also indicate that under geological conditions, a greater proportion (~ 80 %) of the hydrocarbons were generated as oil. Counterintuitively, however, our results indicate that the marine Lower Cretaceous Echuca Shoals Formation has greater ability to form gas (43 %) than the other source rocks, due to inertinite dominating its maceral assemblage. The kinetic dataset developed from the Laminaria High area was incorporated into a 3 D petroleum system model using the Schlumberger PetroMod 3 D software packages to investigate the hydrocarbon charge history of the Laminaria High-Nancar Trough region. The modelling results indicate that most of the potential structures could have received oil charge from the Nancar Trough kitchen, where the Middle Jurassic source rocks are mature with respect to the oil generation window. When buried deep enough to reach sufficient thermal maturity, the Lower Cretaceous source rocks can provide additional sources for oils with a marine affinity. The onset of hydrocarbon generation in the Nancar Trough commenced during the Early Cretaceous, and during the mid to late Cenozoic for the Laminaria High, in response to elevated heat flow during the syn-rifting phase. The second and main phase of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion occurred in the mid-Eocene and continued until the present day, being controlled by the deposition of the thick Cenozoic carbonate shelf, which resulted in deep burial of Mesozoic source rocks. This latter phase of expulsion coincided with the reactivation of fault-bounded traps, which implies that some or all of the initially trapped hydrocarbons could escape out of charged structures. Having excluded the majority of wells drilled either <b>off</b> <b>structure</b> or with trap integrity issues such as inadequate reservoir and/or seal, vertical leakage from faults that are open at the present-day is the most likely explanation for structures that are now completely or partially emptied of hydrocarbons. It has been long suggested that the Latrobe Group coals are the main contributors to hydrocarbon accumulations in the Gippsland Basin. Results from the analysis of 91 source rock samples used in this study show that shales and coaly shales, rather than coal, have more potential for liquid hydrocarbon generation. No substantial variability in kinetic parameters was observed in shales and coaly shales containing Type II/III kerogens, which suggests that the Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene source rocks can be considered as a continuous but organically-heterogeneous facies, deposited in fluvio-deltaic to marginal marine settings. However, four representative samples show that there is a noticeable difference in terms of the compositional models that predict variable potential for gas (17 - 32 %) versus oil generation (68 - 83 %). Kinetic differences are also translated into the physical properties, where the highest GORs (213 - 1443 Sm 3 /Sm 3) were measured for the Paleocene (L. Balmei biozone) carbonaceous shales, and the lowest ratios (120 - 175 Sm 3 /Sm 3) were measured for the Turonian (P. Mawsonii biozone) shales. The incorporation of the developed kinetics into 3 D petroleum system models that account for different kinetic characteristics would enable pre-drill prediction of petroleum quality and refinement of the filling history of the Gippsland Basin.

A fraction of the elastic potential energy stored in the cord is typically transferred back to the person, throwing the person upwards some fraction of the distance he or she fell. The person then falls on the cord again, inducing stress in the cord. This happens multiple times per jump. The same cord is used for several jumps, creating cyclical stresses in the cord that could eventually cause failure if not replaced.|$|R
