At least 15 aircraft are to be assembled in Brazil, and Brazilian companies are {{to be involved in}} the full production run; Gripen Fs are to be delivered later. [...] An almost US$1 billion price increase since selection is due to developments requested by Brazil, such as the [...] "wide area display" [...] (WAD), a panoramic 19 by 8inches touchscreen display. [...] The compensation package is set at US$9 billion, or 1.7 times the <b>order</b> <b>value.</b> [...] Two Brazilian pilots were trained in Sweden between November 2014 and April 2015. The Brazilian Air Force has a requirement for 108 Gripens, to be delivered in three batches.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{examine whether}} <b>ordered</b> <b>values</b> of (sub) {{regional}} femorotibial cartilage thickness change {{are superior to}} region-based approaches in detecting risk factors for cartilage loss in osteoarthritis (OA). Methods 58 women with knee OA had 3 Tesla MR images acquired at baseline and 24 months. Changes in cartilage thickness (∆ThCtAB) were determined in eight medial femorotibial subregions. An ascending sort of individual ∆ThCtAB measurements was done to create “ordered values”. Risk factors for cartilage loss considered were: age, BMI, anatomical knee axis (AAA), minimal (medial) joint space width (mJSW), and percent of medial tibial plateau covered by the meniscus (percent cover). All change metrics were tested for association with the risk factors using Kendall’s τ and relative sensitivity of multiple tests of subregions and <b>ordered</b> <b>values</b> were compared with single metrics of change from plate and compartment summaries and the first <b>ordered</b> <b>value.</b> ResultsThe associations between subregion ∆ThCtAB and AAA (P= 0. 0002), mJSW (P= 0. 016), and age (P= 0. 011) were significant, but only AAA (at α= 0. 05) and age (at α= 0. 1) remained significant after adjusting for multiple subregions. In contrast, cMFTC had P-values< 0. 05 for AAA (P= 0. 0001), mJSW (P= 0. 016), and meniscus subluxation (0. 04). The first <b>ordered</b> <b>value</b> had significant associations with AAA (P= 0. 0004), mJSW (P= 0. 003), meniscus subluxation (P= 0. 02) and percent cover (P= 0. 031) {{all of which were}} significant at α= 0. 05 after adjusting for tests on multiple risk factors. ConclusionOrdered values of ∆ThCtAB were more sensitive in detecting risk factors of cartilage loss than subregional ∆ThCtAB. Sensitivity was further enhanced by considering the minimum <b>ordered</b> <b>value</b> as a single test, thus not requiring adjustment for multiple tests. Using <b>ordered</b> <b>values</b> there was a significant association between ∆ThCtAB and baseline AAA, mJSW, meniscus subluxation and meniscus percent cover. This study provides an important step in validating <b>ordered</b> <b>values</b> of cartilage change...|$|R

It also ordered 25 of Douglas's DC-8, which could seat six across (the 707 originally was to be 144 inches wide with five-abreast seating; Boeing widened it to match the DC-8). The combined <b>order</b> <b>value</b> was $269million. Pan Am's first scheduled jet flight was from New York Idlewild to Paris Le Bourget (stopping at Gander to refuel) on October 26, 1958, with Boeing 707–121 Clipper America (N711PA) with 111 passengers.

2500|$|In early 1961, BUA {{applied to}} the Air Transport Licensing Board (ATLB), a {{predecessor}} of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), for {{a large number of}} domestic and international short-, medium- and long-haul scheduled route licences to give its scheduled network the critical mass to become financially viable by 1965, and to provide sufficient work for a planned £20 million fleet of new jets comprising four long-haul Vickers VC10s and five short-/medium-haul DH 121 Tridents. BUA's applications included a request for twice-weekly all-economy/colonial coach class flights linking Gatwick with Istanbul, Teheran, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Bangkok and Singapore, with a weekly extension to Hong Kong and Tokyo, respectively. BUA intended to inaugurate its first-ever scheduled services to Asia with DC-6Cs or Britannias, which were to be replaced with the new VC10s at a later stage. The airline planned to charge standard IATA fares on all sectors. In addition, it proposed to offer British residents flying to Singapore and Hong Kong in Skycoach an 18% discount on the equivalent economy class fares. In May of that year, BUA became the first independent airline in the UK to launch a brand-new jet aircraft, when it placed an order for ten short-/medium-haul BAC One-Eleven 200 series. The same month, the airline placed an order for four Vickers VC10 long-haul jets costing [...] £2.8 million apiece. Laker personally negotiated these orders with both manufacturers. The combined <b>order</b> <b>value</b> was £20 million. At that time, the ATLB conducted a hearing into BUA's applications for over 20 scheduled route licences to enable it to expand the European network to include a number of major trunk routes from its Gatwick base, such as Gatwick to Paris, Milan, Zürich, Amsterdam and Athens, in competition with existing services of BEA from Heathrow. Although the ATLB granted BUA the requested licences for 12 of these routes, the airline was unable to use them without actual traffic rights.|$|E

Mathematical modeling of AFTI-F 16 fighters involves ninth order differential equation [14].

The study of hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability also involves eighth and tenth <b>order</b> boundary <b>value</b> problems [17]. The mathematical importance of boundary value problems of higher order motivates to study different mathematical techniques to obtain the solutions of these problems.
