5|$|As {{the train}} departs towards King's Cross, Rubeus Hagrid waves riders goodbye {{outside of the}} window. Shadows of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger can also been seen walking down the train corridor, looking for an empty compartment. Following this, Buckbeak flies outside the window, while Hogwarts {{can be seen in}} the background. Shortly after, the train enters a forest where centaurs are running. Upon exiting the forest, Hogwarts can be seen once again in the background. Fred and George Weasley appear, flying broomsticks and playing with fireworks. The Hogwarts Express then enters a tunnel, after which riders find {{themselves}} in the middle of a storm and pass Malfoy Manor. The journey then enters a second tunnel; Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear again in the train corridor. As a spider crawls up the compartment door, Ron eats it and the trio continue to walk <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> corridor. After the tunnel the journey continues into London passing by an industrial factory and then a residential area. The Knight Bus then appears; squeezing between buildings and shrinking to pass under a bridge. As the bus drives away, the train enters King's Cross station, where Alastor Moody greets passengers.|$|E
5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} pole vault) set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, {{by the total number of}} misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Stradlin {{recorded}} his sixth album, Like a Dog, with guitarist Rick Richards, drummer Taz Bentley, and bassist JT Longoria.

However, the album was not released until October 2005, when Stradlin—prompted by a fan petition—made it available through internet order. The following year, Stradlin re-released Ride On, River, <b>On</b> <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> Road, and Like a Dog through iTunes.|$|E
25|$|The great {{advantage}} {{of this approach is}} the efficiency and low cost involved in settling large volumes of trades. The inconvenience is that the issuing corporation no longer knows who its owners are, since its transfer agent has all the immobilized shares recorded as the owner being Cede & Co. For purposes of sending proxy notices and other communications with beneficial owners, the transfer agent, acting on a request of the issuing corporation, sends an inquiry to DTCC, which in turn sends inquiries to its members and so <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> chain.|$|E

25|$|An acrostic {{is a type}} of word puzzle, in eponymous acrostic form, that {{typically}} consists of two parts. The first is a set of lettered clues, each of which has numbered blanks representing the letters of the answer. The second part is a long series of numbered blanks and spaces, representing a quotation or other text, into which the answers for the clues fit. In most forms of the puzzle, the first letters of each correct clue answer, read in order from clue A <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> list, will spell out the author of the quote and the title of the work it is taken from; this can be used as an additional solving aid.|$|E
25|$|Lying {{astride the}} border {{separating}} the Union and Confederacy, the Alleghenies {{were among the}} areas most directly affected by the American Civil War (1861–1865). One of the earliest campaigns of the War was fought {{for control of the}} Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike and for the access it provided to the B Railroad. The Battle of Rich Mountain (July 11, 1861) gave the Federals control of the turnpike, of Tygart's Valley, and of all of the territory of western Virginia to the north and west, including the railroad. (Union General George McClellan's victory in this theater would ultimately bring him promotion to commander the Army of the Potomac.) The Federals fortified at Cheat Summit, and the Confederates established strongholds at Camp Bartow and Camp Allegheny. Here they faced each other warily through the fall of 1861 and the following winter. General Robert E. Lee's attempt to attack Cheat Summit Fort (September 12–15, 1861) and Federal attempts to attack Bartow and Allegheny, all failed to change the strategic stalemate. Finally, the harsh, high elevation winter achieved what the troops had failed to accomplish, and in the spring of 1862 both armies moved <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pike to the Battle of McDowell (May 8, 1862), and then on to fight what became General Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign (spring 1862). Two years later, much of this contested area (along with much else) became part of the new state of West Virginia. The very rugged terrain of the Alleghenies was not at all amenable to a large-scale maneuver war and so the actions that the area witnessed {{for the remainder of the}} conflict were generally guerrilla in nature.|$|E

500|$|After the {{original}} soundtrack version was recorded, Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones {{went back into}} the studio and re-recorded the track. It was the re-recording that was released in January 1979 as the second single from , following the release of [...] "Ease <b>On</b> <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> Road" [...] in 1978, and was Michael's first solo chart single on Epic Records. The 7-inch version split the song in half, with [...] "Part 1" [...] as the A-side and [...] "Part 2" [...] as the B-side; the full-length version was released as a 12-inch single and later was included on The Ultimate Collection in 2004.|$|E

[...] Although the King Records single lists [...] "Bradshaw-Mann" [...] as the songwriters, reissues and {{subsequent}} recordings of [...] "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] credit Tiny Bradshaw, Lois Mann (a pseudonym of King Records' owner Syd Nathan), and Howard Kay. [...] BMI, the performing rights organization, lists the songwriters/composers as [...] "Myron C. Bradshaw, Sydney Nathan, and Howard Kay". According to music historian Larry Birnbaum, [...] "Mann's name was plainly added to allow Syd Nathan to siphon off {{a share of the}} publishing royalties, as label owners routinely did in those days; as for Kay, his identity remains a mystery".|$|E

500|$|In January 1979, [...] "You Can't Win" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single from , a double album distributed by Motown Records in September 1978. The single was issued after the September 1978 release of [...] "Ease <b>on</b> <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> Road", a duet between Jackson and Diana Ross, who played protagonist Dorothy Gale in The Wiz. [...] "You Can't Win" [...] was distributed under Epic Records, and was Jackson's first solo single issued by the company after Epic executives signed him and his brothers to the label in 1976. [...] "You Can't Win" [...] entered Billboards R singles chart on January 20, 1979. It reached number 42 and remained in the chart for ten weeks. A month later, on February 24, 1979, it entered the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 81. The single stayed in the chart for three weeks. In May 1979, [...] "You Can't Win" [...] {{was released}} in Britain, as was a 7" [...] picture disc of the song. The single failed to enter the British charts. When Jackson's Off the Wall was first released in August 1979, the picture disc supplemented the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene that}} {{corresponds}} with [...] "You Can't Win" [...] in The Wiz begins with Dorothy Gale (played by Diana Ross), stumbling upon a scarecrow being heckled by crows while {{stuck in the}} air on a pole. Dorothy remains hidden while the crows mock Scarecrow for asking to be let down. They state that he will remain on the pole because that is his role {{and there is nothing}} to get down for. The crows tell Scarecrow that even if he was let down, {{he would not be able}} to walk as he is a [...] "straw paper dummy". Scarecrow tries to reason with the birds by reading relevant quotations from figures such as Francis Bacon and Cicero as a rationale to be freed. The crows do not relent, however, and make him recite their [...] "Crow Commandments": [...] "Thou shall honor all crows", [...] "Thou shall stop reading all bits of paper and literature" [...] and [...] "Thou shall never, never get down off of this here pole". In addition, the birds tell Scarecrow to sing the crow anthem, [...] "You Can't Win". After the song concludes, Dorothy comes out of hiding and releases Scarecrow from the pole. Together, they then dance their way down the yellow brick road in search of The Wiz, singing [...] "Ease <b>on</b> <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> Road" [...] as they go.|$|E
500|$|Michael Jackson's {{performance}} as the Scarecrow {{was one of the}} only positively reviewed elements of the film, with critics noting that Jackson possessed [...] "genuine acting talent" [...] and [...] "provided the only genuinely memorable moments." [...] Of the results of the film, Jackson stated: [...] "I don't think it could have been any better, I really don't." [...] In 1980, Jackson stated that his time working on The Wiz was [...] "my greatest experience so far [...] [...] [...] I'll never forget that." [...] The film received a positive critique for its elaborate set design, and the book American Jewish Filmmakers noted that it [...] "features some of the most imaginative adaptations of New York locales since the glory days of the Astaire-Rogers films." [...] In a 2004 review of the film, Christopher Null wrote positively of Ted Ross and Richard Pryor's performances. However, Null's overall review of the film was critical, and he wrote that other than the song [...] "Ease <b>on</b> <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> Road", [...] "the rest is an acid trip of bad dancing, garish sets, and a Joel Schumacher-scripted mess that runs 135 agonizing minutes." [...] A 2005 piece by Hank Stuever in The Washington Post described the film as [...] "a rather appreciable delight, even when it's a mess", and felt that the singing – especially Diana Ross's – was [...] "a marvel".|$|E
