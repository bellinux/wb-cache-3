The repair work is completed slightly ahead of schedule, and the rocket cleared for lift-off. Halfway to Earth, Jorgen escapes his bonds thanks to the detectives' bungling and tries to kill Tintin and the others; Wolff seeks to prevent him, and in their struggle over a gun Jorgen is killed. When it is revealed that {{there will not be}} enough oxygen aboard for the crew to survive the journey, Wolff sacrifices himself by opening the airlock and floating <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>space</b> to his death. The crew fall unconscious but Tintin wakes long enough to set the rocket to auto-pilot and it arrives back in Syldavia safely.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, {{also known}} as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>space,</b> where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).|$|E

5|$|Fluctuations in {{the orbits}} of the moons {{indicate}} that their mean density decreases with distance from Jupiter. Callisto, the outermost and least dense of the four, has a density intermediate between ice and rock whereas Io, the innermost and densest moon, has a density intermediate between rock and iron. Callisto has an ancient, heavily cratered and unaltered ice surface {{and the way it}} rotates indicates that its density is equally distributed, suggesting that it has no rocky or metallic core but consists of a homogeneous mix of rock and ice. This may well have been the original structure of all the moons. The rotation of the three inner moons, in contrast, indicates differentiation of their interiors with denser matter at the core and lighter matter above. They also reveal significant alteration of the surface. Ganymede reveals past tectonic movement of the ice surface which required partial melting of subsurface layers. Europa reveals more dynamic and recent movement of this nature, suggesting a thinner ice crust. Finally, Io, the innermost moon, has a sulfur surface, active volcanism and no sign of ice. All this evidence suggests that the nearer a moon is to Jupiter the hotter its interior. The current model is that the moons experience tidal heating {{as a result of the}} gravitational field of Jupiter in inverse proportion to the square of their distance from the giant planet. In all but Callisto this will have melted the interior ice, allowing rock and iron to sink to the interior and water to cover the surface. In Ganymede a thick and solid ice crust then formed. In warmer Europa a thinner more easily broken crust formed. In Io the heating is so extreme that all the rock has melted and water has long ago boiled <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

25|$|American chemist Harold Urey, {{who founded}} cosmochemistry, {{put forward a}} {{scenario}} in 1951, 1952, 1956, and 1966 based largely on meteorites and using Chandrasekhar's stability equations and obtained density distribution in the gas and dust disk surrounding the primitive Sun. In order that volatile elements like mercury could be retained by the terrestrial planets he postulated a moderately thick gas and dust halo shielding the planets from the Sun. In order to form diamonds, pure carbon crystals, Moon-size objects, gas spheres that became gravitationally unstable, would have to form in the disk with the gas and dust dissipating at a later stage. Pressure fell as gas was lost and diamonds were converted to graphite, while the gas became illuminated by the Sun. Under these conditions considerable ionization would be present and the gas would be accelerated by magnetic fields, hence the angular momentum could be transferred from the Sun. He postulated that these lunar-size bodies were destroyed by collisions, with the gas dissipating, leaving behind solids collected at the core, with the resulting smaller fragments pushed far <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>space</b> and the larger fragments staying behind and accreting into planets. He suggested the Moon {{was just such a}} surviving core.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, {{there is}} almost {{universal}} agreement in the astrophysics community that the long-duration bursts {{are associated with the}} deaths of massive stars in a specific kind of supernova-like event commonly referred to as a collapsar or hypernova. Very massive stars are able to fuse material in their centers all the way to iron, at which point a star cannot continue to generate energy by fusion and collapses, in this case, immediately forming a black hole. Matter from the star around the core rains down towards the center and (for rapidly rotating stars) swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into the black hole drives a pair of jets out along the rotational axis, where the matter density is much lower than in the accretion disk, towards the poles of the star at velocities approaching the speed of light, creating a relativistic shock wave at the front. If the star is not surrounded by a thick, diffuse hydrogen envelope, the jets' material can pummel {{all the way to the}} stellar surface. The leading shock actually accelerates as the density of the stellar matter it travels through decreases, and by the time it reaches the surface of the star it may be traveling with a Lorentz factor of 100 or higher (that is, a velocity of 0.9999 times the speed of light). Once it reaches the surface, the shock wave breaks <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>space,</b> with much of its energy released in the form of gamma-rays.|$|E

500|$|Written by John Lucarotti, this script {{came about}} after Space Station was {{rejected}} and Lucarotti was suggested by Terrance Dicks {{as a replacement}} writer {{on the strength of}} his Moonbase 3 script. The story would use the same space station setting as Space Station, the setting being dictated by the production office as means of saving money by having it share sets with Revenge of the Cybermen. Commissioned in June 1974, Lucarotti devised the concept of the ark, a space station that housed a huge plot of countryside the size of Kent - a sort of Home Counties in space. His six-part story concerned the invasion of the ark by a species called the Delc, a spore-like fungus with separate heads and bodies. The final episode was to have the Doctor defeating the Delc leader by hitting it <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>space</b> with a golf club, and indeed Lucarotti planned to give each episode a [...] frivolous title, citing Puffball as the title of an early episode and Golfball as the title of the final episode. When the draft scripts arrived from his home in Corsica, Holmes and Hinchcliffe felt they were far too ambitious and complicated to realise on the programme's budget and Lucarotti had over-conceptualised the story. It was replaced by a different story with the same title by Robert Holmes, which shared only the setting with the previous version.|$|E

Upon arriving at the last known location, they find no other ship, but Captain James T. Kirk is struck by electromagnetic waves and leaves the Enterprise in a shuttlecraft. He pilots it <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>space</b> and disappears. Three years pass and the Enterprise returns to the area under Captain Gregory Westlake, after picking up Spock, who had retired from Starfleet and returned to Vulcan. The crew discovers a previously hidden planet at the location where Kirk vanished. They believe it to be the planet of the Titans, a mythical and powerful alien race. However, the planet is being drawn into a black hole. The Klingons also want to claim the planet. Spock travels to the surface and finds Kirk, who has been living on the planet for three years. Together, they discover the planet is inhabited by the Cygnans, who destroyed the Titans. The planet and the Enterprise enter the black hole, with the Cygnans being destroyed in the process. The ship emerges in orbit of Earth during the Paleolithic era, and the crew teach early man to make fire, in effect playing the role of Prometheus the Titan themselves, similar to the alien influence on human ancestors in [...] (1968).
