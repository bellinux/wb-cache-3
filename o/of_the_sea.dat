5|$|Early in 1953, Carson began {{library and}} field {{research}} on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore.

It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; The Edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.|$|E
5|$|Etty put a {{great deal}} of effort into the painting, {{including}} visiting a mortuary to sketch the dead and decaying bodies on the Sirens' island. His use of real corpses became publicly known, causing complaints from some critics. Although he visited Brighton in 1836 to make studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> in connection with the painting, Etty had little experience of landscape and seascape painting, and the painting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> and clouds is rudimentary in comparison {{with the rest of the}} work.|$|E

5|$|In Southeast Asia, the {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> {{gave rise to}} many myths of epic ocean voyages, princesses on distant islands, monsters and magical fish lurking in the deep.

In North America, various creation stories have a duck or other creature dive to the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> and bring up some mud out of which the dry land was formed. Atargatis was a Syrian deity known as the mermaid-goddess and Sedna was the goddess <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> and marine animals in Inuit mythology.|$|E
