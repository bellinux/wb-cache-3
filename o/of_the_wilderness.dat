5|$|Defining {{wilderness}} as {{a social}} {{as well as an}} environmental ideal, Marshall promoted organization of a national group dedicated to the preservation of primeval land. In 1935, {{he was one of the}} principal founders <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Society and personally provided most of the Society's funding in its first years. He also supported socialism and civil liberties throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{set aside}} about 89 {{percent of the}} park in a highly {{protected}} wilderness area through passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Act of 1964. No roads, motorized vehicles (except rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles), or any development beyond trail maintenance are allowed in this area. The adjacent Ansel Adams Wilderness and John Muir Wilderness were also protected under the act and include regions removed from the park immediately before it was unified with the state grant in 1906.|$|E

5|$|During the Civil War Centennial, the U.S. Post Office issued five {{postage stamps}} commemorating the 100th anniversaries of famous battles, as they {{occurred}} over a four-year period, {{beginning with the}} Battle of Fort Sumter Centennial issue of 1961. The Battle of Shiloh commemorative stamp was issued in 1962, the Battle of Gettysburg in 1963, the Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wilderness</b> in 1964, and the Appomattox Centennial commemorative stamp in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Our quarrel is {{not with}} these men, but with those who give them their chance. We {{who believe in the}} study of nature feel that a real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness,</b> give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E
2500|$|There are 40 trails totaling nearly [...] in <b>the</b> Sawtooth <b>Wilderness</b> {{that can}} be used for day hiking, backpacking, and horseback riding and {{accessed}} from 23 trailheads. Additional trails traverse <b>the</b> foothills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> designated <b>wilderness.</b> Camping is permitted anywhere in <b>the</b> <b>wilderness.</b> There are several developed campgrounds on <b>the</b> western side <b>of</b> range, outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sawtooth <b>Wilderness,</b> including at Redfish, Little Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, and Stanley lakes, as well as at Iron Creek. Restrictions on fires and animals apply in some areas.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>wilderness</b> – <b>the</b> barren region {{immediately}} {{next to the}} Dead Sea, {{and below}} sea level; it was wild, and barely inhabitable, {{to the extent that}} animals and people which were made unwelcome elsewhere, such as bears, leopards, and outlaws, made it their home. In biblical times, this region was further subdivided into three sections – <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> <b>of</b> En Gedi, <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> <b>of</b> Judah, and <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> <b>of</b> Maon.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> Sawtooth <b>Wilderness</b> was {{originally}} designated the Sawtooth Primitive Area in 1937 before becoming part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National <b>Wilderness</b> Preservation System in 1972 under <b>the</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Act. Although entirely managed by Sawtooth National Forest, {{only about a}} quarter (25.33 percent) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sawtooth <b>Wilderness</b> lies within <b>the</b> area Congressionally designated as Sawtooth National Forest, with the majority (69.13 percent) lying in Boise National Forest and a relatively small portion (5.54 percent) in Salmon-Challis National Forest. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, <b>the</b> Sawtooth <b>Wilderness</b> has some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clearest air in the lower 48 states.|$|R
5|$|Since its founding, The Wilderness Society {{has helped}} pass many bills for {{preservation}} and conservation of public lands. It has also purchased lands for preservation, contributing {{a total of}} 109millionacres (421,000km2) to the National Wilderness Preservation System. Marshall's dream of permanent wilderness protection became a reality 25years after his death when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Wilderness Act into law on September 3, 1964 in the Rose Garden of the White House. The ceremony was attended by Alice Zahniser and Mardy Murie, the widows of two prominent members <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Society.|$|E
5|$|The lower areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> {{area are}} covered by a taiga forest of Scots pine. Less common trees include downy birch, goat willow, aspen and rowan. Logging {{in the past has}} mostly {{occurred}} in the southern part ("Kessi"), a large proportion of Vätsäri's forests being old-growth forests. The barren soil makes for poor growth conditions and most of the ground vegetation in the forests is subshrubs. One area with limestone rock features green spleenwort. The reserve is located in an area between a western and eastern vegetation zones, giving rise to unique combinations of species, such as Siberian spruce and red cottongrass.|$|E
5|$|The volcano and the {{surrounding}} Goat Rocks Wilderness, established in 1964, are named after the numerous mountain goats which live in the area. The variable climate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> area supports a host of wildlife, including marmots, pikas, deer, and elk. Various peaks within the wilderness can be climbed or scrambled, and other activities such as hiking are permitted. The area is rife with minerals and resources, including coal, cobalt, copper, and base metals.|$|E

50|$|Because a fire {{destroyed}} much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dome <b>Wilderness</b> in 1996, <b>the</b> stark landscape {{stands out}} in contrast to other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest. The highest point in <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> area is near St. Peter's Dome.|$|R
50|$|A portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Salmo-Priest <b>Wilderness</b> {{lies within}} Kaniksu National Forest; however, {{most of it}} lies within {{neighboring}} Colville National Forest, to the west.

5|$|A {{scientist}} with a PhD in plant physiology, Marshall became independently wealthy {{after the death}} of his father in 1929. He had started his outdoor career in 1925 as forester with the U.S. Forest Service. He used his financial independence for expeditions to Alaska and other wilderness areas. Later he held two significant public appointed posts: chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, from 1933 to 1937, and head of recreation management in the Forest Service, from 1937 to 1939, both during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During this period, he directed the promulgation of regulations to preserve large areas of roadless land that were under federal management. Many years after his death, some of those areas were permanently protected from development, exploitation, and mechanization with the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Act of 1964.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{to three}} lode mines {{and a single}} coal mine were made within the Goat Rocks Wilderness, but the United States Bureau of Mines has no record of {{production}} from any of these claims. Historically, two claims have actually been staked in the area, the Mosquito lode near Walupt Lake in 1934, and later, the Glacier lode near Packwood Glacier in 1939. Neither show evidence of assessment work, and both deposits are now abandoned. Miners may have been drawn to the area by news of lode deposits containing gold, silver, and copper along breccia and shear zones to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> area.|$|E
5|$|The Overland Campaign was {{a series}} of battles fought in Virginia during May and June 1864. Sigel's and Butler's efforts sputtered, and Grant was left alone to fight Lee. Grant crossed the Rapidan River on May 4, attacking Lee in the Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wilderness,</b> a three-day battle with many casualties. Rather than retreat as his {{predecessors}} had done, Grant flanked Lee's army to the southeast and attempted to wedge his forces between Lee and Richmond at Spotsylvania Court House. Lee's army got to Spotsylvania first and a costly battle ensued, lasting thirteen days. Grant attempted to break through Lee's defenses, resulting in one of the bloodiest assaults of the Civil War, known as the Battle of the Bloody Angle. Unable to break Lee's lines, Grant again flanked the rebels to the southeast, meeting at North Anna, where a battle lasted three days.|$|E

50|$|He {{also became}} active in private efforts to {{conserve}} undeveloped areas. After <b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> Society was founded, Zahniser {{was hired as}} executive secretary and later worked as executive director.

5|$|During {{his time}} abroad, Cooper {{stayed with the}} Countess Dorothy di Frasso at the Villa Madama in Rome, where she taught him about good food and vintage wines, how to read Italian and French menus, and how to socialize among Europe's nobility and upper classes. After guiding him through the great art museums and {{galleries}} of Italy, she accompanied him on a ten-week big-game hunting safari {{on the slopes of}} Mount Kenya in East Africa, where he was credited with over sixty kills, including two lions, a rhinoceros, and various antelopes. His safari experience in Africa had a profound influence on Cooper and intensified his love <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness.</b> After returning to Europe, he and the countess set off on a Mediterranean cruise of the Italian and French Rivieras. Rested and rejuvenated by his year-long exile, a healthy Cooper returned to Hollywood in April 1932 and negotiated a new contract with Paramount for two films per year, a salary of $4,000 a week, and director and script approval.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet's talents as {{a general}} made {{significant}} contributions to several important Confederate victories, mostly in the Eastern Theater as one of Robert E. Lee's chief subordinates in the Army of Northern Virginia. He performed poorly at Seven Pines, but {{played an important role in}} the success of the Seven Days Battles in the summer of 1862. Longstreet led a devastating counterattack that routed the Union army at Second Bull Run in August. His men held their ground in defensive roles at Antietam and Fredericksburg. Longstreet's most controversial service was at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, where he openly disagreed with General Lee on the tactics to be employed and reluctantly supervised several attacks on Union forces, including the disastrous Pickett's Charge. Afterwards, Longstreet was, at his own request, sent to the Western Theater to fight under Braxton Bragg, where his troops launched a ferocious assault on the Union lines at Chickamauga, which carried the day. Afterwards, his performance in semiautonomous command during the Knoxville Campaign resulted in a Confederate defeat. Unhappy serving under Bragg, Longstreet and his men were sent back to Lee. He ably commanded troops during the Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wilderness</b> in 1864, where he was seriously wounded by friendly fire. He later returned to the field, serving under Lee in the Siege of Petersburg and the Appomattox Campaign.|$|E
