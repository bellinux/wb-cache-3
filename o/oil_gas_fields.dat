30|$|According to {{the four}} {{hydrocarbon}} generation models, there are some differences in the hydrocarbon-generating processes of the major source rocks in the PLP giant <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>fields.</b> The first three models have the following common features. First, the basins underwent multistage tectonic movements, and the source rocks were buried for a long duration with great burial depth and {{a high degree of}} thermal evolution; the resulting <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>fields</b> that formed are dominated by hydrocarbon gas reservoirs (such as Jingbian, Anyue, Puckett, Gomez and Makarem 1). Second, the early-formed oil reservoirs are preserved in some areas, and the <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>fields</b> feature the coexistence of <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> or are dominated by oil (such as the giant <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>fields</b> in the Tarim Basin and East Siberian Basin). Although in the basins of model (4), the source rocks were buried deeply in the early period with mature to highly mature thermal evolution and massive hydrocarbon generation, later continuous uplift ceased the hydrocarbon generation much earlier. The present burial depth of the source rocks is relatively shallow, and the <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>fields</b> formed are dominated by liquid oil (such as the Niagaran Reef Trend and Lima–Indiana Trend <b>oil</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>fields).</b>|$|R
40|$|In China, {{south of}} the Yangtze River, there are {{a large number of}} carbon sources, while the Sichuan Basin is the largest {{sedimentary}} basin; it makes sense to select the targets for CO 2 geological storage (CGUS) early demonstration. For CO 2 enhanced oil and gas, coal bed methane recovery (CO 2 -EOR, EGR, and ECBM), or storage in these depleted fields, the existing <b>oil,</b> <b>gas</b> <b>fields,</b> or coal seams could be the target areas in the mesoscale. This paper proposed a methodology of GIS superimposed multisource information assessment of geological suitability for CO 2 enhanced water recovery (CO 2 -EWR) or only storage in deep saline aquifers. The potential per unit area of deep saline aquifers CO 2 storage in Central Sichuan is generally greater than 50 × 104 [*]t/km 2 at P 50 probability level, with Xujiahe group being the main reservoir. CO 2 storage potential of depleted gas fields is 53. 73 × 108 [*]t, while it is 33. 85 × 108 [*]t by using CO 2 -EGR technology. This paper recommended that early implementation of CGUS could be carried out in the deep saline aquifers and depleted gas fields in the Sichuan Basin, especially that of the latter because of excellent traps, rich geological data, and well-run infrastructures...|$|E
