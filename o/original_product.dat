5|$|Business writer Megan Barnett {{has pointed}} out {{parallels}} between Dunder Mifflin and the real-life W.B. Mason paper company, based near Boston, in Brockton, Massachusetts. It is similarly regional in focus, serving corporate customers in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Like Dunder Mifflin, its <b>original</b> <b>product</b> line (rubber stamps) was something other than paper, and it faces stiff competition from national and international chains. It, too, has a branch office in Stamford, but Mason's has remained open. In 2009, it had an accounting scandal {{that resulted in a}} $545,000 payment to corporate customers, much as Dunder Mifflin {{had to deal with the}} arrest of Ryan Howard for fraud the year before.|$|E
5|$|The Burger King Specialty Sandwiches are {{a line of}} {{sandwiches}} {{developed by}} the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King in 1978 and introduced in 1979 {{as part of a}} new product line designed to expand Burger King's menu with more sophisticated, adult oriented fare beyond hamburgers. Additionally, the new line was intended to differentiate the company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at the time. Since the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving the chicken offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the primary product left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as the chicken sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the <b>original</b> <b>product</b> line was introduced.|$|E

The pointed/reduced {{end of the bar}} or coil, which is smaller than the die opening, is passed through the die where it enters a gripping device of the drawing machine. The drawing machine pulls or draws the remaining unreduced section of the bar or coil through the die. The die reduces the cross section of the original bar or coil, shapes the profile of the product and increases the length of the <b>original</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{conceptualisation}} of {{the past}} as the standard of the Middle Ages is perhaps best encapsulated by the German term Völkerwanderung. In this model, the Scots are portrayed as making their way from Egypt via Ireland to Scotland, annihilating their enemies on the way. The legitimacy therefore derives from conquest, and purity of racial/royal descent. The tradition in Scotland {{was influenced by the}} Historia Regum Britanniae, the Lebor Gabála Érenn and the Historia Brittonum. Ultimately, such conceptualizations can be derived from Virgil's Aeneid and the Bible, but were just as much an organic and <b>original</b> <b>product</b> of the medieval Scots themselves.|$|E

Bun B has also appeared on several songs with Wu-Tang members in 2009–10: after being featured on Method Man & Redman's Blackout! 2, Bun made appearances on Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II (Gold Edition), made up of tracks cut from the <b>original</b> <b>product,</b> and appeared on Redman's latest album Reggie alongside Redman and Method Man.|$|E

25|$|The {{delivery}} of new texts has radically changed along with technological influence. Composition now {{consists of the}} anticipation of future remediation. Writers think about the type of audience a text will be written for, and anticipate how that text might be reformed in the future. Jim Ridolfo coined the term rhetorical velocity to explain a conscious concern for the distance, speed, time, and travel it will take for a third party to rewrite an original composition. The use of recomposition allows for an audience {{to be involved in}} a public conversation, adding their own intentionality to the <b>original</b> <b>product.</b> This new method of editing and remediation is attributed to the evolution of digital text and publication, giving technology an important role in writing and composition.|$|E

This new test replaced the old two-step KSM test from the 1985 decision in KSM Fastening Systems, Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc. The new test “raised the bar for proving that defendant committed contempt” by requiring that a patentee show “the elements found infringing in the <b>original</b> <b>product</b> without significant change in the redesign.” The KSM test required that the original and redesign were “generally similar.” In addition, the patentee must “show that the defendant’s redesigned product infringes upon the same patent claims as the original product.” ...|$|E

The presence of foreign firms generates incentives for imitation because they introduce <b>original</b> <b>products</b> that are vertically differentiated from domestic products.

2500|$|Coca-Cola's {{market share}} had been losing ground to diet {{soft drinks and}} {{non-cola}} beverages for many years. Consumers who were purchasing regular colas seemed to prefer the sweeter taste of rival Pepsi-Cola, as Coca-Cola learned in conducting blind taste tests. However, the American public's reaction to the change was negative, even hostile, and the new cola was a major failure. The subsequent, rapid reintroduction of Coke's original formula, rebranded [...] "Coca-Cola Classic" [...] and put back into market within three months of New Coke's debut, resulted in a significant gain in sales. This led to speculation that {{the introduction of the}} New Coke formula was just a marketing ploy; however, the company has maintained it was a genuine attempt to replace the <b>original</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Charles Gladding (1828–1894) {{was born}} in Buffalo, New York, served as a first {{lieutenant}} in the Union Army during the Civil War, and later moved to Chicago, where he engaged in the clay sewer pipe business.

[...] Investigating, Gladding verified that it was an [...] "unusually fine deposit of white kaolin clay" [...] located close to a railroad line., and selected the spot as the site for a new business. [...] Gladding, along with Peter McGill McBean and George Chambers, established Gladding-McBean in 1875. [...] Its <b>original</b> <b>product</b> was clay sewer pipe.

2500|$|Vietnam Inc. {{had a major}} {{influence}} on American perceptions of the war, and became a classic of photojournalism. The book was the result of Griffiths' work between 1966 and 1971 in the country, and it stands {{as one of the most}} detailed surveys of any conflict. It includes critical descriptions of the horrors of the war as well as a study of Vietnamese rural life, and views from serving American soldiers. Probably one of its most quoted passages is of a US army source discussing napalm: 'We sure are pleased with those backroom boys at Dow. The <b>original</b> <b>product</b> wasn't so hot – if the gooks were quick they could scrape it off. So the boys started adding polystyrene – now it sticks like shit to a blanket. But if the gooks jumped under water it stopped burning, so they started adding Willie Peter (white phosphorus) so's to make it burn better. And just one drop is enough, it'll keep on burning right down to the bone so they die anyway from phosphorus poisoning.' ...|$|E
6000|$|After the war, {{however, the}} {{viewpoint}} of our historians was changed. They began to regard American literature with increasing respect as an <b>original</b> <b>product,</b> as a true reflection of human life in a new field and under the stimulus of new incentives to play the fine old game of [...] "life, liberty {{and the pursuit of}} happiness." [...] In 1878 appeared Tyler's History of American Literature 1607-1765 in two bulky volumes that surprised readers by revealing a mass of important writings in a period supposed to be barren of literary interest; and the surprise increased when the same author produced two more volumes dealing with the literature of the Revolution. In 1885 came Stedman's Poets of America, an excellent critical study of New World poetry; and two years later Richardson published the first of his two splendid volumes of American Literature. These good beginnings were followed by a host of biographies dealing with every important American author, until we now have choice of a large assortment of literary material where Royal Robbins had none at all.|$|E
