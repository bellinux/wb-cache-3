5|$|Lasting {{impressions}} of the war experience are ever-prevalent on the island. In Canada, 1 July is celebrated as Canada Day, in recognition of Canadian confederation. In the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador the date is Memorial Day, in remembrance of the Newfoundland Regiment's losses at Beaumont-Hamel. Memorial University College, now Memorial University of Newfoundland, was originally established as a memorial to Newfoundlanders who {{had lost their lives}} in active service during the First World War. Lastly, the six caribou memorials and the National War Memorial erected following the First World War, and the establishment of the preserved battlefield park at Beaumont-Hamel which is visited by thousands of tourists a year. The Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site also serves an informal ambassadorial function, educating visitors not <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> experience of the Newfoundland Regiment but also regarding the history of the island.|$|E
5|$|Time {{is viewed}} as unredeemable and problematic, whereas eternity is {{beautiful}} and true. Living under time's influence is a problem. Within Burnt Norton section 3, people trapped in time {{are similar to those}} stuck in between life and death in Inferno Canto Three. When Eliot deals with the past in The Dry Salvages, he emphasises its importance to combat the influence of evolution as encouraging people to forget the past and care <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> present and the future. The present is capable of always reminding one of the past. These moments also rely on the idea of Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita that death can come at any moment, and that the divine will is more important than considering the future.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} stable three-dimensional matchings {{of three}} categories of agents, such as women, men and dogs. This was suggested long ago by Knuth (1976), but very little {{seems to have been}} published on this problem. Based on computer experiments, we present a couple of conjectures as well as a few counterexamples to other natural but discarded conjectures. In particular, a circular 3 D matching is one where women <b>only</b> care <b>about</b> <b>the</b> man, men <b>only</b> care <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dog, and dogs <b>only</b> care <b>about</b> <b>the</b> woman they are matched with. We conjecture that a stable outcome always exists for any circular 3 D matching market, and we prove it for markets with at most four agents of each category. 1...|$|R

25|$|The article {{concludes with}} a quote from Mikhail Gromov (who earlier in the article compares Perelman's {{mathematical}} approach to that of Isaac Newton): “To do great work, {{you have to have}} a pure mind.

After crystallographic image processing, structure factor phase angles are far more reliable than structure factor amplitudes. Further discernment of candidate structures is then mainly based on structure factor phase angles and, to a lesser extent, structure factor amplitudes (so-called 'structure factor fingerprinting').|$|E

25|$|Others, like Mark Bauerlein, {{argue that}} professors in the {{humanities}} have increasingly abandoned proven methods of epistemology (I care <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> quality of your arguments, not your conclusions.) in favor of indoctrination (I care only about your conclusions, not {{the quality of your}} arguments.). The result is that professors and their students adhere rigidly to a limited set of viewpoints, and have little interest in, or understanding of, opposing viewpoints. Once they obtain this intellectual self-satisfaction, persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation are common.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{observations}} and modeling are producing information not <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> present climate and atmospheric conditions on Mars {{but also about}} its past. The Noachian-era Martian atmosphere had long been theorized to be carbon dioxide–rich. Recent spectral observations of deposits of clay minerals on Mars and modeling of clay mineral formation conditions have found {{that there is little}} to no carbonate present in clay of that era. Clay formation in a carbon dioxide–rich environment is always accompanied by carbonate formation, although the carbonate may later be dissolved by volcanic acidity.|$|E

25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, {{he shook his head}} in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E

Christy tries to {{resuscitate}} him using CPR, although she is warned away from him by the other residents, who seem to be aware that he is HIV-positive. The man's condition continues to deteriorate as Sarah's fetus develops. The baby is born prematurely and in poor health, and is in need of a blood transfusion. Johnny and Sarah are ultimately nervous not <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> baby's survival chances, but also of the skyrocketing hospital bills that will now need to be paid following the baby's delivery, causing Sarah to have a brief nervous breakdown and blame Johnny for Frankie's death, and tearfully berates him.|$|E
25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{throughout history}} had, arguably, {{been tempted to}} reduce two {{of these kinds of}} belief and knowledge to the other one: René Descartes and David Hume thought that the only knowledge that people start with is self-knowledge. Some logical positivists (and some would say Wittgenstein, or Wilfrid Sellars) held that people start with beliefs <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> external world. (Arguably, Friedrich Schelling and Emmanuel Levinas held that people start with beliefs only about other people.) It is not possible, on Davidson's view, for a person to have only one of the three kinds of mental content; anyone who has beliefs of one of the kinds must have beliefs of the other two kinds.|$|E

25|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1960s, Presley made films that relied heavily on exotic locations and mundane songs, and he was tied into contracts that he could not escape. Parker did not care if the films were good or bad but <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> profits. When Presley complained to him that he wanted better scripts, Parker reminded him of his lavish lifestyle and that risking $1 million a year for doing practically no work was dangerous. Presley's career stagnated while artists like the Beatles, the Supremes, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan dominated the charts. Parker admitted in 1983 that after 1966, the income from Presley films and soundtracks was dramatically reduced.|$|E
25|$|Nahmanides, often {{critical}} of the rationalist views of Maimonides, pointed out (in his commentary to Genesis) several non-sequiturs stemming from a literal translation of the Bible's account of Creation, and stated that the account actually symbolically refers to spiritual concepts. He quoted the Mishnah in Tractate Hagigah which states that the actual meaning of the Creation account, mystical in nature, was traditionally transmitted from teachers to advanced scholars in a private setting. Many classic Kabbalistic sources mention Shmitot - cosmic cycles of creation, similar to the Indian concept of yugas. Nahmanides' disciple, Rabbi Isaac of Akko, a prominent Kabbalist of 13th-century, held that the Universe is about 15 billion years old. According to the tradition of Shmitot, Genesis talks openly <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> current epoch, while {{the information about the}} previous cosmic cycles is hidden in the esoteric reading of the text.|$|E
25|$|According to {{sociologist}} Burton Clark, Reed {{is one of}} {{the most}} unusual institutions of higher learning in the United States, featuring a traditional liberal arts and natural sciences curriculum. It requires freshmen to take Humanities 110, an intensive introduction to the Classics, covering ancient Greece and Rome as well as the Bible and ancient Jewish history. Its program in the sciences is likewise unusual with its TRIGA research reactor making it the only school in the United States to have a nuclear reactor operated primarily by undergraduates. Reed also requires all students to complete a thesis (a two-semester-long research project conducted under the guidance of professors) during the senior year as a prerequisite of graduation with successful completion of a junior qualifying exam at the end of the junior year a prerequisite to beginning the thesis. Upon completion of the senior thesis, students must also pass an oral exam that may encompass questions not <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> thesis but also about any course previously taken.|$|E
