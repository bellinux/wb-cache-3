5|$|After the battle, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Edinburgh</b> was {{attached}} to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron and remained at sea until 2 June, searching for disabled ships. She arrived in Scapa Flow on the afternoon of 3 June. On the evening of 18 August 1916, the Grand Fleet, including Duke <b>of</b> <b>Edinburgh,</b> put to sea in response to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet, minus the II Battle Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The Germans planned to bombard the port of Sunderland on 19 August, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Germans broke off their planned attack to pursue a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans then set course for home. After Jutland the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, now including Duke <b>of</b> <b>Edinburgh,</b> was ordered to reinforce the patrols north of the Shetland Islands against German blockade runners and commerce raiders. The ship's foremast was converted to a tripod to support the weight of a fire-control director in May 1917, but when the director was actually fitted is not known. Two more 6-inch guns were added in embrasures on the forecastle deck during that same refit. She was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in August 1917 for convoy escort duties, where she remained {{for the duration of the}} war. Upon her return, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Edinburgh</b> was stationed in the Humber, before she was sold for scrap on 12 April 1920 and broken up at Blyth in Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|As a result, a {{bill was}} {{proposed}} in the House of Commons that sought to punish the City <b>of</b> <b>Edinburgh</b> for the behaviour of its citizens by disenfranchising the city. Murray represented the City in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and eventually whittled down the bill so much {{that by the time}} it was voted on, it simply proposed to fine the city and disqualify the Provost. In exchange for his work, the citizens <b>of</b> <b>Edinburgh</b> gave him the Freedom of the City and a diamond, which is still in the possession of his family. Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in the House of Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.|$|E
