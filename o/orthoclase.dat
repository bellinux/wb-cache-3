Augite, biotite, plagioclase and hornblende occur as microphenocrysts and comprise 1% to 7% of the andesite. Small qualities of quartz are common and occur as microxenocrysts.

25|$|There {{are three}} main {{geological}} formations in Penang, i.e. the <b>orthoclase</b> to intermediate microcline granite, microcline granite, and the Mahang formation (mainly ferruginous spotted slate). Penang Island has no sedimentary rocks {{and most of}} the island is underlain by igneous rocks which are granites in the IUGS or Streckeisen classification.|$|E
25|$|While gem beryls are ordinarily {{found in}} pegmatites and certain {{metamorphic}} stones, red beryl occurs in topaz-bearing rhyolites. It is formed by crystallizing under low pressure and high temperature from a pneumatolytic phase along fractures or within near-surface miarolitic cavities of the rhyolite. Associated minerals include bixbyite, quartz, <b>orthoclase,</b> topaz, spessartine, pseudobrookite and hematite.|$|E
25|$|The {{crystallisation}} of {{igneous rocks}} from magma {{depends on a}} number of factors; among them are the chemical composition of the magma, the cooling rate, and some properties of the individual minerals to be formed, such as lattice energy, melting point, and complexity of their crystal structure. As magma is cooled, olivine appears first, followed by pyroxene, amphibole, biotite mica, <b>orthoclase</b> feldspar, muscovite mica, quartz, zeolites, and finally hydrothermal minerals. This sequence shows a trend towards increasingly complex silicate units with cooling, and the introduction of hydroxide and fluoride anions in addition to oxides. Many metals can substitute for silicon. After these igneous rocks undergo weathering, transport, and deposition, sedimentary rocks like clay, shale, and sandstone are formed. Metamorphism also can occur at high temperatures and pressures, creating an even vaster variety of minerals.|$|E
25|$|Twinning is the intergrowth {{of two or}} more crystal of {{a single}} mineral species. The {{geometry}} of the twinning is controlled by the mineral's symmetry. As a result, there are several types of twins, including contact twins, reticulated twins, geniculated twins, penetration twins, cyclic twins, and polysynthetic twins. Contact, or simple twins, consist of two crystals joined at a plane; this type of twinning is common in spinel. Reticulated twins, common in rutile, are interlocking crystals resembling netting. Geniculated twins have a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the twin. Penetration twins consist of two single crystals that have grown into each other; examples of this twinning include cross-shaped staurolite twins and Carlsbad twinning in <b>orthoclase.</b> Cyclic twins are caused by repeated twinning around a rotation axis. It occurs around three, four, five, six, or eight-fold axes, and the corresponding patterns are called threelings, fourlings, fivelings, sixlings, and eightlings. Sixlings are common in aragonite. Polysynthetic twins are similar to cyclic twinning by the presence of repetitive twinning; however, instead of occurring around a rotational axis, it occurs along parallel planes, usually on a microscopic scale.|$|E
500|$|Elemental {{potassium}} {{does not}} occur in nature because of its high reactivity. It reacts violently with water (see section Precautions below) and also reacts with oxygen. <b>Orthoclase</b> (potassium feldspar) is a common rock-forming mineral. Granite for example contains 5% potassium, which is well above the average in the Earth's crust. Sylvite (KCl), carnallite , kainite [...] and langbeinite [...] are the minerals found in large evaporite deposits worldwide. The deposits often show layers starting with the least soluble {{at the bottom and}} the most soluble on top. Deposits of niter (potassium nitrate) are formed by decomposition of organic material in contact with atmosphere, mostly in caves; because of the good water solubility of niter the formation of larger deposits requires special environmental conditions.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Orthoclase</b> {{feldspar}} (KAlSi3O8) is {{a mineral}} {{commonly found in}} granite, a plutonic igneous rock. When exposed to weathering, it reacts to form kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4, a sedimentary mineral, and silicic acid): ...|$|E
2500|$|Feldspars are {{the most}} {{abundant}} group in the Earth's crust, at about 50%. In the feldspars, Al3+ substitutes for Si4+, which creates a charge imbalance that must {{be accounted for by}} the addition of cations. The base structure becomes either − or 2− [...] There are 22 mineral species of feldspars, subdivided into two major subgroups – alkali and plagioclase – and two less common groups – celsian and banalsite. The alkali feldspars are most commonly in a series between potassium-rich <b>orthoclase</b> and sodium-rich albite; in the case of plagioclase, the most common series ranges from albite to calcium-rich anorthite. Crystal twinning is common in feldspars, especially polysynthetic twins in plagioclase and Carlsbad twins in alkali feldspars. If the latter subgroup cools slowly from a melt, it forms exsolution lamellae because the two components – <b>orthoclase</b> and albite – are unstable in solid solution. Exsolution can be on a scale from microscopic to readily observable in hand-sample; perthitic texture forms when Na-rich feldspar exsolve in a K-rich host. The opposite texture (antiperthitic), where K-rich feldspar exsolves in a Na-rich host, is very rare.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Orthoclase,</b> or <b>orthoclase</b> {{feldspar}} (endmember formula KAlSi3O8), is {{an important}} tectosilicate mineral which forms igneous rock. The name is from the Ancient Greek for [...] "straight fracture," [...] because its two cleavage planes are {{at right angles to}} each other. It is a type of potassium feldspar, also known as K-feldspar. The gem known as moonstone (see below) is largely composed of <b>orthoclase.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Microcline may be {{chemically}} {{the same}} as monoclinic <b>orthoclase,</b> but because {{it belongs to the}} triclinic crystal system, the prism angle is slightly less than right angles; hence the name [...] "microcline" [...] from the Greek [...] "small slope." [...] It is a fully ordered triclinic modification of potassium feldspar and is dimorphous with <b>orthoclase.</b> Microcline is identical to <b>orthoclase</b> in many physical properties; it can be distinguished by x-ray or optical examination; viewed under a polarizing microscope, microcline exhibits a minute multiple twinning which forms a grating-like structure that is unmistakable.Perthite is either microcline or <b>orthoclase</b> with thin lamellae of exsolved albite.|$|E

50|$|Typically, {{the pure}} {{potassium}} endmember of <b>orthoclase</b> forms a solid solution with albite, the sodium endmember (NaAlSi3O8), of plagioclase. While slowly cooling within the earth, sodium-rich albite lamellae form by exsolution, enriching the remaining <b>orthoclase</b> with potassium. The resulting intergrowth {{of the two}} feldspars is called perthite.|$|E
50|$|Oligoclase occurs, often {{accompanying}} <b>orthoclase,</b> as {{a constituent}} of plutonic igneous rocks such as granite, syenite, and diorite. It occurs in porphyry and diabase dikes and sills {{as well as}} in the volcanic rocks andesite and trachyte. It also occurs in gneiss. The best developed and largest crystals are those found with <b>orthoclase,</b> quartz, epidote, and calcite in veins in granite at Arendal in Norway. The distinctive texture of rapakivi granite is due to oligoclase rims on <b>orthoclase</b> phenocrysts. Oligoclase is also found in metamorphic rocks formed under transitional greenschist to amphibolite facies conditions.|$|E
50|$|Moonstone is {{composed}} of two feldspar species, <b>orthoclase</b> and albite. The two species are intermingled. Then, as the newly formed mineral cools, the intergrowth of <b>orthoclase</b> and albite separates into stacked, alternating layers. When light falls between these thin, flat layers, it scatters in many directions producing the phenomenon called adularescence.|$|E
