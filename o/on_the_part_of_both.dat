5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc. A large and growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion measures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> town and gown.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{indifferent}} form <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> Forster and Southampton as a whole, Southampton {{became the}} first team in history to reach the League Cup final without conceding a single goal. However, Southampton lost 3–2 to Manchester United in the final on 26 February 2017. Forster had a good match in Southampton's scoreless draw with Liverpool at Anfield on 7 May 2017; saving James Milner's 65th minute penalty kick, and then pushing Marko Grujic's header over the crossbar in injury time.|$|E
5|$|This growing {{coalition}} {{expanded the}} potential enemies that Rome might face, and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers. The result was more alliance-seeking, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership (and protection) within that confederacy. While there were {{exceptions to this}} (such as military rule of Sicily after the First Punic War), {{it was not until}} after the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire, at least in certain locations. This shift mainly took place in parts of the west, such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} played during the Cold War, and intense {{feelings}} of nationalism were aroused in both Canada and the Soviet Union, {{as well as}} on the ice. The games introduced several talented Soviet players to North America, such as Alexander Yakushev, Valeri Kharlamov and goaltender Vladislav Tretiak; the latter two are Hockey Hall of Fame inductees. Team Canada, the first NHL and professional all-star team formed for international play, was led by Phil Esposito, who led the series in scoring, as well as contributing in other roles. The Canadian line of Bobby Clarke, Ron Ellis and Henderson, which was not expected to start for the team, as none were yet stars, played a surprisingly large role in the Canadian win. The series was filled with controversy, starting with the exclusion of top Canadian player Bobby Hull and including disputes over officiating, dirty play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> teams and the deliberate injury of Kharlamov by Clarke in game six.|$|E

Using a between-subjects experimental design, subjects were asked to estimate the probability that a young vs an old stimulus person would succeed in college and to judge the causes for his success or failure. Although there occurred no differences as a function of age in expectancy of success or attributions for success, failure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old stimulus person was attributed more to the stable causes of lack of ability and task difficulty, while failure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young stimulus person was attributed more to the unstable cause of lack of effort. The results were discussed in terms of those conditions under which negative stereotypes concerning the competency of the elderly will be considered appropriate and thereby exert an influence on evaluations.

The Anglo-German Naval Agreement was highly controversial, both at the time and since, because the 35:100 tonnage ratio allowed Germany the right to build a Navy beyond the limits set by the Treaty of Versailles, and the British had made the agreement without consulting France or Italy.|$|E
