25|$|Polo saddles are English-style, close contact, {{similar to}} jumping saddles; {{although}} most polo saddles lack a flap under the billets. Some players {{will not use}} a saddle blanket. The saddle has a flat seat and no knee support; the rider adopting a forward-leaning seat and closed knees dissimilar to a classical dressage seat. A breastplate is added, usually attached to the front billet. A standing martingale must be used: so, a breastplate is a necessity for safety. The tie-down is usually supported by a neck strap. Many saddles also have an overgirth. The stirrup irons are heavier than most, and the stirrup leathers are wider and thicker, for added safety when the player stands in the stirrups. The legs of the pony are wrapped with polo wraps from below the knee to the fetlock to minimize pain. Jumping (<b>open</b> <b>front)</b> or gallop boots are sometimes used along with the polo wraps for added protection. Often, these wraps match the team colours. The pony's mane is most often roached (hogged), and its tail is docked or braided {{so that it will}} not snag the rider's mallet.|$|E

25|$|Until 1914 the Kuban Cossack Host wore a {{full dress}} uniform {{comprising}} a dark grey/black kaftan (knee length collarless coat) with red shoulder straps and braiding {{on the wide}} cuffs. Ornamental containers (czerkeska) which had originally contained single loading measures of gunpowder for muzzle-loading muskets, were worn on the breasts of the kaftans. The kaftan had an <b>open</b> <b>front,</b> showing a red waistcoat. Wide grey trousers were worn, tucked into soft leather boots without heels. Officers wore silver epaulettes, braiding and ferrules, the latter in their czerkeskas. This Caucasian national dress was also worn by the Ural Cossack Host but in different facing colors. Tall black fur hats were worn on all occasions with red cloth tops and (for officers) silver lace. A white metal scroll was worn {{on the front of}} the fur hat. A whip was used instead of spurs. Prior to 1908, individual cossacks from all Hosts were required to provide their own uniforms (together with horses, Caucasian saddles and harness). On active service during World War I the Kuban Cossacks retained their distinctive dress but with a black waistcoat replacing the conspicuous red one and without the silver ornaments or red facings of full dress. A black felt cloak (bourki) was worn in bad weather both in peace-time and on active service.|$|E

500|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, the {{population}} of Minneapolis was growing rapidly, increasing 351 percent from 1880 to 1890. With {{the number of people}} moving into the city, lower-cost housing was needed for immigrants who were new to Minnesota. [...] The street had originally been platted as an alley between 22nd and 23rd Avenues South, but William Ragan developed it as a street and labeled it 22½ Avenue. [...] The houses were situated close together on narrow lots, with very narrow side yards and no front yards. [...] This almost gives the impression of rowhouses. [...] Most of the houses were built with brick veneer on timber frames, and they have uniform-sized roof slopes, modified flat arch windows, and <b>open</b> <b>front</b> porches.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Robert Fletcher {{wanted to}} emphasize the effects of their harsh environment on Khan and his followers. [...] "My intention with Khan was to express {{the fact that they}} had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure, so they had to cannibalize from the spaceship whatever they used or wore. Therefore, I tried to make it look as if they had dressed themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed the ship," [...] he said. Director Nicholas Meyer told Montalbán to keep Khan's right glove on at all times, in order to give viewers a puzzle they could form their own opinions about and add mystery to the character. Meyer has been repeatedly asked if Montalbán wore a prosthetic chest for his scenes, as his uniform was purposefully designed with an <b>open</b> <b>front.</b> Meyer replied in audio commentary for the film that Montalbán (who was 61 during filming) is [...] "one strong cookie," [...] and that no prosthetics were applied to the actor's sizeable frame.|$|E

40|$|Traps {{that use}} {{ultraviolet}} light as an attractant for flies {{are widely used}} in urban situations. To determine the differences in trap efficacy from design and lighting, pairs of traps were compared under laboratory conditions. Comparisons were made between traps with <b>open</b> <b>fronts</b> and with traps with restricted <b>open</b> <b>fronts,</b> black light bulbs, and black light blue bulbs, and glue boards with and without z- 9 -tricosene pheromone. In a windowless laboratory, pairs of traps were placed approximately 90 cm above the floor and 3 m apart. Fifty mixed-sex, 3 - to 5 -day-old house flies (Musca domestica) were released and counts of captured flies were made after 1, 4, 24 hrs. Traps with black light bulbs attracted and captured significantly more flies that those with black light blue bulbs. Black light bulbs increased the catch significantly in traps with <b>open</b> <b>fronts</b> but black light blue bulbs did not. Glue boards with pheromone did not influence fly catch in either housing type when black light blue bulbs were used. In traps with closed fronts and black light bulbs, the fly catch was numerically higher with glue boards with pheromone. The type of trap housing plus the type of light can affect fly catch {{and the use of}} pheromones on glue boards can decrease fly catch...|$|R
