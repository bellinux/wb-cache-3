2500|$|Another {{construction}} of R takes somewhat longer to describe, but better indicates {{the relationship with}} the rings RSn of symmetric polynomials in n indeterminates. For every n there is a surjective ring homomorphism n from the analoguous ring RSn+1 with one more indeterminate onto RSn, defined by setting the last indeterminate X'n+1 to0. Although n has a non-trivial kernel, the nonzero elements of that kernel have degree at least [...] (they are multiples of X1X2X'n+1). This means that the restriction of n to elements of degree at most n is a bijective linear map, and n(e'k(X1,…,X'n+1))=e'k(X1,…,X'n) for all k≤n. The inverse of this restriction can be extended uniquely to a ring homomorphism n from RSn to RSn+1, as follows for instance from the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials. Since the images n(e'k(X1,…,X'n))=e'k(X1,…,X'n+1) for k=1,,n are still algebraically independent <b>overR,</b> the homomorphism n is injective and {{can be viewed as a}} (somewhat unusual) inclusion of rings; applying n to a polynomial amounts to adding all monomials containing the new indeterminate obtained by symmetry from monomials already present. The ring R is then the [...] "union" [...] (direct limit) of all these rings subject to these inclusions. Since all n are compatible with the grading by total degree of the rings involved, R obtains the structure of a graded ring.|$|E

This paper begins by introducing elliptic curves <b>overR</b> but is more concerned with the field of complex numbers, continuing through basic theory to showing that complex tori are isomorphic to complex elliptic curves.

We justify this inclusion by showing how many reported problems with large systems are not just software problems but relate to system issues such as hardware and operational processes. We describe {{what we mean by}} `systems engineering' and go on to discuss the particular course structure which we have developed. We explain, in some detail, the contents of two specific systems engineering courses (Software Intensive Systems Engineering and Critical Systems Engineering) and discuss the problems and challenges we have faced in making these changes. In the Appendix, we provide details of the case studies which are used as linking themes in our courses. Introduction Software engineering gets a really bad press.

In this paper we show that ifRhas enough non-units and ∀x 1 …∀xn∃yψ(x 1,…,xn,y), called an ∀n∃ sentence, is true inR, then ∃yψ(y) is true inK[x 1,…,xn]. Also, ifR=K[T], whereKis an infinite integral domain and∀x 1 …∀xn∃yψ(x 1,…,xn,y) is true inR, then ∃yψ(y) is true inR[x 1,…,xn]. These results are applied to find {{the upper and lower}} bounds of the time complexities of various decision problems on diophantine equations with parameters and arithmetical sentences. Some of the results are: 1. The decision problem of ∀∃ sentences and diophantine equations with parameters over the ring of integers of a global field are co-NP-complete. 2. The decision problem of ∀∃ sentences over the ring of integers of a global field is NP-complete. 3.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The higher {{traces of}} a matrix are the {{coefficients}} of its char-acteristic polynomial. We show that for real matrices these coefficients have a geometric interpretation {{in terms of}} expected values of oriented volumes, generalizing the volume interpretation of the determinant. LetA be an n×nmatrix <b>overR.</b> The higher k-trace ofA is the coefficient τk in the characteristic polynomial of A det(λI −A) = n∑ k= 0 (− 1) kτkλn−k. Note that τ 1 = trA and τn = detA. (We write τk(A) when the dependence on A needs to be explicit.) It is a familiar fact that τn is the oriented volume of the image under multiplication by A of a unit cube inRn, for example, the cube spanned by any orthonormal basis u 1, [...] ., un. The other coefficients τk likewise have an interpretation {{in terms of the}} change in k-dimensional volumes under multiplication by A. Let V (n, k) be the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal k-frames in Rn con-sisting of points u = (u 1, [...] ., uk) where the ui are mutually orthogonal unit vectors inRn. Let spanu be the k-dimensional subspace spanned by the ui. The vectorsAu 1, [...] ., Auk span a parallelepiped. Project that parallelepiped orthogonally onto spanu and define Tk(u) to be the oriented k-volume of the result. The aim {{of this article is to}} prove that as u varies over V (n, k), the average value of Tk(u) i...|$|E
