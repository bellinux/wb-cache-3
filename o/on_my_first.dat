We want to keep him." [...] Hodgson dismissed reports Torres was set to leave Liverpool by saying, [...] "He has {{told us that he}} is looking forward to Monday, to getting back to work and looking forward to playing for Liverpool next season. That is what I know so other reports, I would suggest, are erroneous."

500|$|During {{the last}} two years that the Beatles performed, Lennon and Ono created and {{attended}} their own public protests against the Vietnam War. On March 20, 1969, they were married at the registry office in Gibraltar and spent their honeymoon in Amsterdam, campaigning with a week-long Bed-In for Peace. They planned another Bed-In in the US, but were denied entry to the country. They held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded [...] "Give Peace a Chance". Lennon later stated his regrets about feeling [...] "guilty enough to give McCartney credit as co-writer <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> independent single instead of giving it to Yoko, who had actually written it with me." [...] The famous couple often combined advocacy with performance art, such as in [...] "bagism", first introduced during a Vienna press conference, where they satirised prejudice and stereotyping by wearing a bag over their entire bodies. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles' song [...] "The Ballad of John and Yoko".|$|E

[...] "Running Back" [...] {{is one of the}} three tracks Audius produced for the album. Mullins has stated that when he hears the song on the radio, [...] "he's merely satisfied" [...] that it fits the formula. [...] "Running Back" [...] was recorded at The Sound Academy in Sydney, New South Wales, and Phil Tan mixed the track at Soapbox Studios, Atlanta, Georgia. Mauboy and Flo Rida recorded their verses in separate studios. She said that the song is based on [...] "one of my past experiences". In an interview with Take 40 Australia, Mauboy said working with Flo Rida was a dream come true, [...] "I love urban music and have been a huge fan of Flo-Rida's from the moment I heard 'Low'. For him to now feature <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> single I just can't believe it! I am so excited and honoured." [...] "Running Back" [...] is an urban pop ballad, featuring [...] "a restrained vocal performance from Mauboy." [...] According to Davey Boy from Sputnikmusic, the song [...] "is one-part smooth ballad with its twinkling piano loop and lovelorn lyrics, and one-part contemporary hip hop with its deceptively slinky vocals and effective—if phoned in—Flo Rida cameo." ...|$|E

[...] She added that she spoke with a mixed accent of the United States, Philippines and India, and spoke to fellow cast member Ewen Bremner for advice on her English pronunciation.

[...] Of Yona's background, Bong revealed, [...] "Yona's mother was the leader of the Frozen Seven's revolution – because she was an Inuit. She was confident that she could endure the coldness.

2500|$|He {{resigned}} from the advertising industry in 1964, moved into a modest apartment near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel ("It wasn’t Paris in the 1920s, but I was happy" [...] DeLillo has said of this time), and began work on his first novel. Reflecting on {{the early days of}} his writing career, he remarked: [...] "I lived in a very minimal kind of way. My telephone would be $4.20 every month. I was paying a rent of sixty dollars a month. And I was becoming a writer. So in one sense, I was ignoring the movements of the time." [...] His first novel, Americana, was written over the course of four years and finally published in 1971, to modest critical praise. Americana concerned [...] "a television network programmer who hits the road in search of the big picture". DeLillo revised the novel in 1989 for paperback re-printing. Reflecting on the novel later in his career, he admitted, [...] "I don't think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published." [...] Later still, DeLillo still felt a degree of surprise at Americana being published, noting [...] "I was working <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> novel, Americana, for two years before I ever realized that I could be a writer [...] I had absolutely no assurance that this book would be published because I knew that there were elements that I simply didn't know how to improve at that point. So I wrote for another two years and finished the novel. It wasn’t all that difficult to find a publisher, to my astonishment. I didn't have a representative. I didn’t know anything about publishing. But an editor at Houghton Mifflin read the manuscript and decided that this was worth pursuing." ...|$|E
