5|$|Her stage work in {{the late}} 1950s laid the {{foundation}} for her film career in the 1960s. She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with Tall Story, in which she recreated one of her Broadway roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by Anthony Perkins. Period <b>of</b> <b>Adjustment</b> and Walk on the Wild Side followed in 1962. In Walk on the Wild Side, Fonda played a prostitute and earned a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer.|$|E
5|$|Fonda {{made her}} Broadway {{debut in the}} 1960 play There Was a Little Girl, for which she {{received}} {{the first of two}} Tony Award nominations, and made her screen debut later the same year in Tall Story. She rose to fame in 1960s films such as Period <b>of</b> <b>Adjustment</b> (1962), Sunday in New York (1963), Cat Ballou (1965), Barefoot in the Park (1967) and Barbarella (1968). Her first husband was Barbarella director Roger Vadim. A seven-time Academy Award nominee, she received her first nomination for They Shoot Horses, Don't They (1969) and went on to win two Best Actress Oscars in the 1970s for Klute (1971) and Coming Home (1978). Her other nominations were for Julia (1977), The China Syndrome (1979), On Golden Pond (1981) and The Morning After (1986). Her other major competitive awards include an Emmy Award for the 1984 TV film The Dollmaker, two BAFTA Awards for Julia and The China Syndrome and four Golden Globe Awards.|$|E

5|$|The {{length of}} the time step chosen within the model {{is related to the}} {{distance}} between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The Met Office's Unified Model is run six days into the future, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10days into the future, while the Global Forecast System model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run 16days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart, or prog. The raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast. This can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model, or <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts. MOS or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance. This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. In numerical models, extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.|$|E

25|$|The shunt {{connection}} results in smoother transfer characteristics and lower signal distortions, {{but also in}} a lower modulation range (−60dB). This limitation is lifted by connecting two shunt dividers in series, which keeps the transfer characteristic smooth. The best combination of a smooth transfer characteristic, low distortion, wide range <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> and nearly equal rates of increase and decrease of the transmission coefficient is achieved in a series-parallel circuit composed of two ROs and a series resistor. The frequency response of such circuit {{is similar to that}} of the series connection.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} 4 major forecasters and the forecast consensus. We employ a new technique of "Fixed Horizon" models. This technique analyzes the sequence <b>of</b> <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> a series of forecasts of the same event. We first demonstrate that these forecast adjustment sequences should fluctuate randomly under rationality. We then examine approximately 1200 forecast adjustments over the 1978 - 1982 period to examine the statistical properties <b>of</b> forecast <b>adjustments.</b> The evidence clearly demonstrates that there are marked and significant elements of statistical rationality for these major forecasters. Information shocks are processed slowly. The pattern <b>of</b> <b>adjustments</b> is consistent with forecasters being adverse to "Inconsistency," i. e., large rapid changes in forecasts. There also may be evidence that forecasters move towards a consensus in hero-like fashion. Forecast efficiency, forecast adjustments...|$|R

The book's direct predecessor was Patterns <b>of</b> <b>Adjustment</b> in Deviant Populations, a 1967 survey of white gay men in Chicago designed by Bell and Gebhard and funded by NIMH. This pilot study contained many questions identical to those used in Homosexualities, which was a survey of gay men and lesbians carried out in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1969 and 1970.|$|E
25|$|Externalities occur {{where there}} are {{significant}} social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities {{in an effort to}} correct the price distortions caused by these externalities. Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{target of}} the first Fujimori Administration, was to stop the runaway course of inflation. Beyond that, the goals included repudiating protection and import substitution, returning to full participation in the world trading and financial systems, eliminating domestic price controls and subsidies, raising public revenue and holding government spending strictly to the levels of current revenue, initiating a social emergency program to reduce the shock <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> for the poor, and devoting a higher share of the country's resources to rural investment and correction {{of the causes of}} rural poverty. In practice, new measures came out in bits and pieces, dominated by immediate concern to stop inflation; actions taken in the first year did not complete the program.|$|E

Alvin Ng. Ismail's video, which was addressed directly to gay Muslims in the country, resulted in anonymous death threats being issued against him. The videos were inspired by an interview of Gabrielle Yong, a 21-year-old Malaysian openly bisexual student who attempted suicide while studying abroad in Massachusetts; while her attempt was due to the difficulty <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> in a different environment, she was inspired to contribute her own testimony in the vein of the project.|$|E
25|$|The {{mayor is}} elected citywide to a three-year {{term of office}} and has {{significant}} powers in appointing members to the Planning Board, the Library Board of Trustees, and, with council confirmation, the Board <b>of</b> <b>Adjustment.</b> The mayor serves on the Planning Board. The mayor attends and may speak at council meetings, but voting is confined only to breaking a deadlock with an affirmative vote for passage of an ordinance or resolution. The mayor has veto power over any city ordinance, but can be overridden with votes from four council members. The City Council is the legislative branch of government, deciding public policy, creating city ordinances and resolutions, passing the city budget, appropriating funds for city services, and hiring the City Manager.

25|$|Supporters of {{the theory}} include sexual {{behavior}} scientists J.

They are also more likely to come from poorer, non-white or immigrant backgrounds, have lower IQs, as well as be by definition exclusively attracted to men. Autogynephilic transsexuals are either attracted to women, exclusively or not, or asexual. They are also said under the theory to display more fetishistic or otherwise paraphilic arousal.|$|E
25|$|Issei women's {{lives were}} {{somewhat}} similar, despite differences in context, {{because they were}} structured within interlocking webs of patriarchal relationships, and that consistent subordination was experienced both as oppressive and {{as a source of}} happiness. The Issei women lived lives of transition which were affected by three common factors: the dominant ideology of late Meiji Japan, which advanced the economic objectives of the Japanese state; the patriarchal traditions of the agricultural village, which arose partly as a form <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> to national objectives and the adjustment to changes imposed by modernization; and the constraints which arose within a Canadian or American society dominated by racist ideology. Substantive evidence of the working lives of Issei women is very difficult to find, partly for lack of data and partly because the data that do exist are influenced by their implicit ideological definition of women.|$|E
25|$|An {{ordinary}} camera {{could be}} used to take the three pictures, by reloading it and changing filters between exposures, but pioneering color photographers usually built or bought special cameras that made the procedure less awkward and time-consuming. One of the two main types used beam splitters to produce three separate images in the camera, making all three exposures {{at the same time and}} from the same viewpoint. Although a camera of this type was ideal in theory, such cameras were optically complicated and delicate, and liable to get out <b>of</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Some designs were also subject to optical phenomena that could cause noticeably uneven color or other defects in the results. The other, more robust type was an essentially ordinary camera with a special sliding holder for the plates and filters that allowed each in turn to be efficiently shifted into position for exposure—an operation sometimes partly or even entirely automated with a pneumatic mechanism or spring-powered motor.|$|E
