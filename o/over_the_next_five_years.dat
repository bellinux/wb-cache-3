5|$|Concerned that {{allegations}} of communists in the SCLC, if made public, would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives, Kennedy warned King to discontinue these associations, and later {{felt compelled to}} issue the written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders.

In 1989 she was elected as the representative for Bijnor, with 183,189 votes, winning by 8,879 votes.

5|$|With a {{new home}} and First Division football, attendances were more than double those at the Manor Ground, and Arsenal's budget grew rapidly. Their {{location}} and record-breaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> Chapman built a new Arsenal. He appointed enduring new trainer Tom Whittaker, implemented Charlie Buchan's new twist on the nascent WM formation, captured young players like Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood, and lavished Highbury's income on stars like David Jack and Alex James.

The Brunner family were active in the Oxford community, Thomas' parents raising him and his siblings to appreciate cultural and charitable activities.

5|$|After {{three years}} out of {{commission}} from 1903 to 1906, Yorktown hosted Secretary of the Navy Victor H. Metcalf on board when he greeted the Great White Fleet on its arrival in San Francisco in May 1907. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> most of Yorktowns time was spent in sealing patrols in Alaska and duty in Latin American ports. From July 1912, Yorktown was out of commission for alterations, but resumed duties off the Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran coasts beginning in April 1913. Through World War I, Yorktown continued in the same role, until she departed for the East Coast of the United States in April 1918. She served an escort for one convoy headed to Halifax in August, and remained in coastal escort duties in the east until January 1919. After arrival at San Diego in February, she was decommissioned for the final time in June 1919; she was sold in 1921 to an Oakland firm and broken up that same year.|$|E
5|$|As CGDK chairperson, Sihanouk unsuccessfully negotiated, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> {{with the}} Chinese {{government}} {{to broker a}} political settlement to end the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.

Chakrapong was appointed as the deputy chief-of-staff for the ANS in March 1985, while Ranariddh was minted to the twin positions of commander-in-chief and the chief-of-staff of the ANS in January 1986, replacing Tam. In December 1987 the Prime Minister of the PRK government, Hun Sen, first met with Sihanouk to discuss ending the protracted Cambodian–Vietnamese War.

5|$|The gradual {{switch from}} amateur to {{professional}} continued in 1968, when {{for the first}} time the chorus was supplemented by a smaller, professional group of singers; the mix of amateur and professional choristers continued <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> At the end of the 1960s the main WNO company, now a year-round operation, consisted of 8 salaried principal singers, 57 guest soloists and a chorus of 90 amateurs and 32 professionals. As well as the Bournemouth players, the company engaged the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, City of Birmingham Symphony and Ulster orchestras for different venues. In the last season of the decade 32 performances were given in Cardiff and 61 elsewhere in the UK. In addition to the main company, WNO maintained two smaller groups: one, with orchestra, toured Welsh towns, the other, consisting of 12 singers with piano, toured 79, mostly small, towns in Wales and England.
