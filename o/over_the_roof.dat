5|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced in March 2011. Barfi! {{was shot}} between June 2011 and February 2012, mostly in Darjeeling. In March 2011, Basu visited Kolkata to finalize the locations within the city. Filming in Mumbai began on 20 March 2011 and continued until May 2011. In June 2011, {{the cast and}} crew shot in Darjeeling. In December 2011, some scenes were filmed on the outskirts of Coimbatore, especially Pollachi and Ooty. The scenes in which Kapoor's character is chased by policemen <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> tops were shot in Kolkata at the end of January 2012. Shooting was completed by April 2012, except for some scenes featuring Chopra. The producers postponed the release from 13 July to 31 August 2012 as the September 2011 shooting schedule was cancelled and was waiting to be shot. However, Basu began working on Ileana's dubbing portions by end of April 2012, because D'Cruz was unfamiliar with the Hindi language and wanted to learn it whilst filming.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is similar}} to that of Madagascan Paratriaenops, but the premaxilla is longer. The rostrum (front part of the skull) is {{well-developed}} and contains a pronounced nasal swelling, which is less pronounced than in Paratriaenops; the depression behind the swelling is relatively shallow. Compared to other species of Triaenops, the rostrum is relatively narrow and short, similar to T.parvus; T.afer and T.persicus have a broader rostrum. The front margin of the rostrum is cast back between the left and right corners. A transverse line passes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the rostrum. The infraorbital foramen, an opening in the skull, is oblong in shape. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are not broadened towards the sides, are connected to the maxillaries by broad bones, and contain clear crests on their upper sides. In T.menamena, these crests are rectangular in form and larger than in Paratriaenops. The braincase is lower than in other species of Triaenops. The sagittal crest, which is on the roof of the braincase, is poorly developed. In the mandible, the coronoid process is blunt and rounded, but the angular process (both processes at the back of the bone) is small.|$|E
25|$|A {{cottage on}} the north side of Anglo Scotian Mills was reputed to have the tallest {{domestic}} chimney in England. Its length was necessary to reach <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the Mill. Although the cottage has been demolished for several years, the chimney can still be seen attached to the wall of the Mill.|$|E

25|$|As a batsman, {{following}} a strong order, Robinson's normal brief was to score quickly. He lifted Claude Lewis, the Kent left-arm spinner and later county scorer, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> {{of the football}} stand at Headingley, put Dick Howorth of Worcestershire out of Park Avenue, Bradford and into Horton Park, and Johnnie Clay of Glamorgan out of the Arms Park in Cardiff.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 a {{production}} car was modified and dubbed the Gremlin XP prototype. It has a larger glass hatchback and additional side quarter windows. A pronounced crease started from the mid-body section and wraps <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> while the rear quarter panels feature bulges around the wheel well openings. The rear panel has a recessed and blacked out area with four lights. The {{design of the}} concept car improved visibility around the Gremlin's original wide C-pillar.|$|E

Only the black painted {{versions}} included gold body side stripes that continued up and <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> band, as well as gold paint accents for the standard slot-styled wheels. A carryover 1977 Hornet AMX decal was available for the rear deck and hood, in either gold with orange or black with gold. Polished forged aluminum 5-spoke road wheels were optional.|$|E
25|$|When a turbine {{is mounted}} on a rooftop the {{building}} generally redirects wind <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and this can double the wind speed at the turbine. If {{the height of a}} rooftop mounted turbine tower is approximately 50% of the building height it is near the optimum for maximum wind energy and minimum wind turbulence. Wind speeds within the built environment are generally much lower than at exposed rural sites, noise may be a concern and an existing structure may not adequately resist the additional stress.|$|E

25|$|Many {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the burial of the mummies and some present-day Lebanese burials. For example, one of the infants had long strands of hair between its toes. According to local tradition {{in some areas of}} Lebanon today, a mother whose child dies will pull out her hair in lamentation while kissing the feet of her deceased child. Similarly, today in Lebanon, when the last member of a family dies, the key to the family house is thrown <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> indicating that no one will live in the house again. The presence of a key in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave may also indicate that the last member of a family had died there as well.|$|E
25|$|Ram Dass befriends Sara {{when his}} pet monkey escapes into Sara's {{adjoining}} attic. After climbing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> to Sara's {{room to get}} the monkey, Ram Dass tells Carrisford about Sara's poor living conditions. As a pleasant distraction, Carrisford and Ram Dass buy warm blankets, comfortable furniture, food, and other gifts, and secretly leave them in Sara's room when she is asleep or out. Sara's spirits and health improve due to the gifts she receives from her mysterious benefactor, whose identity she does not know; nor are Ram Dass and Carrisford aware that she is Crewe's lost daughter. When Carrisford anonymously sends Sara a package of new, well-made and expensive clothing in her proper size, Miss Minchin becomes alarmed, thinking Sara might have a wealthy relative secretly looking out for her, and begins to treat Sara better and allows her to attend classes rather than doing menial work.|$|E
25|$|Most of the museum's {{collections}} of mammalian and dinosaur fossils remain hidden from public view. They {{are kept in}} numerous storage areas located deep within the museum complex. Among these, the most significant storage facility is the ten story Childs Frick Building which stands within an inner courtyard of the museum. During construction of the Frick, giant cranes were employed to lift steel beams directly from the street, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> and into the courtyard, {{in order to ensure}} that the classic museum façade remained undisturbed. The predicted great weight of the fossil bones led designers to add special steel reinforcement to the building's framework, as it now houses the largest collection of fossil mammals and dinosaurs in the world. These collections occupy the basement and lower seven floors of the Frick Building, while the top three floors contain laboratories and offices. It is inside this particular building that many of the museum's intensive research programs into vertebrate paleontology are carried out.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRoofs {{comprise}} 20 - 25 % of {{the total}} urban surface area and with different roofing technologies and photovoltaic, present an opportunity for sustainable building designs. The operation temperature of photovoltaic (PV) modules has {{a significant impact on}} the conversion efficiency and output energy of the PV system. This research investigated the thermal interactions between the building envelope and PV panels by examining the PV panel temperature differences for those installed over a green roof (PV-green) and those installed over a black roof (PV-black). A LEED platinum certified educational building with roof mounted PV panels was used as a case study for the experimental phase of the study. PV panels <b>over</b> <b>the</b> green <b>roof</b> consistently recorded lower temperatures than PV panels <b>over</b> <b>the</b> black <b>roof.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> PV panels <b>over</b> <b>the</b> green <b>roof</b> had more energy output compared to <b>the</b> PV panels <b>over</b> <b>the</b> black <b>roof...</b>|$|R
500|$|After being {{dispatched}} {{from the}} station the train ascends a [...] half-enclosed chain lift hill. As the train begins its descent, music of choice begins to play. The train turns {{to the right and}} then proceeds over the first of many camelback hills. This hill navigates <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> structure covering the park's Hollywood area. A heavily banked turnaround is followed by another camelback <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> After a turn to the left the ride track runs parallel to the park's Hollywood street, after which the train navigates over two more camelback hills, and is slowed as it runs through a set of block brakes at the top of another hill. After descending out of the brakes, the train enters a one-and-a-half turn upward-spiralling helix followed by another camelback hill. A tunnel with strobe lighting leads the train into the final brake-run before it returns to the station.|$|E
500|$|The Phra Thinang Rachakaranya Sapha (พระที่นั่งราชกรัณยสภา; [...] ) {{is located}} on the {{southern}} end of the eastern wall. The closed rectangular building was built as a council chamber for use by the king and his ministers. In 1897 on his first trip to Europe, King Rama V installed Queen Saovabha Phongsri as regent, and she presided over privy council meetings here. This tradition was repeated in 1956 when Queen Sirikit, as regent presided over the privy council while King Rama IX briefly entered the Sangha as a monk. Occasionally the building is still used by the king for private audiences. The peculiar characteristic of this building was the projecting pediments <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> line. This feature was common during the Ayutthaya period.|$|E
500|$|L'Estrange {{wrote to}} the Council again, this time asking for {{permission}} to use Belmore Park for a second attempt. Much like his first attempt, the second ended in failure. Once again the balloon took {{much of the day}} to fill, with the lift going ahead at 5 pm on the afternoon of 7 December 1878. The first attempt dragged him approximately [...] through the crowd. Returning to the start point, L'Estrange tried again, shooting up into the air approximately [...] and sailing away towards the south, before descending again and being dragged across the park. The crowd feared the balloon would crash but once more it lifted, up and <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of Carters' Barracks. L'Estrange, realising that the balloon was not going to lift higher, threw out the anchor, which caught in the spouting of a building and threw the balloon into the drying yard of the Benevolent Asylum, where it caught in the washing lines and wires and was practically destroyed. Still, L'Estrange's place in Sydney hearts had been established and a well-attended benefit was held at the Theatre Royal on 19 December 1878.|$|E
