40|$|Abstract. <b>Outstanding</b> claims <b>liability</b> is the {{insurance}} companies’ corporate responsibility towards future debt. There {{are a number}} of existing models used to estimate the <b>outstanding</b> claims <b>liability</b> for long tail business. However, some of the assumptions imposed on these models are not met by the claims data under consideration. Furthermore, trends in the development year and payment year periods are not taken into account by these models. The Probabilistic Trend Family (PTF) model is developed to overcome these problems. In this paper, PTF model is described; and the process of estimating the <b>outstanding</b> claims <b>liability,</b> starting from the preliminary analysis of the claims data to the estimation of the <b>outstanding</b> claims <b>liability</b> is explained. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the obtained estimate of the <b>outstanding</b> claims <b>liability</b> is analyzed using a tool called leverage. Leverage can be used to evaluate the robustness of the model used to estimate the <b>outstanding</b> claims <b>liability.</b> Keywords : <b>Outstanding</b> claims <b>liability,</b> long tail business, development year period, payment year period, probabilistic trend family, sensitivity, leverage. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{application}} of the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method to the important problem of setting claims reserves in general insurance business for the <b>outstanding</b> loss <b>liabilities.</b> A measure of the uncertainty in these claims reserves estimates is also needed for solvency purposes. The RJMCMC method described in this paper represents an improvement over the manual processes often employed in practice. In particular, our RJMCMC method describes parameter reduction and tail factor estimation in the claims reserving process, and, moreover, it provides the full predictive distribution of the <b>outstanding</b> loss <b>liabilities...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the asymptotic {{behaviors of the}} loss reservings computed by individual data method and its aggregate data versions by Chain-Ladder (CL) and Bornhuetter–Ferguson (BF) algorithms. It is shown that all deviations of the three reservings from the individual loss reserve (the projection of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>liability</b> on the individual data) converge weakly to a zero-mean normal distribution at the View the MathML sourcerate. The analytical forms of the asymptotic variances are derived and compared by both analytical and numerical examples.

Our quantitative findings can be summarized in two sentences. For all the reforms considered, the financial impact of the mechanical effect (change in benefits) is order of magnitudes larger than the behavioral impact or change in behavior. For the two Spanish reforms, we find once again that their effect on the <b>outstanding</b> <b>liability</b> of the Spanish Social Security System is essentially negligible: neither the mechanical nor the behavioral effects amount to much for the 1997 reform, and amount to very little for the 2002 amendment.

50|$|This {{assessment}} {{results in}} a determination of whether the privilege of self-insurance can be granted and what security is necessary. The security {{may be in the}} form of a bond from a licensed surety company, certificate of deposit, United States government obligations, letter of credit or cash, in the minimum amount of $750,000. Most security amounts are considerably higher than the minimum. The employer may also be required to carry excess coverage. If the applicant is a subsidiary of a larger corporation, a parental guarantee will usually be required. The Commission requires that even if self-insurance is subsequently surrendered or revoked, the security must remain in place to cover all <b>outstanding</b> <b>liability</b> for the period of self-insurance.|$|R

In general, there is no extradition agreement between countries which covers extradition for <b>outstanding</b> tax <b>liabilities.</b> Going into tax exile is a form of tax mitigation or avoidance. A tax exile normally cannot return to their home country without being subject to <b>outstanding</b> tax <b>liabilities,</b> which may prevent them from leaving the country until they have been paid.|$|R

40|$|In old {{accounting}} tradition, {{non-life insurance}} companies have estimated nominal claims reserves for their <b>outstanding</b> loss <b>liabilities.</b> The new Solvency II developments require from non-life insurance companies that they go over to a market-consistent valuation of their insurance liabilities (full balance sheet approach) and that they prove solvency on a yearly basis. As a consequence non-life insurance companies need to consider discounted claims reserves {{and they need to}} yearly adjust these claims reserves for the <b>outstanding</b> loss <b>liabilities</b> according to the latest information available. In the present paper we study this one-year adjustment (one-year claims development result) for discounted claims reserves in a stochastic framework: For the purely insurance technical side the Bayes chain ladder model is used, the interest rate risk is described by an appropriate covariance matrix obtained from the Vasicek model. ...|$|R

3000|$|With {{retail and}} {{commercial}} customers, the banks prefer direct negotiations {{in an attempt}} to achieve an amicable agreement or, if necessary, they settle for receiving only part of the receivables. If an amicable settlement can be achieved, redemption 4 is agreed on. 5 The debtor then makes the previously agreed redemption payment, while the bank releases the provided collateral in return. The bank will, however, only accept a redemption payment if the payment that is offered equals at least the sum of the expected discounted (net) returns from the collateral and the cost of personal arbitration measures against the debtor (lower bound). On the other hand, the debtor will not pay back more than the <b>outstanding</b> <b>liability</b> (upper bound). In the case of redemption, the redemption payment should lie within the interval identified above. The difference between the realized redemption payment and the lower bound constitutes the premium. If negotiations fail or are not possible because of the debtor’s lack of financial assets, the bank can only fall back to the third form of the workout-process, the liquidation of the collateral. 6 [...]...|$|R
