5|$|At a New Year's Eve {{party that}} year, Sally feels alone without Harry by her side. Harry spends New Year's alone, {{walking around the}} city. As Sally decides to leave the party early, Harry appears and {{declares}} his love for her. She argues that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> is there is because he is lonely, but he lists the many things he realized he loves about her. They kiss and marry three months later.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
5|$|Newton often openly mocked {{the captain}} by {{creating}} obscene poems and songs {{about him that}} became so popular the crew began to join in. He entered into disagreements with several colleagues that resulted in his being starved almost to death, imprisoned while at sea and chained like the slaves they carried, then outright enslaved and forced {{to work on a}} plantation in Sierra Leone near the Sherbro River. After several months he came to think of Sierra Leone as his home, but his father intervened after Newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances, and a ship found him by coincidence. Newton claimed the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> left was because of Polly.|$|E
5000|$|The Attorney General, Sir Charles Russell {{attacked}} the City's attitude. The <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> could see for resisting the merger were a misplaced {{pride in the}} office of Lord Mayor and a [...] "too sacred regard" [...] for the City funds. Following the receipt of a letter from the President of the Local Government Board the City agreed to resume tendering evidence in December on the understanding that the terms of reference could be modified.|$|R
5000|$|Brewer {{took over}} at Ole Miss in 1983, {{succeeding}} Steve Sloan, who was 20-34-1 {{in the previous}} five seasons. Brewer's previous affiliation with Ole Miss made him a favorite in some circles at Ole Miss. An [...] "outsider" [...] had served as head coach {{since the end of}} Vaught's second stint in the position in 1974. Others, however, thought that Brewer's ties to Vaught and Vaught's associates were the <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> was considered for the position.|$|R
50|$|He was {{interested}} in Hindi literature and art that was the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>he</b> wrote some books. Suresh Singh was associated with poet Sumitranandan Pant, lyricist Naeem, actor Mani Madhukar.|$|R
5|$|After high school, Shoup {{attended}} DePauw University {{where he}} was one of 100 awarded the Edward Rector Scholarship, giving him full tuition. Majoring in mathematics, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity and maintained high marks, narrowly failing the selection criteria for Phi Beta Kappa Society. He was on the track and field and rifle teams, and also competed in the wrestling and football teams. He won the Indiana and Kentucky Amateur Athletic Union marathon in 1925. He waited tables, washed dishes and worked in a cement factory to help pay his expenses. Lack of funds compelled him to take a year off after his junior year to teach school, and his expenses were further strained when he contracted a severe case of pneumonia and incurred hospital bills. He opted to enroll in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) to offset his living expenses, and later recalled that this was the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> joined the military. He graduated from DePauw in 1926.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Mugford's {{statement}} Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he said the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He said he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs windows, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also said he had seen his parents' wills, {{and that they had}} left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, he told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{uses the}} {{situation}} to host a sex education class {{in order to learn}} if his former girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) has been having sex with her current boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). Distraught after realizing that they are having sex and after everyone mocks him, Andy throws a tantrum, hurling a box of pizza at the wall and storming out of the conference room. Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty saying no to how politely Gabe asked him. Gabe tells Andy {{that he is going to}} let this whole situation slide this time and advises Andy to put Erin behind him.|$|E
5000|$|Ben McKenzie {{spoke about}} Gordon's {{new role as}} a bounty hunter, [...] "He's {{just trying to get}} by. The <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he's</b> bounty hunting is to pay the bills and it also gives him that thrill of being in combat again, of having a {{challenge}} again. But the larger mission of cleaning up the city, he's kind of throwing his hands {{up in the air and}} said, 'I can't deal with this on an emotional and psychological level right now." ...|$|R
50|$|After Lois {{prepares to}} release a very {{damaging}} story, Sam has Lois taken into custody. The two finally meet face to face much to Lois' displeasure. Sam tells Lois the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he's</b> being lenient with her {{is that she is}} his daughter. He threatens to make her disappear forever in a place where not even Superman can find her. To make his point Sam shoots Lois' laptop containing her story. He realizes that she has back up copies but he has made his point.|$|R
5000|$|... "Dempsey {{could beat}} anybody he could hit. The <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>he</b> couldn't do {{anything}} with fellows like Tunney or Greb or myself was he couldn't hit us."- Tom Gibbons in a radio interview in 1949 ...|$|R
5|$|After {{a medical}} exam, Mulder {{finds out that}} Orison has three times the bloodflow {{capacity}} of the brain due to a hole in he has drilled into his own head, allowing him to perform mental tricks by hypnotizing people. Orison hypnotizes the security guard in his room and easily escapes. Meanwhile, at Orison's apartment, a prostitute escapes when Pfaster attacks her for wearing a wig. Orison then finds Pfaster and takes him at gunpoint. In the woods, Orison digs a grave for Pfaster, who morphs into a demonic beast and kills him, burying him in his own shallow grave. Pfaster then calls the police, telling them where Orison is buried, and goes to Scully's house. He attacks Scully, who tells him that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> was not given {{the death penalty was}} because she asked the judge for life. He overpowers her and locks her in her own closet. Mulder thinks something may be wrong when he hears the same song on his radio and calls Scully. After receiving no answer, he goes over to her house and stumbles upon Pfaster, promptly arresting him. Meanwhile, Scully escapes from the closet and shoots Pfaster, despite him being unarmed, killing him. Scully later confides in Mulder, telling him she's scared because she's not sure who's in control of her, God or something else.|$|E
25|$|Gibson casually disregards his {{reputation}} for intimidation, though, saying that he made no concerted effort to seem intimidating. He joked {{in an interview with}} a St. Louis public radio station that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> made faces while pitching was because he needed glasses and could not see the catcher's signals.|$|E
25|$|WCW {{claimed that}} {{attempts}} were made to save the storyline though Warrior has claimed in interviews and convention appearances that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> was brought back was so Hogan could get a win over Warrior in return for Hogan's WrestleMania job. Warrior's last appearance in WCW was on the November 9, 1998 episode of Monday Nitro, {{when he came to the}} rescue of The Disciple who was being attacked by members of The nWo. Warrior retired from wrestling that year.|$|E
50|$|Squire Flicker: The main {{character}} of the series, a squire under Sir Loungelot, he happily accepts any task his master gives him. Flicker longs for the day he'll become a Dragon Knight himself, yet it seems the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he's</b> not is that Loungelot typically takes credit for Flicker's heroic deeds. He is secretly in love with Princess Flame though he is very shy about showing it. Flicker is generally smarter and more competent than the Knights, and is a Machinist far {{ahead of his time}} even though his inventions do not always go well as he planned.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{came down}} here to see Pelter, Japson & Company, that's certain," [...] remarked Dick. [...] "It eras evidently the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>he</b> came to New York. Now the {{question}} is, Did he go and see those men, and did they waylay him, or did they hire somebody to do it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Egghead sneaks up {{and tries}} his luck at getting the gold-lamp, and succeeds. He says, [...] "Oh boy am I lucky". It is then {{revealed}} that the <b>only</b> <b>he</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> got the lamp was because he mistakes it for a sugar bowl. He looks {{at the back of}} the lamp and it reads, [...] "Rub Lamp 3 times". Egghead does so and a genie appears, which scares Egghead and he runs off; only for the genie to pull him right back.|$|R
25|$|Croydon Athletic F.C. {{was bought}} in 2008 by Mazhar Majeed. The {{football}} club was investigated by HM Revenues and Customs due to allegations that Majeed {{had been using}} the club for money-laundering purposes. Majeed had been recorded by an undercover journalist stating that was the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> had bought the club. This led to the manager and his assistant leaving the club after a match on 4 September, 2010. Less than a month later on 2 October, the club's chairman David Le Cluse {{was found dead in}} a garage in Sutton with a bullet wound to his head. In February 2011, a verdict of suicide was recorded at Croydon Coroner's Court.|$|E
25|$|Lois {{hands her}} exposé {{in and the}} {{government}} is after her for treason. With agents on her tail, she makes a mad dash for it. When Lois is in custody, her father Sam Lane is there to greet her in an interview room in an unnamed facility. Sam tells Lois the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> has been lenient with her is because she is his daughter, while he does love her the planet will always come first over his family and threatens to make her disappear forever if she continues. Lois returns to the Daily Planet under cover of night and explains all to Perry. She points out the whole paper is at risk and everyone connected to it if her exposé runs. Perry understands and though he must protect the paper he is first and foremost a good journalist and nudges Lois in the right direction; he won't run the story but noted it must get out to the people somehow. Enlightened, she quits the Daily Planet, as Lois gets her edge back. It was later revealed she never really quit the Daily Planet.|$|E
25|$|Dionysius {{copied the}} last decennovenal {{cycle of the}} Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with {{numbered}} Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi (Years of our Lord Jesus Christ) because, as he explained to Petronius, he {{did not wish to}} continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did not realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle × cycle of leap years × days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years, otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact.|$|E
50|$|He once {{joked that}} the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>he</b> hadn't fought {{and lost in}} Antarctica was that he hated being cold. In a 1990 Kayo boxing cards set, he posed while sitting on the canvas, with black make-up {{covering}} his eye, as he held on to a ring rope. As stated before, he would sometimes use the alias of Ruben Bardot to obtain fights.|$|R
5000|$|Ken is a {{first year}} student but is in a {{different}} class than Yukihiro. He has a hot-headed and rather impolite personality, and views Yukihiro as a rival. He actually has a crush on Yūko, the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>he</b> joined the club. He constantly complains that he doesn't have a nickname, and is later nicknamed by Yūko as [...] "Moonlight Dancing Step" [...] (Gekkō Danshingu Suteppu).|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Eugene (Josh McDermitt) and Rosita (Christian Serratos) {{return to}} the {{industrial}} machine shop that he and Abraham had found. There, she demands he manufacture her a bullet, as he had said he would. Eugene refuses, telling her that her plan {{is not likely to}} succeed, but Rosita continues to insist and eventually tells him that he has let down everyone who helped him, that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he's</b> alive is because people felt sorry for him, and that manufacturing a bullet would be the first useful thing he's done. Deeply hurt by these comments, Eugene begins to manufacture the bullet in silence. Later, when Rosita attempts to apologize, Eugene angrily brushes her off, telling her that he knows she sincerely meant what she said and is just trying to rebuild the bridge now that she has got what she wants.|$|R
25|$|In 1577, some of {{the gang}} members were caught, {{including}} Niers himself. Monika Spicker-Beck, for example, notes that a Claus Strikker confessed in April that 10 years earlier, he had worked together with Niers, and helped him murder a 20-year-old woman in Gottswald. Also, an accomplice named Peter Oblath drew {{up a list of}} 14 gang members, including the name of Peter Niers. Joy Wiltenburg notes that Niers himself was arrested and tortured in Gersbach. There, he confessed to 75 acts of murder, but somehow managed to escape. Over the next few years, until his final arrest in 1581, a number of pamphlets, ballads, and stories were written and circulated detailing his cannibalism and mastery of the black arts. For example, it was said that when Niers and Sumer's gang gathered at Pfalzburg, they had a meeting with the Devil, who gave his blessing to the gang's ambitions, even providing Niers and Sumer with monthly pay along with granting supernatural powers to Niers. Even earlier than this, however, it seems that Niers learned how to become invisible from his mentor Martin Stier, and that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> was finally caught was because he was deprived of his bag containing the magical materials to make himself invisible. A critical component of such magical material was thought to be the remains of fetuses; during the casting of the spell the fetus hearts were eaten. Joy Wiltenburg mentions also another use of fetal black magic: To concoct the flesh and fats of infants into magic candles that, when lit, would allow them to rob houses without awaking the inhabitants.|$|E
500|$|Over {{time one}} member of staff dropped out {{followed}} by another shortly after Bungie's acquisition by Microsoft, leaving Errera the sole webmaster and the main force on the site. Errera says that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> {{has become known as}} the [...] "Godfather" [...] of Halo is due his long-term presence in the community. Halo.Bungie.Org is unusual among large non-commercial sites in having no paid advertisements of any kind on any portion of the pages.|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} Waitman Wade Beorn writes: [...] "...some {{have argued}} that [...] deliberately inflated the numbers of Jews he reported killed. Yet all evidence indicates that he was quite content to play his role in Nazi genocide and that his subsequent displeasure with the regime may have stemmed from the imminent Nazi defeat but not opposition to the Holocaust". Bernhard Wehner of the Kripo stated that Nebe was worried the Allies would punish him for his crimes {{and that this was}} the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> joined the resistance.|$|E
50|$|At this time, Major Carrick {{insisted that}} all of the RRT {{candidates}} must go through the 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company Indoctrination Process (Indoc). Carrick later admitted that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>he</b> insisted on this issue was that he felt that all or most of the Radio Battalion Marines would either quit or fail the Indoc and the project would be put to rest once and for all.|$|R
50|$|There was {{a certain}} {{awareness}} about the phenomena among the public: in 1715, during a trial against male homosexuality, the soldier Jürgen Wiess defended himself by claiming that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>he</b> had reacted willingly to the sexual advances of a male corporal was because he believed the corporal {{to be a woman}} in disguise, as it was known that there were several disguised women among the soldiers.|$|R
60|$|As their dialect {{differed}} {{but little}} {{from that of}} the Gauls in the Carthaginian service, Malchus was enabled to understand the greater part of their conversation, and learned that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>he</b> was not put to death at once was that they wished to keep him until beyond the risk of pursuit of the Carthaginians, when he could be sacrificed to their gods formally and with the usual ceremonies.|$|R
500|$|The Season Seven DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Jim and Danny discussing Danny's success at selling his father's restaurant for {{a large amount of}} money, Michael expressing his delight at helping Jim and Dwight {{despite the fact that he}} is [...] "an old man", Michael mistaking Danny for a male model, extended scenes of Andy's band, extra footage of Meredith flirting with Danny, Michael remembering that Danny was once a backpack model, and Danny saying that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> will be working at Dunder Mifflin is because [...] "they offered [...] a stupid amount of money".|$|E
500|$|MacInnis {{said his}} {{decision}} to leave Calgary {{was not easy to}} make given his family was from the city. [...] He claimed money was not the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> signed with the Blues, stating that he wanted a new challenge. He left Calgary after 11 full NHL seasons as the franchise's all-time leader in scoring with 822points, and led in assists (603), games played (803), playoff assists (77) and playoff points (103). He appeared in six All-Star Games with Calgary and was named a league all-star five times: twice on the first team and three times on the second. The team honoured MacInnis as the first player inducted into their [...] "Forever a Flame" [...] program in 2012. [...] His jersey number 2 was raised to the Saddledome rafters on February 27, 2012, but was not formally retired.|$|E
500|$|In {{mentioning}} {{that he has}} been summoned for jury duty, and implying its exclusivity, Peter is confronted by Brian who reveals that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> was selected was because he had voted in the last election. Peter goes on to state that he actually stuffed the ballot box at the Oscars, when the nominees included Grover from Sesame Street, Bluto from Popeye, and Daniel Day-Lewis, among others. Actress Anne Hathaway presented the award. Going on to find out that everyone is asked to do jury duty, Peter soon seeks to be kicked out, just as he was from the rock band Coldplay once he suggested that they write a song that is [...] "not whiny bullcrap". Further attempting to be kicked out of jury duty, Peter begins singing the song [...] "Surfin' Bird" [...] by The Trashmen, a song that was first introduced in the series in the seventh season episode [...] "I Dream of Jesus".|$|E
50|$|After {{crushing}} {{the forces of}} Hell and Purgatory in the original titles, Daniel Garner was denied seeing his wife, Catherine. Now, with no faith left, {{he sat in the}} cemetery, where his quest once began. Suddenly, Death itself appeared, proposing Daniel a new bargain: reunion with his wife in exchange for 7,000 souls. Daniel reluctantly agrees, receiving the Soulcatcher gun. He is sent to familiar places, battling hordes of demon spawn, again defeating the formidable Necrogiant, Alastor, and Swamp Thing. An old ally, Eve, reappears during this quest, warning that Death cannot be trusted, but Daniel didn't forget her own betrayal at the end of Painkiller: Battle out of Hell. Daniel avoids her as she tries to persuade him that everything is not as it seems, and the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he's</b> so successful at killing demons and not succumbing to their power is that he is not really dead.|$|R
5000|$|Cahor, [...] "The Deceiver," [...] is {{a renowned}} trouble-maker. His {{main concern is}} {{creating}} chaos in Avernus, misinforming and conning all the ones he meets, in order to thwart and upset diabolic plans. This chaotic behavior got him exiled to Avernus. The <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>he</b> hasn't been readily destroyed is that his antics also mislead the demons. His true form {{is that of a}} mottled gray malebranche, but he seldom appears as such.|$|R
