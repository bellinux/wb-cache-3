5|$|Judge Duff {{ordered a}} retrial for Burge, former Police Supt. Richard Brzeczek, and the City of Chicago on two other {{outstanding}} charges (conspiracy {{and whether the}} City of Chicago's policy toward police brutality contributed to Wilson's injuries). Burge was acquitted <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges</b> in a second trial, which began on June 9, 1989, and lasted nine weeks.|$|E
5|$|Helm {{was painted}} as a {{suspicious}} figure {{by some of}} the izinDuna because all white visitors to Bulawayo met with him before seeing the king. This feeling was {{compounded by the fact that}} Helm had for some time acted as Lobengula's postmaster, and so handled all mail coming into Bulawayo. He was accused of having hidden the concession's true meaning from the king and of having knowingly sabotaged the prices being paid by traders for cattle, but neither <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges</b> could be proven either way. On the fourth day of the enquiry, Elliot and Rees, two missionaries based at Inyati, were asked if exclusive mining rights in other countries could be bought for similar sums, as Helm was claiming; they replied in the negative. The izinDuna concluded that either Helm or the missionaries must be lying. Elliot and Rees attempted to convince Lobengula that honest men did not necessarily always hold the same opinions, but had little success.|$|E
25|$|The {{prisoners were}} sued by several Libyan police {{officers}} for slandering {{them with the}} allegations of torture. However, on 27 May 2007, the prisoners were acquitted <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges</b> and the plaintiffs ordered to pay the legal fees.|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the electrostatic disruption products of fragile interplanetary dust aggregates which are initially electrically charged on entering the Jovian plasmasphere is considered. The detailed orbits <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charged</b> particles, which are shown to be confined to the equatorial plane, are computed. It is found that the fragments with radii typically about 1 micron are magnetogravitationally trapped within the plasmasphere due to the velocity-induced oscillation of their surface potentials. It is suggested that the distribution of micrometeroid dust within the Jovian magnetosphere, observed by Pioneer 10 and the recent Voyager, {{is a result of}} the magnetogravitational trapping and subsequent orbital evolution <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charged</b> dust particles...|$|R
25|$|Illegally dumped {{hazardous}} waste {{may be a}} result of the costs of dropping materials at designated sites: some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charge</b> a fee for depositing hazardous material.

25|$|When Titus {{was cleared}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges</b> {{at a meeting}} of the full Seattle City Central Committee, a heated {{gathering}} which lasted 7 hours, Central Branch launched a statewide referendum vote against Titus. This vote closed on June 1, 1905, and exonerated Titus by a vote of 4-to-1. Of the 41 votes cast against Titus in the state, fully 35 came from Seattle Central Branch.|$|E
25|$|When Connors {{was working}} for The Bear (CFBR-FM) in Edmonton in 1992, {{he was charged with}} sexual assault in a case that purportedly {{occurred}} at a hotel in October 1992. He was acquitted <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges</b> in January 1993, although Connors reconsidered his broadcasting career due to the stress of this case. The broadcaster sustained a reported nervous breakdown in October 1995, which he blamed on job stress and uncertainty.|$|E

50|$|Metallic and {{semiconducting}} carbon nanotubes generally coexist in as-grown materials. To {{get only}} semiconducting or only metallic nanotubes selective functionalization of metallic SWNTs via 4-hydroxybenzene diazonium can be used. Separation {{can be done}} in solution by deprotonation of the p-hydroxybenzene group on the reacted nanotubes (metallic) in alkaline solution followed by electrophoretic separation <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charged</b> species from the neutral species (semiconducting nanotubes). This followed by annealing would give separated pristine semiconducting and metallic SWNT.|$|R

25|$|On 15 May 1999, Yeltsin survived {{another attempt}} of impeachment, {{this time by}} the Democratic and {{communist}} opposition in the State Duma. He was charged with several unconstitutional activities, including {{the signing of the}} Belavezha Accords dissolving the Soviet Union in December 1991, the coup-d'état in October 1993, and initiating the war in Chechnya in 1994. None <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges</b> received the two-thirds majority of the Duma which was required to initiate the process of impeachment of the president.|$|E

25|$|The Erdoğan {{government}} {{has said that}} the corruption investigation and comments by Gülen are the long term political agenda of Gülen's movement to infiltrate security, intelligence, and justice institutions of the Turkish state, a charge almost identical to the charges against Gülen by the Chief Prosecutor of Turkey in his trial in 2000 before Erdoğan's party had come into power. Gülen had previously been tried in absentia in 2000, and acquitted <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges</b> in 2008 under Erdoğan's AKP government.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} charge {{carriers}} are the positively charged proton and the negatively charged electron.

25|$|According to The Economist findings, Berlusconi, while Prime Minister of Italy, {{retained}} in effective control of 90% of all national television broadcasting. This figure included stations he owns directly {{as well as}} those over which he had indirect control by dint of his position as Prime Minister and his ability to influence the choice of the management bodies of these stations. The Economist has also claimed that the Italian Prime Minister is corrupt and self-serving. A key journalist for The Economist, David Lane, has set out many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges</b> in his book Berlusconi's Shadow.|$|E
25|$|If convicted <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges,</b> Lindh {{could have}} {{received}} {{up to three}} life sentences and 90 additional years in prison.

The court scheduled an evidence suppression hearing, at which Lindh {{would have been able to}} testify about the details of the torture to which he claimed he was subjected. The government faced the problem that a key piece of evidence – Lindh's confession – might be excluded from evidence as having been forced under duress (i.e. torture).|$|E
25|$|On July 7, {{charges of}} {{involuntary}} manslaughter were filed against five officials and employees of Ringling Bros. Within days <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges</b> being filed, the circus {{reached an agreement}} with Hartford officials to accept full financial responsibility and pay whatever amount the city requested in damages.

25|$|In 1988, Palast {{directed}} a U.S. civil racketeering {{investigation into the}} Shoreham Nuclear Power Station project, under construction by Stone & Webster and Long Island Lighting Company. A jury awarded the plaintiffs US$4.8 billion; however, New York's chief federal judge(which district?)reversed the verdict. The racketeering charges stemmed from an accusation that LILCO filed false documents {{in order to secure}} rate increases. LILCO sought a dismissal <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges</b> on the grounds that Suffolk County lacked authority under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and that the allegations of a history of racketeering did not qualify as a continuing criminal enterprise.|$|E
25|$|The upward motions {{within the}} storm and winds at higher levels in the {{atmosphere}} tend to cause the small ice crystals (and positive charge) in {{the upper part of}} the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from thunderstorm cloud base. This part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil. While this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud, some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges</b> can be redistributed by air movements within the storm (updrafts and downdrafts). In addition, there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures.|$|E

This time the charges stuck and Wicks {{was expelled}}. Adding insult to injury, the old accusation which he had dodged in 1923 was revisited and it was declared that Wicks had been a spy ever since joining the party in 1919. Historian Theodore Draper later claimed, {{on the basis of a}} review of Wicks' private papers, that there was actually no convincing evidence of the veracity <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>charges</b> — which may well have been influenced by the spy-mania of the Great Purges then sweeping the Soviet Union.|$|E
