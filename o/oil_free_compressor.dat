40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Industrial Research Ltd (IRL) has {{developed}} a novel metallic-diaphragm pressure wave generator technology for large high-frequency (30 - 60 Hz) pulse tube cryocoolers. A diaphragm pressure wave generator, using a conventionally lubricated motor-crank drive, provides a clean pressure wave for a cryocooler. High frequency pulse tubes are at their most efficient when closely coupled to pressure wave generators. There are, however, many applications which require the physical separation of the compressor from the cold head such as a Gifford McMahon (GM) system. Furthermore, GM cryocoolers perform well at low temperatures {{due in part to}} their low frequency (~ 1 Hz) operation. GM cryocoolers typically employ compressors related to air conditioning compressors which need filters to remove the compressor oil from the helium flow, thus increasing maintenance. This paper describes the development of an <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> <b>compressor</b> for GM cryocoolers fabricated by fitting a reed valve assembly to the outlet of a 200 ml swept-volume diaphragm pressure wave generator. The system was designed to charge a high pressure tank to 16 bar drawing gas from a low pressure tank held at 5 bar. Helium mass flow rate was predicted to be 3. 5 g/s. Results of testing the compressor are presented...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{compressed}} air free of entrained oil {{to be used in}} industry. In many cases it can be supplied by oil flooded screw compressors with multi stage filtration systems, or by oil free screw compressors. However, if water injected screw compressors can be made to operate reliably, they could be more efficient and therefore cheaper to operate. Unfortunately, to date, such machines have proved to be insufficiently reliable and not cost effective. This paper describes an investigation carried out to determine the current limitations of water injected screw compressor systems and how these could be overcome in the 15 - 315 kW power range and delivery pressures of 6 - 10 bar. Modern rotor profiles and approach to sealing and cooling allow reasonably inexpensive air end design. The prototype of the water injected screw compressor air system was built and tested for performance and reliability. The water injected compressor system was compared with the oil injected and <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> <b>compressor</b> systems of the equivalent size including the economic analysis based on the lifecycle costs. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that water injected screw compressor systems could be designed to deliver clean air free of oil contamination with a better user value proposition than the oil injected or oil free screw compressor systems over the considered range of operations...|$|E

The importance of direct hydrogen delivery—either as a highpressure, medium-pressure gas, or liquid—recognizes the technical and economic hurdles facing on-board liquid fuel reforming. This program leverages efforts to develop natural gas reformers for stationary PEM fuel cell power generation as well as various technologies and products for compressed natural gas vehicles.

40|$|The devlopment of {{domestic}} heat pump systems is mainly {{based on the}} use of volumetric oil lubricated compressors. Following the implementation of economizer based rotary compressors, which represented a major improvement step, one major opportunity to improve both efficiency and heat rate, in particular for high temperature lift heat pumps, is to use two stage cycles. However the reliability of those can be strongly impaired by oil migration, resulting in oil level unbalance when using oil lubricated compressors, unless more sophisticated auxiliaries including an oil pump are added. The need for this additional equipment, the requirement of higher vapour velocity for oil return and impediments to the efficiency of enhanced surfaces for heat exchangers are some of the incentives for the development of <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> <b>compressor</b> systems. As high speed bearings and electrical motors are gradually becoming available this open the way to consider the use of low power, compact, oil-free and high speed radial compressors. This paper describes the basic design of a high speed single stage radial compressor for high pressure ratios and a wide flow range aimed for the first stage of a two stage heat pump. A commercially available 3 D viscous code has been applied to calculate the flow field through the impeller and the diffuser. The particular choice of the bearings allows using very small tip clearences resulting in low leakage losses. To complete the design a commercial 3 D Finite Element code has been used for stress prediction {{as well as for the}} calculation of the blade critical frequencies and their corresponding modes. During the design process the impeller blade geometry has been continuously checked for machinability in order to ensure a feasible impeller using conventional 5 axis milling machines.

A novel low-cost moving magnet <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> linear <b>compressor</b> is described here, and follows a companion paper on the linear motor system. The experimental apparatus to evaluate the thermodynamic performance of the linear compressor is comparatively straightforward, but the data analysis is involved, since key measurements have to be corrected for the phase response of the transducers. Harmonic fitting, using fast Fourier transform with zeropadding and minimisation algorithms, {{have been used for}} the voltage, current and displacement signals. This enables corrections to be made for the phase lag in the voltage, current and displacement measurements. The experiments using nitrogen, with a constant pressure ratio, show that the linear motor system under resonance achieves a high overall efficiency. For the design point, the motor efficiency is 74 %, while for a pressure ratio of 3. 0, the average overall adiabatic efficiency is 54 % and the isothermal efficiency is 46 %, all of which are within a reasonable range for a small compressor...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} type of twin screw {{machines}} are twin screw compressors. These normally contain rotors of uniform pitch and profile along the rotor length. However, in some cases such as in twin screw vacuum pumps with very large pressure ratios, the variable pitch rotors are often used to improve efficiency. The limited use of rotors with variable pitch and/or section profile is mainly due to manufacturing constraints. In order to analyse the performance of such machines by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), it is necessary to produce a numerical mesh capable of calculating 3 D transient fluid flows within their working domains. An algebraic grid generation algorithm applicable to unstructured grid, Finite Volume Method (FVM) for variable pitch and variable profile screw machines is described in this paper. The grid generation technique has been evaluated for an <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> air <b>compressor</b> with “N” profile rotors of 3 / 5 lobe configuration. The performance was obtained by calculations with commercial CFD code. The grid generation procedure provides mesh of the required quality and results from CFD calculations are presented to compare performance of constant pitch rotors, variable pitch rotors and variable profile rotors. The variable pitch and variable profile rotors achieve steeper internal pressure rise and a larger discharge area for the same pressure ratio. Variable pitch rotors achieve reduced sealing line length in high pressure domains...|$|R
40|$|Screw {{compressors}} {{are commonly}} used for industrial and commercial gas processing and refrigeration. These machines {{are known to be}} able to admit mixtures of gasses and liquids to a certain concentration. In oil injected compressors, oil is mostly injected in the working domain to seal, cool and lubricate. But would the injection of atomized oil or other liquid in the suction of the compressor be useful for better control of the discharge temperature and reduction in energy consumption, is still to be determined. Similarly, liquid neutral to the process may be injected in an <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> <b>compressor</b> suction to help controlling discharge temperature. It can be erosive and corrosive to the compressor rotors. Therefore mapping a two phase suction flow of a screw compressor may help in understanding the means to improve compressors efficiency and reliability. This paper is the initial phase of PhD program to determine the multiphase flow characteristic at suction of twin screw compressors by means of experimental techniques. Review of most common and up to date measurement techniques in field of multiphase flow was carried out to determine their suitability and feasibility. Also Modelling of single and multiphase flow at the suction domain of a twin screw compressor were performed {{in order to have a}} better understanding of flow distribution. The research is performed on an oil free screw compressor with “N” rotor profiles of 128 mm and configuration of 3 / 5 lobes with L/D of 1. 6 and 93 mm centre distance. A simplified CFD model of only suction domain which reduces computational time was compared with the CFD model of the entire compressor and it was found that it predicts most of flow features with same accuracy.

40|$|TutorialAlthough wet (oil injected) and dry (<b>oil</b> <b>free)</b> screw <b>compressors</b> {{are widely}} used in many applications, limited {{information}} is available regarding the pulsation, vibration, and noise problems associated with these types of compressors. This tutorial discusses such problems and includes case histories where field testing was performed, and provides design recommendations. Both wet and dry screw compressors normally generate pulsation at the pocket passing frequency (PPF) and its multiples. The pulsation amplitudes are affected by many variables such as mole weight of the gas, operating pressures, speed, screw profile, {{and shape of the}} discharge port. The pulsation amplitudes are further amplified by acoustical natural frequencies of the compressor/silencer/piping system. Dry screw compressors are generally supplied with suction and discharge silencers which are designed to attenuate the pulsation generated by the compressors. Most of the silencers are reactive type (Helmholtz filters), absorptive type, or a combination of these two. Although the silencers are designed to attenuate pulsation at certain frequencies, they can also amplify pulsation when the excitation frequencies are coincident with the acoustical natural frequencies of the silencer itself. Pulsation in the silencers can also increase the vibration levels of the compressor rotors and can cause electrical problems to be fed into the local bus. Therefore, the silencers should be carefully designed to attenuate the pulsation levels over a wide frequency band. Wet screw compressors typically do not have silencers, since oil separators are used. The oil separators are primarily designed to remove the oil from the gas, but the separators can also attenuate and/or amplify the pulsation generated by the compressor. The shell wall mechanical natural frequencies can also be excited by pulsation at multiples of the PPF, which can result in excessive noise levels and fatigue failures of the shell wall, attached small bore piping, instrumentation, and the oil injection lines...|$|R
40|$|Variable speed <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> screw <b>compressors</b> {{can be used}} in {{upstream}} oil and gas applications such as gas collection and flare gas recovery. The critical nature of these applications is such that the owners closely monitor the drive train of the package as long un-planned stoppages are extremely expensive. If any of the monitored parameters start to deviate from the norm then shut-downs and services can be scheduled in a timely manner preventing costly stoppages. This paper first describes the parameters monitored on the drive train as required by the international standards used by the oil and gas companies. The paper then leads onto an in-depth description of the instrumentation mounted on and even within the drive train, incorporating the main drive motor, gearbox and compressor, and how the instrumentation is monitored by a package machine condition monitoring system that interfaces with the package control system. As the final location of the instruments is often in extremely hazardous environments such as highly corrosive offshore marine environments or abrasive hot desert environments, and the compressors themselves are often compressing highly combustible gas such as methane or even hydrogen, the protection methods employed by the instruments to prevent explosion is then discussed. The multiple communications networks that allow the condition monitoring system to send its values to the package control system and the client’s distributed control system are also discussed. This discussion includes how the measured values make their way from the stand alone machine condition monitoring system to the compressor control system and how the two systems integrate with each other to protect the package before annunciating the system status to the client 2 ̆ 7 s distributed control system. Finally a full description is given on how these measured values impact on the running of the package with respect to the compressors service life and the control systems ability to maintain the process setpoints.

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers {{insight into}} screw {{compressor}} designs beyond {{the capabilities of}} other conventional methods. It allows evaluation of local flow patterns which influence performance but are difficult or impossible to investigate experimentally. Implementation of CFD in these machines is challenging due to the physics of the flow, {{the properties of the}} working fluids and the complexity of flow passages which change size and position. This is additionally challenged by a lack of methodologies available to generate the meshes required for the full three dimensional transient simulations. Commercially available CFD solvers need to fully interact with customized grid generators to enable resolution of grid deformation during a flow solution. However, the factors that influence flow predictions are not only related to grids but also to the approach which CFD solvers use to calculate distribution of parameters such as pressure, velocities, temperatures, etc. In this paper, two approaches most commonly used in commercial CFD software are compared and analysed. The first is a segregated cell-centre based solver and the second is a coupled vertex-centre based solver. Both are pressure based finite volume solvers. Customized grid generation software is used for meshing of moving rotors and flow domains around the rotors in an <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> air screw <b>compressor</b> with ‘N’ rotor profile of 3 / 5 lobe combination. The deforming rotor grid is maintained as identical in both solvers. The performance predictions obtained by calculations with these two CFD models are compared with measurements obtained on the test compressor in the City University London test rig. The comparison includes pressure in the compressor chamber, mass flow rate, indicated power and the volumetric efficiency. The study reveals differences between the results obtained by two different solvers and the experimental results. Analysis presented in this paper provides a good basis for further consideration of differencing schemes and other characteristics and settings for different CFD solvers in order to achieve accurate predictions of flows in positive displacement machines...|$|R
