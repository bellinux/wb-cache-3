5|$|On March 18, 2003, Owumi {{signed a}} letter <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> play college {{football}} for Georgetown. He joined the team on a scholarship under head coach Bob Benson, uncertain of his future in basketball. Although Owumi had initially desired to play the quarterback position, his coaches wanted him to play wide receiver due to his athletic abilities. He later moved to being a safety and eventually became the Hoyas' third-string quarterback, {{but he would not}} officially play the position. Following the football season, Owumi often practiced with the school's basketball team but never joined. He decided to transfer out of Georgetown to focus on academics and basketball, retaining his four years of college basketball eligibility.|$|E

5|$|Adenhart had a 6–0 {{record with}} a 1.04 earned run average {{during the regular season}} in his junior year, and as a result was named the Gatorade Player of the Year in Maryland. In a 1–0 loss during the playoff quarterfinal matchup, he threw a no-hitter and had 14 strikeouts. Entering his final high school season, Baseball America dubbed Adenhart the top high school {{prospect}} in the country.

Entering the final regular season game of his high school career, he had a 5–1 record, a 0.73 ERA and an average of 2.2 strikeouts per inning. During November of his senior year, Adenhart signed a letter <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> play with the North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team at the University of North Carolina, although his chances of being drafted high continued to climb and the North Carolina coaching staff saw their chances of acquiring Adenhart to be slim.|$|E
5|$|By the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} or not the Timberwolves would remain in Minneapolis following the 1994–95 season became an issue. On February 11, 1994, NBA commissioner David Stern announced that he and his representatives would serve as mediators in an effort to resolve issues related to the debt owed on the Target Center, the Timberwolves home arena. The Timberwolves ownership was seeking a public or private entity to purchase the $73 million remaining on the arena's mortgage, otherwise the team would be sold and in all likelihood moved from Minnesota. Although mediation talks were just beginning to keep the team in place, by the following week it was revealed that ownership had met with representatives from San Diego, Nashville and New Orleans to discuss the potential relocation of the franchise. By late February, New Orleans emerged as the likely city for the team to relocate to if a deal could not be reached to keep the team in Minneapolis. This became the case after the potential ownership group Top Rank signed a letter <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> purchase the team and move it to New Orleans if debt issues at the Target Center were not resolved.|$|E

Owumi struggled to guard Kevin Durant during the game. He first scored double digits on November 27, with a team-high 12 points against Baylor. He led Alcorn State to its first Division I victory on January 13, 2007, when he posted 15 points and six rebounds vs. Mississippi Valley State. Two games later, the junior scored 17 points to defeat Alabama State. On March 1, Owumi notched a career-high 30 points along with a season-best ten rebounds in a defeat to Prairie View A.

5|$|SR 11 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1994. Four years later, several parties, {{including}} District 11 of Caltrans, the City and County of San Diego, the San Diego Association of Governments, and Tijuana were signatories to a Letter <b>of</b> <b>Intent</b> <b>to</b> build the border crossing. The route {{was added to}} the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1999. In 2009, Senate Bill 1486 was passed, and the presidential permit in 2008 allowed for the border crossing to be constructed. By one year later, several alternatives were considered, in terms of constructing some or even none of the interchanges, or removing the proposed toll on the route. State funding is allocated to cover much of the $400 million cost, which does not include the port of entry at another $350 million. The California Transportation Commission endorsed the project in January 2012, and approved the proposed freeway route that December.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Ezeh {{entered his}} senior season as {{the focal point of}} his school's running game and was rated as the seventh-best {{football}} prospect in the state of Michigan, according to The Detroit News. He was also invited to try out for the United States national rugby union team as an outside center. During the season, Ezeh was regularly among the leading rushers in the area. In the Division 4 state semifinal game, Ezeh returned a kickoff 80yards for a touchdown and rushed for 136yards on 24 carries. During the game, after Catholic Central scored on a quarterback sneak with 2:28 remaining, Ezeh scored on a two-point conversion to give his team a 3534 victory. This led them to the 2005 MHSAA state championship game at Ford Field, which they lost 1710 to Powers Catholic High School. By the end of the season, Ezeh had compiled a school record 2,914 career rushing yards, which included 33 touchdowns. During his senior year, he also occasionally played linebacker, recording 34 tackles (16 for a loss). Although, he missed part of the season with an ankle injury, he totaled 1,391yards and 10 touchdowns on 217 carries and added seven pass receptions, including one touchdown, and he was recognized as a 2nd-team All-area running back. The Detroit News recognized him as their postseason number six blue chip prospect in the state, and he was selected to play in the Michigan High School Football Coaches Association's annual all-star game. In February 2006, he signed his letter <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> play for Michigan, where it was unclear whether he would play fullback, tight end or linebacker.|$|E

5|$|Jordan {{grew up in}} Prior Lake, Minnesota, to John and Deb Schroeder, {{and moved}} to nearby Lakeville, a suburb of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, when he was thirteen. John played several sports, {{including}} basketball, football and baseball while Deb was a gymnast and a cross-country runner. Schroeder is the oldest of three siblings; brother Zach is two years younger and sister Elly is six years younger; both of them also play hockey. He first played hockey {{at the age of}} four; his first organized team was called the Lakeville Ponys which was intended as a learn to skate program but at the recommendation of his coach Scott Cummings, he was moved up to the Mite program because his skill level was far ahead of the other kids his age. Schroeder spent two years at St. Thomas Academy in suburban Mendota Heights, Minnesota, before graduating with high honors from Ann Arbor Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He accelerated his high school education in order to play NCAA hockey a year early and took courses online from Brigham Young University to do so. Schroeder signed a letter <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> <b>to</b> join the University of Minnesota in November 2007. He enrolled at the school in the fall of 2008, majoring in business and marketing education. In 2010, his final year at the school, Schroeder was named to the WCHA All-Academic team, the result of a 3.0 grade average over the previous two semesters.|$|E
