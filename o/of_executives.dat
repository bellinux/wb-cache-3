Several years later, when Jeffrey Skilling was hired, he {{developed}} a staff <b>of</b> <b>executives</b> that – {{by the use of}} accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting – were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Arthur Andersen to ignore the issues.|$|E

However, no action was taken against the Church. The investigation ground to a halt after a ruling by a U.S. District Court judge in a case concerning Marc and Claire Headley's complaints against the Church over their treatment at Gold Base.|$|E
5|$|Following {{through on}} the CEO's opinion that the company needed a {{consistent}} marketing plan and management team to succeed, the company began its moves by replacing its chairman and CEO Jerry W. Levin with its own choice <b>of</b> <b>executives,</b> Barry J. Gibbons, {{chairman and managing director}} of Grand Metropolitan Retailing, Ltd., as chief executive and Ian A. Martin, Grand Met's top executive in the United States, as chairman. The moves came to no surprise to Wall Street analysts and franchisees, as they were expected due to reservations about Levin after his appointment by the outgoing management at Pillsbury. Grand Met's first major restructuring move was the dismantling of Burger Kings 50-year-old purchasing and distribution arm, Distron. Unhappy with the distribution group, the company originally thought to dispose of the division after the purchase but instead decided to reorganize it into two separate groups, one for procurement (Burger King Purchasing or BKP) and another for distribution (Burger King Distribution Services or BKDS). With the restructuring, the company eliminated many positions and ended up laying off over a hundred staff members as a consequence.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the council can only {{be compared with the}} quite unique and unusual {{composition of}} the German upper house, the Bundesrat. Membership of the Bundesrat is limited to members of the governments of the states of Germany and can be recalled by those governments {{in the same manner as}} the EU's Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat and if their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are solely responsible for their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Hence they also are not elected at the same time and the body as a whole cannot be dissolved like most parliaments. As government representatives, members do not vote as individual members but in state blocks, rather than political alignment, to their state governments' agreed line. Each state has unequal voting powers based on population, with an absolute majority required for decisions. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council. However, unlike the EU's Council, the Bundesrat does not vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed. They both bear similar criticisms, because of the interference, <b>of</b> <b>executives</b> in the legislative process.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that poor {{performance}} on tests <b>of</b> <b>executive</b> functions relate to lower ratings of health related quality of life (HQoL) in persons with chronic diseases. Older adults {{are known to have}} lower scores on tests <b>of</b> <b>executive</b> function, however it is not known if these decrements are related to ratings of HQoL. The present study examined how three measures <b>of</b> <b>executive</b> functions - the Stroop Color- Word Test, Trail Making B, Category Test - related to HQoL (as measured by the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36; MOS SF- 36) in 160 older adults (54 % M; 83 % White) who were free of major medical, neurological, or psychiatric diseases. Multiple regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, race, education, BMI, hypertension diagnosis, and BMI were conducted. Each of the three measures <b>of</b> <b>executive</b> function was entered in separate models, independently predicting the PCS and the MCS. None of the measures <b>of</b> <b>executive</b> functions significantly related to HQoL. In conclusion, results of this study do not support the hypothesis that lower scores on tests <b>of</b> <b>executive</b> function are related to lower levels of HQoL in either the physical or mental domains in relatively healthy older adults...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review and {{proposed}} model {{is to provide a}} clearer picture of the current state <b>of</b> <b>executive</b> coaching and to provide a basic non-theoretical model that could be utilized for preparing graduate students in clinical and counseling doctoral training programs for the professional role <b>of</b> an <b>executive</b> coach. The proposed model is an adaptation of the established Organizational Consulting track at Pacific University 2 ̆ 7 s School of Professional Psychology. The formal training of psychology graduate students in the role <b>of</b> the <b>executive</b> coach is an attempt to provide standardized preparation for one subset <b>of</b> the <b>executive</b> coach population. This standardization is deemed important due to {{the current state of the}} field <b>of</b> <b>executive</b> coaching. Several inherent weaknesses in the field <b>of</b> <b>executive</b> coaching were elucidated during the literature review, including: the lack of a standardized, universally accepted definition <b>of</b> <b>executive</b> coaching; the lack of a credentialing or governing body; the lack of empirical research supporting the professional role; and the lack of formal, standardized training.
