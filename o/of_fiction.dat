40|$|I {{critically}} examine {{some recent}} {{work on the}} philosophy <b>of</b> scientific <b>fictions,</b> focusing {{on the work of}} Winsberg. By considering two case studies in fracture mechanics, the strip yield model and the imaginary crack method, I argue that his reliance upon the social norms associated with an element of a model forces him to remain silent whenever those norms fail to clearly match the characteristic <b>of</b> <b>fictions</b> or non-fictions. In its place, I propose a normative epistemology <b>of</b> <b>fictions</b> which clarifies a model's ontological commitments when the community of scientists lack any clear, shared norms of use. Specifically, I will introduce a variational account <b>of</b> <b>fictions</b> as an extension of Laymon's monotonic improvability account of idealizations. I will conclude by connecting this variational account <b>of</b> <b>fictions</b> to didactic fictions in general...|$|R
