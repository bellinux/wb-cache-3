50|$|Peggy was bred to 'Jim', another Nubian-French Alpine cross, {{yielding}} a short-eared buckling, a short-eared doeling, 'Pauline', and a doeling {{that looked like}} Jim, 'Paulette'. They destroyed the buckling and kept the does. At two months old, Pauline, the short eared doe, was badly injured {{by some of the}} other goats and destroyed. Paulette, the Nubian-French Alpine-looking doe, was bred to 'Christopher', a bright red Nubian-Murciana cross buck. That pairing yielded 'Redette', a doeling that looked like her father and later, with a buck named 'Scamp' gave birth to 'Gilda', a beautiful short-eared LaMancha that died young from <b>over-production</b> <b>of</b> kids and <b>milk.</b> Paulette's second freshening, with her father Jim, yielded three bucklings, of which the Freys kept one, naming him 'Rascal'. Rascal was paired with a purebred Toggenburg doe, producing Scamp, Peggy's grandson, who was bred to his older half-sister Redette and fathered Gilda. Peggy's third freshening, with her daughter Paulette's previous partner, Christopher, yielded three red short-eared Lamancha bucks, of which none were kept; a mistake, Mrs. Frey wrote later, that she regretted.|$|R

40|$|A {{rare case}} of {{preclinical}} Cushing 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome with slight <b>over-production</b> <b>of</b> aldosterone is described. A 54 -year-old female {{patient with a}} right adrenal mass, 3 cm in diameter on computed tomography, {{had a history of}} hypertension for 6 years. The blood pressure was 145 / 81 mmHg and her plasma potassium level was 3. 3 mEq/l. The basal plasma cortisol, ACTH, renin activity and aldosterone levels were within the reference range and the plasma cortisol level was insufficiently suppressed by 8 mg dexamethasone administration. Adrenal venous sampling was performed, which indicated the <b>over-production</b> <b>of</b> both cortisol and aldosterone in the right adrenal tumor. We diagnosed preclinical Cushing 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome with slight <b>over-production</b> <b>of</b> aldosterone due to the right adrenal tumor and performed right adrenalectomy.

Post-operatively, her blood pressure and plasma potassium level normalized, and her plasma cortisol was sufficiently suppressed by night-time 1 mg dexamethasone administration. The response to captopril load test normalized. In this case, we assume the possibility that the double production of cortisol and aldosterone may reflect disorganized expression of steroidogenic enzymes usually associated with malignant transformation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a {{generalized}} autoimmune disease {{which results in}} multiorgan damage. The pathogenesis of SLE is mainly due to the <b>over-production</b> <b>of</b> autoantibodies and immune complexes, as well as abnormal regulation of their production and clearance. One of the many factors {{that lead to the}} <b>over-production</b> <b>of</b> autoantibodies is the hyperactivity of T- and B-cells. Owing to the costimulatory function of the CD 28 molecule during T-cell activation, the CD 28 gene is the target of our study. The results show that the T allele of the CD 28 gene and its corresponding homozygous genotype scored the highest frequency amongst the Malaysian population. However, the CD 28 gene is not significantly associated with the susceptibility of SLE when comparing between diseased and normal healthy subjects...|$|R

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a {{foodborne}} pathogen {{capable of}} surviving under challenging conditions both outside {{and inside the}} host. During the transition from exponential to stationary phase it experiences a series of environmental changes that require an appropriate response to maintain cell viability. In this study the autolytic behaviour of a L. monocytogenes strain was investigated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The study was done at the permissive autolysis temperature, 30 ˚C and at 20 ˚C, an autolysis non-permissive temperature. An autolytic strain proteome was also compared to a non-autolytic strain at the permissive autolysis temperature. The autolytic strain proteome at 30 ˚C in comparison to 20 ˚C evidenced increased synthesis of the P 60 autolysin, glycolytic enzymes and proteins related with environmental stress responses. The <b>over-production</b> <b>of</b> P 45 autolysin, was observed when the autolytic strain proteome was compared with the non-autolytic strain. The proteomes at the non-permissive temperature and the proteome of the non-autolytic strain were characterized by a diminished synthesis of several stress related proteins. The lack of autolysis seems to be associated to the <b>over-production</b> <b>of</b> proteins linked to fatty acid and amino acid synthesis, transcription regulation and cell morphogenesis {{as evidenced by the}} proteome at the non-permissive temperature and the non-auto-lytic strain.

40|$|The airway {{epithelium}} {{is known}} to play an integral role in the airway defense via the mucociliary system and mechanical barriers. The airway epithelial cells can be activated to produce and release biological mediators important in the pathogenesis of multiple airway disorders.

One of the hallmarks of these airway disorders is the <b>over-production</b> <b>of</b> mucus by airway epithelial cells, and disruption of physiologic mucociliary clearance by the <b>over-production</b> <b>of</b> mucus can lead to mucus plugging, air trapping, and atelectasis which is often complicated by infection. The major macromolecular components of mucus are the large glycoproteins known as mucins. Currently, 20 MUC genes have been identified and their encoded glycoproteins classified as gel-forming, secreted, or cell-associated mucins. The representative mucins are MUC 1 and MUC 5 AC as cell-associated and gel-forming mucin, respectively. In this study, I focused on these 2 mucin genes and clarified the regulation mechanisms.

40|$|Physiologically {{irrelevant}} metabolic pathways patched {{together from}} {{the reactions of}} multiple promiscuous enzymes {{can serve as a}} starting points for the evolution of novel pathways that degrade or generate new or pre‐existing metabolites. It has been shown that at least three such ‘serendipitous’ pathways in E. coli can be evolved to over‐come a block in the synthesis of pyridoxal‐ 5 ’‐phosphate (PLP). These pathways restore PLP synthesis by converting metabolites from core metabolism to intermediates in PLP synthesis that are downstream of the block, and can be elevated to a physiologically relevant level by the <b>over‐production</b> <b>of</b> certain enzymes <b>of</b> the pathway. <b>Over‐production</b> <b>of</b> HisB, Php, or YjbQ complements a strain of E. coli with a deletion in pdxB, which encodes an enzyme that is essential in PLP biosynthesis, by elevating flux through one or more serendipitous pathways that restore PLP synthesis by producing a novel source of 2 ‐oxo‐ 3 ‐ hydroxy‐ 4 ‐phosphobutanoate—an intermediate in PLP biosynthesis downstream of the step catalyzed by pdxB. The aim of this honors thesis was to further characterize the serendipitous pathway(s) involved in this process. First, this thesis indicated that HisB, Php, and YjbQ operate in the same serendipitous pathway. Although HisB, Php, and YjbQ are not epistatic, since <b>over‐production</b> <b>of</b> each enzyme still complements a deletion of pdxB when genes encoding the other two enzymes are deleted, complementation by each enzyme is inhibited by a single metabolite, indicating that HisB, Php, and YjbQ participate in a single serendipitous pathway that is down‐regulated by this metabolite. Second, I determined which catalytic domain of the bi‐functional HisB enzyme catalyzes the promiscuous activity in the serendipitous pathway that restores PLP synthesis upon HisB overproduction. When the two catalytic domains of HisB were individually over‐produced, only the imidazoleglycerol‐phosphate dehydratase domain complemented a deletion in pdxB. Moreover, mutating active site residues from this domain either partially or completely interfered with complementation by <b>over‐production</b> <b>of</b> the full length HisB protein. Lastly, I described a project that I am currently completing, which uses genome‐wide transposon mutagenesis to search for enzymes that participate in the same serendipitous pathway as HisB in rescuing PLP synthesis. I screened an insertion library for cells that could no longer synthesize PLP using this serendipitous pathway and am in the process of locating transposons in the genomic DNA of select insertion mutants...|$|R
