5|$|Late in his life, {{from the}} {{electric}} period on, Davis repeatedly disregarded his earlier work, {{such as the}} music of Birth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cool</b> or Kind of Blue. In Davis' view, remaining static stylistically was the wrong option.|$|E

5|$|Elements of Tristano's early playing – counterpoint, reharmonizing, {{and strict}} time – {{influenced}} Miles Davis' Birth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cool,</b> and the playing of saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and pianist Dave Brubeck. Tristano's early, more feelings-based performances also influenced {{the style of}} pianist Bill Evans, who also used overdubbing and multitracking in his own recordings after Tristano had experimented with the techniques. Avant garde musician Anthony Braxton has often mentioned Tristano {{and some of his}} students as influences.|$|E

5|$|Most {{albatrosses}} {{range in}} the Southern Hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia, South Africa and South America. The exceptions to this are the four North Pacific albatrosses, of which three occur exclusively in the North Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, California and Alaska; and one, the waved albatross, breeds in the Galápagos Islands and feeds {{off the coast of}} South America. The need for wind to enable gliding is the reason albatrosses are for the most part confined to higher latitudes: being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing the doldrums extremely difficult. The exception, the waved albatross, is able to live in the equatorial waters around the Galápagos Islands because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> waters of the Humboldt Current and the resulting winds.|$|E
5|$|Some affiliative {{behaviors}} are seasonal or gender-specific, {{such as the}} male squeal approach and anogenital inspections performed during the mating season. Another example is the female greeting behavior, where two females will use their anogenital scent glands to mark each other's backs, jump over one another, writhe together, and emit squealing vocalizations. This behavior is not seen during the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool,</b> dry season or around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors can be affected by age. All ruffed lemurs over five months of age allogroom, and, in captivity, subadults participate in play more frequently than adults.|$|E

In May 2003, Midway Games announced {{the production of a}} platformer video game based on the show for the Game Boy Advance.

25|$|In June 1988, Mulligan {{was invited}} {{to be the first}} Composer-in-Residence at the Glasgow International Jazz Festival and was {{commissioned}} to write a work, which he titled The Flying Scotsman. In 1991, Mulligan contacted Miles Davis about revisiting the music from the germane 1949 Birth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cool</b> album. Davis had recently performed some of his Gil Evans collaborations with Quincy Jones at the Montreux Jazz Festival and was enthusiastic. However, Davis died in September and Mulligan continued the recording project and tour with Wallace Roney and Art Farmer subbing for Davis. Re-Birth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cool</b> (released in 1992) featured the charts from Birth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cool,</b> and a new nonet which included Lewis and Barber from the original Davis band. Mulligan appeared at the Brecon Jazz Festival 1991. Mulligan's final recording was a quartet album (with guests), Dragonfly, recorded in the summer of 1995 and released on the Telarc label. Mulligan gave his final performance on the 13th Annual Floating Jazz Festival, SS Norway, Caribbean Cruise, November 9, 1995.|$|E
