25|$|Immediately {{after this}} agonizing pedicure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound.

This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated {{as often as possible}} (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week),</b> with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.|$|E

Jenner liked Wheaties and ate the breakfast cereal two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> which supported the advertising campaign's claims.

500|$|Interferon beta-1a is {{injected}} either weekly (intramuscular injection) <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> (subcutaneous injection) depending on commercial formulations, while interferon beta-1b {{is injected}} subcutaneously every second day. In 2014, a pegylated form of interferon beta-1a was introduced with {{the brand name}} Plegridy, which is available as a subcutaneous injection. This peginterferon beta 1-a attaches polyethylene glycol to the interferon molecules allowing longer lasting biological effects in the body while decreasing the frequency of administration to once every two weeks. [...] Interferon beta balances the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory agents in the brain, and reduces the number of inflammatory cells that cross the blood–brain barrier. Overall, therapy with interferon beta leads to a reduction of neuron inflammation. Moreover, it is also thought to increase the production of nerve growth factor and consequently improve neuronal survival.|$|E

After Parkes's family moved to Scotland, the three cousins often spent their school holidays together there. Parkes recalled, [...] "John, cousin Leila and I were very close. From Edinburgh we would drive up to the family croft at Durness, which was from about the time John {{was nine years old}} until he was about 16."

500|$|Following the {{construction}} of the new camp site west of Lang Vei, Willoughby and his CIDG soldiers concentrated their efforts on strengthening the camp’s defenses, and they made relatively few contacts with the North Vietnamese. However, unbeknown to Willoughby, the North Vietnamese 304th Division had assembled on the battlefield, reinforced by the 198th Tank Battalion, with the following orders: the 66th Regiment was given the task of capturing Khe Sanh village, part of Huong Hoa District, to begin their Route 9-Khe Sanh Campaign; the 24th Regiment was ordered to destroy the enemy strongholds of Ban Houei Sane and Lang Vei; while the 9th Regiment was ordered to destroy any reinforcements that may try to relieve those bases areas. From December 1967, CIDG soldiers operating from Lang Vei began to report more frequent contacts with the North Vietnamese. By mid-January, U.S. military intelligence also reported movements of North Vietnamese formations across the Xe Pone River from Laos into South Vietnam. At the same time, the North Vietnamese began to harass the Lang Vei Special Forces Camp with mortar and artillery fire at least two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> and North Vietnamese patrols even probed the camp’s perimeters. [...] 3rd Marine Division intelligence estimated the combat strength of NVA and VC forces in the DMZ area during this period was 40,943 troops.|$|E
500|$|In the {{standard}} Golden Age model, the industry's top product, the A films, premiered {{at a small}} number of select first-run houses in major cities. Double features were not the rule at these prestigious venues. As described by historian Edward Jay Epstein, [...] "During these first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising." [...] Then it was off to the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of smaller, independent theaters, programs often changed two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> To meet the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as [...] "quickies" [...] for their tight production schedules—as short as four days. As Brian Taves describes, [...] "Many of the poorest theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily." [...] Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the trailers, or screen previews, that presaged its arrival, [...] "he new film's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got", writes Epstein. Aside from at the theater itself, B films might not be advertised at all.|$|E

Spielberg commented after seeing hundreds of young boys reading for the role, Irvine had come in and done a cold reading and that [...] "his performance was very natural, very authentic." [...] Irvine auditioned for two months, going in two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> and learned {{that he had the}} part when he was asked to read a piece of War Horse script on camera in order to check his West Country accent, and the piece of mocked-up script that he read out was Albert telling Joey that Steven Spielberg wanted him to play the part.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{patients}} {{in the early years}} of ECT were given treatment two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> or occasionally daily; a few psychiatrists experimented with more intensive treatment. At St James Hospital, Portsmouth, William Liddell Milligan gave neurotic patients ECT up to four times daily. His aim was [...] "to reduce the patient to the infantile level, in which he is completely helpless and doubly incontinent". Robert Russell and Lewis Page tried a slightly different regime, giving patients one or two sessions of ECT a day but with several additional electric shocks during the convulsion. This treatment was given to over 3,800 patients at the Three Counties Hospital. Arlesey, Bedfordshire. The Page-Russell technique was taken up by Scottish-American psychiatrist D Ewen Cameron who used it to [...] "depattern" [...] his patients at the McGill University in Canada. It later emerged that the CIA had put funds into Professor Cameron’s work. In 1988 nine of his former patients received compensation from the US government; the Canadian government later compensated those patients whose treatment had not been funded by the CIA and court cases continue to this day.|$|E
