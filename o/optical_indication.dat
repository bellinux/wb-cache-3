40|$|The {{theory of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation dispersion by polydisperse particles is analyzed. Methods of reliable <b>optical</b> <b>indication</b> of smokes to identify Fire Danger are considered. The conventional method of optical smoke detection implies measuring optical {{characteristics of the}} environment under control. After that the results obtained are converted into microphysical parameters which {{can be compared to}} the known microphysical properties of smokes. The calculated optical portrait of smokes is offered. The portrait of smokes is the field of representation points in coordinates of the degree of diffusion radiation polarization for two diffusion angles. Each of the spots indicates one of the numerous realizations of smokes. The direct match of the representation spots in the optical increases the probability of smoke A different way to protect optical system is to use the device with mutually orthogonal polarizers of the light source and detector. If hindrance is nonspherical aerosol, the signal from the device is used to correct the signals from smoke detectors...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of a {{gravitational}} lensing and optical study of MACS J 1423. 8 + 2404 (z= 0. 545, MACS J 1423), the most relaxed cluster in the high-redshift subsample of clusters discovered in the MAssive Cluster Survey (MACS). Our analysis uses high-resolution images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in the F 555 W and F 814 W passbands, ground-based imaging in eight optical and near-infrared filters obtained with Subaru and Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope, as well as extensive spectroscopic data gathered with the Keck telescopes. At optical wavelengths, the cluster exhibits no sign of substructure and is dominated by a cD galaxy that is 2. 1 mag (K band) brighter than the second brightest cluster member, suggesting that MACS J 1423 is close to be fully virialized. Analysis of the redshift distribution of 140 cluster members reveals a Gaussian distribution, mildly disturbed {{by the presence of}} a loose galaxy group that may be falling into the cluster along the line of sight. Combining stronglensing constraints from two spectroscopically confirmed multiple-image systems near the cluster core with a weak-lensing measurement of the gravitational shear on larger scales, we derive a parametric mass model for the mass distribution. All constraints can be satisfied by a unimodal mass distribution centred on the cD galaxy and exhibiting very little substructure. The derived projected mass of M[< 65 arcsec (415 kpc) ] = (4. 3 ± 0. 6) × 10 ^(14) M_☉ is about 30 per cent higher than the one derived from X-ray analyses assuming spherical symmetry, suggesting a slightly prolate mass distribution consistent with the <b>optical</b> <b>indication</b> of residual line-of-sight structure. The similarity in shape and excellent alignment of the centroids of the total mass, K-band light and intracluster gas distributions add to the picture of a highly evolved system. The existence of a massive cluster like MACS J 1423, nearly fully virialized only 7 Gyr after the big bang, may have important implications for models of structure formation and evolution on cosmological time scales...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In {{tropical}} countries, {{physicians are}} skeptic in using corneas with death-to-preservation time (DTPT) > 6 h, concerns being endothelial cell viability and microbial contamination on prolonged DTPT. The {{objective of the}} study was to investigate these concerns by analyzing the outcomes of corneal transplants performed using donor corneas with DTPT > 6 h. Materials and Methods: The study was a retrospective case series of 65 transplants performed in 2013 with donor corneas that had DTPT > 6 h (range, 6. 1 – 9. 8 h). The information on donor cornea tissues and the recipient details were collected from the eye bank and the medical records department of our tertiary eye care center. The main outcome measures were slit lamp assessment of the donor corneas, primary graft failure, graft survival, and postoperative adverse reactions, especially infections, if any. Results: Median DTPT was 7 h. Forty-four (67. 7 %) corneas were evaluated as optical grade and 21 (32. 3 %) were deemed as therapeutic grade; 36 (55. 4 %) were used for <b>optical</b> <b>indications.</b> There was no relationship between DTPT and the tissue grading of corneas or endothelial cell density. Of the 23 keratoplasties for purely <b>optical</b> <b>indications</b> with a minimum follow-up of 3 months, 15 (65. 2 %) remained clear whereas 7 (30. 4 %) failed (mean follow-up 15. 1 ± 6. 7 months). The causes of failure were primary graft failure (n = 1) and secondary graft failure (n = 6). Conclusion: The donor corneas with DTPT 6 h to 10 h can be utilized for <b>optical</b> <b>indications</b> provided that they meet the criteria of tissue acceptance for optical use...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{selection}} of ROSAT results on the morphology, the evolution, and the masses of galaxy clusters and groups. ROSAT provides the first complete X-ray view on the Virgo cluster: it reveals a complex structure similar to the <b>optical</b> appearance. <b>Indications</b> for ongoing evolution is found {{in a number of}} clusters traced both by the surface brightness distribution and temperature variations. With ROSAT data, which provide spatial and spectral resolution at the same time, good mass estimates can be obtained for various systems from small groups to very massive clusters covering a mass range of a few 10 ^ 13 to 4. 6 · 10 ^ 15. The gas to dark matter ratio for clusters is 10 - 30 % while for groups slightly smaller values (3 - 25 %) are found. The most luminous ROSAT cluster RXJ 1347. 5 - 1145 is presented which is an ideal object to compare the X-ray mass with the mass derived by gravitational lensing.

40|$|There {{are several}} reasons for which the {{correction}} of aphakia differs between children and adults. First, a child’s eye is still growing {{during the first few}} years of life and during early childhood, the refractive elements of the eye undergo radical changes. Second, the immature visual system in young children puts them at risk of developing amblyopia if visual input is defocused or unequal between the two eyes. Third, the incidence of many complications, in which certain risks are acceptable in adults, is unacceptable in children. The optical correction of aphakia in children has changed dramatically however, accurate optical rehabilitation and postoperative supervision in pediatric cases is more difficult than adults. Treatment and optical rehabilitation in pediatric aphakic patients remains a challenge for ophthalmologists. The aim of this review is to cover issues regarding optical correction of pediatric aphakia in children; kinds of <b>optical</b> correction, <b>indications,</b> timing of intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, types of IOLs, site of implantation, IOL power calculations and selection, complications of IOL implantation in pediatric patients and finally to determine the preferred choice of optical correction. However treatment of pediatric aphakia is one step on the long road to visual rehabilitation, not the end of the journey.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar as indicações e os resultados do transplante de córnea em crianças na Fundação Altino Ventura (FAV). MÉTODOS: Foi realizado estudo retrospectivo em 33 pacientes (34 olhos), com idades igual ou {{inferior}} a 12 anos, que haviam sido submetidos a transplante penetrante de córnea entre 2000 e 2009 na FAV. A média dos tempos de seguimento pós-operatório foi de 32, 5 ± 23, 2 meses (variando de 4 meses a 7 anos). Os dados analisados foram: indicação cirúrgica; acuidade visual para longe com melhor correção óptica (AVLc/c) no pré-operatório e na última consulta de seguimento, equivalente esférico refracional (EE) pós-cirurgia e complicações. Os resultados qualitativos foram expressos por suas frequências e os quantitativos por suas médias e desvios padrão. Utilizou-se o teste de t-Student para verificar possível diferença entre médias, aceitando-se o nível de significância de 95, 0 % (p PURPOSE: To {{evaluate the}} indications and results after penetrating keratoplasty in children at Altino Ventura Foundation (FAV). METHODS: A retrospective study {{was performed in}} 33 patients (34 eyes), with ages equal or less than 12 years, they underwent a penetrating keratoplasty at FAV, from 2000 to 2009. The mean follow up time was 32. 5 ± 23. 1 months. Surgery indication, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) before and after surgery, spherical equivalent (SE) pos surgical and complications were analyzed. The qualitative results were expressed by their frequencies and the quantitative by their means and standard deviations. The t-Student {{test was used to}} verify possible differences between means. The level of significance was 95. 0 % (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Mean age at surgery was 7. 5 ± 3. 3 years. Twenty seven (79. 4 %) grafts had <b>optical</b> <b>indication</b> and seven (20. 6 %) therapeutic or tectonic. Among the optical transplants, the most frequent indication was cornea opacity after ocular trauma in 18 (52. 9 %) eyes. The visual acuity was better in 21 (61. 7 %) eyes and worse in eight (23. 5 %). In the optical transplants, rejection was present in four (14. 8 %) eyes, and four (11. 8 %) developed glaucoma. CONCLUSION: In FAV opacity after ocular trauma was the most common indication for pediatric keratoplasty. This {{may be the result of}} the low income and violent society, among the citizens from the studied population. Many blind children due to cornea disease may achieve improvement in visual acuity if an appropriate surgical and good postoperative management is performed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Since 1990 {{we follow}} a quality {{assurance}} program with periodical tests of functional performance {{values of a}} 16 -year-old simulator. Material and Method: For this purpose we adopted and modified German standards for quality assurance on linear accelerators and international standards elaborated for simulators (International Electrotechnical Commission). The tests are subdivided into daily visual checks (light field <b>indication,</b> <b>optical</b> distance indicator, isocentre-indicating devices, indication of gantry and collimator angles) and monthly and annually tests of relevant simulator parameters. Some important examples demonstrate the small variation of parameters over 6 years: position of the light field centre when rotating the collimator, diameter of the isocentre circle when rotating the gantry, accuracy of the isocentre indication device, and coincidence of light field and simulated radiation field. Results: As an important result we can state, that by these rigid periodic tests {{it was possible to}} detect and compensate deteriorations of simulators quality rapidly. Conclusions: Technical improvements and specific calling-in of maintenance personnel whenever felt appropriate provided performance characteristics of our old simulator which are required by international recommendations as a basis for modern radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|The peak {{amplitude}} of linear polarization detected recently from an extrasolar hot giant planet HD 189733 b, {{is a few}} times of 10 ^- 4, more than {{an order of magnitude}} higher than all theoretical predictions. Rayleigh scattering off H_ 2 and He may although give rise to a planet-star flux ratio of the order of 10 ^- 4 in the blue band, it cannot account for the high polarization unless the planet has an unusually extended atmosphere. Therefore, it is suggested that the high polarization should be attributed to the presence of a thin cloud of sub-micron size dust grains in the upper visible atmosphere which supports the observational finding of an almost feature-less transmission spectrum in the <b>optical</b> with no <b>indication</b> of the expected alkaline absorption features. It is found that the polarimetry observation allows for a small eccentricity of the orbit that is predicted from the time delay of the secondary eclipse of the planet. The estimated longitude of the ascending node is 16 ^o± 6 which interestingly coincides with the observationally inferred location of the peak hemisphere-integrated brightness.

40|$|Approaching energy {{coupling}} in laser-irradiated metals, we {{point out the}} role of electron-electron collision as an efficient control factor for ultrafast optical absorption. The high degree of laser-induced electron-ion nonequilibrium drives a complex absorption pattern with consequences on the transient optical properties. Consequently, high electronic temperatures determine largely the collision frequency and establish a transition between absorptive regimes in solid and plasma phases. In particular, taking into account umklapp electron-electron collisions, we performed hydrodynamic simulations of the laser-matter interaction to calculate laser energy deposition during the electron-ion nonequilibrium stage and subsequent matter transformation phases. We observe strong correlations between optical and thermodynamic properties according to the experimental situations. A suitable connection between solid and plasma regimes is chosen in accordance with models that describe the behavior in extreme, asymptotic regimes. The proposed approach describes as well situations encountered in pump-probe types of experiments, where the state of matter is probed after initial excitation. Comparison with experimental measurements shows simulation results which are sufficiently accurate to interpret the observed material behavior. A numerical probe is proposed to analyze the transient optical properties of matter exposed to ultrashort pulsed laser irradiation at moderate and high intensities. Various thermodynamic states are assigned to the observed <b>optical</b> variation. Qualitative <b>indications</b> {{of the amount of}} energy coupled in the irradiated targets are obtained.

40|$|This paper reviews charge {{ordering}} in {{the organic}} conductors, β″-(BEDT-TTF) (TCNQ), θ-(BEDT-TTF) 2 X, and α-(BEDT-TTF) 2 X. Here, BEDT-TTF and TCNQ represent bis(ethylenedithio) tetrathiafulvalene and 7, 7, 8, 8 -tetracyanoquinodimethane, respectively. These compounds, {{all of which}} have a quarter-filled band, were evaluated using infrared and Raman spectroscopy in addition to optical conductivity measurements. It was found that β″-(BEDT-TTF) (TCNQ) changes continuously from a uniform metal to a charge-ordered metal with increasing temperature. Although charge disproportionation was clearly observed, long-range charge order is not realized. Among six θ-type salts, four compounds with a narrow band show the metal-insulator transition. However, they maintain a large amplitude of charge order (Δρ~ 0. 6) in both metallic and insulating phases. In the X = CsZn(SCN) 4 salt with intermediate bandwidth, the amplitude of charge order is very small (Δρ < 0. 07) over the whole temperature range. However, fluctuation of charge order is indicated in the Raman spectrum and <b>optical</b> conductivity. No <b>indication</b> of the fluctuation of charge order is found in the wide band X = I 3 salt. In α-(BEDT-TTF) 2 I 3 the amplitude of charge order changes discontinuously from small amplitude at high temperature to large amplitude (Δρmax~ 0. 6) at low temperature. The long-range charge-ordered state shows ferroelectric polarization with fast optical response. The fluctuation of multiple stripes occurs in the high-temperature metallic phase. Among α-(BEDT-TTF) 2 MHg(SCN) 4 (X = NH 4, K, Rb, Tl), the fluctuation of charge order is indicated only in the X = NH 4 salt. α′-(BEDT-TTF) 2 IBr 2 shows successive phase transitions to the ferroelectric state keeping a large amplitude of charge order (Δρmax~ 0. 8) over the whole temperature range. It was found that the amplitude and fluctuation of charge order in these compounds is enhanced as the kinetic energy (bandwidth) decreases...|$|R
