This includes nitroglycerin, beta blockers and, {{in the context}} of an acute event, stronger pain relief such as morphine and other opiates.

5|$|In the {{northern}} part of its range, the species often <b>occurs</b> <b>with</b> the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), but no evidence shows they compete with each other. In the south, the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) and the rice rat regularly occur together; water levels are known to influence relative abundance of these two species in Florida. The cotton rat is mainly active during the day, which may help differentiate its niche from that of the rice rat.|$|E
5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, a latent infection <b>occurs</b> <b>with</b> no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E

5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as <b>occurs</b> <b>with</b> puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E
40|$|The verb "play" {{can take}} nouns expressing {{various kinds of}} sport as its object: play tennis, play baseball, etc. But not all can <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> "play": *play boxing, *play camping. (*shows an {{ungrammatical}} sentence.) In this paper, first we studied the semantic change of "play" diachronically. Next we divided various kinds of sport into two groups and analyzed them: one {{is a group of}} nouns expressing sports which can <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> "play", the other is a group of those which cannot. As a result, we found that almost all kinds of sport <b>occurring</b> <b>with</b> "play" had six features; while meeting the six features, the noun expressing the sport could occur in the object position of "play". Therefore we suggest that the six features are the semantic restrictions of nouns expressing sports <b>occurring</b> <b>with</b> "play". Also we add {{that in the case of}} having a shortage of two features and over, the noun expressing the sport could not <b>occur</b> <b>with</b> "play"...|$|R

5|$|Development of an endometrial {{hyperplasia}} (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is {{a significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without {{the presence of a}} hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia <b>occurs</b> <b>with</b> an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy <b>occurs</b> <b>with</b> more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.|$|E
5|$|In {{locations}} where both snake and salamander co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they {{feed on the}} amphibians with impunity. Coevolution <b>occurs</b> <b>with</b> the newt increasing its toxic capabilities {{at the same rate}} as the snake further develops its immunity. Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.|$|E

5|$|John Bachman {{discovered}} the marsh rice rat in 1816, {{and it was}} formally described in 1837. Several subspecies have been described since the 1890s, mainly from Florida, but disagreement exists over their validity. The Florida Keys population is sometimes classified as a different species, the silver rice rat (Oryzomys argentatus). Data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicate a deep divergence between populations east of Mississippi and those further west, {{which suggests that the}} western populations may be recognized as a separate species, Oryzomys texensis. The species is part of the genus Oryzomys, which also includes several others occurring further south in Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America, some of which have previously been regarded as subspecies of the marsh rice rat. One, Oryzomys couesi, <b>occurs</b> <b>with</b> the marsh rice rat in Tamaulipas and southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|Kidney damage <b>occurs</b> <b>with</b> {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.|$|E

Fruiting was much denser in spruce forests—with up to 700–1000 fruitbodies per square meter—than in pine forests, where fruitbodies were sporadic. Fruitbodies grew by the millions in the year following the Yellowstone fires of 1988.|$|E

5|$|Males {{establish}} their dominance more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult males are very competitive {{with each other}} and fight for access to females. Higher dominance means better access to mating and earlier access to food, so naturally a great deal of fighting over rank <b>occurs,</b> <b>with</b> younger males constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups their entire lives, and males emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an older one for dominance. Frequently, when older baboons drop in the social hierarchy, they move to another tribe. The younger males who pushed them down often bullies and harasses them. Older males tend to have more supportive and equal relationships than those of the younger males. The former may form coalitions against the latter.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus zapfei is {{a fossil}} bat in the genus Miniopterus {{from the middle}} Miocene of France.

M.zapfei is known from five mandibles (lower jaws) and an isolated fourth upper premolar (P4). The fourth lower premolar is more slender than in M.fossilis and the cingulum shelf surrounding the P4 is less well-developed than in living Miniopterus. The length of the first lower molar is 1.57 to 1.60mm.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus is now {{recognized}} as one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys. O.dimidiatus is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. O.couesi <b>occurs</b> <b>with</b> O.dimidiatus in southeastern Nicaragua. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear and {{it is likely that the}} current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys is classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
