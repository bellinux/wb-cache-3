5|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> at the {{molecular}} level. This field overlaps with other areas <b>of</b> <b>biology,</b> particularly those of genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology is {{a study of the}} interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and how those interactions are regulated.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{biologists}} still often {{write about}} evolution as if organisms had goals, and some philosophers <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> such as Francisco Ayala and biologists such as J. B. S. Haldane consider that teleological language is unavoidable in evolutionary biology.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle's {{biology is}} the theory <b>of</b> <b>biology,</b> {{grounded}} in systematic observation and collection of data, mainly zoological, embodied in Aristotle's {{books on the}} science. Many of his observations were made during his stay {{on the island of}} Lesbos, including especially his descriptions of the marine biology of the Pyrrha lagoon there. His theory is based on his concept of form, which derives from but is markedly unlike Plato's theory of Forms.|$|E
5|$|Biogeography (an {{amalgamation}} <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> and geography) is {{the comparative}} study of the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time. The Journal of Biogeography was established in 1974. Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, the theory of island biogeography, published by the Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in 1967 {{is considered one of}} the fundamentals of ecological theory.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing {{both sides of the}} issue. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields <b>of</b> <b>biology.</b> He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E

5|$|From 1883-1884, Thompson {{stayed in}} Cambridge as {{so-called}} Junior Demonstrator in physiology, teaching students.

5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should not be taken out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|Mycology is {{the branch}} <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> {{concerned}} with the systematic study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy, and their use to humans {{as a source of}} medicine, food, and psychotropic substances consumed for religious purposes, as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. The field of phytopathology, the study of plant diseases, is closely related because many plant pathogens are fungi.|$|E

Her mother, Aurelia Schober Plath (1906–1994), was a second-generation American of Austrian descent, and her father, Otto Plath (1885–1940), was from Grabow, Germany.

He was the second {{of a set of}} quadruplets, being born between his brothers Wallace and Malcolm, the fourth child died within weeks of being born. They also had an older brother, James Stanley. All four attended Whitman College, and went on to earn doctorates and have distinguished careers as scientists and academics.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyze a popular pseudo-scientific {{discourse}} in Germany in the twenties that developed an idea of a state as a living organism. The discourse was sometimes named “the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> the state”. The aim of this analysis {{is to provide a}} genealogy of the term “biopolitics” that was first used by a Swedish theoretician <b>of</b> the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> the state Rudolf Kjellén and to show the influence, that the idea <b>of</b> the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> the state had {{on the development of the}} Nazi biopolitics. The paper reconstructs the main aspects of Michel Foucault’s genealogy of the modern biopolitics and subsequently shows, how the idea <b>of</b> the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> the state constituted the extreme development of the naturalistic tendencies diagnosed by Foucault in the modern theories of (bio) politics. </p...|$|R
5|$|Sub-disciplines <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> {{are defined}} by the scale at which life is studied, the kinds of organisms studied, and the methods used to study them: {{biochemistry}} examines the rudimentary chemistry of life; molecular biology studies the complex interactions among biological molecules; cellular biology examines the basic building-block of all life, the cell; physiology examines the physical and chemical functions of tissues, organs, and organ systems; ecology examines how organisms interact in their environment; and evolutionary biology examines the processes that produced the diversity of life.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} Stars was likely {{influenced}} by Escher's own interest in both geometry and astronomy, {{by a long}} history of using geometric forms to model the heavens, and by a drawing style used by Leonardo da Vinci. Commentators have interpreted the cage's compound shape as a reference to double and triple stars in astronomy, or to twinned crystals in crystallography. The image contrasts the celestial order of its polyhedral shapes with the more chaotic forms <b>of</b> <b>biology.</b>|$|E
5|$|The history <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> {{traces the}} study of the living world from ancient to modern times. Although the concept <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> as a single {{coherent}} field arose in the 19th century, the biological sciences emerged from traditions of medicine and natural history reaching back to ayurveda, ancient Egyptian medicine and the works of Aristotle and Galen in the ancient Greco-Roman world. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by Muslim physicians and scholars such as Avicenna. During the European Renaissance and early modern period, biological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in empiricism and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were Vesalius and Harvey, who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as Linnaeus and Buffon who began to classify the diversity of life and the fossil record, as well as the development and behavior of organisms. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek revealed by means of microscopy the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for cell theory. The growing importance of natural theology, partly a response to the rise of mechanical philosophy, encouraged the growth of natural history (although it entrenched the argument from design).|$|E
