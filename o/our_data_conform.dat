40|$|Species hybridization, {{and thus}} the {{potential}} for gene flow, was once viewed as reproductive mistake. However, recent analysis based on large datasets and newly developed models suggest that gene exchange is not as rare as originally suspected. To investigate the history and speciation of the closely related species Drosophila subobscura, D. madeirensis, and D. guanche, we obtained polymorphism and divergence data for 26 regions throughout the genome, including the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA. We found that the D. subobscura X/autosome ratio of silent nucleotide diversity is significantly smaller than the 0. 75 expected under neutrality. This pattern, if held genomewide, may reflect a faster accumulation of beneficial mutations on the X chromosome than on autosomes. We also detected evidence of gene flow in autosomal regions, while sex chromosomes remain distinct. This {{is consistent with the}} large X effect on hybrid male sterility seen in this system and the presence of two X chromosome inversions fixed between species. Overall, <b>our</b> <b>data</b> <b>conform</b> to chromosomal speciation models in which rearrangements are proposed to serve as gene flow barriers. Contrary to other observations in Drosophila, the mitochondrial genome appears resilient to gene flow in the presence of nuclear exchange...|$|E
40|$|Phylogenetic {{relationships}} among the Braconidae were examined using homologous 16 S rDNA gene sequence data. Analyses recovered the few well-supported relationships evident in this family from morphological analyses, viz the monophyly of the microgastroid complex of subfamilies, the monophyly of the cyclostome complex of subfamilies (= braconoids), a sister-group relationship between the Alysiinae and Opiinae, and a close relationship between the Helconinae and Blacinae. With respect to the braconoid complex of subfamilies, a sister-group relationship was recovered between Aphidiinae and Mesostoinae, and a clade composed of Gnamptodontinae + Histeromerinae + Rhyssalinae + Aphidiinae + Mesostoinae was also recovered. The Doryctinae and Rogadinae sensu lato (s. l.) were generally not resolved as monophyletic. With respect to the helconoid complex of subfamilies, a sister-group relationship was recovered between Sigalphinae and Agathidinae, whereas Neoneurinae fell out among other helconoid subfamilies. Other {{relationships among}} the helconoid subfamilies were unclear from these analyses. With respect to the microgastroid complex of subfamilies, <b>our</b> <b>data</b> <b>conform</b> to morphological estimates, recovering ((Microgastrinae + Miracinae) + Cardiochilinae) + Cheloninae. The topology of our trees suggests that the cyclostome subfamilies are a natural derived group, inferring that endoparasitism (not ectoparasitism) is the ancestral state for the Braconidae, unless all of the ectoparasitic ancestors of the helconoid + microgastroid subfamilies are now extinct.

40|$|Current {{methods of}} DNA {{sequence}} analysis attempt to reconstruct historical patterns of population structure and growth from contemporary samples. However, these techniques {{may be influenced}} by recent population bottlenecks, which have the potential to eliminate lineages that reveal past changes in demography. One way to examine the performance of these demographic methods is to compare samples from populations before and after recent bottlenecks. We compared estimates of demographic history from populations of greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) before and after recent bottlenecks using four common methods (nested clade analysis [NCA], Tajima’s D, mismatch distribution, and MDIV). We found that NCA did not perform well in the presence of bottleneck events, although it did recover some genetic signals associated with increased isolation and the extinction of intermediate populations. The majority of estimates for Tajima’s D, including those from bottlenecked populations, were not significantly different from zero, suggesting <b>our</b> <b>data</b> <b>conformed</b> to neutral expectations. In contrast, mismatch distributions including the raggedness index were more likely to identify recently bottlenecked populations wit...|$|R
40|$|A {{recent study}} by Ingram et al. [2000 b: Teratology 62 : 393 - 405] 4051 {{suggests}} a His 73 Arg polymorphism (A:G) in HOXA 1 contributes substantially to a liability for autism. Using 68 individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders, they found a significant dearth of G homozygotes and biased transmission of G alleles from parents to affected offspring, especially from mothers. Because the connection between HOXA 1 and liability to autism is compelling, we attempted to replicate their finding using a larger, independent sample from the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism (CPEA) network. In <b>our</b> <b>data,</b> genotype frequencies <b>conform</b> to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; allele transmissions meet Mendelian expectations; {{and there is no}} obvious sex-biased allele transmission. Based on our sample size, calculations suggest that we would have at least 95 % power to detect linkage and association even if the A:G polymorphism were to account for only 1 % of the heritability of autism. Therefore, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the samples in the two studies are intrinsically different, <b>our</b> <b>data</b> from <b>our</b> sample argue against a major role for HOXA 1 His 73 Arg in liability to autism. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|We have {{conducted}} {{a series of}} high-resolution friction experiments on large floating saline ice floes in an environmental test basin. In these experiments, a central ice floe was pushed between two other floes, sliding along two interfacial faults. The frictional motion was predominantly stick–slip. Shear stresses, normal stresses, local strains and slip displacement were measured along the sliding faults, and acoustic emissions were monitored. High-resolution measurements during a single stick–slip cycle at several positions along the fault allowed us to identify two phases of frictional slip: a nucleation phase, where a nucleation zone begins to slip before the rest of the fault, and a propagation phase when the entire fault is slipping. This is slip-weakening behaviour. We have therefore characterized what we consider to be a key deformation mechanism in Arctic Ocean dynamics. In order to understand the micromechanics of sea ice friction, we have employed a theoretical constitutive relation (i. e. an equation for shear stress in terms of temperature, normal load, acceleration, velocity and slip displacement) derived from the physics of asperity–asperity contact and sliding (Hatton et al. 2009 Phil. Mag. 89, 2771 – 2799 (doi: 10. 1080 / 14786430903113769)). We find that <b>our</b> experimental <b>data</b> <b>conform</b> reasonably with this frictional law once slip weakening is introduced. We find that the constitutive relation follows Archard's law rather than Amontons' law, with Embedded Image (where τ is the shear stress and σn is the normal stress) and n[*]=[*] 26 / 27, with a fractal asperity distribution, where the frictional shear stress, τ[*]=[*]ffractal Tmlws, where ffractal is the fractal asperity height distribution, Tml is the shear strength for frictional melting and lubrication and ws is the slip weakening. We can therefore deduce that the interfacial faults failed in shear for these experimental conditions through processes of brittle failure of asperities in shear, and, at higher velocities, through frictional heating, localized surface melting and hydrodynamic lubrication...|$|R

40|$|Age {{and size}} at {{maturity}} can have significant fitness consequences. Selection often favors early-maturing individuals {{because of their}} higher survival to maturity and greater relative contribution to population growth rate, {{but it may also}} favor delayed maturation if fitness increases with age or size at maturity. Males of several poeciliid fishes exhibit variation in age and size at maturity primarily controlled by a sex-linked gene called the P-locus. Wild-caught Phallichthys quadripunctatus males show a bimodal size distribution, which is often associated with a P-locus polymorphism in other poeciliids. We conducted two experiments to evaluate the inheritance of male age and size at maturity and the influence of social environment (presence of mature or juvenile males during development) on these traits. We specifically tested the hypothesis that male age and size at maturity in P. quadripunctatus are governed by a single Y-linked locus, and modified by the social environment. Although our results imply both a genetic and an environmental component to the dimorphism in maturation, both large and small males were able to sire both large and small sons, allowing us to reject the hypothesis that age and size at maturity in this species are controlled by a single, Y-linked locus. <b>Our</b> <b>data</b> do not <b>conform</b> adequately to any of the genetic mechanisms described to date for maturation polymorphism in poeciliids.

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{paradigm in}} evolutionary biology {{over the last}} ten years has been the role of fluctuating asymmetry in sexual selection. Fluctuating asymmetry in bilaterally paired traits, and in particular sexual traits, has been proposed to be a reliable indicator of individual quality and the focus of selection through sexual competition and attractiveness.
