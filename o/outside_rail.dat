25|$|One oddity is that, {{almost from}} its opening until 1917, the Bakerloo {{operated}} with the polarity of the conductor rails reversed, the <b>outside</b> <b>rail</b> negative and the centre rail positive. This {{came about because}} the Bakerloo shared a power source with the District Railway. On the Bakerloo, the outside conductor rail tended to leak to the tunnel wall, whereas on the District Railway, the centre rail shared a similar problem. The solution was to reverse the polarity on the Bakerloo line, so that the negative rail leaked on both systems. In 1917, the two lines were separated when the LNWR began its 'New Line' service between Euston and Watford Junction, which the Bakerloo would share north of Queens Park. As a result, normal operation was restored.|$|E
25|$|Aids: The rider {{applies the}} outside leg {{slightly}} further back from its normal position, which activates the outside hind (the first {{beat of the}} intended lead). At the same time, he or she uses the outside rein to flex the horse's head toward the outside, which frees up the animal's inside shoulder, encouraging it to fall into that lead. If the rider were {{to ask for the}} left lead, for example, he or she would apply the right leg behind the girth and use the right rein to turn the horse's head to the right. To make the rider's intent even clearer, the horse may be angled slightly toward the <b>outside</b> <b>rail</b> of the arena, which will guide it into taking the correct lead as it goes towards the unobstructed inside, and also discourages the horse from simply running onto the forehand.|$|E

2500|$|The Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company {{operated}} a [...] narrow gauge railroad that ran for over forty {{years from the}} bar of the Columbia River up the Long Beach Peninsula to Nahcotta, Washington, on Willapa Bay. [...] The line ran entirely in Pacific County, Washington, and had no connection to any <b>outside</b> <b>rail</b> line.

2500|$|Business {{increased}} substantially {{following the}} extension of the railroad. [...] More passenger trains were run. [...] Shipping of freight, particularly of raw logs increased greatly, until the Willapa Bay area was logged out a few years later. [...] The extension had been built to allow ready conversion to standard gauge, by use of larger standard gauge cross-ties. [...] However, by 1910, the Northern Pacific abandoned its plans to build out to the mouth of the Columbia on the north bank, and as a result the Ilwaco railroad never had any <b>outside</b> <b>rail</b> connection.|$|E
2500|$|The surface {{sections}} use {{the fourth}} rail solely for operational consistency; the system shares track with Network Rail in several places. Where the track is shared with 750 V third-rail stock, the central rail is bonded to the running rails and the <b>outside</b> <b>rail</b> electrified at 660 V. This allows {{both types of}} train to operate satisfactorily. The suburban network of the London & North Western Railway (LNWR) was electrified in co-operation with the Underground, but during the 1970s British Rail introduced third-rail EMUs and the sections of the LNWR suburban network not used by the Underground had the fourth rail removed (see [...] "London and North Western Railway", above).|$|E
50|$|When the <b>outside</b> <b>rail</b> is {{at higher}} {{elevation}} than the inside rail, {{it is called}} positive cant. This is normally the desired layout for curved track. Most counties achieve the desired level of positive cant by raising the <b>outside</b> <b>rail</b> to that level which is called superelevation. For Swiss railroad, the cant is done by rotating at the track axis (center of the two rails) to have <b>outside</b> <b>rail</b> super elevated (raised) at the half rate of the desired cant and the inside rail under elevated (lowered) at the same half rate of the desired cant.|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} chapter has been overviewed {{movement}} of locomotives in curved track, occurred forces in rails and other factors which affects magnitude of stresses in rails. Also overviewed types of stresses and most dangerous defects which they cause. As well as has been analyzed equipment {{that is being used}} to measure stresses in rails at the moment with their advantages and disadvantages. In the second section, four curves and two types of the vehicles were chosen, and according to their technical characteristics digital analysis were done. Also, in this chapter were formed principal scheme, according to which forces were calculated for <b>outside</b> and inside <b>rails</b> of the curves. After calculating the forces, in Comsol Multiphysics environment 3 D models were made according to chosen curves radiuses and rail types, rail materials were selected as well. Regarding to the results of digital analysis, parametrical analysis were done, where maximum speeds were calculated for explorative curves. In the final chapter, results from digital analysis were analyzed. Siemens locomotive’s results compared with <b>rail</b> car’s PESA, <b>outside</b> <b>rail’s</b> results compared with inside rail’s, conclusions were made about how size of stresses changes while changing radius of curved track, the speed of train or <b>outside</b> <b>rail’s</b> cant. Also results of parametrical analysis are being analyzed, which shows how axle load affects traveling speed of trains in curved track and how much this traveling speed could be raised in these curves for these types of trains...|$|R

500|$|In 1826 George Stephenson was {{appointed}} to design and build the [...] route. Stephenson built the line using four equally spaced rails; he envisaged that this would allow the line to operate as a double tracked railway line under normal circumstances, but that {{in the event of}} a locomotive needing to haul a particularly wide load or of one of the <b>outside</b> <b>rails</b> breaking, a train could run along the central pair of rails. He also felt that, by having the rails this close together, it would reduce the amount of land required for the already extremely expensive L scheme.|$|R

5000|$|As a heavy train goes round a bend at speed, the {{reactive}} {{centrifugal force}} can cause negative effects: passengers and cargo may feel unpleasant forces, {{the inside and}} <b>outside</b> <b>rails</b> will wear unequally, and insufficiently anchored track may move. To counter this, a cant (superelevation) is used. Ideally the train should be tilted such that resultant (combined) force acts straight [...] "down" [...] through {{the bottom of the}} train, so the wheels, track, train and passengers feel little or no sideways force ("down" [...] and [...] "sideways" [...] are given with respect to the plane of the track and train). Some trains are capable of tilting to enhance this effect for passenger comfort. Because freight and passenger trains tend to move at different speeds and weigh dramatically different, a cant cannot be ideal for both types of rail traffic.|$|R
