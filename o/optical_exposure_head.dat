40|$|Holographic photopolymers develop {{permanent}} index change via the polymerization {{and subsequent}} diffusion of monomer. It is well-known that to achieve high-fidelity recording, {{the rate of}} polymerization must be small {{in comparison to the}} rate of diffusion, particularly for strong exposures that consume significant fractions of the available monomer. When this condition is violated, polymerization is slowed in high-intensity regions by the local depletion of monomer, resulting in broadening of recorded features. This paper shows that a diffusing inhibitor has analogous dynamics controlled by the ratio of inhibitor diffusion rate to inhibition rate. When the ratio is small, inhibitor is locally depleted in bright regions, resulting in localized acceleration of polymerization. This causes recorded index features to be narrower than the incident <b>optical</b> <b>exposure.</b> Theoretical, numerical and experimental studies are used to illustrate this fact and show that this narrowing can be used to compensate for the broadening caused by monomer dynamics.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityChronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease marked by widespread accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau). CTE {{is associated with a}} constellation of symptoms, including impairments in cognition, behavior, and mood. Although initially described in boxers as dementia pugilistrca, CTE has been diagnosed in athletes from a variety of backgrounds, as well as military veterans and other individuals exposed to traumatic brain injury (TBI). To date, the only shared risk factor for CTE is a history of single or multiple TBI. This work aimed to better elucidate the relationship between <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts and the development and progression of CTE. Although the link between brain injury and CTE has been well described, the magnitude of this relationship has never been studied epidemiologically. The minimum prevalence of CTE was determined in a cohort at high risk of <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts, specifically National Football League (NFL) athletes. All former NFL athletes who passed away in 2011 were identified; a subset of these athletes were studied and diagnosed with CTE to establish a minimum prevalence of CTE. The characteristics of those examined and diagnosed with CTE and those undiagnosed were explored. These analyses represent the first epidemiologic study of CTE; the high prevalence highlights the relationship between <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts and the diagnosis of CTE. Next, the relationship between the nature of athletic exposure and CTE was quantified. An athletic history questionnaire was developed and integrated into a mathematical model, incorporating data from sensors placed in football players' helmets, to identify the theoretical frequency and magnitude of an athlete's <b>head</b> impact <b>exposure.</b> This model was adapted for use postmortem, and {{it was found that the}} duration of athletic exposure, total theoretical collisions experienced; and the sum of the 95 th percentiles of the rotational acceleration endured, were all significantly associated with extent of CTE pathology.
