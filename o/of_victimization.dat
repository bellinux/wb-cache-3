5|$|Under the Kingdom, Sicily's {{products}} went to {{many different}} lands. Among these were Genoa, Pisa, the Byzantine Empire, and Egypt. Over {{the course of}} the 12th century, Sicily became an important source of raw materials for north Italian cities such as Genoa. As the centuries went on, however, this economic relationship became less advantageous to Sicily, and some modern scholars see the relationship as frankly exploitative. Furthermore, many scholars believe that Sicily went into decline in the late Middle Ages, though they are not agreed on when this decline occurred. Clifford Backman argues that {{it is a mistake to}} see the economic history of Sicily in terms <b>of</b> <b>victimization,</b> and contends that the decline really began in the second part of the reign of Frederick III, in contrast to earlier scholars who believed that Sicilian decline had set in earlier. Where earlier scholars saw late medieval Sicily in continuous decline, Stephen Epstein argued that Sicilian society experienced something of a revival in the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|Overall, 40% of the {{population}} in Lima above 15 years old has been a crime victim. The younger population (ages 15 to 29 years old) has the highest victimization rate (47.9%). In 2012, citizens reported thefts (47.9%): in homes or establishments (19.4%), robbery or attack (14.9%), gang aggression (5.7%), among others in lesser frequency. The districts with the highest level <b>of</b> <b>victimization</b> are Rimac, El Agustino, Villa El Salvador, San Juan de Lurigancho and Los Olivos.

500|$|The Haitians at gravest risk <b>of</b> <b>victimization</b> {{by human}} traffickers are its poorest people, {{particularly}} children. In Haiti, the poorest {{country in the}} western hemisphere, over half the population lives on less than {{a dollar a day}} and over three quarters live on less than two dollars a day. [...] Severe poverty, compiled with a lack of social services such as education and basic healthcare increases a child’s vulnerability to modern slavery. [...] Factors that increase a child's likelihood of becoming a restavek include illness or loss of one or both parents, lack of access to clean water, lack of educational opportunities, and having access to family in a city. [...] In addition to poverty, individual factors that can lead to exploitation include unemployment, illiteracy, poor educational opportunities, a history of physical or sexual abuse, homelessness, and drug abuse. These individual factors “push” people towards pathways of human trafficking and modern day slavery. Oftentimes men, women and children accept slave-like work conditions because there is little hope for better and they need to survive. Some cross national borders in search of positive opportunities, but instead find themselves a part of the exploited work force. [...] Additionally, factors that make people easy targets for traffickers make enslavement more likely. [...] One group at high risk for sexual enslavement and other types of forced labor is internally displaced persons, particularly women and children living in refugee camps, [...] which offer little security. [...] The estimated 10% of undocumented Haitians, whose births go unreported, are at especial risk of enslavement.|$|E

2500|$|While {{people with}} BPD feel {{euphoria}} (ephemeral or occasional intense joy), they are especially prone to dysphoria (a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction), depression, and/or feelings of {{mental and emotional}} distress. Zanarini et al. recognized four categories of dysphoria that are typical of this condition: extreme emotions, destructiveness or self-destructiveness, feeling fragmented or lacking identity, and feelings <b>of</b> <b>victimization.</b> Within these categories, a BPD diagnosis is strongly associated {{with a combination of}} three specific states: feeling betrayed, [...] "feeling like hurting myself", and feeling out of control. Since there is great variety in the types of dysphoria experienced by people with BPD, the amplitude of the distress is a helpful indicator of borderline personality disorder. In addition to intense emotions, people with BPD experience emotional [...] "lability"; or in other words, changeability. Although the term emotional lability suggests rapid changes between depression and elation, the mood swings in people with this condition actually fluctuate more frequently between anger and anxiety and between depression and anxiety.|$|E

In one carefully controlled study, researchers compared rates <b>of</b> <b>victimization</b> among LGBT youth and their heterosexual siblings, and they found significantly higher rates of abuse among the LGB individuals. Comparing rates of perceived discrimination among African American and White individuals, researchers have found large differences in reports of discrimination: 30.9% of Whites reported experiencing [...] "major discrimination" [...] throughout their lives compared to 48.9% of African Americans. [...] Similarly, 3.4% of Whites reported experiencing discrimination [...] "often" [...] in their lives, compared to 24.8% of African Americans.

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} link between victimization at school and health risk {{behaviors}} using representative data comparing lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths and heterosexual youths. Methods: Data from the 1995 Youth Risk Behavior Survey taken in Massachusetts and Vermont were exam-ined. This sample included 9188 9 th through 12 th grade students; 315 of these students were identified as LGB. Analyses of variance were used to examine health risk behaviors by sexual orientation by gender by victimiza-tion level. Results: The combined effect of LGB status and high levels <b>of</b> at-school <b>victimization</b> {{was associated with the}} highest levels of health risk behaviors. LGB youths reporting high levels <b>of</b> at-school <b>victimization</b> reported higher levels of substance use, suicidality, and sexual risk behaviors than heterosexual peers reporting high levels <b>of</b> at-school <b>victimization.</b> Also, LGB youths re-porting low levels <b>of</b> at-school <b>victimization</b> reported levels <b>of</b> substance use, suicidality, and sexual-risk be-haviors that were similar to heterosexual peers who reported low at-school victimization.

Both of these factors give the commemorations at Bleiburg emotional weight and political significance, especially at a point when Croatia was going through another historical transition in the 1990s. It also meant that the Bleiburg myth was easily manipulated; the victims of the Bleiburg tragedy were actively invoked not only to distort the Ustasa past, but to justify the resurgence of extreme nationalist political options. The Bleiburg myth became one of many historical moments that symbolized Croatian martyrdom, due to the prevailing narrative <b>of</b> <b>victimization</b> by Greater Serbian aggression during the 1990s. The martyrium myth is one of the most common archetypes in the taxonomy of myths... The danger of presenting the victims of Bleiburg exclusively as martyrs for the Croatian state, however, is that the reality of the NDH regime and the crimes it committed are ignored in the new, revised narrative of World War Two.|$|E
2500|$|Papen {{stayed in}} the Zentrum mostly because he hoped to move his party towards the right, and he often {{advocated}} that the Zentrum leave the Weimar Coalition to join a coalition with the German National People's Party. In {{the words of the}} British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett who lived in Berlin between 1927–34 and knew the [...] "gentleman rider" [...] well, Papen was a [...] "fervent Catholic" [...] who always carried his rosary with him, and was a man of [...] "considerable wealth" [...] as his father-in-law was the richest industrialist in the Saarland. Papen exercised a certain degree of power in the Zentrum by the virtue of being the largest shareholder in the Catholic newspaper Germania, which was the most prestigious of the Catholic papers in Germany. Papen's beliefs were based on a type of Catholic conservatism that believed that sovereignty rested only with God and those He had appointed as His earthly representatives such as the Catholic Church and the aristocracy, which led Papen to a complete rejection of democracy as he felt that sovereignty could not rest with the people. Papen viewed the November Revolution of 1918 as a disaster that had brought [...] "western subjectivism" [...] to Germany, tearing apart the natural order of things and Germany could not recover from this disaster until the democratic system was destroyed. Like many other German Catholic noblemen in the interwar period, Papen had a profound sense <b>of</b> <b>victimization,</b> seeing himself as the victim of a monumental conspiracy. For Papen, European history {{from the time of the}} Enlightenment onward was a continuous tale of woe and decline as the [...] "false doctrines" [...] of rationalism, liberalism, republicanism, democracy and secularism had gained ascendancy at the expense of the [...] "true" [...] Catholic and aristocratic values. For Papen, like many Catholic noblemen, the authors of these disastrous developments were the Freemasons and the Jews. For Papen, the present was culmination of all he hated as he saw various developments like Marxism, women's rights, individualism, [...] "economic egoism", democracy and the [...] "de-Christianization" [...] of German culture as part and parcel of the same conspiracy that had allegedly begun in 18th century France.|$|E

6000|$|Why {{this should}} be so is a {{question}} to answer which thoroughly would require a volume in itself. As to the driving, why should men submit to it, seeing that labor is abundant, and that in all newly-settled countries the laborer is the true hero of the age? In answer to {{this is to be}} alleged the fact that hired labor is chiefly done by fresh comers, by Irish and Germans, who have not as yet among them any combination sufficient to protect them from such usage. The men over them are new as masters, masters who are rough themselves, who themselves have been roughly driven, and who have not learned to be gracious to those below them. It is a part of their contract that very hard work shall be exacted, and the driving resolves itself into this: that the master, looking after his own interest, is constantly accusing his laborer of a breach of his part of the contract. The men no doubt do become used to it, and slacken probably in their endeavors when the tongue of the master or foreman is not heard. But as to that matter of non- payment of wages, the men must live; and here, as elsewhere, the master who omits to pay once will hardly find laborers in future. The matter would remedy itself elsewhere, and does it not do so here? This of course is so, and it is not to be understood that labor as a rule is defrauded of its hire. But the relation of the master and the man admit of such fraud here much more frequently than in England. In England the laborer who did not get his wages on the Saturday, could not go on for the next week. To him, under such circumstances, the world would be coming to an end. But in the Western States the laborer does not live so completely from hand to mouth. He is rarely paid by the week, is accustomed to give some credit, and, till hard pressed by bad circumstances, generally has something by him. They do save money, and are thus fattened up to a state which admits <b>of</b> <b>victimization.</b> I cannot owe money to the little village cobbler who mends my shoes, because he demands and receives his payment when his job is done. But to my friend in Regent Street I extend my custom on a different system; and when I make my start for continental life I have with him a matter of unsettled business to a considerable extent. The American laborer is in the condition of the Regent Street bootmaker, excepting in this respect, that he gives his credit under compulsion. [...] "But does not the law set him right? Is there no law against debtors?" [...] The laws against debtors are plain enough as they are written down, but seem to be anything but plain when called into action. They are perfectly understood, and operations are carried on with the express purpose of evading them. If you proceed against a man, you find that his property {{is in the hands of}} some one else. You work in fact for Jones, who lives in the street next to you; but when you quarrel with Jones about your wages, you find that according to law you have been working for Smith, in another State. In all countries such dodges are probably practicable. But men will or will not have recourse to such dodges according to the light in which they are regarded by the community. In the Western States such dodges do not appear to be regarded as disgraceful. [...] "It behoves a frontier man to be smart, sir." ...|$|E
