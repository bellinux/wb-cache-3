Although {{television}} {{pictures from}} Earth satellites {{have been used}} for over ten years to detect major sea ice features, direct photo-interpretation methods have been supplemented with a fully-automated technique employing Composite Minimum Brightness (CMB) charts. Lack of on-board calibration has prevented quantitative use of the CMB method. In a newly-developed procedure the satellite brightness measurements taken over selected areas are used for external calibration. The calibrated data were used to study sea ice conditions in the North American Arctic. Characteristic brightness levels were found corresponding to the following: 1) compact or very close pack, snow covered; 2) compact or very close pack, without snow but with little or no puddling; 3) very close to close pack with much puddling; 4) <b>open</b> <b>pack,</b> generally with much puddling and rotten ice; 5) very <b>open</b> <b>pack</b> or ice-free conditions.

40|$|We {{measured}} {{light absorption}} in 42 marine snow, sea ice, seawater, brine, and frost flower samples {{collected during the}} OASIS field campaign between February 27 and April 15, 2009. Samples represented multiple sites between landfast ice and <b>open</b> <b>pack</b> ice in coastal areas approximately 5 km west of Barrow, Alaska. The chromophores that are most commonly measured in snow, H 2 O 2, NO 3 -, and NO 2 -, on average account for less than 1 % of sunlight absorption in our samples. Instead, light absorption is dominated by unidentified "residual" species, likely organic compounds. Light absorption coefficients for the frost flowers on first-year sea ice are, on average, 40 times larger than values for terrestrial snow samples at Barrow, suggesting very large rates of photochemical reactions in frost flowers. For our marine samples the calculated rates of sunlight absorption and OH production from known chromophores are (0. 1 - 1. 4) x 10 ** 14 (photons/cm** 3 /s) and (5 - 70) x 10 **- 12 (mol/L/s), respectively. Our residual spectra are similar to spectra of marine chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), suggesting that CDOM is the dominant chromophore in our samples.

40|$|Recent type systems {{allow the}} {{programmer}} to use types that describe more precisely the invariants {{on which the}} program relies. But {{in order to satisfy}} the type system, it often becomes necessary to help the type checker with extra annotations that justify why a piece of code is indeed well-formed. Such annotations take the form of term-level type manipulations, such as type abstractions, type applications, existential package packing and opening, as well as coercions, or casts. While those operations have no direct runtime cost, they tend to introduce extra runtime operations equivalent to η-redexes or even empty loops {{in order to get to}} the point where we can apply that supposedly free operation. We show a coercion that is like a pacific swiss army knife of coercions: it cannot cut but it can instantiate, <b>open,</b> <b>pack,</b> abstract, analyze, or do any combination thereof, reducing the need for extra surrounding runtime operations. And all that, of course, for the price of a single coercion, which still costs absolutely nothing at runtime.

It additionally happens to come in handy to work around some limitations of value polymorphism.

40|$|The global ship impact {{forces on}} the CCGS Amundsen are {{quantified}} here for 44 impacts with multi-year ice floes in the Beaufort Sea. Global impact forces were derived from an inertial measurement system called MOTAN. In general, global forces of up to 9. 0 MN were measured for maximum impact speed from 3. 1 to 10. 2 kt. Most of the impacts were conducted with two floes of known thickness and strength. Only two floes were sampled during the two-week program, but they characterized {{a wide spectrum of}} multi-year ice. Floe B 1 S 1 was the thinner of the two floes (7. 2 m), quite warm, saline and relatively weak (the depth-averaged borehole strength of the two test holes was 7. 3 MPa and 4. 5 MPa). Floe B 1 S 2 was thicker (8. 0 m), colder, less saline and stronger (the depth-averaged borehole strength of the uppermost 7 m of ice was 22. 0 MPa). As anticipated, global impact forces and ship accelerations were higher during collisions with the thicker, stronger floe than the weaker floe, for comparable ship speeds. The highest surge acceleration (1. 03 m/s 2) occurred during the final ram with Floe B 1 S 2 which was conducted at a maximum impact speed of 6. 7 kt. That collision generated the highest global impact force of the program: 9. 0 MN. The highest heave acceleration (0. 84 m/s 2) and sway acceleration (0. 46 m/s 2) occurred during rams with Floe B 1 S 1, while transiting to a natural harbour within the floe. Global forces from 18 impacts with isolated multi-year floes floating in <b>open</b> <b>pack</b> ice were comparable to many of the rams with Floe B 1 S 1, for a given impact speed. Comparison of the Commanding Officer 2 ̆ 019 s expected ice severity for the 18 impacts indicated that even experienced personnel can have difficulty ascertaining the competency of multi-year ice. Impact forces and accelerations measured by MOTAN on the CCGS Amundsen were comparable to MOTAN-derived measurements on the CCGS Terry Fox from oblique impacts with bergy bits. The maximum heave, surge and sway accelerations on the CCGS Terry Fox were respectively 0. 57 m/s 2, 0. 56 m/s 2 and 1. 24 m/s 2 during the Bergy Bit Trials, with measured global impact forces of up to 10. 6 MN.

30|$|An {{assembly}} of randomly packed spheres can represent certain {{features of the}} geometry of simple liquids [17]. Models of randomly packed hard spheres exhibited some features of the properties of simple liquids [18]. Using a new series acceleration method, the virial expansion for the pressure of hard discs and hard spheres {{was found to be}} a monotonically increasing function of the number density ρ and diverged at the density of closest packing with the critical exponent γ = 1 [19]. The general problem of <b>open</b> <b>packing</b> of spheres is difficult, since the answers depend on the assumptions about the local connectivity. At the purely mathematical level the only thing that counts is that there is continuity from one sphere to the next. From the engineering viewpoint of the stability of a pile of dust particles or a rime of ice crystals, each particle must be in contact with several other particles but not with crystallographic regularity. An <b>open</b> <b>packing</b> of spheres must be regular, at least in two dimensions, and preference is given to arrangements that are related to (4; 2)-connected three-dimensional (3 D) nets. The problem of stability is difficult because it involves chemical bonding. From the viewpoint of simple ionic bonding, any <b>open</b> <b>packing,</b> in general, is not electrostatically stable with respect to a more compact one. Material encapsulated during synthesis can promote stability of open frameworks, but removal of the encapsulated material should result in collapse of the framework as the minimum of electrostatic energy is favoured. From the viewpoint of ionic plus covalent bonding, open structures can persist metastably if bonds remain unbroken. The safest approach, in considering nets with extremely low density, is to look first at all theoretical possibilities, irrespective of chemical implications, and then to look at the complex topochemical possibilities. Low-density sphere packings were invented for a continuous, locally symmetric arrangement, in which each line joining the points of contact of successive spheres passes through the centres of the spheres. The most <b>open</b> <b>packing</b> has 94.4 % void space. The line-centre restriction is critical to mechanical stability of a sphere packing, but is not necessary for chemical stability. Replacement of one sphere by a triangle of three spheres is an important technique for creating new packings. Relaxation of the stability criterion allows invention of sphere packings of even lower density, including ones with 95.5 and 95.8 % void space. In earlier publications the bundlet model for clusters of SWNTs was presented [20 – 22]. The aim of the present report is to perform a comparative study of the properties of fullerenes (droplet model) and SWNTs (bundlet model).
