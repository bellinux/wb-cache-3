When lubricating rolling element bearings, four basic strategies have historically been employed: Grease lubrication; Oil bath lubrication; Oil lubrication via slinger disc or oil ring; Oil mist lubrication. For high speed (3000 RPM and higher), slinger discs or oil rings are commonly used due to the short re-greasing interval exhibited with grease lubrication and the high heat generation due to churning seen with oil bath lubrication. This paper seeks to reprise the work of Lemmon & Booser, Heshmat & Pinkus, Gardner and Ettles et al in defining the equations of performance related to <b>oil</b> <b>slinger</b> discs and oil rings. It will then {{address some of the}} operational and reliability concerns of each of these oiling methods using a purpose built test rig that is representative of {{the current state of the}} art in bearing housing design for pumps. Specifically it will look at how the following parameters affect oil delivery and stability: Rotational speed; Bearing housing inclination; Oil ring material; Slinger geometry; Slinger and oil ring submergence depth...|$|E

Although Daimler-Benz redesigned the bearings and added <b>oil</b> <b>slingers</b> and their associated coolers, the RLM considered the DB 605 to be a [...] "sick engine" [...] and the problems had not been fully resolved {{by the end of}} the war.|$|R
