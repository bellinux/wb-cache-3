5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E
5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Liz attends singles {{activities}} at the YMCA and her friend, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), joins her as her wingman. Nancy accompanies Liz {{to one of the}} activities, and is concerned when Liz speaks critically of everyone there and rebuffs a man whom Nancy has drawn into conversation. Nancy encourages Liz to focus not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative,</b> but on what she does want from a man. Liz tries to follow Nancy's advice the next day at a dodgeball game, and she tells a man (Ariel Shafir), whom she hit in the face during a previous dodgeball game, what traits she wants from a man. However, the man does not speak English, and a disappointed Liz hits him with another ball.|$|E

5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable {{narrow band}} filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E

25|$|Faced {{with this}} serious {{challenge}} to {{the unity of the}} republic, Sukarno declared martial law (Staat van Oorlog en Beleg) on 14 March 1957. He appointed a non-partisan prime minister Djuanda Kartawidjaja, while the military was in the hands of his loyal General Nasution. Nasution increasingly shared Sukarno's views <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> impact of western democracy on Indonesia, and he saw a greater role for the military in political life.|$|E
25|$|The Arjun {{features}} a hydro-pneumatic suspension.

Though <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> side, it is a more maintenance-intensive and expensive system, even if more capable than the simpler and cheaper torsion bar system utilised on many older tanks worldwide. During trials, the Arjun showcased its fording capability, by driving under 1.8 metres of water for 20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{well-known}} sequences {{of the film is}} the scene of a train robbery at night time.

25|$|The 60 extant {{photographs}} from their journey show that Hunt and Baker were keen {{on the new}} medium and familiar with its techniques. It was a real partnership: both men brought their own strengths to the process, and images that survive demonstrate their aesthetic acumen {{as well as their}} journalistic desire to show the settings in which they worked. One image of an unveiled Ghawazee female dancer, signed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> by Hunt himself, is likely the earliest photographic portrait of a Middle Eastern woman. Another image of the less photogenic view {{from the rear of the}} Parthenon demonstrates two men unafraid to indulge their take on a revered landmark.|$|E
25|$|He {{voted against}} the death penalty; the flag desecration amendment; the {{balanced}} budget amendment, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act; the Defense of Marriage Act; the Communications Decency Act; and the North American Free Trade Agreement. He was critical of proposals to replace the progressive income tax with a flat tax. Moynihan surprised many in 1991 when he voted against authorization of the Gulf War. Despite his earlier writings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> effects of the welfare state, he surprised many people again by voting against welfare reform in 1996. He was sharply critical of the bill and certain Democrats who crossed party lines to support it.|$|E
25|$|Users do not {{necessarily}} share with others the content which is of most interest to them, but rather that which projects a good impression of themselves. While everyone agrees that social networking has {{had a significant impact}} on social interaction, there remains a substantial disagreement as to whether the nature of this impact is completely positive. A number of scholars have done research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> effects of Internet communication as well. These researchers have contended that this form of communication is an impoverished version of conventional face-to-face social interactions, and therefore produce negative outcomes such as loneliness and depression for users who rely on social networking entirely. By engaging solely in online communication, interactions between communities, families, and other social groups are weakened.|$|E

25|$|Taylor, {{representing}} {{the field of}} Humanistic Psychology, presented a balanced review of Transpersonal psychology in the early nineties. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> side he mentioned Transpersonal Psychology's tendency toward being philosophically naive, poorly financed, almost anti-intellectual, and somewhat overrated as far as its influences. On the positive side he noted the fields integrated approach to understanding the phenomenology of scientific method; the centrality of qualitative research; {{and the importance of}} interdisciplinary communication. In conclusion he suggested that the virtues of Transpersonal psychology may, in the end, outweigh its defects. In a later article Taylor regarded Transpersonal psychology as a visionary American folk-psychology with little historical relation to American academic psychology, except through its association with Humanistic psychology and the categories of transcendence and consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Haloperidol is {{a typical}} {{butyrophenone}} type antipsychotic that exhibits high affinity dopamine D2 receptor antagonism and slow receptor dissociation kinetics. It has effects similar to the phenothiazines. The drug binds preferentially to D2 and α1 receptors at low dose (ED50 = 0.13 and 0.42mg/kg, respectively), and 5-HT2 receptors at a higher dose (ED50 = 2.6mg/kg). Given that antagonism of D2 receptors is more beneficial on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> symptoms, this characteristic underlies haloperidol's greater effect on delusions, hallucinations and other manifestations of psychosis. Haloperidol's negligible affinity for histamine H1 receptors and muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptors yields an antipsychotic with a lower incidence of sedation, weight gain, and orthostatic hypotension though having higher rates of treatment emergent extrapyramidal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> side, {{studies show}} that some former {{military}} brats struggle to develop and maintain deep, lasting relationships, and can feel like outsiders to U.S. civilian culture. The transitory lifestyle can hinder potential for constructing concrete relationships with people and developing emotional attachments to specific places, as can the stresses of having a parent deployed to a war zone and also the psychological aftermath of war in dealing with returning veteran parents. In some cases {{there is also the}} loss of a parent in combat, or a drastic change in a parent due to a combat related disability. A military brat may personally know another child or teenager, or even a few other peers, whose parents have become war casualties (wounded or killed). A significant minority of ex-military brats may exhibit symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, etc.|$|E
