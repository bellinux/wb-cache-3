40|$|A {{technique}} is described which allowed {{the measurement of}} the oxygen consumption of the isolated heart of Octopus vulgaris. Contraction of the heart resulted in an aortic <b>output</b> and a flow through the heart muscle into coronary veins (the coronary <b>output).</b> The flow and oxygen content of the aortic <b>output</b> and the coronary <b>output</b> were measured with variable input pressures and constant <b>output</b> back pressure (volume loaded), variable <b>output</b> back pressure and constant aortic <b>output</b> (pressure loaded), and during hypoxia. Volume loading of the heart resulted {{in an increase in}} aortic <b>output,</b> power <b>output</b> and total oxygen consumption. Pressure loading increased power <b>output</b> and total oxygen consumption of the heart. Exposure to hypoxia decreased the aortic <b>output,</b> power <b>output</b> and total cardiac oxygen consumption. In the response of the heart to reduced work, brought about either by a reduced input pressure or by hypoxic perfusate, the power <b>output</b> was linearly related to the total oxygen consumption of the heart. The oxygen extracted from the coronary <b>output</b> accounted for 80 - 100 % of the total oxygen consumption of the heart. Coronary <b>output</b> amounted to 30 % of the total cardiac <b>output</b> at maximum power <b>output.</b> In volume-loaded hearts the volume of the coronary <b>output</b> increased as aortic <b>output</b> increased; in pressure-loaded hearts coronary <b>output</b> increased as power <b>output</b> increased, but aortic <b>output</b> remained constant. In hypoxia, the coronary <b>output</b> increased as the aortic <b>output</b> fell. At a perfusate Po 2 of around 50 Torr (1 Torr = 133 Pa), the aortic <b>output</b> ceased although the heart continued to beat and the coronary <b>output</b> continued, accounting for all of the oxygen consumption of the heart. The coronary <b>output</b> flow in vitro therefore has the capacity to be varied independently of the aortic <b>output</b> flow to maintain the oxygen supply to the perfused cardiac muscle...|$|R

This further implies that stabilizing the <b>output</b> gap - the gap between actual and natural <b>output</b> — is equivalent to stabilizing the welfare-relevant <b>output</b> gap — the gap between actual and efficient <b>output.</b> If, however, non-trivial real imperfections are introduced into the model, the gap between natural and efficient <b>output</b> is not constant any more and is affected by shocks. Consequently, divine coincidence disappears, the <b>output</b> gap does not equal the welfare-relevant <b>output</b> gap any longer, and central banks are left with their trade-off between inflation and <b>output</b> stabilization.|$|R
