40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} GLAFF, {{a large-scale}} versatile French lexicon extracted from Wiktionary, the collaborative online dictionary. GLAFF contains, for each entry, inflectional features and phonemic transcriptions. It distinguishes {{itself from the}} other available French lexicons by its size, its potential for constant updating and its copylefted license. We explain how we have built GLAFF and compare it to <b>other</b> <b>known</b> <b>resources</b> in terms of coverage {{and quality of the}} phonemic transcriptions. We show that its size and quality are strong assets that could allow GLAFF to become a reference lexicon for French NLP and linguistics. Moreover, other derived lexicons can easily be based on GLAFF to satisfy specific needs of various fields such as psycholinguistics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} two French lexical resources, GLÀFF and PsychoGLÀFF. The former, {{automatically}} {{extracted from the}} collaborative online dictionary Wiktionary, is a large-scale versatile lexicon exploitable in Natural Language Processing applications and linguistic studies. The latter, based on GLÀFF, is a lexicon specifically designed for psycholinguistic research. GLÀFF, counting more than 1. 4 million entries, features an unprecedented size. It reports lemmas, main syntactic categories, inflectional features and phonemic transcriptions. PsychoGLÀFF contains additional information related to formal aspects of the lexicon and its distribution. It contains about 340, 000 entries (120, 000 lemmas) that are corpora-attested. We explain how the resources have been created and compare them to <b>other</b> <b>known</b> <b>resources</b> in terms of coverage and quality. Regarding PsychoGLÀFF, the comparison shows that it has an exceptionally large repertoire while having a comparable quality...|$|E
40|$|Although quantum {{computers}} {{are capable of}} solving problems like factoring exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms, determining the resources responsible for their computational power remains unclear. An important class of problems where quantum computers possess an advantage is phase estimation, which includes applications like factoring. We introduce a computational model based on a single squeezed state resource that can perform phase estimation, which we call the power of one qumode. This model is inspired by an interesting computational model known as deterministic quantum computing with one quantum bit (DQC 1). Using the power of one qumode, we identify {{that the amount of}} squeezing is sufficient to quantify the resource requirements of different computational problems based on phase estimation. In particular, we can use the amount of squeezing to quantitatively relate the resource requirements of DQC 1 and factoring. Furthermore, we can connect the squeezing to <b>other</b> <b>known</b> <b>resources</b> like precision, energy, qudit dimensionality, and qubit number. We show the circumstances under which they can likewise be considered good resources...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the power of photonic resources, as viewed from several different but related perspectives. They range from quantum computation, precision parameter estimation to the thermodynamics of relativistic quantum systems, as applied to cosmology in particular. The use of photonic states allows us to address several important questions about the resources required in quantum mechanical processes. In chapter 1, we propose a new quantum computational model, called the `power of one qumode', that relies mainly on a single-mode photonic squeezed state. In particular, we show the amount of squeezing can quantitatively relate the resource requirements of factoring to the problem of finding the trace of large unitary matrices, a result with consequences for understanding how powerful quantum computation really is. Furthermore, we can connect squeezing to <b>other</b> <b>known</b> <b>resources</b> like precision, energy, qudit dimensionality and qubit number, which is a useful stepping stone to finding the resources that enable quantum computation. In chapter 2, we exploit the quantum mechanical properties of photonic states for use in precision parameter estimation of general linear optical processes, which is useful for a diverse number of applications, from characterising an unknown process in a photonic quantum computer to biological imaging. We introduce a formalism that quantifies this improvement in precision. We also provide conditions under which one can easily check for photonic states that are optimal to use in this context, which is a potentially important result for future experimental efforts. In chapter 3, we explore the connection between two-mode squeezed states, commonly used in quantum optics, and relativistic quantum processes, in particular in cosmology. Using this connection, we apply recently developed tools from the thermodynamics of quantum systems perturbed far from equilibrium to address an old question of entropy production in cosmology from a surprising new angle. </p...|$|E

40|$|This handbook, now {{available}} in paperback, brings together a comprehensive collection of mathematical material in one location. It also {{offers a variety of}} new results interpreted in a form that is particularly useful to engineers, scientists, and applied mathematicians. The handbook is not specific to fixed research areas, but rather it has a generic flavor that can be applied by anyone working with probabilistic and stochastic analysis and modeling. Classic results are presented in their final form without derivation or discussion, allowing for much material to be condensed into one volume. Concise compilation of disparate formulae saves time in searching different sources. Focused application has broad interest for many disciplines: engineers, computer scientists, statisticians, physicists; as well as for any researcher working in probabilistic and stochastic analysis and modeling in the natural or social sciences. The material is timeless, with intrinsic value to practicing engineers and scientists. Excerpts from reviews of the hardbound edition: This is a unique book and an invaluable reference for engineers and scientists in the fields of electrical engineering, mathematics and statistics. There is no other single reference book that covers Gaussian and Gaussian-related distributions of random variables that are encountered in research work and practice. This is a reference book that I recommend to all my graduate students working in the area of telecommunication system analysis and design. [...] John Proakis, Professor Emeritus, Northeastern University and Adjunct Professor, University of California, San Diego The reference book Probability Distributions Involving Gaussian Random Variables, authored by Dr. Marvin Simon, has become, {{in a very short time}} frame, one of the most useful aids to research in the field of digital communications that has come out in many years. It has numerous results that can save researchers in the field endless hours of work. It has replaced various <b>other</b> well <b>known</b> <b>resources</b> because of its concentration of relevant, timely, and easily accessible results. [...] Larry Milstein, UCSD There are a small number of reference works that have proven so invaluable that I have purchased a home copy in addition to my office copy. This handbook is one of them. [...] Dr. Norman C. Beaulieu, University of Alberta The Gaussian distribution and those derived from it are at the very core of a huge number of problems in multi-disciplinary fields of engineering, mathematics and science… The book, with its comprehensive information in analytical, tabular, and graphical form, is an invaluable tool for scientists and engineers.

40|$|A key {{requirement}} for future production facilities is to perform new production processes in a flexible and adaptive way with available and <b>known</b> <b>resources.</b> In this context, a comprehensive description (ontology) of involved components {{has a high}} significance. If certain technological aspects are missing during a production process, the production control should respond in a dynamic, versatile and adaptive (agile) manner to the overall value network. The possibility to describe the requirements of products for the necessary processes in the same namespace like {{the requirements of the}} necessary processes for the resources is a prerequisite to enable this behavior. Afterwards the different requirements will be placed in relation to the respective requirements. The aim is to define the necessary processes for the production based on the description of the product and the <b>known</b> <b>resources</b> in an agile way. Due to this a framework for a comprehensive description of automated production facilities, products and processes is described in this paper. The idea is that based on this framework a production facility can change the produced products without dedicated commissioning and ramp-up phases...|$|R
