Sixty-six days after the incident, North Korea released 39 of the passengers on 14 February through the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom, but kept the aircraft, crew, and remaining passengers. The statements provided by the released passengers refuted North Korea's claims that the hijacking was led by the pilots; instead, they pinned the blame {{on one of the}} passengers. One man claimed to have looked <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft despite instructions from the North Korean guards, and saw the hijacker being driven away in a black sedan. Another passenger was reported to have become mentally deranged {{as a result of his}} captivity, and lost the ability to speak.|$|E

500|$|On September 22, 1851, Minot was in {{a parked}} {{passenger}} train at Turner Station. He glanced <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train and saw the new telegraph wires. Departing the train, Minot ran into the station, got on the new telegraph, and wired the next station along the line, Monroe, {{to see if the}} eastbound train to Piermont-on-Hudson had gone past. The station agent said no. At that point, Minot ordered the engineer of the train to proceed on their way to Goshen. The engineer refused to take Minot's order, and instead, Minot got into the cab car himself and drove the train himself to Port Jervis, hours ahead of the planned scheduled time of arrival. This was the second of the several [...] "firsts" [...] the Erie Railroad created in its time, along with the shipment of milk by rail at Chester station in 1842. The use of the telegraph and Minot's system remained until 1888, when a new system of block signaling, developed by the competitor Pennsylvania Railroad, helped expand Minot's use of telecommunications to control rail traffic.|$|E
500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E
