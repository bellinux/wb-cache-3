It includes {{the effects on}} the body of pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment <b>of</b> <b>conditions</b> caused by marine hazards and how fitness to dive affects a diver's safety. Hyperbaric {{medicine is}} another field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for two of the most important diving-related illnesses, DCS and arterial gas embolism.|$|E

40|$|Generalization <b>of</b> <b>conditioned</b> fear {{refers to}} the {{transfer}} <b>of</b> the <b>conditioned</b> fear response to stimuli that resemble the original <b>conditioned</b> stimulus. Overgeneralization <b>of</b> <b>conditioned</b> fear {{has been associated with}} panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and may be relevant to obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms as well. This study represents the first attempt to determine the degree to which individuals with high versus low OC traits over generalize conditioned fear. We hypothesized that the high OC individuals, particularly those characterized by overestimation of threat, would show overgeneralization <b>of</b> <b>conditioned</b> fear compared to controls as measured by behavioral and psychophysiological (fear-potentiated startle) measures. The results of this study show an interaction between the high and low Threat Estimation groups as measured by the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire, which suggests that those who have a tendency to overestimate threat show overgeneralization <b>of</b> <b>conditioned</b> fear. This finding suggests that the relation between OC symptoms and overgeneralization <b>of</b> <b>conditioned</b> fear may be specific to the high threat estimation component of OC symptoms...|$|R

5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number <b>of</b> <b>conditions,</b> including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E

Although black is still used for submarines, it was discontinued on destroyers after it had been determined that black ships remained more noticeable than gray ships on even the darkest nights.|$|E
5|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum <b>of</b> <b>conditions</b> caused by infection {{with the human}} {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E

5|$|On 24 March 2009, it was {{revealed}} that the fate of 5,900 artefacts retrieved from the wreck would rest with a U.S. District Judge's decision. The ruling was later issued in two decisions on 12 August 2010 and 15 August 2011. As announced in 2009, the judge ruled that RMS Titanic Inc. owned the artefacts and her decision dealt with the status of the wreck as well as establishing a monitoring system to check future activity upon the wreck site. On 12August 2010, Judge Rebecca Beach Smith granted RMSTitanic, Inc. fair market value for the artefacts but deferred ruling on their ownership and the conditions for their preservation, possible disposition and exhibition until a further decision could be reached. On 15 August 2011, Judge Smith granted title to thousands of artefacts from the Titanic, that RMS Titanic Inc. did not already own under a French court decision concerning the first group of salvaged artefacts, to RMS Titanic Inc. subject to a detailed list <b>of</b> <b>conditions</b> concerning preservation and disposition of the items. The artefacts can be sold only to a company that would abide by the lengthy list <b>of</b> <b>conditions</b> and restrictions.

40|$|Recent {{studies using}} lesion, infusion, and unit-recording {{techniques}} {{suggest that the}} infralimbic (IL) subregion of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) {{is necessary for the}} inhibition <b>of</b> <b>conditioned</b> fear following extinction. Brief microstimulation of IL paired with conditioned tones, designed to mimic neuronal tone responses, reduces the expression <b>of</b> <b>conditioned</b> fear to the tone. In the present study we used microstimulation to investigate the role of additional mPFC subregions: the prelimbic (PL), dorsal anterior cingulate (ACd), and medial precentral (PrCm) cortices in the expression and extinction <b>of</b> <b>conditioned</b> fear. These are tone-responsive areas that have been implicated in both acquisition and extinction <b>of</b> <b>conditioned</b> fear. In contrast to IL, microstimulation of PL increased the expression <b>of</b> <b>conditioned</b> fear and prevented extinction. Microstimulation of ACd and PrCm had no effect. Under low-footshock conditions (to avoid ceiling levels of freezing), microstimulation of PL and IL had opposite effects, respectively increasing and decreasing freezing to the conditioned tone. We suggest that PL excites amygdala output and IL inhibits amygdala output, providing a mechanism for bidirectional modulation of fear expression...|$|R
