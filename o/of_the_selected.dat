5|$|Although {{the team}} was {{considered}} successful, {{in spite of the}} failure to recapture The Ashes, the problems between the players and the administrators continued. Before the team departed Australia, the players arbitrarily replaced one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> players without recourse to the ACC. After the final match in England, Trott and his players broke an agreement to return home in time for the 1896–97 Australian season. Instead, they organised matches in North America and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the draft, around 40% of {{the players}} {{selected}} in it were born from countries outside the United States. It would remain the highest influx of international players selected in the modern NBA draft era until the 2016 NBA draft, where almost half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> players were born in countries outside the US. In addition, four of the players selected in the draft were Russians, which not only marked the highest number of players born in that region to be taken in one draft, but also was the highest representation of a country in one draft until 2016 when five Frenchmen would be taken in the draft.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of travel in the late 18th century, very few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> delegates were present on the designated day of May 14, 1787, and it was not until May 25 that a quorum of seven states was secured. (New Hampshire delegates would not join the Convention until more than halfway through the proceedings, on July 23.) James Madison arrived first, and soon most of the Virginia delegation arrived. While waiting for the other delegates, the Virginia delegation produced the Virginia Plan, which was designed and written by James Madison. On May 25, the delegations convened in the Pennsylvania State House.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} said that there are three ranks <b>of</b> tawakkul: <b>the</b> trust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> believers, <b>the</b> trust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>select,</b> and <b>the</b> trust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>select</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>select.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> trust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>select</b> is trusting God with no motives or desires. It is casting aside all wants. *And finally <b>the</b> trust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>select</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>select</b> {{is giving}} {{yourself}} over to God completely so that His desires become yours.|$|R

5|$|Units have {{a primary}} job which determines the stat boosts they receive when they level {{up and the}} {{attributes}} associated with that class. A unit may also have a secondary job set of abilities, where it can use any abilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> job, but with the stat profile of the primary job. For example, an Assassin with a Sniper secondary job could use abilities from both jobs, but has the stat profile and appearance of an Assassin, its primary job. This may deny the use of some abilities depending on their equipped weapon. In the previous example, any abilities that require the possession of a great bow, {{will not be allowed}} for use if the character has a Katana equipped.|$|E
5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was {{under threat of}} strikes by both the Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrumentation}} included ten smoked paper analog seismometers {{that were}} configured {{to allow for}} 48 hours of continuous single-component data recording. Six digital recorders built by the Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg were also used to record signals from three-component seismometers. Eight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> sites were equipped with a vertical component velocity transducer along with an FM telemetry link to transfer data back to a central station where a three-component unit was stationed. There the seismic signals were digitized, along with an internal time signal and an external DCF77 time signal, and stored on magnetic tape. The tapes were then played back and the P-wave and S-wave arrival times were used to automatically determine aftershock locations. Approximately two hundred aftershocks were recorded each day for the first several days of the expedition {{and at the end}} of the recording period in February the equipment was still picking up around 100 shocks per day. The team then set out to determine an accurate velocity model using data from the more accurate telemetry network. The soviet geophysicists detonated 100 kilograms of TNT in a hole drilled near the mainshock epicenter and the resulting shock waves were detected and used to help pinpoint a more accurate crustal velocity value of 5.3 to 5.4km/s.|$|E
