He hears a scratching sound and claws away at the fresh plaster wall until blood begins streaming downward. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) performs an autopsy on the body Doggett found {{and one of her}} FBI cadets, Rudolph Hayes, accurately guesses that the victim hooked up with a psychotic killer at a bar. Hayes's suggestions lead Scully to connect this murder to another killing two weeks earlier. In the meantime, Doggett wonders why anyone tipped him off about the murder, since it is not an X-File.|$|E

25|$|Significant development, called 'gentrification' by critics, {{occurred}} in East Palo Alto from around 2000, {{with the construction}} of a large shopping center named Ravenswood 101—including a Home Depot, a Best Buy, and an IKEA store—and several upscale housing communities intended for high-earning Silicon Valley workers. This development faced opposition from some residents, who charged that it priced locals <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region's only affordable communities while providing only low-paying retail jobs and consuming disproportionate land area (2.2 square miles). Supporters pointed to an increased tax base.|$|E
25|$|The CMP {{utilizes}} {{several different}} methods to reduce traffic congestion. One innovative design that came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MPO's Congestion Management Studies is the Diverging diamond interchange (DDI). Because of the CMP {{suggesting that this}} type of interchange should be used to alleviate bottlenecks in the MPO area, KYTC chose to use a DDI design for the Harrodsburg Road and New Circle interchange. A public meeting was held on March 29, 2011 at Southern Hills United Methodist Church. This is the first Diverging Diamond Interchange (now called Double Crossover Diamond or DCD) in the state of Kentucky.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{begins with a}} shot of an empty street, followed by clips of disadvantaged and poorer members of society going about their daily activities. Two men play dominoes on a wooden crate outside a building, a gang make fun of an elderly man hanging newspapers outside his store and an obese woman walks down the street. Clips of Carey leaning against a wall and sitting on some steps looking on at what is happening are shown. As the first chorus begins, everyone starts to dance joyfully {{in the street and}} help those in need. A gospel choir comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings as the street becomes more crowded with people of all ages and backgrounds rejoicing and getting along with each other.

500|$|The ride {{begins with}} a dousing of Floo Powder from Hermione Granger, who asks the guests to say, [...] "Observatory" [...] in order to {{transport}} them to their desired location, and the enchanted bench flies off through the Floo Network to the Astronomy Tower. The guests leave the room of requirement through its fireplace and enter the Observatory, where they look out through the open arches to the hills and lake outside Hogwarts' boundary. As the guests fly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Observatory's arches, the ride smoothly switches to a wrap-around projection screen and they follow Harry Potter and Ron Weasley around Hogwarts' buildings and towers to a Quidditch match. As Harry and Ron travel under a bridge, Hagrid yields the riders and asks them if they have seen a dragon. As Harry redirects the riders' attentions back to their journey, Hagrid's pet Hungarian Horntail dragon begins to chase the riders. The bench flies out of the projection screen and into a set of the uneven bridge that crosses the valley behind Hogwarts and, after falling out of {{a hole in the}} floor of the bridge, they encounter an animatronic dragon, which breaths pressurized water mist with red lighting pointed to it to make it resemble fire.|$|E

2500|$|Balls 8 {{received}} {{significant modifications}} {{in order to}} carry the X-15.

[...] A notch was also cut <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right wing's flaps so that the plane could accommodate the X-15's vertical tail. [...] Balls 8 {{was one of two}} such bombers modified to carry the X-15; while the other plane was retired in 1969 {{after the end of the}} X-15 program, NASA continued using Balls 8 for drop tests until it was retired in 2004.

2500|$|A motif {{within the}} second season {{is the image of}} a damaged teddy bear and its missing eye. The teddy bear first appears {{at the end of the}} music video [...] "Fallacies" [...] for Jesse's band [...] "TwaüghtHammër," [...] which was {{released}} as a webisode in February 2009 leading to {{the second season}}. The teddy bear can also be spotted on the mural on Jane's bedroom wall during the final episode of the second season, further connecting the crash to Jane. It is seen in flashforwards during four episodes, the titles of which, when put together in order, form the sentence [...] "Seven Thirty-Seven down over ABQ." [...] The flashforwards are shot in black and white, with the sole exception of the pink teddy bear, which is an homage to the film Schindler's List, in which the color red is used to distinguish a little girl in a coat. At the end of the season, Walter indirectly helps cause the midair collision of two airplanes; the pink teddy bear is then revealed to have fallen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planes and into the Whites' swimming pool. Vince Gilligan called the plane accident an attempt to visualize [...] "all the terrible grief that Walt has wrought upon his loved ones" [...] and [...] "the judgment of God." ...|$|E

We trace the knowledge transfer from Intershop to the spin-offs and relate it to recent theorizing on the spin-off process as well as spin-off-based cluster formation. The Intershop case suggests that temporarily successful dot. coms could exert lasting effects on regional development...|$|R

From worldwide stardom with multi-platinum hip-hop group The Fugees, to an unlikely seven-year incarceration for a drug offense and later to a miraculous commutation by former President George Bush, the documentary specifically explores Forté's return to society as a honed instrument for teaching and song and the acclimation process.

25|$|Würzburg C {{featured}} lobe {{switching to}} improve aiming accuracy. The C model was aimed by sending the signal <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> two slightly off-centre feed horns {{in the middle}} of the antenna, the signal being switched rapidly between the two horns. Both returns were sent to an oscilloscope display, slightly delaying the signal from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the horns. The result appeared as two closely separated blips which the operator attempted to keep at the same height on the display. This system offered much faster feedback on changes in target position, and changes in signal strength due to changes in reflection off the target affected both lobes equally, eliminating common reading errors. An almost identical system was used in the United States' first gun-laying radar, the SCR-268.|$|R
