Kirkman avouched that since the initiation of the zombie apocalypse, many of the characters have reverted to traditional gender roles; [...] "Lori is really just aggravated <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things and she's lashing out. She was serious and she wants Andrea to pull her weight; certain people are stuck with certain tasks and {{to a certain extent}} people are retreating back into traditional gender roles because of how this survival-crazy world seems to work. Lori has {{a lot of things going}} on so she's definitely going to be behaving somewhat irrationally at times as she tries to cope with the pregnancy and the conflict between Rick and Shane as well as dealing with the fact that Rick was out on the road again. She's going through a lot of stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Instead, Stabæk started {{negotiating}} with IT Fornebu to take <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> they owned. They needed a [...] lot {{which would have}} a market value of between NOK60 and 80 million, and Reinsfelt stated that the municipality was willing to help by [...] "maneuver in gray areas within the margins". The club was further pressured by NFF, {{who were going to}} limit the exceptions allowed for Nadderud and other stadiums not meeting their criteria. On 29 October, FB and Stabæk signed an agreement whereby Stabæk received a free lot and NOK50 million, in exchange for FB taking over the commercial properties. The condition was that the municipality allowed a more dense use of the rest of FB's area. This would require a re-regulation of the area, and Reinsfelt estimated {{that it would not be}} possible for construction to start until 2006. In November, UEFA changed the rules for artificial turf to state that it had to be green. Until Stabæk's proposal was made, UEFA had not though that anyone would build a pitch with a non-green turf, and representatives stated that it was because of Stabæk the rule change was made. The plans were nearly terminated in October 2006, after discussion about the planned Fornebu Line—a people mover which would connect Fornebu to Lysaker—stopped the regulation plan. However, in November the final permissions were granted by Bærum Municipality. On 22 December, Stabæk announced that the financing was secured.|$|E

At the sixth meeting, on 8 December, Campbell withdrew the Blackheath Club, explaining that the rules that the FA intended to adopt would destroy the game and all interest in it.

2500|$|In July 1989, Johnston {{opted not}} to return to Celtic (who had {{recently}} sold his replacement Frank McAvennie back to West Ham United) and instead joined Graeme Souness's Rangers. From the early 20th century onwards, Catholics had not been knowingly signed by Rangers, nor employed in other prominent roles as an 'unwritten rule'. Johnston was [...] "their first major Roman Catholic signing". He was the highest-profile Catholic to sign for the club since the World War I era, though other Catholics had signed for Rangers before. The move angered both Celtic and Rangers supporters. Some Rangers fans burned scarves and threatened to hand in season tickets over the signing, while Celtic fans referred to Johnston as Judas. Rangers' kitman protested by making Johnston arrange his own kit and withholding from him the chocolate bars dispensed to other players. [...] He won <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Rangers fans in November 1989 when he scored an injury time winner for Rangers against former club and bitter rivals Celtic.|$|E

At that point he braked immediately. His conductress, Dorothy Dunster, called out [...] "What's happened?", and Samson got out to see what had happened. Carter, who was knocked over and dazed but not injured, said the bus continued about fifty yards before braking and another witness said he thought about twenty-five yards.|$|E

[...] As Clinton saw it, [...] "turning <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of that material—intentionally or unintentionally—drained, gave all kinds of information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups and the like.

[...] As such, Miller told Cleese that the episode would interpret Petruchio as an early Puritan more concerned with attempting to show Kate how preposterous her behaviour is (showing her [...] "an image of herself" [...] as Miller put it), rather than bullying her into submission, and as such, the part was not to be acted {{along the lines of the}} swaggering bully a la Richard Burton in Franco Zeffirelli's adaptation.
