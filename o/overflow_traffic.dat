50|$|Both bridges {{are under}} scrutiny, with four options being considered. Three call for {{expansion}} of the Little Bay Bridge to six or eight lanes and restoration of the General Sullivan as both a pedestrian/bicycle way and alternative for buses and <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic.</b> The fourth would replace all three spans with an eight lane bridge.|$|E
50|$|All traffic shaper {{implementations}} have {{a finite}} buffer, and must {{cope with the}} case where the buffer is full. A simple and common approach is to drop traffic arriving while the buffer is full (tail drop), thus resulting in traffic policing as well as shaping. A more sophisticated implementation could apply a dropping algorithm such as Random Early Discard; a crude alternative would be to allow <b>overflowing</b> <b>traffic</b> through unshaped.|$|R

40|$|A {{network is}} {{considered}} having two hierarchical levels, namely first choice routes and a star-type last choice network. The principle of alternate routing offers an economic {{utilization of the}} channels, a high probability that calls can be served in failure states even though with diminished GOS, and finally a certain capability to handle local traffic overload. The performance of such a network can be improved by an overlaid ring network connecting a number of switching nodes and taking over the <b>overflowing</b> <b>traffics</b> from these nodes. The ring can be operated with a central or a distributed switching system...|$|R
50|$|The airport's history starts between 1937 and 1939 {{when the}} {{municipal}} council investigated several sites considered suitable for an aerodrome. What finally forced {{the federal government}} to act on a site was the Second World War; in 1942 a military airfield was opened at Raglan to take <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic</b> and aircraft parking from the overcrowded Richmond Air Base in Sydney's west.|$|E
50|$|The City of Kansas City built Grandview Airport (IATA code GVW) in 1941. During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces I Troop Carrier Command built a {{facility}} {{on part of}} the airfield in 1944 which {{was used as a}} sub-base for Sedalia AAF (later Whiteman Air Force Base) for <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic</b> and training uses. The United States Navy also used the airport as an Outlying Landing Field (OLF) to Naval Air Station Olathe, Kansas where aviators were trained for carrier operations.|$|E
50|$|Junctor Circuits were {{installed}} in similar frames, but were simpler, {{with only two}} relays. They were used only in Line to Line junctors. Large offices, {{in addition to these}} Junctor Circuits, had Intraoffice Trunks, which were of similar design but fit into the same Universal Trunk Frames as interoffice trunks. They carried <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic</b> when the small Junctor Groups of an office with many LN could not cope. Digit transmitters, receivers, other complex service circuits, and some complex trunks including those using E&M signaling, were permanently mounted in relay racks similar to those of 5XB rather than plug-in frames.|$|E

30|$|Traffic is an {{abstract}} concept referring to data flows which are shuttling {{to and from}} in the network, and {{can be described as}} various ways, such as consumed bandwidth. Since every new traffic would be assigned one or more interference-free channels in this paper and each channel denotes a certain value of bandwidth, we can use the number of active channels to represent the amount of traffic. When no enough channels in A(n) are available for node n to communicate, it is called <b>traffic</b> <b>overflowing.</b> If a node occurs <b>traffic</b> <b>overflowing,</b> it {{will not be able to}} assign enough channels for new QoS flows. The traffic prediction scheme is designed to reduce such a situation in this paper. After receiving a QoS routing request, TPQOR protocol would predict the probability of the <b>traffic</b> <b>overflowing</b> in the networks. When a node receives a QoS routing request, the future probability of its <b>traffic</b> <b>overflowing</b> is estimated by the history of its bandwidth use.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{analytical}} modelling multiservice networks with implemented <b>traffic</b> <b>overflow</b> mechanisms. The {{basis for the}} proposed method is a special two-dimensional convolution algorithm that enables determination of the occupancy distribution and the blocking probability in network systems in which traffic streams of individual classes can be serviced by both primary and alternative resources. The algorithm worked out by the authors {{makes it possible to}} model systems with any type of traffic offered to primary resources. In order to estimate the accuracy of the proposed method, the analytical results of blocking probabilities in selected networks with <b>traffic</b> <b>overflow</b> have been compared with simulation data...|$|R
50|$|The {{company which}} owns the Ambassador Bridge {{proposed}} its own twin span with six lanes to be built across the Detroit River. Cost estimates range from one to two billion U.S. dollars to build a second span. The new span would be a cable-stayed bridge and would accommodate {{the bulk of the}} cross-border traffic with the original span being used for <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic.</b> However, a twin span adjacent to the Ambassador Bridge, by itself, does not address Canadian concerns about traffic on Huron Church Road in Windsor. While many of the stop lights commonly cited will be removed by the planned expansion of the 401 which would connect to the downriver NITC bridge, the final approach to the Ambassador Bridge remains on overcrowded Windsor surface streets.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} {{was the site}} of a tavern from at least 1781, when Solomon Aiken was documented to be operating one. His business benefited from the establishment of the Woodstock and Royalton Turnpike, a toll road, in 1800, and he built the main tavern building about 1805 to handle increased business. The Cape was added in 1835 to handle <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic</b> and provide more space for the Aiken family. Notable visitors to the tavern included President James Madison in 1817, and the Marquis de Lafayette in 1824. At its height, the tavern was the center of a small village, with a blacksmith's shop and school. The turnpike declined in importance after the construction of railroads in the state, and the tavern ended as a business in the 1870s. The buildings were used as private residences until the mid-20th century, and were then abandoned. They underwent restoration in the early 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|The {{underlying}} {{principle of}} the five-level hierarchy was to provide economies of scale by establishing direct connections between centralized call [...] "collection points" [...] (essentially the Class 4 offices) where economically feasible, and to provide additional concentration points (Class 1 through 3) to handle <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic</b> {{that could not be}} handled directly, or to handle traffic to locations which {{were less likely to be}} dialed from a given point - usually longer distances and/or smaller locations in other parts of the North American dialing plan. The North American plan differed from those of other continents in the existence of three concentration levels of hierarchy for domestic (here defined as including all those points [...] "within" [...] the dialing plan) calls, a need not required where the larger geographic area was broken into several national plan jurisdictions. However, it is important to note that this was not a strict hierarchy of absolute levels. If enough call traffic existed between geographic areas, for example, a Class 4 office could have direct trunk connections not only to a Class 3 office, but to a Class 2 or Class 1 office, and vice versa. For example, the Class 2 switch in Toronto (TOROON0101T2) had connections not only to the Class 1 switch in Montréal (MTRLPQ0201T1), but to the Class 1 switch in White Plains (WHPLNY0201T1), one of the Class 2 switches in New York City (NYCMNYAA02T2) and a Class 3 switch in Buffalo (BFLONYFR04T3). Network engineers re-worked the system as necessary to balance off call completion percentages with budgetary limitations. In fact, minor changes were made almost every month.|$|E
50|$|The FAC was {{wound down}} in 1998 and Camden was {{transferred}} along with Bankstown, the former Hoxton Park Airport and Kingsford Smith Airport to Sydney Airports Corporation Limited, {{but at this}} stage was still a government controlled enterprise.

30|$|Although path S-E-C-D passes one hop {{less than}} its {{counterpart}} path S-A-B-C-D, its intermediate node E suffers {{a high probability}} of <b>traffic</b> <b>overflow.</b> This makes the path S-E-C-D to have a lower route priority, though it has fewer hops. Therefore, TPQOR changes the pre-hop of node C from E to B in stage 3.|$|R
40|$|Efficient interprocessor {{communication}} {{is a key}} parameter to achieve high performance in distributed memory multicomputer networks. Thus. modelling and analysing message communication latency is critical for optimizing the performance of {{interprocessor communication}}s. To demonstrate how to achieve efficient (low latency) interprocessor communication. we have developed generalized stochastic Petri net (GSPN) routing models for congestion-prone communication patterns occurring in multicomputer networks. Under congestion-prone adjacent and non-adjacent node communication patterns, we use our developed GSPN routing models to {{study the effects of}} congestion (arising due to problems such as buffer <b>overflow</b> and <b>traffic</b> contention) on the message communication latency of multicomputer networks. This modelling has been carried out for mesh multicomputer networks employing the packet switching technique...|$|R

40|$|AbstractÐIn a {{dual band}} {{personal}} communications services (PCS) network, heavy traffic areas {{are covered by}} microcells which overlay macrocells. In such a network, microcells and macrocells utilize different frequency bands. We propose an analytic model to study {{the performance of a}} dual band PCS architecture. Our model assumes that a PCS subscriber has a general residence time distribution in a microcell and the macrocell residence time distribution is derived from the microcell residence time distribution. An iterative algorithm is used to compute the <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic</b> from a microcell to its overlaid macrocell. Then, the call incompletion probability is computed by a macrocell model based on the <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic.</b> Our study indicates that the variance of the microcell residence time distribution and the number of microcells covered by a macrocell have significant effects on the call incompletion probability...|$|E

5000|$|Many {{computer}} security experts have denounced the so-called [...] "anti-worm". Their {{position is that}} no code should be run on a system without the system owner's consent.

They can put a strain on the network as they spread and download updates. Worm code, even if its author has good intentions, can wreak havoc on the network. It can <b>overflow</b> the <b>traffic</b> capacity of the network.

40|$|Abstract-In this paper, {{we present}} an {{approximate}} model (with finite or infinite waiting room) for an integrated service system with {{three types of}} traffic: a first offered narrow-band <b>traffic,</b> an <b>overflow</b> narrow-band <b>traffic</b> and a wide-band traffic. A narrow-band call requires a single server, {{while the number of}} servers required to serve a wide-band call is N. The blocked narrow-band calls are lost while the blocked wide-band calls are delayed in a finite or infinite waiting room. Based on two assumptions with regard to the characteristics of the system, we resolve the system by decomposition. The corresponding improvements in numerical efficiency as well as in computational storage requirements are significant enough to enable use of the model within network optimization algorithms. The model provides a very good approximation for the system performance, that is the blocking probabilities of the two narrowband traffics, the loss probability (in the case of finite waiting room), the probability of nonwaiting and the average waiting time of wide-band traffic.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} into optimal admission control policies for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks (HWN), considering an integration of wireless mesh networks with an overlaying cellular infrastructure. In order {{to characterize the}} <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic</b> from the underlaying mesh to the overlay, a Partially-Observable Markov-Modulated Poisson Process (PO-MMPP) traffic model is developed. This model captures the burstiness of the <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic</b> under the imperfect observability of the mesh network states. Then, by modeling the overlay network as a controlled PO-MMPP/M/C/C queueing system and obtaining structured decision theoretic results, it is shown that the optimal control policies for this class of HWNs {{can be characterized as}} monotonic threshold curves. Further, these results are used to design a computationally efficient algorithm to determine the optimal policy in terms of thresholds. Numerical observations suggest that the proposed algorithm is efficient in terms of time-complexity and can drastically reduce the cost of dropped and blocked calls. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unified {{treatment of the}} mathematical properties of the second-order derivatives of the <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic</b> function from an Erlang loss system, assuming the number of circuits to be a nonnegative real number. It is shown that the <b>overflow</b> <b>traffic</b> function Â(a, x) is strictly convex with respect to x (number of circuits) for x ≥ 0, taking the offered traffic, a, as a positive real parameter. It is also shown that Â(a, x) is a strictly convex function with respect to a, for all (a, x) ∈ ℝ+ × ℝ+. Following a similar process, it is shown that Â(a, x) is a strict submodular function in this domain and that the improvement function introduced by K. O. Moe [11] is strictly increasing in a. Finally, based on some particular cases and numerous numerical results, there is a conjecture that the function Â(a, x) is strictly jointly convex in areas of low blocking where the standard offered traffic is less than - 1. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.
