25|$|The natural {{esterification}} {{that takes}} place in wines and other alcoholic beverages during the aging process is an example of acid-catalysed esterification. Over time, the acidity of the acetic acid and tannins in an aging wine will catalytically protonate other organic acids (including acetic acid itself), encouraging ethanol to react as a nucleophile. As a result, ethyl acetate – the ester of ethanol and acetic acid—is the most abundant ester in wines. Other combinations of organic alcohols (such as phenol-containing compounds) and organic acids lead to a variety of different esters in wines, contributing to their different flavours, smells and tastes. Of course, when compared to sulfuric acid conditions, the acid conditions in a wine are mild, so yield is low (often in tenths or hundredths <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>point</b> by volume) and take years for ester to accumulate.|$|E

Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in the uncertainty of remittance income appears to raise the likelihood of household spending on asset accumulation by approximately 2.2 <b>percentage</b> <b>points</b> (0.017 * 1.3) and the share of household expenditures in this category by approximately 9 percent (0.07 * 1.3), a non-trivial amount 30.|$|R

As a sensitivity check we investigate if reduced payroll taxes affect the likelihood of firm entry and exit, and find some support for a net firm inflow.

The separation value between the two distributions coincides with the threshold current of the IPV algorithm.
