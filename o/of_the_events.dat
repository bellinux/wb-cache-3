5|$|Historiographical {{studies of}} the May Revolution do not face many doubts or unknown details. Most of the {{information}} was properly recorded {{at the time and}} was made available to the public by the Primera Junta as patriotic propaganda. Because of this, historical views on the topic differ in their interpretations of the meanings, causes and consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>events,</b> rather than in the accuracy of their depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> themselves. The modern version of events does not differ significantly from the contemporary one.|$|E
