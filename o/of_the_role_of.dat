5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide an example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates {{in the form of}} glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{built by}} Bishop Gundulf {{in the late}} 12thcentury was {{enclosed}} by a stone wall.

The original gateway was radically altered in the 13th or 14thcentury. From across the River Medway, the twin landmarks of Rochester's castle and cathedral would have dominated the medieval landscape, symbolic of the authority of the church and nobility in the period.

40|$|Contemporary {{research}} into preservice teacher’s perspectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> teachers in <b>the</b> profession {{has been conducted}} by numerous researchers (Auh, 2006; Borg, 2004; Britzman, 2003; Broadbent, 1998; Chong, Low, & Goh, 2011; Louden, 2008; Pajares & Urdan, 2008; Preisman, 2007; Schempp, 1987; Stroud, Smith, Ealy, & Hurst, 2000; Williams & Soares, 2002). Although our western social structures have altered in many ways over recent decades, {{research into}} preservice teacher’s perspectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> teachers in <b>the</b> profession over previous decades can provide unique vantage points from which to consider <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> preservice teacher perspectives <b>of</b> teacher <b>roles.</b> Wright and Tuska (1968) outline their conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> preservice teacher self-perspectives as stages–dream, play and life. In this conceptualization, preservice teachers initially dream of {{what they will do}} as teachers. Preservice teachers then undertake upervised professional experience in schools, allowing them the opportunity to play at being at teacher. Finally, on taking up a teaching position, they live <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> a teacher. <b>The</b> Apprenticeship <b>of</b> Observation conceptualization proposed by Lortie (1975) also provides a basis from which to consider contemporary understandings of preservice teacher’s perspectives. Lortie (1975) proposes that the extended interactions that preservice teachers have had of schools and teachers through their own school attendance can be seen as serving an apprenticeship in teaching. Lortie (1975) contends that preservice teachers arrive at their teacher education programs with pre-existing perspectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> teachers, and that these perspectives impact on preservice teachers as they undertake their studies. This presentation will outline the current conceptual framework and preliminary findings of an ongoing PhD research project being conducted by the presenter.
