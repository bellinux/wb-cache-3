500|$|The Senate {{vetoed the}} text {{submitted}} by the Congress. The veto was proposed by the People's Party, which held {{the majority of the}} seats, and by the Democratic Union of Catalonia, and was approved by 131 [...] "yes" [...] and 119 [...] "no" [...] votes and 2 abstentions. As a result, the text was sent back to the Congress. On 30 June 2005, it was approved by Congress, which, in accordance with the constitutional provisions, overrode the Senate veto. This was achieved with 187 [...] "yes" [...] votes (including a member of the People's Party, Celia Villalobos), 147 [...] "no" [...] votes, and four abstentions. The veto override implied its approval as law. The vote was held after Zapatero unexpectedly took the floor of Parliament to speak in its support, saying We are expanding the opportunities for happiness of <b>our</b> <b>neighbors,</b> our colleagues, our friends and our relatives. At the same time, we are building a more decent society. Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the opposition People's Party, was denied the opportunity to address Parliament after Zapatero's appearance, and accused Zapatero of dividing Spanish society.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of {{the fourth}} season, Collider.com's Kayti Burt opined that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is [...] "the X-Men TV show you should be watching". Burt noted that the X-Men film {{franchise}} was expanding to television with the series Legion, but that S.H.I.E.L.D. already served that purpose well, highlighting {{the similarities between the}} X-Men and the Inhumans, both creations of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby during the 1960s consisting of a large group of super-powered people who [...] "are <b>our</b> <b>neighbors</b> and our friends ... both heroes and villains", and face [...] "the same fears and prejudices" [...] from the wider community. Burt felt that the similarities between S.H.I.E.L.D.s Inhumans and the X-Men became [...] "particularly pointed" [...] in the third season with the Hive storyline, which had a lot in common with the film [...] that was released around the same time; Burt was of the opinion that S.H.I.E.L.D. executed the storyline [...] "much better" [...] than the film did. Other similarities Burt discussed were the series diverse and ensemble cast, its take on the mutant cure storyline, the parallels between Daisy Johnson's second season arc and the introduction of Rogue in the first X-Men film, and its social and political commentary. With the latter, Burt also discussed the similarities between the Watchdogs and Donald Trump, calling it [...] "not very subtle, but social commentary doesn't have to be. I appreciate that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is attempting to comment on the current socio-political state of the country in a way that many of the other superhero TV shows don't even attempt to do. It's perhaps the show's most X-Men-like quality." [...] Concluding, Burt said that though the X-Men characters cannot appear in the MCU due to 20th Century Fox holding the rights, [...] "we still get to enjoy many of the themes prominent in the X-Men universe through S.H.I.E.L.D." ...|$|E

[...] “The equity of this is perfectly clear. For if a good name is more precious than riches, a man, in being robbed of his good name, is no less injured than if he were robbed of his goods; while, in the latter case, false testimony is sometimes not less injurious than rapine committed by the hand.” ...|$|E
