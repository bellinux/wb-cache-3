5|$|Combined Operations {{examined}} {{a number of}} options while planning {{the destruction of the}} dock. At this stage of the war the British government still tried to avoid civilian casualties.

50|$|Surviving POWs, about 1.5 million, repatriated Ostarbeiter, {{and other}} {{displaced}} persons, totally more than 4,000,000 people {{were sent to}} special NKVD filtration camps (not Gulag).

5|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> {{casualties}} in Operation Storm is disputed. The State Attorney's Office of the Republic of Croatia claims that 214 civilians were killed156 in 24 instances {{of war crimes}} and another 47 as victims of murderduring the battle and in its immediate aftermath. The Croatian Helsinki Committee disputes the claim and reports that 677 civilians were killed during the same period. When submitted as evidence, their report {{was rejected by the}} ICTY due to unsourced statements and double entries contained within. Serbian sources quote 1,192 civilians dead or missing. ICTY prosecutors set the number <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> deaths at 324. Croatian government officials estimate that 42 Croatian civilians were killed during the operation.|$|E
40|$|Though ’gender issues’ {{are largely}} {{a part of}} the policy debate in the UN system, there are {{significant}} challenges to materialize efforts to more gender-balanced approaches to peacekeeping and peace-building missions. In practice, gender issues are often separated from other security concerns and/or added ad hoc in training of security sector forces. Instead, the central argument of the report is to understand gender issues as an integral approach to the Protection <b>of</b> <b>Civilians</b> (PoC) framework. This report seeks to identify three core elements of ‘gendering’ the security sector reform approaches in the Democratic republic of Congo. These include (1) the physical protection <b>of</b> <b>civilians,</b> (2) the social protection <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> and (3) the legal protection <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> in the DRC.

5|$|Throughout the 1950s, Bainbridge {{remained}} an outspoken proponent <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> control {{of nuclear power}} and the abandonment of nuclear testing.

5|$|After World War I, {{and with}} another European war looming, {{leaders from the}} {{historic}} peace churches met to strategize about how {{to cooperate with the}} government to avoid the difficulties of World War I.

The U.S. Army's introduction of aviation to Ford Island triggered expansion throughout Hawaii with the development <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> airports, {{the creation of the}} Hawaii chapter of the National Aeronautic Association, and a national flying code. The army's aviation division was generally favorably received by the Hawaiians, who took the military's investment in their land as a compliment.|$|E
5|$|Although Gibraltar's {{civilian}} inhabitants {{had started}} to return as early as April 1944, the last evacuees did not arrive back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after VJ Day {{was a lack of}} shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> housing. The garrison was relocated to {{the southern end of the}} peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.|$|E
5|$|Cadet nurses {{came from}} across the nation and from all backgrounds.

Attrition rates for cadets were {{comparable}} to those reported for other nursing schools in the same period. The corps was the largest of the federal nurse-training programs, and allowed young women to serve their country in uniform and without discrimination. The American Hospital Association credited the cadet student nurses with helping to prevent the collapse <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> nursing during the war.|$|E
