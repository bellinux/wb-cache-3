50|$|Although {{the mail}} sorting machine was {{eventually}} broken up for scrap, it was highly influential outside of Canada. Lewis' original suggestion that {{some sort of}} invisible or see-through ink be used to store routing information on the front face of the letters is now practically universal, as is the basic workflow of the address being converted to bar code form as soon as possible by typists and then sent into automated machinery for actual sorting. Use of bar-coded ZIP codes printed directly at the sending point when using postage meters became mandatory in the U.S. in 1973. During the 1960s the use of <b>optical</b> <b>character</b> <b>readers</b> replaced typists for letters with typewritten addresses, and in the 1990s, handwritten ones as well.|$|R

50|$|Optical {{character}} recognition (also <b>optical</b> <b>character</b> <b>reader,</b> OCR) is the mechanical or electronic conversion {{of images of}} typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, {{a photo of a}} document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example from a television broadcast). It is widely used as a form of information entry from printed paper data records, whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerised receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation. It is a common method of digitising printed texts {{so that they can be}} electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key data and text mining.

50|$|Remote Bar Coding System (RBCS), {{also called}} Remote Video Encoding (RVE) {{is a method}} used by the United States Postal Service to encode the address of letter-sized mailpieces that are not decipherable by a Multiline <b>Optical</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Reader</b> (MLOCR). When an MLOCR does not {{recognize}} a valid address on a letter, (usually due to hand-written addressing) it sends {{an image of the}} mailpiece to a central RBCS (RVE) site where more sophisticated optical character recognition software is able to interpret many hand-written addresses using neural net and fuzzy logic algorithms. If this does not succeed, human operators visually examine the image and enter the address. In both cases, the data is sent back to the originating mail facility where mailpieces are then automatically matched back up with data {{through the use of a}} unique fluorescent barcode printed on the back during initial MLOCR attempt, and receive a POSTNET barcode representing the full address.|$|E

The tilt in characters contributes a major share in affecting {{the efficiency of the}} recognition algorithms. This paper presents a technique to estimate and correct the vertical tilt in printed characters of English in order to make an OCR to read the text more efficiently. The input characters are assumed to be segmented from the document image and free from noise. Initially, the direction of tilt of the characters is detected using a heuristically constructed knowledgebase. Next, the inclination of the character to its base is estimated using line drawing algorithm. Finally, the estimated tilt is corrected through rotation in counter direction of the tilt. The method has been tested with sufficient samples and readability analysis is performed with an OCR. Experimental results show an average improvement in readability by OCR from 20 % before tilt correction to 82 % after the tilt correction...|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, the U.S. Postal Service {{introduced}} an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP+4, often called [...] "plus-four codes", [...] "add-on codes", or [...] "add ons".A ZIP+4 Code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional digits {{to identify a}} geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area, such as a city block, a group of apartments, an individual high-volume receiver of mail or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery. But initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus-four code is not required. In general, mail is read by a multiline <b>optical</b> <b>character</b> <b>reader</b> (MLOCR) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP+4 Code from the address—along with the even more specific delivery point—and sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode (IM) {{on the face of}} the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits—nine for the ZIP+4 Code and two for the delivery point.|$|E
5000|$|Proper Placement: The Delivery Address {{should be}} {{left-justified}} and located roughly {{in the center}} of mailpiece's largest side. More precisely, on a letter-size piece, the recommended address placement is within the <b>optical</b> <b>character</b> <b>reader</b> (OCR) read area, which is a space on the address side of the mailpiece defined by these boundaries: Left - 1/2 inch (13 mm) from the left edge of the piece; Right - 1/2 inch (13 mm) from the right edge of the piece; Top - 2-3/4 inches (70 mm) from the bottom edge of the piece; Bottom - 5/8 inch (16 mm) from the bottom edge of the piece. Preferred placement of a return address is in the upper left portion of the mailpiece—on the side of the piece bearing postage. Finally, postage (e.g., stamps, meter imprints, information-based indicia IBI, etc.) is to be affixed in the upper right corner of the address side of the mail cover. It should be noted that any stamp/indicia partly concealed or otherwise obscured by an overlapping stamp/indicia may not be counted as valid postage.|$|E

Text Categorization may be the remedy of increased need for advanced techniques. Text Categorization is the classi cation of units of natural language texts with respect to a set of pre-existing categories. Categorization of documents is challenging, as the number of discriminating words can be very large. This thesis presents compilation of a Turkish dataset, called Anadolu Agency Newsgroup in order to study in Text Categorization. Turkish is an agglutinative languages in which words contain no direct indication where the morpheme boundaries are, furthermore, morphemes take a shape dependent on the morphological and phonological context. In Turkish, the process of adding one suÆx to another can result in a relatively long word, furthermore, a single Turkish word can give rise to {{a very large number of}} variants. Due to this complex morphological structure, Turkish requires text processing techniques di erent than English and similar languages. Therefore, besides converting all words to lower case and removing punctuation marks, some preliminary work is required such as stemming, removal of stopwords and formation of a keyword list. This thesis also presents the evaluation and comparison of the well-known k-NN classi cation algorithm and a variant of the k-NN, called Feature Projection Text Categorization (FPTC) algorithm. The k-NN classi er is an instance based learning method. It computes the similarity between the test instance and training instance, and considering the k top-ranking nearest instances to predict the categories of the input, nds out the category that is most similar. FPTC algorithm is based on the idea of representing training instances as their pro jections on each feature dimension. If the value of a training instance is missing for a feature, that instance is not stored on that feature. Experiments show that the FPTC algorithm achieves comparable accuracy with the k-NN algorithm, furthermore, the time eÆciency of FPTC outperforms the k-NN signi cantlyİlhan, UfukM. S...|$|R
