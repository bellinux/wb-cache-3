5|$|In August 1999, <b>our</b> <b>mother</b> {{had died}} of cancer in tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When <b>our</b> <b>mother</b> died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} into Lackawanna County, PA106 {{continues on}} a southeastern trend, crossing through homes {{before returning to}} the deep forestry in Greenfield Township. The route continues further, passing through a lumber yard, where it turns southward and further southeastward into the community of Finch Hill. In Finch Hill, PA106 passes <b>Our</b> <b>Mother</b> of Sorrows Cemetery and intersects with PA247 (Lakeland Drive) {{in the center of the}} town. After PA247, PA106 passes through a small residential district before reaching the Homestead Golf Course. The route passes along the southern side of the golf course and turns eastward after passing to the north of Merli-Sarnoski Park.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example is}} <b>Our</b> <b>Mother</b> of Perpetual Help. Catholics have, for centuries, prayed before this icon, usually in reproductions, to intercede {{on their behalf}} to Christ. Over the centuries, several churches {{dedicated}} to <b>Our</b> <b>Mother</b> of Perpetual Help have been constructed. Pope John Paul II held mass at the National Shrine of <b>Our</b> <b>Mother</b> of Perpetual Help in the Philippines where the devotion is very popular and many Catholic churches hold a Novena and Mass honoring it every Wednesday using {{a replica of the}} icon, which is also widely displayed in houses, buses and public transport in the Philippines. Devotions to the icon have spread from the Philippines to the United States, and remain popular among Asian-Americans in California. As recently as 1992, the song The Lady Who Wears Blue and Gold was composed in California and then performed at St. Alphonsus Liguori Church in Rome, where the icon resides. This illustrates how a medieval work of art can give rise to feast days, Cathedrals and Marian music.|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} {{transept}} stands {{a statue of}} <b>Our</b> <b>Mother</b> of Good Counsel in a niche topped by a pediment and flanked by two pilasters – each pilaster on a pedestal {{on either side of}} it. The north transept is where the Baptistery is located. The statue of <b>Our</b> <b>Mother</b> of Good Counsel and the stained-glass window over the door hints to its previous designation as the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary. On the walls are memorial plaques to early personalities of the church, notably, John Connolly and Bishop Michel-Esther Le Turdu. The relics of Saint Laurent-Marie-Joseph Imbert can be found enshrined in the wall at {{the right side of the}} door.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s a {{group of}} Louisiana Creole people {{attended}} the Hispanic Our Lady of Guadalupe Church because OLG was the closest church to the Frenchtown area of the Fifth Ward. Because the OLG church treated the Creole people in a discriminatory manner, by forcing them to confess and take communion after people of other races did so and after forcing them to take the back pews, the Creoles opted {{to build their own}} church. The <b>Our</b> <b>Mother</b> of Mercy Catholic Church in the Fifth Ward, Houston's second black Catholic church, was officially founded in June 1929.|$|E

25|$|Pius was a Marian pope, {{who in his}} {{encyclical}} Ubi primum described Mary as a Mediatrix of salvation. In 1854, he promulgated the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, articulating a long-held Catholic {{belief that}} Mary, the Mother of God, was conceived without original sin. He conferred the title <b>Our</b> <b>Mother</b> of Perpetual Help on a famous Byzantine icon from Crete entrusted to the Redemptorists. In 1862, he convened 300 bishops to the Vatican for the canonization of Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan. His 1864 Syllabus of Errors stands as a strong condemnation against liberalism, modernism, moral relativism, and secularization. Perhaps his most important legacy is the First Vatican Council, which convened in 1869, which defined the dogma of papal infallibility, but was interrupted as Italian nationalist troops threatened Rome. The council is considered to have contributed to a centralization of the Church in the Vatican.|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, girls' {{schools were}} still closed. In solidarity, private schools for boys {{had decided not}} to open until 9 February, and notices {{appeared}} saying so. On 7 February, Yousafzai and her brother returned to their hometown of Mingora, where the streets were deserted, and there was an [...] "eerie silence". [...] "We went to the supermarket to buy a gift for <b>our</b> <b>mother</b> but it was closed, whereas earlier it used to remain open till late. Many other shops were also closed", she wrote in her blog. Their home had been robbed and their television was stolen.|$|E
500|$|Sellers's {{behaviour}} {{towards his}} family worsened in 1962; {{according to his}} son Michael, Sellers asked him and his sister Sarah [...] "who we love more, <b>our</b> <b>mother</b> or him.

At the end of 1962, his marriage to Anne broke down. In 1963, Sellers starred as gang leader [...] "Pearly Gates" [...] in Cliff Owen's The Wrong Arm of the Law, followed by his portrayal of a vicar in Heavens Above! ...|$|E

500|$|The former {{president}} {{was quoted in}} 1957 as saying to then-House Majority Leader John McCormack, [...] "Had {{it not been for}} the fact that I was able to sell some property that my brother, sister, and I inherited from <b>our</b> <b>mother,</b> I would practically be on relief, but with the sale of that property I am not financially embarrassed." [...] The following year, Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each {{former president}}, and it is likely that Truman's financial status played a role in the law's enactment. The one other living former president at the time, Herbert Hoover, also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman.|$|E
500|$|Her {{opponent}} Scott Brown {{speculated that}} she had fabricated a native ancestry to gain an advantage in the employment market; the Brown campaign used Warren's lineage in several attack ads. In response, Warren's brothers issued a joint statement stating that they [...] "grew up listening to <b>our</b> <b>mother</b> and grandmother and other relatives talk about our family's Cherokee and Delaware heritage". Brian Leiter of the Chicago Law School dismissed the allegations against Warren, noting that law schools have [...] "no pressure to hire Native Americans for affirmative action reasons", and that Warren's record of scholarship was [...] "clearly sufficient to get her appointed at Harvard". Several Brown staffers mocked Warren by doing the [...] "tomahawk chop" [...] at a Brown campaign rally, which Brown {{said he did not}} condone.|$|E
