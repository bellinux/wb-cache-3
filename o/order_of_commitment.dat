50|$|Commitment {{ordering}} (CO) is a {{class of}} interoperable serializability techniques in concurrency control of databases, transaction processing, and related applications. It allows optimistic (non-blocking) implementations. With the proliferation of multi-core processors, CO has been also increasingly utilized in concurrent programming, transactional memory, and especially in software transactional memory (STM) for achieving serializability optimistically. CO is also {{the name of the}} resulting transaction schedule (history) property, which was originally defined in 1988 with the name dynamic atomicity. In a CO compliant schedule the chronological <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> events of transactions is compatible with the precedence order of the respective transactions. CO is a broad special case of conflict serializability, and effective means (reliable, high-performance, distributed, and scalable) to achieve global serializability (modular serializability) across any collection of database systems that possibly use different concurrency control mechanisms (CO also makes each system serializability compliant, if not already).|$|E

The higher <b>order</b> category <b>of</b> consensual <b>commitment</b> explained effective decision-making. At the meso-level of leadership modeling, organizational design influenced both leadership style and decision-making. Specifically, an organizational design that generated lateral job roles and a relational leadership orientation was found to enhance consensual commitment, and provided a level of assurance against dysfunctional team dynamics. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Although {{originally}} envisioned as {{a permanent}} component of federal tax law, the investment tax credit (ITC) has been far from immutable. Initially codified in 1962, the credit was suspended during 1966 and reinstated the following year; it was repealed in 1969 and reincarnated during 1971; a rate increase (seven to ten percent) was enacted in 1975 and further magnified with the shortened depreciable lives of 1981; and most recently, the ITC was repealed {{for a second time}} as part of the massive Tax Reform Act of 1986. Unquestionably, Congress discerns some macro-economic benefit from recurring modifications to this tax policy. ^ The foundation for this Congressional conviction rests, first and foremost, upon effectiveness of the various policy choices [...] ineffective policy can not be constructive. To investigate the effectiveness issue, this experiment undertook univariate Box-Jenkins time-series intervention analyses for three of the federal tax policy alternatives surrounding the ITC: enactment (1962, 1971), rate increase (1975, 1981), and repeal (1969, 1986). The investigation focused on the relationship between the ITC and investments in fixed assets via consideration <b>of</b> monthly <b>order</b> data obtained from the United States Department of Commerce and Bureau of the Census. Two acquisition time-series were assessed at the effective month for each policy variation. The first <b>order</b> series consisted <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> for assets qualifying for the ITC; the second <b>order</b> series consisted <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> for assets not qualifying for the ITC. Dichotomous groups facilitated examination of the subject relationship while affording a limited degree of control over exogenous economic and tax variables. ^ The findings of this study support positive effects for the enactments (1962, 1971) and for the actual rate increase (1975); negative effects are attested for the repeals (1969, 1986). No support was manifested for a positive effect concomitant with codification of the Accelerated Cost Recovery System of depreciation (1981). It was concluded, therefore: Ceteris paribus, tax policy respecting the ITC has been efficacious in modifying targeted investment behavior. ...|$|R
