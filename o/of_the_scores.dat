25|$|The bulk of Buxtehude's oeuvre {{consists}} of vocal music, which covers {{a wide variety}} of styles, and organ works, which concentrate mostly on chorale settings and large-scale sectional forms. Chamber music constitutes a minor part of the surviving output, although the only chamber works Buxtehude published during his lifetime were fourteen chamber sonatas. Unfortunately, many of Buxtehude's compositions have been lost. The librettos for his oratorios, for example, survive; but none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> do, which is particularly unfortunate, because his German oratorios seem to be the model for later works by Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Philipp Telemann.

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of amusia requires individuals to detect out-of-key notes in conventional but unfamiliar melodies. A behavioral failure on {{this test is}} diagnostic because there is typically no overlap between the distributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> of amusics and controls. Such scores are generally obtained through the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA), which involves {{a series of tests}} that evaluate the use of musical characteristics known to contribute to the memory and perception of conventional music. The battery comprises six subtests which assess the ability to discriminate pitch contour, musical scales, pitch intervals, rhythm, meter, and memory. An individual is considered amusic if he/she performs two standard deviations below the mean obtained by musically-competent controls. This musical pitch disorder represents a phenotype that serves to identify the associated neuro-genetic factors. Both MRI-based brain structural analyses and electroencephalography (EEG) are common methods employed to uncover brain anomalies associated with amusia (See Neuroanatomy). Additionally, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is used to detect anatomical differences between the MRIs of amusic brains and musically intact brains, specifically with respect increased and/or decreased amounts of white and grey matter.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{the seeds}} of the Niu–Li {{factional}} strife were seen to have been sown in 808, when Emperor Xianzong held a special imperial examination for the examinees to give honest criticism of government. The officials in charge of the examination, Wei Guanzhi and Yang Yuling (楊於陵), selected three examinees who gave blunt criticism—Niu Sengru, Huangfu Shi (皇甫湜), and Li Zongmin—for top marks. However, Chancellor Li Jifu was stung by the criticism they provided and viewed it as a personal attack against him. Li Jifu tearfully complained to Emperor Xianzong that the reviewers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> that Wei and Yang gave the imperial scholars - Pei Ji and Wang Ya — had conflicts of interest, as Huangfu was Wang's nephew. As a result of his accusations, Pei, Wang, Yang, and Wei were each demoted, with Wei initially demoted to be the prefect of Guo Prefecture (果州, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan), and then further moved to be the prefect of Ba Prefecture (巴州, in modern Bazhong, Sichuan). Niu, Huangfu, and Li Zongmin were not exiled, but were said in the Zizhi Tongjian to be effectively stalled in their careers, forcing them to find governmental positions themselves under regional governors. Despite this, Li Jifu's son Li Deyu viewed the insult on his father to be too great to bear, and thereafter an enmity developed between Li Deyu and those he viewed as having criticized his father unfairly.|$|E

[...] After World War I, he supervised a series of complete recordings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> of the operas on the HMV label, beginning with The Mikado in 1918. [...] The first nine sets, made between 1918 and 1925, were recorded by the early acoustic process.

[...] With the introduction of electrical recording and its greatly improved recording process and sound, a new round of recordings began in 1927. [...] For the electrical series, Carte's own singers were mostly used. [...] Carte also recognised the potential of radio and worked with the BBC to relay live broadcasts of D'Oyly Carte productions. [...] A 1926 relay of part of a Savoy Theatre performance of The Mikado was heard by up to eight million people. [...] The London Evening Standard noted that this was [...] "probably the largest audience that has ever heard anything at one {{time in the history of}} the world."

500|$|Two {{projects}} helped Rimsky-Korsakov {{focus on}} less academic music-making. The {{first was the}} creation of two folk song collections in 1874. Rimsky-Korsakov transcribed 40 Russian songs for voice and piano from performances by folk singer Tvorty Filippov, who approached him at Balakirev's suggestion. This collection was followed by a second containing 100 songs, supplied by friends and servants, or taken from rare and out-of-print collections. Rimsky-Korsakov later credited this work as a great influence on him as a composer; it also supplied a vast amount of musical material from which he could draw for future projects, either by direct quotation or as models for composing fakeloric passages. The second project was the editing of orchestral scores by pioneer Russian composer Mikhail Glinka (1804–1857) in collaboration with Balakirev and Anatoly Lyadov. Glinka's sister, Lyudmila Ivanovna Shestakova, wanted to preserve her brother's musical legacy in print, and paid the costs of the project from her own pocket. No similar project had been attempted before in Russian music, and guidelines for scholarly musical editing had to be established and agreed. While Balakirev favored making changes in Glinka's music to [...] "correct" [...] what he saw as compositional flaws, Rimsky-Korsakov favored a less intrusive approach. Eventually, Rimsky-Korsakov prevailed. [...] "Work on Glinka's scores was an unexpected schooling for me", he later wrote. [...] "Even before this I had known and worshipped his operas; but as editor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> in print I had to go through Glinka's style and instrumentation to their last little note... And this was a beneficent discipline for me, leading me as it did to the path of modern music, after my vicissitudes with counterpoint and strict style".|$|E
