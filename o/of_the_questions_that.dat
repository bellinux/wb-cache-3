25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} early Jewish philosophers influenced by Islamic philosophy is Rav Saadia Gaon (892–942). His most important work is Emunoth ve-Deoth (Book of Beliefs and Opinions). In this work Saadia treats <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> interested the Mutakallimun so deeply—such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc.—and he criticizes the philosophers severely.|$|E

Lorie Van Auken, one of the Jersey Girls, estimates that only 30% of their questions were answered in the final 9/11 Commission Report, published July 22, 2004.|$|E
25|$|During the yarchei kallah, the gaon laid {{before the}} {{assembly}} a number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> {{had been sent}} in during the year {{from all parts of}} the Diaspora. The requisite answers were discussed, and were finally recorded by the secretary of the academy according to the directions of the gaon. At the end of the yarchei kallah the questions, together with the answers, were read to the assembly, and the answers were signed by the gaon. A large number of the geonic responsa originated in this way; but many of them were written by the respective Geonim without consulting the kallah assemblies convened in the spring.|$|E
25|$|Searle's thought {{experiment}} {{begins with}} this hypothetical premise: suppose that artificial intelligence research {{has succeeded in}} constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands Chinese. It takes Chinese characters as input and, by following the instructions of a computer program, produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.|$|E

25|$|Star {{grew up in}} a rural {{working class}} area of Rhode Island. Starved for {{philosophy}} she befriended an ex-nun during high school and eventually obtained a scholarship to Radcliffe College where she began taking philosophy classes. Not fitting in and deterred from taking a Religion degree, Star dropped out, married and moved to Venezuela where she co-founded an organic commune. It was here that Star asked many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> formed the basis of her research. Her work is guided by interests in both technology and feminism, and it was during this time that the women's movement and Kate Millett's Sexual Politics inspired her to ask questions about technology, and the effects that both good and bad technology have on oneself and on the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{interest}} in synesthesia {{is at least}} as old as Greek philosophy. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> the classic philosophers asked was if color (chroia, what we now call timbre) of music was a physical quality that could be quantified (Campen 2007, Gage 1994, Ferwerda & Struycken 2001, Jewanski 1999). The first known experiment to test correspondences between sound and color was conducted by the Milanese artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century. He consulted with a musician at the court of Rudolph II in Prague to create a new experiment that sought to show the colors that accompany music. He decided to place different colored strips of painted paper on the gravicembalo, a keyboard instrument (Gage, 1994). He was also an artist who created strange portraits from unusual objects, such as Four Seasons in One Head. The problem of finding a mathematical system to explain the connection between music and color has both inspired and frustrated artists and scientists throughout the ages. The seventeenth-century physicist Isaac Newton tried to solve the problem by assuming that musical tones and color tones have frequencies in common. He attempted to link sound oscillations to respective light waves. According to Newton, the distribution of white light in a spectrum of colors is analogous to the musical distribution of tones in an octave. So, he identified seven discrete light entities, that he then matched to the seven discrete notes of an octave (Campen 2007, Peacock 1988).|$|E
500|$|Wieman's words proved prophetic. [...] Though Process and Reality {{has been}} called [...] "arguably the most {{impressive}} single metaphysical text of the twentieth century," [...] it has been little-read and little-understood, partly because it demands – as Isabelle Stengers puts it – [...] "that its readers accept the adventure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> will separate them from every consensus." [...] Whitehead questioned western philosophy's most dearly held assumptions about how the universe works, but in doing so he managed to anticipate a number of 21st century scientific and philosophical problems and provide novel solutions.|$|E

500|$|The season's {{exploring}} of supernatural {{and mystical}} concepts ties-in {{with the release}} of Doctor Strange, the first MCU film to explore magic. In addition to the Darkhold, this includes the introduction of Ghost Rider, with Whedon explaining in July 2016, that [...] "the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters [...] We felt that [...] was obviously a great character that we’d love to have on our show that we feel fits with that shift." [...] Whedon pointed out that the previous tie-ins were sometimes [...] "very direct", and other times [...] "more thematic. The tie this year will feel more of a reflection of , less an interweaving plot." [...] He added, [...] "Hopefully some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> we’re asking will be answered by [...] then pose some new themes and ideas for us to explore." [...] "Deals with Our Devils", aired after the release of Doctor Strange, sees Aida create a portal to rescue Coulson and Fitz from another dimension. The visuals for these are intentionally reminiscent of those used in the film. Bell added that the Darkhold [...] "feels like it belongs in the library in Kathmandu", referring to the Kamar-Taj library seen in Doctor Strange.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps {{rated the}} episode an A-, finding it [...] "almost like an {{extension}} of the pilot". Phipps felt the scene featuring Mulder's kidnapping to be [...] "one of the scariest moments from the series' early days, as much for what it suggests as for what it shows". Writing for website Den of Geek, Matt Haigh reviewed the episode positively, praising its decision not to answer all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> it asks. Haigh noted that [...] "the fact that we are left as clueless about what really happened as Mulder and Scully only enhances the viewing experience", finding such mystery to be [...] "a rare thing indeed" [...] on network television. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, finding it to be [...] "much more confident in its pacing and tone" [...] than the previous episode. Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode was [...] "a skilfully scripted story of cover-up and paranoia", and noted that [...] "it sets up the overall themes of the show so well, it almost seems like a primer".|$|E

2500|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> many viewers {{said they}} {{considered}} irrelevant when measured against the faltering economy or the Iraq war, like why Senator Barack Obama did not wear an American flag pin on his lapel, the incendiary comments of Obama’s former pastor, or Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s assertion {{that she had}} to duck sniper fire in Bosnia more than a decade ago. The questions from the moderators were considered to be focused on campaign gaffes and training most of their ammunition on Obama, to which Stephanopoulos responded by saying that [...] "Senator Obama [...] the front-runner" [...] and the questions were [...] "not inappropriate or irrelevant at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|The couplet sums {{up with a}} {{potential}} answer to all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> the author was posing throughout the entire sonnet. He says, [...] "thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee" [...] in {{the first line of}} the couplet. This is suggesting that the young man has valuable attraction that is not being used properly or appreciated. It seems as if the speaker is insinuating that the beauty will die with the young man. The last line of the couplet says, [...] "which usèd, lives th'executor to be." [...] Here {{it seems as if the}} speaker is saying that if the young man uses his beauty, then it will prolong his life. The word [...] "executor" [...] hints at both death and accounting.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 16th century Livorno - Leghorn - in Tuscany became an English Navy base for patrolling {{shipping}} routes in the Mediterranean Sea, thereby attracting a large English {{community to the}} city. According to Villani, [...] "The history of the British Factory of Leghorn is also {{the history of the}} conflicts that its members had with the Tuscan authorities to assert their right to live openly their religious beliefs. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> for a long time poisoned the relationships between the English and Tuscans in those years was the attempt made by the British Factory to obtain permission to celebrate Protestant religious services for its members. The religious authorities were against any concession — not because they were afraid of a possible Protestant proselytism, but because they feared the emergence of a spontaneous doctrine of tolerance among the Catholics." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1917, Lloyd George felt able {{to assert}} {{authority}} over the generals {{and at the end}} of the year was able to sack the First Sea Lord Admiral Jellicoe. Over the objections of Haig and Robertson, an inter-Allied Supreme War Council was set up. En route to a meeting in Paris to discuss this (1 November), Lloyd George told Wilson, Smuts and Hankey that he was toying with the idea of sending Haig to command the British and French forces in Italy. At the meeting (4 November), Lloyd George accused Haig of encouraging press attacks on him. Haig was making similar complaints about Lloyd George, whom he privately compared to the Germans accusing the Allies of atrocities, of which they were guilty. Haig volunteered to write to J. A. Spender, pro-Asquith editor of the Westminster Gazette but Lloyd George begged him not to. Haig wrote [...] "I gave LG a good talking-to on several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> he raised, and felt I got the best of the arguments", a view which does not reflect the later reputations of Haig and Lloyd George.|$|E
