50|$|Using the Federal Serum Therapy Institute as technical-scientific base, he {{embarked}} {{in quick}} succession of important sanitation campaigns. His first challenge {{was a series of}} yellow fever endemics, which had earned Rio de Janeiro the sinister reputation of 'Foreigners' Grave'. Between 1897 and 1906, 4,000 European immigrants had died there from the disease. Cruz pursued the new technique of eradicating mosquitoes and their breeding grounds, fumigating houses, and isolation of the ill. There was opposition to the campaign by many, including physicians, the military, and the poor, but the campaign was successful. Cruz was initially successful in the sanitary campaign against the bubonic plague, to which end he used <b>obligatory</b> <b>notification</b> of cases, isolation of sick people, treatment with the sera produced at Manguinhos and extermination of the rats populating the city.|$|E
40|$|The {{program of}} {{schistosomiasis}} {{control for the}} State of São Paulo, where only low endemicity areas occur, is discussed in this paper. Inclusion of schistosomiasis among the diseases due to <b>obligatory</b> <b>notification</b> is considered {{as a measure of}} great importance. Accordingly the search for passive cases conducted by the public health system acquired major importance in the disease surveillance. As from 1981 to 1992 only 11 % of the detected cases were considered as autochthonous. The main transmission areas are located at the Litoral and Paraiba Valley regions. In the period of time under analysis, the epidemiological surveillance data suggest a decrease in the morbidity and in the autochthony tendency in the State of São Paulo...|$|E
40|$|The Health and Education Councils of the Junta de Castilla y León collaborated in {{developing}} a strategy apt to determine {{the impact of the}} pandemic influenza, occurred in 2009, and to identify preventive measures and information in the educational area. Methods : The development of a Prevention and Action Strategy against the Impact of Influenza A in the Educational Service of Castilla y León is detailed. Absences were monitored in pre-, primary and secondary schools of Castilla y León. Absenteeism data were analyzed and related with the flu cases reported by the System of Diseases of <b>Obligatory</b> <b>Notification</b> (DON). The studied outbreaks and the actions taken are described [...] Results: During the studied weeks the average weekly rate of truancy in Castilla and Leon was 5. 17...|$|E
40|$|The Italian Regional administration, {{after the}} full {{accomplishment}} of the Regional legal order (1970), was, {{by the political}} choice, excluded from all the forms of participation in international activities, also {{in the domain of}} their competence. To get round the problem, however, the Regional administration has launched series of reports with analogous institutions of other states or even with states themselves. The agreements signed in that way, unfortunately, have given place to a strong legal argument with the central government. In this situation, the Constitutional Tribunal, in the well-known sentence n. 179 / 1987, on one hand, has confirmed the prerogative of the State power to conclude international agreements also in the domain of Regional competence; on the other hand, however, has implemented the regional activities of pure international importance, on the condition that it had obtained the Government assent. In the consequence of the above mentioned implementation, the problem was confined to the procedures able to avoid the violation of this limits by the regional administration. In this way, the decree of the president of Italian Republic from 31 th march 1994 was formed. It distinguished the “promotional” activities from the ones of “pure international importance” and regulated the formalities of an obligatory assent of the Government. With the reform of Title V of {{the second part of the}} Constitution (2001), it was stipulated that “in the field of its competence the Region can sign contracts with countries and agreements with territorial units within a country in cases and forms regulated by the Sate power” (art. 117, clause 9). The Regional administration, therefore, is being recognised as a external power. The law of the accomplishment (n. 131 / 2003), however, has reorganised this power both by levelling the agreements to activities of pure international significance (with the <b>obligatory</b> prior Government <b>notification)</b> and, in case of agreements with other States, by stipulating the government prior assignment of full powers. The main problem is, therefore, the application of Principle of one-way loyal collaboration, as the sentence n. 131 is a complex of procedural and substantial obligations which only the Region is responsible for. For that reason, the Constitutional Tribunal has stepped in to partially temper the excessive legal restrictions; in the sentence n. 238 / 2004, in fact, it is established that the ‘new’ external power of the regions has to be coordinated with the competence of the State, in the way that it does not modify the Regions' autonomy guaranteed by the Constitution. In consequence, the Constitutional Tribunal has established that, if the Government applies the procedures of the sentence n. 131 in an arbitrary manner, the Regions will be allowed to appeal to principle of the conflict of powers...|$|R
40|$|Before general {{application}} of a primary prevention program its efficacy has to be demonstrated. For this purpose a randomized controlled trial with active or passive follow-up may be conducted. In the last 5 years, the ratio of controlled trials with passive versus those with active follow-up was 1 : 13. However, under certain circumstances a passive follow-up may be more appropriate and useful to overcome the drawbacks of an active follow-up, as e. g. high costs and many drop-outs. In a randomized controlled trial, a passive follow-up {{is based on the}} reporting of cases by physicians or hospitals instead of actively following up all study participants individually. The statistical evaluation can be carried out using a one-sample chi 2 -test. Advantages and limitations are discussed. A passive follow-up may be advantageous in situations with low incidence, large number of participants, complete ascertainment of conditions with <b>obligatory</b> <b>notification</b> or effective disease registries and should be preferred in such a context...|$|E
40|$|Consolidation {{of data on}} {{meningococcal}} disease surveillance for {{the state}} of Santa Catarina, Brazil, has provided new insight about the evolution of this disease during the period of 1971 - 2000. A descriptive epidemiological study, based on retrospective analysis of all cases of meningococcal disease notified in the state of Santa Catarina, linked the surveillance data from the Secretary of the State of Health, magnetic tape records and the data from the national surveillance of diseases of <b>obligatory</b> <b>notification.</b> Following World Health Organization guidelines, cumulative incidence exceeding five cases per 100, 000 inhabitants was considered indicative of an epidemic. Official population data from the Fundação Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística were used for the incidence denominator. During the 1971 - 2000 period, 7, 893 cases and 1, 354 deaths caused by meningococcal disease were reported. This corresponds to a mean of 263 cases and 45 deaths per year, with a mean incidence of 6. 4 cases per 100, 000 inhabitants and a fatality rate of 17. 2 %. Three distinct epidemiological periods were identified, two of which can be considered epidemic. Two of three distinct epidemiological periods were characterized by an epidemic of meningococcal disease, covering 20 of the 30 years analyzed. Identification of the epidemics and preventive actions, such as vaccination and health education, contributed to the reduction of morbidity and mortality due to this disease...|$|E
40|$|Background. In Colombia, {{maternal}} {{near miss}} morbidity is monitored {{in the health}} surveillance system. The National Health Institute included a special report on cases that met three or more World Health Organization criteria according to the World Health Organization criteria. Objective. To estimate the relationship between variables related to opportune {{access to health care}} services in Colombia during 2013 depending on inclusion criteria -three or more- for maternal near miss morbidity. Materials and methods. A cross-sectional analysis of the national registry of <b>obligatory</b> <b>notification</b> on maternal near miss morbidity was performed. Cases with three or more criteria were compared with those with one or two according to some variables related to the timely access of health care services. Results. A total of 8 434 maternal near miss morbidity cases were reported, women were aged between 12 and 51 years old (M= 26. 4, SD= 7. 5). 961 (11. 4 %) lived in remote rural areas; 4 537 (53. 8 %) were uninsured under the health system, or they were affiliated to either the subsidized or special health care regime; 845 (10. 0 %) belonged to an ethnic minority; 3 696 (44. 4 %) were referred to a more complex service; 4 097 (49. 2 %) were admitted to the intensive care unit; and 3 975 (47. 1 %) met three or more of the inclusion criteria for maternal near miss morbidity. They were combined to meet three or more of the case inclusion criteria: intensive care unit admission (OR= 5. 58; IC 95 % 5. 06 - 6. 15); being uninsured or affiliated to the subsidized or special regime (OR= 1. 57; IC 95 % 1. 42 - 1. 74); and referral to a more complex service (OR= 1. 18; IC 95 % 1. 07 - 1. 31). Conclusions. In Colombia, the timely access of health care services is related to maternal near miss morbidity with three or more inclusion criteria...|$|E
