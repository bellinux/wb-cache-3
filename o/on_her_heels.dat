25|$|For introduction, {{the woman}} is to sit down, so to say, <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> with her legs spread apart, which will bring the womb down as low as possible. Then taking the womb veil into the right hand with the cavity looking upward and {{compressed}} from side to side, giving it thus {{the shape of an}} ellipse, she has to push it up the vagina as far as it will go. It will then spread out of its own accord and apply itself closely and firmly to the neck of the womb.|$|E
60|$|From {{kneeling}} over to {{play with}} the baby the girl sank back <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels</b> with her hands fallen before her.|$|E
6000|$|Peggy squatted <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> {{close to}} Aunt Judy's side, and thus {{addressed}} her: [...] "Aun' Judy, ef I tell you sumfin', soul an' honor, hope o' glory, you'll neber tell?" ...|$|E
60|$|And turning <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel,</b> {{she moved}} slowly away towards {{the far edge}} of the moor with a queenly gesture.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] she said; [...] "monstrous depravity--poor old Gustard's!" [...] And still {{laughing}} that dangerous laugh, she turned <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel</b> and went out.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} tell me that!" [...] exclaimed Dora. [...] "You are a mean, mean boy, so there!" [...] And she turned <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel</b> and walked off.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. You see I'm {{trying to}} beat a coper that's close ahead of us just now. The Sunbeam is pretty swift <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> an' if the breeze holds--ha! you've got it, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not, indeed?" [...] Miss Brown {{answered}} angrily. [...] "Don't you know--can't you believe--that close <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels</b> {{will come}} her husband--that Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, if ever {{he comes to}} life in this room, will leave it between two policemen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently, I remember, she {{sat back}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels</b> and looked up into my face. [...] "We've done wrong--and parting's paying. It's time to pay. We needn't have paid, if we'd kept to the track.... You and I, Master, we've got to be men." ...|$|E
60|$|MARGARET. Goodbye, Mr Gilbey. [She turns <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel</b> {{and goes}} {{to the other end of}} the table]. I suppose you wont {{introduce}} me to the clergyman's daughter.|$|R
60|$|And {{having said}} that she turned <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel</b> and slowly walked away, leaving behind her an ocean of desolation. She walked away--with a slow, {{swinging}} stride, one hand <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hip, her head thrown back.|$|R
60|$|She stared {{him up and}} down, and he {{felt uncomfortable}} in his spine, but {{maintained}} his air of nonchalance. Then she turned slowly <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel,</b> and started to walk back. The corporal went at her side.|$|R
60|$|The {{water in}} the iron pan on the cooking fire boiled furiously, belching out volumes of white steam that mixed with the thin black thread of smoke. The old woman {{appeared}} to him through this {{as if in a}} fog, squatting <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> impassive and weird.|$|E
60|$|She {{was still}} on her knees, but had fallen back <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> with arms hanging limp and {{helpless}} by her side. Hope so suddenly arisen had equally quickly died out of her heart, and her pinched face expressed in every line the despair and misery which had come in its wake.|$|E
60|$|She {{had fallen}} back, {{squatting}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> her hands clasped before {{her and her}} head sunk upon her bosom, bowed with shame and with horror. Her name had been bandied about by traitors, her person been bought and sold {{as the price of}} the blackest sacrilege that had ever disgraced the patriciate of Rome.|$|E
60|$|Turning <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel</b> within {{little more}} than a biscuit's toss of the reef, no earthly power could have saved us, were it not that, up to the very brink of the coral rampart, there are no soundings.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{that for}} a tack! Praise {{goodness}} it wasn't a shingle nail, it would have landed you in the Milky Way. I do hate to have my nerves shook up so." [...] And she turned <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel</b> and went <b>her</b> way.|$|R
60|$|Together, {{hand over}} hand, {{they came in}} on the reefed mainsail. Joe began to warm up with the work. The Dazzler turned <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel</b> like a race-horse, and swept into the wind, her canvas snarling and her sheets slatting like hail.|$|R
60|$|Blanca {{fell upon}} {{her knees and}} kissed the coverlet on which reposed her mistress; but Dea Flavia {{did not seem to}} see her. She was {{squatting}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> with body and head erect, and slowly now, like the rosy kiss of dawn upon the snow-clad hills of Etruria, a faint crimson glow spread over her pale cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|... "The miscreants! the miscreants!" [...] {{she shouted}} as {{she threw herself}} down on to the floor before her young {{mistress}} and squatted there <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> wringing her hands and uttering moans of terror. [...] "They have {{set fire to the}} palace! They are on us, my beloved! Save thyself! Save thy house! Oh ye gods! protect us all!" ...|$|E
60|$|The cutter was a fast sailer, and {{although}} the pirate schooner had left Sandy Cove nearly two days before her, the Wasp, having had a fair wind, followed close <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels.</b> The Avenger cast anchor in the harbour of the Isle of Palms {{on the morning of}} her fifth day out; the Wasp sighted the island on the evening of the same day.|$|E
60|$|It was as {{the steel}} of my {{determination}} striking upon the flint of hers. She {{looked up to}} my face for an instant; she raised her eyebrows in deprecation; she sighed, shrugged one shoulder, and, turning <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel,</b> moved towards the door.|$|R
6000|$|A hundred leagues from Manilla town, [...] The San Gregorio's helm came down; [...] Round {{she went}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel,</b> and not [...] A cable's length from a galliot [...] That rocked on the waters just abreast [...] Of the galleon's course, which was west-sou'-west.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Think! I don't think, I knows! That 'are's no gal, nor widder neither, if my name's Tom Tooth-acre! Look at her walk; {{look at the}} way {{she turns}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel</b> I I've been a watchin' <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> There ain't no woman livin' with a step like that!' says he.|$|R
60|$|Then he stood, arrested. Clara was {{kneeling}} {{on a pile}} of white underclothing on the hearthrug, her back towards him, warming herself. She did not look round, but sat crouching <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> and her rounded beautiful back was towards him, and her face was hidden. She was warming her body at the fire for consolation. The glow was rosy on one side, the shadow was dark and warm on the other. Her arms hung slack.|$|E
60|$|Corley did not answer. He sauntered {{across the}} road swaying his {{head from side to}} side. His bulk, his easy pace, and the solid sound of his boots had {{something}} of the conqueror in them. He approached the young woman and, without saluting, began at once to converse with her. She swung her umbrella more quickly and executed half turns <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels.</b> Once or twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and bent her head.|$|E
60|$|The moon shone very brightly {{in a clear}} sky, and by {{the light}} of it an observer, had there been any to observe where all were so {{occupied}} with their own urgent affairs, could have watched every movement and expression of these women. Rachel, seated on the ground, was rocking herself to and fro, her face hidden in her hands, and praying. Nehushta knelt at her side, resting the weight of her body <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels</b> as only an Eastern can, and stared sullenly at nothingness.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{the sort}} of thing we've been having for {{seventeen}} days, Mr. Burns," [...] I said with intense bitterness. [...] "A puff, then a calm, and in a moment, you'll see, she'll be swinging <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel</b> with <b>her</b> head away from her course to the devil somewhere." ...|$|R
60|$|As the Elsinore {{swung around}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel</b> Mr. Pike put <b>her</b> <b>on</b> the back track {{so as to}} cover the water she had just crossed over. He lowered the glasses through which he was {{scanning}} the sea and pointed down the hatchway that opened into the big after-room beneath. The ladder was gone.|$|R
60|$|Without {{another word}} she turned <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel,</b> {{and for the}} rest of our dejected journey she might have been mistaken for a cross nurse {{trailing}} on pace for pace beside a rebellious child. My dignity was less ruffled than hers, however, and for a brief while I had earned my freedom.|$|R
60|$|Tata, without {{rising from}} her seat <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> watched the {{restitution}} with her dreamy eyes; she {{paid no attention to}} the blue boy on the pavement; pictures from her father were nothing new to her. The mothers parted with expressions of mutual esteem in spite of their difference of accent and fortune. Mrs. Forsyth asked if she might not kiss Peter, and did so; he ran to his mother and whispered to her; then he ran back and gave Tata so great a hug that she fell over from it.|$|E
60|$|Our ship behaved well on this occasion, {{getting out}} of the way with {{sufficient}} rapidity. While this was in the course of execution, I had an opportunity to look after the corvette and the lugger. The last was still leading, having managed, by means of short tacks, to work up considerably to windward of the two French frigates. Here she had made a last tack to the eastward, intending to run for the coast. The sloop-of-war was still in her wake, and was following <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> at a rapid rate.|$|E
6000|$|Razumov {{remained}} outwardly impassive. [...] "What is {{the meaning}} of this performance?" [...] he was asking himself. But with a preliminary sound of bumping outside some door behind him, the lady companion, in a threadbare black skirt and frayed blouse, came in rapidly, walking <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> and carrying in both hands a big Russian samovar, obviously too heavy for her. Razumov made an instinctive movement to help, which startled her so much that she nearly dropped her hissing burden. She managed, however, to land it on the table, and looked so frightened that Razumov hastened to sit down. She produced then, from an adjacent room, four glass tumblers, a teapot, and a sugar-basin, on a black iron tray.|$|E
60|$|She {{regarded}} him gravely as he spoke, {{and then her}} eyes left his face and became fixed upon an object {{at the far end}} of the corridor. Bob turned in time to see Janet Duncan swing <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel</b> and follow <b>her</b> mother up the stairs. He struggled to find words to tide over what he felt was an awkward moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Which means," [...] responded {{the young}} lady pertly, [...] "the same thing to ME as to Paw. No trespassers but yourself. Thank you, sir." [...] She twirled lightly <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>heel</b> and dropped him that exaggerated curtsey known to the school-children as a [...] "cheese." [...] It {{permitted}} in its progress the glimpse of a pretty little slipper which completed his subjugation.|$|R
50|$|Smith is 181 cm tall, weighs 67 kg, {{is right}} handed {{and has a}} tattoo <b>on</b> <b>her</b> left <b>heel.</b>|$|R
