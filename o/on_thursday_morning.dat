5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. <b>On</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>morning</b> Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E
5|$|As per the {{regulations}} for , three practice sessions were held, two {{one and a}} half-hour sessions on Thursday and another one-hour session on Saturday morning. After a thunderstorm on Wednesday night, {{the first of the}} two free practice sessions held <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>morning,</b> started with every driver setting their installation laps on intermediate tyres. The track soon dried up, and the cars changed to slick tyres. Nico Rosberg had an early shunt when he clipped his front wing exiting the Tabac corner though he did not sustain considerable damage to his car. The two Mercedes drivers swapped places {{at the top of the}} time sheets for most of the session, until late improvements pushed Rosberg down the order to finish ninth, more than a second off his team-mate Lewis Hamilton. Rookie Max Verstappen surprised the paddock by finishing second, two-tenths of a second down on Hamilton. The Renault-powered cars all finished within the top seven, while the Williams team ended the session in tenth and seventeenth, owing to the car not being well suited for wet and low-temperature conditions.|$|E

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2016 season, two ninety-minute practice and one sixty-minute session were held before qualifying on Saturday. The first two usually {{take place on}} Friday, with Monaco being the single exemption, where those sessions are held on Thursday, in order to minimise road-closure disruptions to local residents. In the first session <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>morning,</b> Lewis Hamilton topped the timesheets {{with a time of}} 1:15.537, one tenth of a second faster than his teammate Nico Rosberg. They were followed by Sebastian Vettel, almost half a second down on Hamilton, and the two Red Bull cars of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen respectively. Daniil Kvyat, driving for Toro Rosso, in sixth was the last driver to get within a second of Hamilton's time. He {{was the only one of}} the front runners to set his time on the supersoft instead of the faster ultrasoft tyres. There were several incidents during the session: After twenty-four minutes, Felipe Massa hit the barrier in turn one, damaging his car and leading to a virtual safety car (VSC) period. Later, Lewis Hamilton had a brake lockup at the same spot, but was able to get into the run-off area without touching the guardrail. Several other drivers had dangerous moments in turn one as well, but the most severe incident of the session came three minutes to the end: A drain cover had come loose around the first corner, puncturing Rosberg's left rear tyre and damaging Jenson Button's McLaren MP4-31, causing the practice to be red flagged, ultimately ending the session.|$|E

25|$|On the day {{preceding}} the first Passover seder (or <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>morning</b> {{preceding the}} seder, {{when the first}} seder falls on Motza'ei Shabbat), firstborn sons are commanded to observe the Fast of the Firstborn which commemorates the salvation of the Hebrew firstborns. According to , God struck down all Egyptian firstborns while the Israelites were not affected. However, it is customary for synagogues to conduct a siyum (ceremony marking {{the completion of a}} section of Torah learning) right after morning prayers, and the celebratory meal that follows cancels the firstborn's obligation to fast.|$|E

25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>morning,</b> lasted 45 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Alex Lynn set the fastest time for Theodore Racing by Prema in the opening practice session—held in variable weather conditions—with a lap of two minutes and 14.495 seconds, 0.061 seconds faster than any one else at the track. His closest challenger was Félix da Costa in second in front of third-placed Coletti and Mücke Motorsport's Felix Rosenqvist in fourth position. Alexander Sims was fifth-fastest, ahead of Jaafar. Tom Blomqvist, Marciello, Lucas Auer and Korjus rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Sainz {{was the first of}} the drivers to go off the track in wet conditions and rebounded off the Fisherman's Corner barriers with his car's rear-end. His teammate King understeered into the same barrier eleven minutes later, while Rosenqvist crashed at San Francisco Bend on dirty tyres due to him running wide at Lisboa turn. Three other drivers—Sekiguchi, Lucas Wolf and Sun Zheng—failed to record a lap time as a consequence of encountering incidents during the session.|$|E
25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>morning,</b> lasted 45 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Antonio Giovinazzi set the fastest time for Carlin in the opening practice session with a lap of two minutes and 13.829 seconds, nearly eight-tenths of a second faster than anyone else on the track. His closest challenger was Felix Rosenqvist who fought Giovinazzi for the top spot. Markus Pommer was third-fastest, ahead of the Japanese trio of Kenta Yamashita, Sekiguchi and Kanamaru. Cassidy, Lance Stroll, Mitsunori Takaboshi and Alexander Albon rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The session was red flagged twice: firstly for Jake Dennis twenty minutes into the session by crashing into the right-hand wall at the Solitude Esses after sustaining a puncture, and secondly for Callum Ilott when he impacted the barrier at the left-hand turn before Faraway corner with nine minutes left. Two other drivers, Sims and Zhi Cong Li, crashed at Lisboa turn but no stoppage was necessitated as both cars were retrieved from the track without difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>morning,</b> lasted thirty minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Grosjean set the fastest time for ASM in the opening practice session with a late lap of two minutes and 14.223 seconds, nearly one-tenth of a second faster than any one else on the circuit in spite of heavily damaging his car's left-hand side {{in order to avoid}} Stephen Jelley's stricken vehicle at Policeman's Bend. His closest challenger was Sébastien Buemi in second in front of third-placed Asmer and Prema Powerteam's Roberto Streit in fourth. Koudai Tsukakoshi was fifth-fastest, ahead of Edoardo Mortara in sixth. Oliver Jarvis, Jelley, Senna and Nico Hülkenberg rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The session was stopped halfway through when Franck Mailleux spun into the barriers lining the track at the R Bend and this caused his car to be stranded on track. Other incidents included Lei spinning at Lisboa corner but avoided damaging his car with Sam Bird later swiping the turn's wall and Walter Grubmüller limped to the pit lane with his front-right suspension bent.|$|E

25|$|<b>On</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>morning,</b> the mutineers went {{to protest}} {{at the gates}} of Philomel, but found them to be manned by a party of petty officers, {{supported}} by the police. Just before 08:00, Phipps announced that all sailors were to report for duty by 10:00 and be prepared to accept the consequences of the mutiny—anyone who did not would be discharged. The government was aware that a large number were unlikely to accept the offer, and accepted that this act would set the development of the RNZN back by several years. After the sailors returned to the reserve, Dr. Finlay advised them that they would likely forfeit all veterans' benefits if they persisted in their actions, but the warning had the opposite effect to that intended. The majority of the mutineers stripped off their rank and category insignias, medal ribbons, and good conduct badges, and returned to the base to collect their effects. However, the Master-At-Arms would only allow them onto the base individually and with an escort, and they could only claim their belongings after returning all items of uniform and equipment, even if they had been paid for through wage deductions.|$|E
25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>morning,</b> lasted 45 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Lucas Auer set the fastest time for Theodore Racing by Prema in the opening practice session—which was delayed for one hour to facilitate barrier repairs at Police corner following a support race crash —with a lap of two minutes and 14.645 seconds. 0.055 seconds faster than any one else at the track. His closest challenger was Antonio Giovinazzi ahead of teammate Tom Blomqvist and Buller. Jordan King was fifth-fastest, in front of Felix Rosenqvist. Max Verstappen, Nicholas Latifi, Coletti and Sean Gelael rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Gelael and Cao made contact at Lisboa corner and Sam MacLeod crashed into the barriers at Police corner. Wells spun into the wall at Fisherman's bend with Mitsunori Takaboshi caused the session to be stopped by hitting the Moorish Hill turn barrier. Ocon was caught off guard by the accident and damaged his left-front suspension by swiping Takaboshi's car. Spike Goddard impacted the Moorish Hill corner wall in the session's closing minutes which prevented anyone from improving on their quickest lap times.|$|E
25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held <b>on</b> <b>Thursday</b> <b>morning,</b> lasted 40 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Rosenqvist was fastest in the first practice session {{with a time of}} two minutes and 13.099 seconds which was recorded his final timed lap late in the session. He was four-tenths of a second quicker than the second-fastest driver Callum Ilott who moved out of traffic to drive with a clear track on his fastest lap. Kenta Yamashita was third-fastest, ahead of Juncadella and Norris; the latter held the fastest lap until ten minutes remaining in the session. Jake Hughes, Félix da Costa, Sims, David Beckmann and George Russell rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The session was stopped early for 16 minutes when Ferdinand Habsburg went into Fisherman's Bend corner too quickly and understeered into the turn's barriers, causing his car's left front corner to become lodged underneath the wall. Habsburg was transported to a local hospital for a precautionary check-up. As a result, the session was extended by five minutes to provide competitors with additional on-track time. Cassidy stopped his car on the front straight with brake problems while Mardenborough made a pit stop because his car's engine cover was becoming detached and the problem affected his vehicle's top speed, and Tadasuke Makino carried excessive speed turning into Lisboa Bend corner and damaged his car's front-left corner in an impact with the turn's exit barrier.|$|E
