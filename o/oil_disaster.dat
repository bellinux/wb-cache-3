As a result, <b>oil</b> pipeline <b>disasters</b> have frequently occurred in the country.

40|$|As oil {{transportation}} worldwide {{continues to}} increase, many communities {{are at risk}} of <b>oil</b> spill <b>disasters</b> and must anticipate and prepare for them. Factors that influence oil spill consequences are myriad and range from the biophysical to the social. We provide a summary literature review and overview framework to help communities systematically consider the factors and linkages that would influence consequences of a potential oil spill. The focus is on spills from oil tanker accidents. Drawing primarily on empirical studies of previous <b>oil</b> spill <b>disasters,</b> we focused on several main domains of interest: the <b>oil</b> spill itself, <b>disaster</b> management, the physical marine environment, marine biology, human health, economy, and policy. Key variables that influence the severity of consequences are identified, and significant interactions between variables are delineated. The framework can be used to clarify the complexity of oil spill impacts, identify lessons that may be transferable from other <b>oil</b> spill <b>disasters,</b> develop scenarios for planning, and inform risk analysis and policy debates in localities that are seeking to understand and reduce their vulnerability to potential spill disasters. As a case study, the framework is used to consider potential oil spills and consequences in Vancouver, Canada. Major increases in oil tanker traffic are anticipated in this region, creating urgent new demands for risk information, disaster management planning, and policy responses. The case study identifies particular conditions that distinguish the Vancouver context from other historic events; in particular, proximity to a densely populated urban area, the type of oil being transported, financial compensation schemes, and local economic structure. Drawing lessons from other <b>oil</b> spill <b>disasters</b> is important but should be undertaken with recognition of these key differences. Some types of impacts that have been relatively inconsequential in previous events may be very significant in a Vancouver case...|$|R

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{manufacturers}} have embraced oil tankers {{with a double}} hull because it strengthens the hull of ships, reducing the likelihood of <b>oil</b> <b>disasters</b> in low-impact collisions and groundings over single-hull ships. They {{reduce the likelihood of}} leaks occurring at low speed impacts in port areas when the ship is under pilotage. Research of impact damage of ships has revealed that double-hulled tankers are unlikely to perforate both hulls in a collision, preventing oil from seeping out. However, for smaller tankers, U shaped tanks might be susceptible to [...] "free flooding" [...] across the double bottom and up to the outside water level each side of the cargo tank. Salvors prefer to salvage doubled-hulled tankers because they permit the use of air pressure to vacuum out the flood water. In the 1960s, collision proof double hulls for nuclear ships were extensively investigated, due to escalating concerns over nuclear accidents.|$|R
