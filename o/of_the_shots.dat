The main effects studio was Moving Picture Company (MPC), which produced 420 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b> Several other studios, including Weta Digital, Fuel VFX, Rising Sun Pictures, Luma Pictures, Lola Visual Effects, and Hammerhead Productions, also produced effects shots for the film.|$|E
5|$|Kirk's fight {{scene with}} Martia {{in the form}} of Kirk was mostly filmed with a double dressed in similar clothes; in the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> the camera allowed only one of the combatants' faces to be seen. When Kirk talked with his double directly, two separate takes of Shatner facing opposite directions were combined, with the camera motion carefully controlled so that the resulting image looked realistic.|$|E

5|$|Three {{mainstream}} narratives emerged {{after the}} shooting. The early view that Israeli gunfire {{had killed the}} boy developed into the position that, because of the trajectory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots,</b> Palestinian gunfire {{was more likely to}} have been responsible. This view was expressed in 2005 by Denis Jeambar, editor-in-chief of L'Express, and , a former France2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage. A third perspective, held by Arlette Chabot, France 2's news editor, is that no one can know who fired the shots.|$|E
5|$|According to Dallas, {{it rained}} on days that were {{supposed}} to be sunny, while other days of production lacked rain when {{they were supposed to be}} rainy. Goodwin added that the scene of Snow and Charming releasing the birds was freezing because of the heavy rain. Their scene in the cabin took place on the first day of the episode's production. Her near-death scene involved a real cliff, though the height was exaggerated later using CGI and a green screen; a stunt double stood in for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|E
5|$|Renoir used few close-ups {{or reverse}} shots and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> are two shots. The hunt scene {{differs from the}} rest of the film; it uses rapid editing whereas most of the film uses long takes of {{dialogue}} or action. Renoir wanted to shoot the film in color to take advantage of the beauty of Sologne in the winter but he was unable to secure funding from Jean Jay. One week before filming began Renoir tried to persuade Technicolor to fund the color cinematography but the company refused.|$|E

The work was so extensive that three visual effects supervisors divided the workload among themselvesJohn Knoll supervised the on-set production and the podrace and space battle sequences, Dennis Muren supervised the underwater sequence and the ground battle, and Scott Squires, alongside teams assigned for miniature effects and character animation, worked on the lightsaber effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{front cover}} design, a {{photograph}} of the group on a zebra crossing, was based on ideas sketched by McCartney, and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios in Abbey Road. At 11:35 that morning, photographer Iain Macmillan was given only ten minutes to take the photo whilst he stood on a step-ladder and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera. Macmillan took six photographs, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before deciding which <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> would be used upon the album sleeve.|$|E
5|$|In the video, Candy {{is shown}} {{living with a}} cult on a farm {{populated}} by abused women and a tyrannical man. Candy and the other women are seen performing various chores around the house. The man demands that the women prepare dinner, and drags one of them outside by her hair. These opening sequences are accompanied by {{the sounds of a}} piano, the women's cooking knives, and the man's ax. The women seek vengeance against the man, removing all of their clothing, confronting him while he is chopping wood, and shooting him with golden rifles. Following the man's death, the women have dinner together while wearing latex clothing. The visual also includes scenes of Candy posing with a white horse while wearing oversized hats and holding decorated machine guns. During these scenes, Candy is shown only wearing a bodystocking, and in some instances a large chastity belt. To accommodate restrictions regarding censorship, Candy's nipples are airbrushed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Expendables 2 {{contains}} approximately 1,547 {{digital effect}} shots. The main effects studio was Worldwide FX (WWFX), which produced 1,186 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots,</b> and a further 800 shots which were discarded {{in response to}} changes to the film's story. Several other studios, including El Ranchito, Malditochrome, Tata Elxsi, Reliance Mediaworks, and , also produced effects shots for the film through WWFX. Digital effect pre-production began in July 2011 and was completed one year later. WWFX's primary facility is situated in Sofia, allowing them to have constant access to the production, and model assets of the sets before their practical versions were built; this enabled WWFX to raise issues relating to the designs early and develop an optimised construction plan. Anything that was considered to potentially need a computer generated double was photographed and digitally modeled {{even if it was}} not scheduled to appear in the film, which later served useful as the film's story was adjusted, requiring WWFX to rebuild entire scenes.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many of {{the sets}} {{featured}} on the show which were filmed on a Fox soundstage, the shot of the buried alien space craft was actually filmed in the hills near Simi Valley, California. Carter wanted a full-scale mock-up of the alien ship {{to be buried in}} the ground. This was unusual for the show; usually, {{a small portion of the}} ship would have been buried in the ground and the rest would have been filled in either via digital graphics, or with a scale model. In this episode, however, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> of the alien ship, sans the take off, were done practically. To create the otherworldly glow of the ship, over 100 lamps were hidden within the craft. In addition, the ship itself was covered in glyphs that are supposed to be part of an unknown alien language. This was accomplished by designing fictional characters and programming them into a computer. These were then printed as letters which could be applied to the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|Six {{teams from}} North America and six teams {{representing}} {{the rest of}} the World play a series of games against each other in order to win points. The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup. Teams compete in four formats: team games, mixed doubles games, singles competitions, and skins games. Team games are regular curling games, with two teams of four playing against each other. Mixed doubles games involve two teams, each consisting of one male and one female, playing against each other. Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end, one of which is positioned {{prior to the start of}} the end. This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games. The singles competition involves two teams playing against each other. There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions. Each curler from each team is assigned to throw at least one type of shot. Points are given based on how well the shot is made. After all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> have been thrown, the team with the most points wins the competition. Skins games involve two teams playing against each other, where the objective is to win skins by scoring two or more points with the hammer or stealing points without the hammer. The points for the skins games, which go toward the total points for the cup, are distributed throughout the game, and the teams earn these points by winning skins.|$|E

5|$|Until the film's production, many {{special effects}} in the film {{industry}} were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings, and on-set visual effectsalthough other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> that would be practical and those which would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, {{he did not know}} how to accomplish what he had seen. The result was a mixture of original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to guess which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation. Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes. Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions, and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.|$|E

30|$|To {{make the}} {{thresholds}} sensitive to <b>the</b> different <b>shot</b> classes, {{we need some}} methods to make such thresholds locally adaptive. <b>The</b> overall video <b>shot</b> complexity depends on the activity and the motion, while <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> class depends on both the complexity and <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot.</b> <b>The</b> <b>shot</b> duration has a strong correlation with <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> motion in <b>the</b> video. <b>The</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> is typically inversely proportional to <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> motion in <b>the</b> video [9].
