5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius torminosus contain {{a number of}} sterols, of which {{ergosterol}} (a component of fungal cell walls) is the most predominant at 60.5% of all sterols, followed by its derivatives and ergosta-5/7-dien-3-ol (17.0%), ergost-7-en-3-ol (13.7%) and ergosta-7-22-dien-3-ol (8.3%). Researchers have identified 28 volatile compounds {{that contribute to the}} <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> the mushroom. Many of these are alcohols and carbonyl compounds with eight carbon atoms; the predominant volatile compound (about 90%) is 1-octen-3-one, an odorant common in mushrooms.|$|E

Although GS-MS measurements showed that the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> the stew from the cook-serve system was stronger than those from the In-Cart cooking system, the results of the sensory evaluation indicated that the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> the In-Cart cooking system were stronger than those from the cook-serve system. The result was explainable by the fact that compounds with strong odors such as concentrations of sulfur-containing compounds and aldehydes were high with the In-Cart cooking system...|$|R

40|$|Infections {{have been}} shown to alter body odor. Because immune {{activation}} accompanies both infection and immunization, we tested the hypothesis that classical immunization might similarly result in the alteration <b>of</b> body <b>odors</b> detectable by trained biosensor mice. Using a Y-maze, we trained biosensor mice to distinguish between urine odors from rabies-vaccinated (RV) and unvaccinated control mice. RV-trained mice generalized this training to mice immunized with the equine West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine compared with urine of corresponding controls. These results suggest that there are similarities between body <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> mice immunized with these two vaccines. This conclusion was reinforced when mice could not be trained to directly discriminate between urine <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> RV- versus WNV-treated mice. Next,we trained biosensor mice to discriminate the urine <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a general elicitor of innate immunological responses) from the urine of control mice. These LPS-trained biosensors could distinguish between the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> LPS-treated mouse urine and RV-treated mouse urine. Finally, biosensor mice trained to distinguish between the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> RV-treated mouse urine and control mouse urine did not generalize this training to discriminate between the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> LPS-treated mouse urine and control mouse urine. From these experiments, we conclude that: (1) immunization alters urine odor in similar ways for RV andWNV immunizations; and (2) immune activation with LPS also alters urine odor but in ways different from those of RV and WNV...|$|R
5|$|Spongiforma thailandica is {{a species}} of fungus in the Boletaceae family, genus Spongiforma. The {{stemless}} sponge-like species, first described in 2009, was found in Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand, where it grows in soil in old-growth forests. The rubbery fruit body, which has a strong <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> coal-tar similar to Tricholoma sulphureum, consists of numerous internal cavities lined with spore-producing tissue. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the species {{is closely related to}} the Boletaceae genera Porphyrellus and Strobilomyces.|$|E

40|$|Olfaction {{may play}} an {{important}} role in regulating bird behavior, and has been suggested to be involved in feather-pecking. We investigated possible differences in the body <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> red junglefowl females by using an automated olfactometer which assessed the ability of trained mice to discriminate between the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> uropygial gland secretions (the main carrier <b>of</b> potential individual <b>odors</b> in chickens) <b>of</b> six feather-pecked and six non-pecked birds. All mice were clearly able to discriminate between all individual red junglefowl odors, showing that each bird has an individual body odor. We analyzed whether it was more difficult to discriminate between the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> two feather-pecked, or two non-pecked birds, than it was to discriminate between the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> two randomly selected birds. This was not the case, suggesting that feather-pecked birds did not share a common odor signature.

5|$|As a {{saprobic}} mushroom, or decomposer {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. They are most often found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> the gleba attracts insects that walk and feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus rubroflammeus from similar boletes include the deep purple-red cap and the reticulated stem. B.flammans {{is similar in}} appearance, but has a more variable cap color, ranging from dark red to brick-red or reddish-brown, a yellow stem base and less prominently reticulate stem, and it grows under conifers. Rubroboletus rhodosanguineus is also very similar but has more variable cap color with brown to olive tones and its cut flesh has an <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> overripe fruit that intensifies when dry. The European species R.rhodoxanthus has a paler overall color. Another European species, B.permagnificus, has larger spores (13–16 by 5–6.5μm), weakly decurrent pores, and only associates with oak trees.|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of PsychologyJerome FriemanMale {{and female}} Phodopus campbelli were {{investigated}} for kin recognition abilities, assessed by kin discrimination of bedding, urine, fecal, or midventral glandular secretion odors.

40|$|Social {{information}} can be acquired {{either directly or indirectly}} from cues inadvertently produced by individuals with similar interests and requirements (“inadvertent social information,” ISI). These inadvertent cues provide “public information” that other individuals can use to guide their behavior. We show here that female mice use olfactory ISI to determine their choice of, and responses to, males and that the use of this ISI involves the gene for oxytocin (OT). Female mice (OT wild type and CF- 1 strain) displayed a significant interest in, and choice <b>of,</b> the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> uninfected males of varying sexual status that were associated with the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> an another estrous female. This recognition of, and choices for, specific, individual male odors was evident 24 h later. Female mice also distinguished between males subclinically infected with the gastrointestinal nematode parasite, Heligimosomoides polygyrus, and nonparasitized males, displaying aversive responses (analgesia, increased corticosterone) to, and avoidance <b>of,</b> the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> infected males. The presence <b>of</b> the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> another estrous female with that of the infected male, which are indicative of potential mate interests, attenuated these aversive responses and resulted in a choice for the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> infected male. OT gene-deficient (knockout) females were impaired in their use of this ISI to modulate their responses to either uninfected males of differing sexual states or infected males. These findings suggest that OT genes are necessary for the processing of inadvertent social information and likely the integration of both direct and indirect social information...|$|R
5|$|Lactarius rubidus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.rufulus, but it has watery to whey-like latex and develops a strong <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> maple syrup or butterscotch when dried. Another lookalike is Lactarius thiersii, {{but it has a}} smaller cap and stem and has mild-tasting flesh and latex. The flesh and latex of Lactarius rufus have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo. Additionally, L.rufus typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base, and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than L.rufulus. L.vinaceorufescens has a yellowing latex.|$|E
5|$|When {{collected}} in its typical habitat {{and during the}} appropriate season, Tricholoma vernaticum mushrooms can be readily identified because of their prominent characteristics: white color, stocky fruit body, farinaceous odor, and ring on the stipe. Tricholoma lookalikes in the same geographic region grow at lower elevations, typically in autumn. T.portentosum has a gray cap, a stipe with yellow tints, and lacks a ring, while T.mutabile has violet tones in its cap and also lacks a ring. Other lookalikes include Hygrophorus subalpinus and H.camarophyllus, but these species have broad, waxy gills, and lack the characteristic <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> T.vernaticum.|$|E
5|$|Like all Phallus species, P.indusiatus is saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} from breaking down wood and plant organic matter. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups in disturbed ground and among wood chips. In Asia, it grows among bamboo forests, and typically fruits after heavy rains. The {{method of reproduction}} for stinkhorns, including P.indusiatus, is different from most agaric mushrooms, which forcibly eject their spores. Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass that has a sharp, sickly-sweet <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> carrion. The cloying stink of mature fruit bodies—detectable from a considerable distance—is attractive to certain insects. Species recorded visiting the fungus include stingless bees of the genus Trigona, and flies of the families Drosophilidae and Muscidae. Insects assist in spore dispersal by consuming the gleba and depositing excrement containing intact spores to germinate elsewhere. Although {{the function of the}} indusium is not known definitively, it may visually entice insects not otherwise attracted by the odour, and serve as a ladder for crawling insects to reach the gleba.|$|E
50|$|Other {{studies have}} {{approached}} mate choice based on odor preference.

Women that were ovulating rated the <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> MHC-dissimilar men as more pleasant {{than those of the}} MHC-similar men. Furthermore, <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> MHC-dissimilar men often reminded women of current or former partners, suggesting that odor—specifically odor for MHC-dissimilarity—plays a role in mate choice.|$|R

40|$|Identification <b>of</b> <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> {{compounds}} {{introduced into}} changeable olfactory environments {{is the essence}} of olfactory coding, which focuses perception on the latest stimulus with the greatest salience. Effects of stimulus intensity and adapting time on mixture component identification after adapting with one component were each studied in 10 human subjects. <b>Odors</b> <b>of</b> 1 and 5 mM vanillin (vanilla) and phenethyl alcohol (rose) were identified, with adapting time varied by sniffing naturally once or twice, or sniffing 5 times, once every 2 s. <b>Odors</b> <b>of</b> water-adapted single compounds were identified nearly perfectly (94 %), self-adapted to 51 % but did not cross-adapt (94 %), showing the 2 compounds had quickly adapting independent <b>odors.</b> Identifications <b>of</b> the vanilla and rose odors in water-adapted mixtures were reduced to 59 % and 79 %, respectively. Following single-component adaptation, the average 33 % identification <b>of</b> <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> adapted (ambient) mixture components contrasted with the greater average 86 % identification of new unadapted (extra) mixture components. Identifications were lower for 1 than 5 mM components when concentrations were not matched, and ambient component identifications were lower after 10 -s adaptation than after 1 or 2 sniffs. Rapid selective adaptation and mixture component suppression manipulate effective intensity to promote emergence <b>of</b> characteristic <b>odor</b> qualities in dynamic natural settings.

5|$|Tree {{of heaven}} {{is a popular}} {{ornamental}} tree in China and valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions. It was once very popular in cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> its blossoms and the weediness of its habit. The problem of odor was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher seed production also results. Michael Dirr, a noted American horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers. He further writes (his emphasis): In Europe, however, the tree is still used in the garden to some degree as its habit is generally not as invasive {{as it is in}} America. In the United Kingdom it is especially common in London squares, streets, and parks, though it is also frequently found in gardens of southern England and East Anglia. It becomes rare in the north, occurring only infrequently in southern Scotland. It is also rare in Ireland. In Germany the tree is commonly planted in gardens. The tree has furthermore become unpopular in cultivation in the west because it is short-lived and that the trunk soon becomes hollow, making trees more than two feet in diameter unstable in high winds.|$|E
