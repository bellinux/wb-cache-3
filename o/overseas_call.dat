50|$|Inadvertent {{calls to}} {{emergency}} telephone numbers are problematic as, if the dispatcher is uncertain {{of the nature}} of a presumed emergency, police are rapidly dispatched to the address on an enhanced 9-1-1 or 1-1-2 call.

In some cases, criminals have inadvertently dialled 9-1-1 instead of the NANP <b>overseas</b> <b>call</b> prefix 011-, a misdial of a local exchange code was processed as a distress call or a pocket dial of an emergency number revealed their position to law enforcement.

Our findings discuss the implications and provide a useful reference for future CCO-related studies. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{concerns}} about the transfer of U. S. services jobs to overseas workers have deepened long-standing fears {{about the effects of}} trade on the domestic labor market. But a balanced view of the impact of trade requires that we consider jobs created through the production of U. S. exports as well as jobs lost to imports. A new measure of the jobs gained and lost in international trade flows suggests that the net number of U. S. jobs lost is relatively small— 2. 4 percent of total U. S. employment as of 2003. In the aftermath of the 2001 recession, the perception has grown that vast numbers of U. S. services jobs are being relocated to India, China, and other developing countries.

With approximately 70 % to 75 % of the costs of call centre operations linked to CSR labour costs, there are both short-term and long-term implications associated with call centres’ productivity.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{strengths}} and weaknesses of the methods employed for data collection, rather than on actual conclusions about the stimulus interfaces used. 2. METHODOLOGY 2. 1. The Task The evaluation task is calculating the cost of a telephone call, using different versions of a prototype application. Each user is required to use all the different versions. Most people are familiar with telephone usage so that the task domain should not be unfamiliar to any user. However the method of call charging employed by BT is not particularly obvious, and so many people will not be familiar with exactly how telephone charges are calculated. BT charge calls by measuring the number of units used in each call. Each unit costs 5. 06 pence. Some calls are more expensive than others, due to the distance called, or the amount of equipment used. For example <b>overseas</b> <b>calls</b> are typically much more expensive than inland calls and calls to mobile phones are particularly expensive. BT cope with this by allotting different amounts of time per unit to each distance band, hence a Local call may use one unit every 360 seconds, and a call to Hong Kong may use a unit every 3. 5 seconds. Additionally BT vary the amount of time per unit according to the time of day, so that busy periods are more expensive. Inland calls usually have three charge rates, cheap, standard and peak, however some <b>overseas</b> <b>calls</b> have only one charge rate, and many have just two. British Telecom, (1987). In this study the functional part of each version of the prototype is clearly separated from the interface. There is considerable scope for variation in the way a user enters call parameters (distance and time of day).
