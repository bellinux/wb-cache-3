After what you have both seen, are you both satisfied, so far?" ...|$|R

5|$|Joust is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1982. While {{not the first}} game to feature two-player cooperative play, Joust was more successful than its predecessors and popularized the concept.

The <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards.|$|E
5|$|Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1986. It is {{a sequel to}} Williams' 1982 game Joust.

The <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust 2 features improved audio-visuals and new features such as mutant buzzards created by eggs falling into lava, the ability to transform from an ostrich to a flying horse, and differently themed levels. Waves no longer seamlessly flow into each other; the gameplay is divided into separate screens with transitions between them.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a Stretcher match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam, {{in which the}} <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> place your {{opponent}} on a stretcher and wheel the stretcher across a finish line. The match {{went back and forth}} before Van Dam attempted to perform a Somersault Plancha onto Orton, but Orton moved out of the way. Orton put Van Dam on the stretcher and tried to wheel him across the finishing line. Van Dam, however, managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto the stretcher. Van Dam wheeled the stretcher over the line for the win. After the match, Orton attacked Van Dam, executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor. Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on the stretcher.|$|E

5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb {{them before they}} slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Defender is a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling shooting game {{set on the}} surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three ships to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy, or hit by an enemy projectile, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.|$|E
