5000|$|The {{most common}} theory on the {{arrangement}} of <b>oarsmen</b> in the new ship types is that of [...] "double-banking", i.e., that the quadrireme was derived from a bireme (warship with two rows of oars) by placing two <b>oarsmen</b> on each oar, the quinquereme from a trireme by placing two <b>oarsmen</b> on the two uppermost levels (the thranitai and zygitai, according to Greek terminology), and the later hexareme by placing two rowers on every level. [...] Other interpretations of the quinquereme include a bireme warship with three and two <b>oarsmen</b> on {{the upper and lower}} oar banks, or even a monoreme (warship with a single level of oars) with five <b>oarsmen.</b> The [...] "double-banking" [...] theory is supported {{by the fact that the}} 4th-century quinqueremes were housed in the same ship sheds as the triremes, and must therefore have had similar width (ca. 16 feet, or 5.3 m), which fits with the idea of an evolutionary progression from the one type to the other.|$|R
2500|$|In 1884, amateur {{status for}} {{overseas}} <b>oarsmen</b> {{was put on}} the same basis as for home <b>oarsmen,</b> thus ending the concession on racing for money prizes. By 1886 a phrase had also been added debarring any person [...] "engaged in any menial activity".|$|R
25|$|His country scenes at Yerres {{focus on}} {{pleasure}} boating on the leisurely stream {{as well as}} fishing and swimming, and domestic scenes around his country home. He often used a soft impressionistic technique reminiscent of Renoir to convey the tranquil nature of the countryside, {{in sharp contrast to}} the flatter, smoother strokes of his urban paintings. In <b>Oarsman</b> in a Top Hat (1877), he effectively manages the perspective of a passenger in the back of a row boat facing his rowing companion and the stream ahead, in a manner much more realistic and involving than Manet's Boating (1874).|$|E
25|$|During the War of 1812, {{about one-quarter}} of the {{personnel}} in the American naval squadrons of the Battle of Lake Erie were black, and portrait renderings of the battle {{on the wall of}} the nation's Capitol and the rotunda of Ohio's Capitol show that blacks played a significant role in it. Hannibal Collins, a freed slave and Oliver Hazard Perry's personal servant, is thought to be the <b>oarsman</b> in William Henry Powell's Battle of Lake Erie. Collins earned his freedom as a veteran of the Revolutionary War, having fought in the Battle of Rhode Island. He accompanied Perry for the rest of Perry's naval career, and was with him at Perry's death in Trinidad in 1819.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Mallory {{attended}} Glengorse, a preparatory {{boarding school}} in Eastbourne on the south coast of England, having transferred from another prep school in West Kirby. At the age of 13, he won a mathematics scholarship to Winchester College. In his final year at Winchester, he was introduced to rock climbing and mountaineering by a master, R.L.G. Irving, who took {{a small number of}} people climbing in the Alps each year. In October 1905, Mallory entered Magdalene College, Cambridge, to study history. There he became good friends with future members of the Bloomsbury Group, including Rupert Brooke, John Maynard Keynes, James Strachey, Lytton Strachey and Duncan Grant, who took some portraits of Mallory. Mallory was a keen <b>oarsman,</b> who rowed for his college while at Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|Mycenaean {{ships were}} shallow-draught vessels {{and could be}} beached on sandy bays.

25|$|Like his father, Laurie was an <b>oarsman</b> {{at school}} and university. In 1977, {{he was a member}} of the junior coxed pair that won the British {{national}} title before representing Britain's Youth Team at the 1977 Junior World Rowing Championships. In 1980, Laurie and his rowing partner, J.S. Palmer, were runners-up in the Silver Goblets coxless pairs for Eton Vikings rowing club. Later, Laurie also achieved a Blue while taking part in the 1980 Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race. Cambridge lost that year by fivefeet. During this time, Laurie was training for up to eighthours a day and was on course to become an Olympic-standard rower. Laurie is a member of Leander Club, one of the oldest rowing clubs in the world. He was also a member of the Hermes Club and the Hawks' Club.|$|E
25|$|In 1714, the Irish actor Thomas Doggett {{provided}} {{money to}} endow a boat race called Doggett's Coat and Badge Race {{in honour of}} the new king, George I of Hanover. The race was originally to be rowed annually on 1 August on the River Thames, by up to six young watermen per boat who {{were not to be}} out of their apprenticeship by more than twelve months. The prize for the champion <b>oarsman</b> is a fine red coat embellished with a large silver badge on one arm, depicting the white horse of Hanover with the word 'liberty' underneath. Since Doggett's death, the Fishmongers' Company continues to organise this event each year, and it is now believed to be the world's longest continuously-running sporting event as well as being the longest boat race in the world – 4miles, 5furlongs (7,400m).|$|E
25|$|From {{early in}} the 19th century, it was a custom to hold boat races on the Tyne. The Tyne had {{a large number of}} keelmen and wherrymen, who handled boats as part of their jobs. As on the River Thames, there were {{competitions}} to show who was the best <b>oarsman.</b> As a wherryman did not earn very much, professional rowing was seen as a quick way of earning extra money. Regattas were held, and provided modest prizes for professionals, but the big money was made in challenge races, in which scullers or boat crews would challenge each other to a race over a set distance for a side stake. The crews would usually have backers, who would put up the stake money, as they saw the chance of financial gain from the race. In the days before mass attendances at football matches, races on the river were enormously popular, with tens of thousands attending. Betting would go on both before and during a race, the odds changing as the fortunes of the contestants changed. Contestants who became champions of the Tyne would often challenge the corresponding champions of the River Thames, and the race would be arranged to take place on one of the two rivers.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{with its}} land counterpart, the exact {{size of the}} Byzantine navy and its units {{is a matter of}} {{considerable}} debate, owing to the scantness and ambiguous nature of the primary sources.

These lists reveal that during the reign of Leo VI the Wise, the navy reached 34,200 <b>oarsmen</b> and perhaps as many as 8,000 marines. The central Imperial Fleet totalled some 19,600 <b>oarsmen</b> and 4,000 marines under the command of the droungarios of the basilikon plōimon.

2500|$|The {{arrangement}} {{and number of}} <b>oarsmen</b> is the first deciding factor {{in the size of}} the ship.
