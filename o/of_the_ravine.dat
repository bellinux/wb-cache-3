5|$|Across the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine</b> from Cave 1 on {{the other}} Stupa hill is a large hall known as Sitabai's temple cave. The portico has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 {{chambers}} at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. The door of the central shrine has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion figures. The sanctum has no image now, but is similar to Linga shrine on the island.|$|E
5|$|As one road, NY14 and NY414 travel down Franklin Street, {{the main}} {{thoroughfare}} of Watkins Glen. The routes pass by several blocks of homes as {{they follow the}} western base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine</b> and meet {{the east end of}} NY329, which ascends the side of the valley to serve Watkins Glen State Park. NY414 continues to follow NY14 to Watkins Glen's central business district, where NY414 splits from the overlap to travel east at an intersection that also acts as the eastern terminus of NY409. From this point north, NY14 and NY414 follow opposite sides of Seneca Lake, with NY414 running along the east lake shore.|$|E
5|$|The road forks to the {{northeast}} between large buildings and passes beneath Bloor Street, then crosses the Rosedale Ravine. It passes through residential South Rosedale, entering a trench and passing beneath Crescent Road. The road descends into the Yellow Creek ravine (crossing David A. Balfour Park) along the former route of Roxborough Drive, then climbs to pass beneath the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks. It continues to climb along the eastern bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine,</b> entering Moore Park and turning north at St. Clair Avenue East. The road passes through the centre of Mount Pleasant Cemetery, after which it takes its name. It crosses the old Belt Line Railway trail, and winds northeast into Davisville Village.|$|E
50|$|Excavations {{were made}} in 1899 in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> in a Sicel {{necropolis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third period; explorations in the various Greek cemeteries resulted in <b>the</b> discovery <b>of</b> some fine bronzes, notably a lebes.|$|R
50|$|Flatruet is a fell {{in north}} western Härjedalen, Sweden, between Mittådalen in Härjedalens kommun and Ljungdalen. Flatruet {{comprises}} many ravines {{dating back to}} <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice age. <b>The</b> <b>ravines</b> were formed when the ice lake in the Messlingen valley area burst and rushed down into the valley below. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> reside on <b>the</b> south side <b>of</b> Flatruet.|$|R

5|$|On December 16, 1945, Arévalo was {{incapacitated}} for a {{while after}} a car accident. The leaders of the Revolutionary Action Party (PAR), which was the party that supported the government, were afraid that Arana would {{take the opportunity to}} launch a coup and so struck a deal with him, which later {{came to be known as}} the Pacto del Barranco (Pact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ravine).</b> Under the terms of this pact, Arana agreed to refrain from seizing power with the military; in return, the PAR agreed to support Arana's candidacy in the next presidential election, scheduled for November 1950. Arévalo himself recovered swiftly, but was forced to support the agreement. However, by 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana due to his lack of support for labor rights. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana. In 1947 Arana had demanded that certain labor leaders be expelled from the country; Árbenz vocally disagreed with Arana, and the former's intervention limited the number of deportees.|$|E
5|$|The privateers {{arrived at}} Old Panama City on 27 January 1671; they camped {{overnight}} before attacking the following day. They were opposed by approximately 1,200 Spanish infantry and 400 cavalry; most were inexperienced. Morgan sent a 300-strong party of men down a ravine {{that led to}} the foot of a small hill on the Spanish right flank. As they disappeared from view, the Spanish front line thought the privateers were retreating, and the left wing broke rank and chased, followed by the remainder of the defending infantry. They were met with well-organised firing from Morgan's main force of troops. When the party came into view at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine,</b> they were charged by the Spanish cavalry, but organised fire destroyed the cavalry and the party attacked the flank of the main Spanish force. In an effort to disorganise Morgan's forces, the governor of Panama released two herds of oxen and bulls onto the battlefield; scared by the noise of the gunfire, they turned and stampeded over their keepers and some of the remaining Spanish troops. The battle was a rout: the Spanish lost between 400 and 500 men, against 15 privateers killed.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} half of the 15th century, along with Funchal, Machico was {{elevated}} to town (1451) and continued to grow, following the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine</b> into the valley. Two poles developed: the right margin, that included the main barrio and the town's public institutions (municipal chamber, customshouse and church), and the left margin, that included nucleus of Banda d'Além, the Misericórdia (social centre) and Chapel of Christ, now known as the Chapel of Nosso Senhor dos Milagres (Our Lord of Miracles).|$|E
2500|$|In <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> and on <b>the</b> {{mountain}} slopes are copses {{or small}} woods of tabaquillo and mayten, {{called in the}} mountain zone [...] "quebracho", <b>the</b> coexistence <b>of</b> which is a unique biogeographical phenomenon. The tabaquillo has relatives which are distributed <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andes from Venezuela to Argentina, while the mayten originates from <b>the</b> woodlands <b>of</b> south-west Argentina (<b>the</b> cool Andean-Patagonian woodland). <b>The</b> greatest density <b>of</b> these woods is in <b>the</b> bottoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravines,</b> where they acquire a low forest physiognomy with great quantities of ferns and epiphytes. Both the grasslands and <b>the</b> woodlands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pampas and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> respectively are composed of plants of very diverse origins. Some, approaching from <b>the</b> eastern slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountainous area, are native to the Austro-Brazilian region. Other species of specifically Andean origin have in the Pampa de Achala their most southerly distribution. On the other hand, numerous species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> Argentina find in this region their most northerly habitat.|$|R
25|$|The city {{is mostly}} flat or gentle hills {{and the land}} gently slopes upward away from the lake. The flat land is {{interrupted}} by numerous ravines cut by numerous creeks and <b>the</b> valleys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three rivers in Toronto: the Humber River in the west end and the Don River east of downtown at opposite ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Toronto Harbour, and the Rouge River at the city's eastern limits. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> and valley lands in Toronto today are park lands, and recreational trails are laid out along <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> and valleys. <b>The</b> original town was {{laid out in a}} grid plan on the flat plain north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harbour, and this plan was extended outwards as the city grew. The width and depth <b>of</b> several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> and valleys are such that several grid streets such as Finch Avenue, Leslie Street, Lawrence Avenue, and St. Clair Avenue, terminate on one side of a ravine or valley and continue on the other side. Toronto has many bridges spanning <b>the</b> <b>ravines.</b> Large bridges such as the Prince Edward Viaduct were built to span wide river valleys.|$|R
50|$|Early {{settlers}} {{quickly discovered}} that the sandy and gravelly soil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> made them unsuitable for agriculture. They were extensively logged during the nineteenth century, and {{there are very few}} trees in <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> that date to before <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> logging around 1850. The rivers and creeks were also an important source of power for early European settlers, and many mills operated on the rivers in the nineteenth century, with the last closing in 1914.|$|R
25|$|On the far left, Cordellier's {{division}} advanced on Leval and Monceau-Saint-Waast while farther east, Fromentin's division attacked toward Saint-Remy-Chaussée and Saint-Aubin. Bellegarde's cannons {{opened fire}} in mid-morning, starting a mutual bombardment. The French infantry crossed a ravine and grappled {{for possession of}} Saint-Aubin village with a Croatian infantry battalion. In the afternoon Bellegarde launched a counterattack led by Austrian regular infantry, while two regiments of cavalry swept down on the French left flank. The Austrians captured eight French cannon and caused the French to flee to the safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Turambar {{decided to}} ambush the Dragon {{as he crossed}} the ravine of Cabed-en-Aras and to try {{stabbing}} him from beneath. He took two companions with him, Dorlas and Hunthor, but the first deserted them and the other was slain by a stone. Turambar mortally wounded Glaurung with Gurthang, but was hurt by the venom of the Dragon's blood and fell in a swoon. When Níniel came to search for him, Glaurung with his last words undid his spell, and she remembered who she was and realized that Turambar was her brother. Horrified, Nienor cast herself over the brink <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine</b> into the river Taeglin and died.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{entering}} {{the town of}} Leon, US62 veers slightly northeastward to run along {{the base of a}} small valley surrounding Mud Creek. The two entities separate at the hamlet of Leon, and US62 returns northward, descending {{the eastern side of the}} Conewango Creek valley and becoming the eastern valley road once again. Just before crossing into the town of Dayton, US62 leaves the edge of the valley and heads northward through the gully. Here, it crosses over Conewango Creek once more and intersects NY322. At the northern extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine,</b> US62 turns northeastward toward the community of Dayton, the site of its junction with NY353.|$|E
25|$|Since ravines {{were often}} formed by <b>the</b> union <b>of</b> several thalwegs upstream, <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> which {{tributary}} to keep as the boundary marker between plots of land up high {{was not always}} easy and often led to disputes. This problem was aggravated {{by the fact that}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> in question had several names, which made for a possible source of confusion.|$|R
50|$|As {{an ancient}} river community, {{the region was}} {{conditioned}} by a privileged position: it {{had access to the}} sea and interior territory, across many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> and rivers that cross the region and protected by a dominant mountain. Alvor was, since this early period, a reference for many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller populations that developed along the eastern maritime coast east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Arade.|$|R

25|$|Piers Gill runs {{below the}} eastern crags of Lingmell {{in a deep}} ravine, {{one of the finest}} in the District. Averaging about 30ft, but much deeper in places, it pursues an L-shaped course down the {{fellside}} before emerging from its cutting to merge with Greta Gill. The scenery of Piers Gill and Lingmell from the Corridor Route ascent of Scafell Pike is remarkable and a faint path follows the eastern bank of the gill giving even more intimate views. The ravine appears to offer access at either end, but ordinary walkers should on no account attempt to follow it. Crossings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine</b> should also be considered impossible for the average hiker.|$|E
25|$|Little {{remains of}} the castle {{features}} except the waist-high battlements, that served little more than lookout {{to the city of}} Angra. A double staircase connects the main platform from the path leading to the Gardens. Gardened and manicured, the spaces below the old castle are lined by endemic and flowering plants. Apart from the monument to D. Pedro IV, the only remnant to the fortifications use is an azulejo tile dedicated to the Fort of São Luís located in the staircase. Remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine</b> canalization and mills are evident in the roads that lead from the park grounds, including along the Rua do Pisão, Rua do Garoupinha and Rua de Santo Espírito.|$|E
25|$|Grenier {{instructed}} Quesnel to {{form the}} center column in two lines with skirmishers out in front. His objective was to get soldiers onto {{the east side of}} the Bärenthal ravine. Schmitz, who fought under the eye of his division commander Rouyer, was also ordered to form his men into two lines. He was to clear Mittel- and Ober-Feistritz of enemies so that the French soldiers could fire on the Austrian soldiers on the east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine.</b> Off to the right, Campi already had instructions to assist the attacks of the center and left columns as well as to attack the Austrians from the rear. From Jesenice in the upper Sava valley, Eugène directed two battalions of the Italian Guard to move north and clear away any Austrian outposts to the south of Feistritz.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{quantifying}} explicitly <b>the</b> sediment budget <b>of</b> deeply incised <b>ravines</b> in <b>the</b> lower Le Sueur River watershed, in southern Minnesota. High-rate-gully-erosion equations {{along with the}} Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) were implemented in a numerical modeling approach {{that is based on}} a time-integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sediment balance equations. The model estimates <b>the</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>ravine</b> width and depth change and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> sediment periodically flushing from <b>the</b> <b>ravines.</b> Components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sediment budget <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> were simulated with the model and results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>ravine</b> walls are <b>the</b> major sediment source in <b>the</b> <b>ravines.</b> A sensitivity analysis revealed that <b>the</b> erodibility coefficients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gully bed and wall, the local slope angle and the Manning’s coefficient are the key parameters controlling <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> sediment production. Recommendations to guide further monitoring efforts in the watershed and increased detail modeling approaches are highlighted {{as a result of this}} modeling effort. ...|$|R
25|$|On the {{southeast}} {{side of the}} streambed opposite the sacred spring are the remains of an unusually well-preserved clepsydra. This instrument {{is important in the}} study of ancient methods of timekeeping in that it is an example of an inflow water clock. Since an inflow clock measures time by the filling of a known volume from a constant rate of inflow, it is much more accurate than an outflow water clock in measuring the gradations between full and empty. The clepsydra was composed of a central, square reservoir with a steep stairway on the south side to allow access to the bronze plug {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir. Domestic structures for the operation of the sanctuary are closely packed along {{the southeast}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine,</b> both north and south of the clepsydra.|$|E
25|$|The {{deaths of}} Colonel William R. Creighton and Lieutenant Colonel Orrin J. Crane {{similarly}} {{led to an}} outpouring of grief in Cleveland. Creighton was in temporary command of the 1st Brigade of the 2nd Division of XII Corps at the Battle of Ringgold Gap on November 27, 1863. Crane led his men through a deep ravine, suffering significant casualties. He {{was shot and killed}} as his remaining men neared the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine</b> and safety. Creighton attempted to reach Crane, and himself was mortally wounded. On December 2, 1863, the Cleveland City Council set aside several lots in Section 14 at Woodland Cemetery for the burial of Creighton, Crane, and their immediate family members. Both men were temporarily laid to rest in a vault at the Erie Street Cemetery while monumental headstones were fashioned for them. They were permanently buried at Woodland Cemetery on July 3, 1864.|$|E
25|$|Sacken posted Tallisin's corps to {{the south}} with the 7th Division {{on the right and}} the 18th Division in the center.

25|$|After {{some time}} of peace, Glaurung returns to exterminate {{the men of}} Brethil. Turambar leads an {{expedition}} to cut him off, and stabs Glaurung from beneath while the dragon is crossing a ravine. As Glaurung is dying on the bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine,</b> Turambar pulls his sword from the dragon's belly, and blood spurts onto his hand and burns him. Overwhelmed with pain and fatigue, he faints. Niënor finds him and mistakes his swoon for death. In a last effort of malice Glaurung opens his eyes and informs her that she and Turambar are brother and sister. Glaurung then dies, and his spell of forgetfulness passes from Niënor. Remembering her entire life and knowing that her unborn child was begotten in incest, she throws herself from the nearby cliff into the river Taeglin and is washed away. When Turambar wakes, Brandir informs him of Niënor's death and of their true relationship as siblings, as he had overheard the dragon's words. Mablung confirms Brandir's tale, and Turambar takes his own life upon his sword.|$|E
25|$|Hood {{departed}} from Gadsden on October 22, {{en route to}} Guntersville, Alabama, where he planned to cross the Tennessee River. Learning that that crossing place was strongly guarded, and concerned that Federal gunboats could destroy any pontoon bridge he might deploy, he impulsively changed his destination to Decatur, 40 miles west. When Hood arrived at Decatur on October 26, he found that a Federal infantry force of 35,000 men was defending an entrenched line that included two forts and 1,600 yards of rifle pits. Two Federal wooden gunboats patrolled the river. On October 28, Confederate skirmishers advanced through a dense fog to a ravine within 800 yards of the main fortifications. Around noon, a small Federal detachment drove the sharpshooters and skirmishers out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine,</b> capturing 125 men. Hood, concluding {{that he could not}} afford the casualties that would ensue from a full-scale assault, withdrew his army. He decided once again to move to the west, to attempt another crossing near Tuscumbia, Alabama, where Muscle Shoals would prevent interference by Federal gunboats.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon {{ordered the}} tired {{soldiers}} of Ricard and Meunier {{back into the}} battle for Marchais. The emperor sent Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre with two battalions of Old Guard Foot Chasseurs to cut off Marchais from the north. Ricard organized a four-battalion attack from the hamlet of Pomesson in the south. Lefebvre's two battalions captured L'Épine-aux-Bois. Though the French achieved local artillery superiority, the Russians in Marchais continued to resist until 5:00 pm when {{they were forced to}} relinquish control of the village and pull back. When they reached the west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravine,</b> Defrance's cavalry charged into them, inflicting heavy losses on the brigades of Dietrich and Blagovenzenko. Several hundred Russian skirmishers near Marchais were either cut down or captured. Realizing that without control of Marchais, the battle was lost, Sacken began pulling back his artillery from the right wing toward the center. Near the highway, Russian infantry squares were charged by French cavalry, but they were able to escape when their own cavalry intervened. The Sophia Regiment was completely engulfed by French cavalry but fought its way clear.|$|E
25|$|At its {{northern}} end is {{a remnant of}} Wendigo Creek, Wendigo Pond and a children's playground. The creek, pond and Wendigo Way are likely named after the wendigo, mythical cannibalistic creatures of Algonquian mythology. Algonquins {{did not have a}} settlement in the park, but are believed to have used it for hunting and fishing and cultivating corn on <b>the</b> sandy uplands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park. <b>The</b> <b>ravine</b> extending north along the creek at one time extended north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park, past Bloor Street. <b>The</b> <b>ravine</b> was filled in to provide for an extension of Bloor Street, and for housing development north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{moderately}} dense {{population of}} metropolitan Hamilton, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ravines</b> {{have been left}} close to their natural state.

During the late summer, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller ones will slow to a trickle. During the spring and after major storms, the creeks often overflow their banks and flood the marshy lands that surround most of them. Many of these <b>ravines</b> located on <b>the</b> Stoney Creek, Ontario section of Hamilton have small human intervention like tunnels in them allowing the water to flow through so a road can exist above. Other human intervention includes parks, trails, nearby houses, and even small factories or warehouses nearby although they are not used to extract water or dump their wastes.|$|R
