40|$|Platanthera holochila (Hbd.) Krzl. [syn = Peristylus holochila (Hbd) N. Hallé] is {{the rarest}} of three orchids endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago. As of 2011, 33 {{individual}} plants of this U. S. Federally endangered species remained on three islands {{with only one}} specimen known to occur on Kauai. This paper presents a summary of experiments aimed at cultivating this species from seed leading to the reintroduction of seedlings. We describe: 1) the mycorrhizal <b>fungi</b> acquired <b>from</b> P. holochila protocorms on Molokai, 2) the role of light vs. dark pretreatment on symbiotic seed germination using a mycorrhizal <b>fungus</b> <b>from</b> <b>Florida,</b> and 3) asymbiotic germination on three media (Murashige and Skoog, Knudson C, P 723). Protocorms recovered in situ using seed packets yielded seven strains of a mycorrhizal fungus assignable to the anamorphic genus Epulorhiza Moore, {{but none of these}} strains prompted seed germination in vitro. Using the mycorrhizal <b>fungus</b> <b>from</b> <b>Florida,</b> no significant differences were detected between light pre-treatment vs. dark incubation on seed germination or development, but statistical differences were evident among two agar types tested. Seeds sown on acidified (pH 5. 0) asymbiotic medium P 723 (PhytoTechnology Labs) developed to the leaf-bearing stage 351 days after sowing and incubation in darkness at 16 – 19 °C. Seedlings illuminated 451 days after sowing were eventually established on soil in a greenhouse (ex vitro). A total of 85 seedlings were promptly transported to Hawaii in March 2011. A minimum of 3. 1 years is required for the propagation of P. holochila from seed using acidified asymbiotic medium P 723...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of inoculation of beech and oak stumps with a biological preparation of <b>oyster</b> <b>fungus</b> (Pleurotus ostreatus) mycelium. The inoculum was grown on a sawdust substrate at Warsaw University of Life Sciences Department of Mycology and Forest Phytopathology. The experiment was set up at the Forest Experimental Station in Rogów. Stumps were inoculated: i) immediately after tree felling or ii) at approximately 5 and 12 months after felling. A total of 60 beech stumps and 50 oak stumps were inoculated in the years 2002 - 2004. The infected stumps were then inspected for the presence of the mycelium and fruiting bodies of P. ostreatus. The presence of fruiting bodies of other wood-decaying fungi was also noted. The extent of rotting was determined macroscopically, with the causal agent being confirmed on the basis of isolation and identification of mycelium from fragments of colonized wood obtained <b>from</b> rooted-out stumps. <b>Oyster</b> <b>fungus</b> mycelium was found to colonise beech stumps much more effectively than oak stumps. Stumps inoculated immediately after, or five months after felling were more effectively colonized by the mycelium than those inoculated after one year. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R
40|$|Summary – Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} various trapping and endoparasitic nematophagous <b>fungi</b> (NF) isolated <b>from</b> <b>Florida</b> citrus orchards on five entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) species that show various distributions across Florida’s citrus industry. Four trapping NF (Arthrobotrys oligospora, A. dactyloides, A. musiformis and Gamsylella gephyropaga) and two endoparasitic NF (Catenaria sp. and Myzocytium sp.) were tested against Steinernema diaprepesi (Sd), S. glaseri (Sg), S. riobrave (Sr), Heterorhabditis zealandica (Hz) and H. indica (Hi). Fungi were added to soil microcosms either as a pure culture on agar plugs (trapping NF) or as fungal-colonised nematodes (endoparasitic NF) on agar plugs, concurrently with 2000 EPN of a given species. After 7 or 14 days exposure, nematodes were recovered from the soil using Baermann funnels. The recovery of all EPN species was reduced between 56 - 92 % by G. gephyropaga. Neither Sd or Sg were affected by any species of Arthrobotrys, whereas A. musiformis reduced recovery of all other EPN and A. oligospora reduced numbers of all other species except Hi. Both endoparasitic NF reduced the recovery of all EPN except Hi by at least 82 %. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that NF {{may play a role in}} regulating regional patterns of abundance and diversity of EPN species in Florida, which in turn regulate the abundance of a major citrus pest, the Diaprepes root weevil, Diaprepes abbreviatus...|$|R

30|$|The {{mycorrhizal}} <b>fungi</b> were re-isolated <b>from</b> the D. officinale roots {{after two}} months of inoculation. As expected, no <b>fungus</b> was isolated <b>from</b> the non-inoculated orchids. We then sequenced the ITS- 5.8 S rDNA sequences of the re-isolated <b>fungus</b> <b>from</b> the roots inoculated with S 1 {{as well as the}} mtLSU sequences of the re-isolated <b>fungus</b> <b>from</b> the S 3 -inoculated roots and verified that these fungi were the same as those used for the first inoculations (data unpublished).|$|R
