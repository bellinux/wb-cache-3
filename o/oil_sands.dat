5|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>sands</b> in Alberta have {{a proven}} reserve of , {{the second largest}} proven {{reserves}} of crude oil in the world. They have become the largest source of oil imported into the United States. With significant economic development and investment into the <b>oil</b> <b>sands,</b> the industry has been enjoying strong support by both the province's government and the federal government. However, the industry has also been subject to criticism due to {{the environmental impacts of}} bitumen exploitation. While the industry has attempted to resolve these issues by developing new techniques, such as in situ extraction, environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace, have launched campaigns to delegitimize the resource, based on its greenhouse gas emission records.|$|E

5|$|Stelmach's premiership {{was heavily}} focused on {{management}} of the province's oil reserves, especially those of the Athabasca <b>Oil</b> <b>Sands.</b> He rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace of development in the Fort McMurray area, and similarly opposed calls for carbon taxes. Other policy initiatives included commencing {{an overhaul of the}} province's health governance system, amendments to the Alberta human rights code, a re-introduction of all-party committees to the Legislature, and the conclusion of a major labour agreement with Alberta's teachers. His government also attracted controversy for awarding itself a 30% pay increase shortly after its re-election, and featured strained relations with Calgary, one of Klein's former strongholds. Despite this, Stelmach increased the Progressive Conservatives' already substantial majority in the 2008 election. With the advent of the late-2000s recession, Stelmach had to cope with a deteriorating economic situation and the Alberta government's first budget deficit in 16 years.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process for the recovery of bitumen from an <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> comprising the following phases in succession: (a) mixing an <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> with a diluent capable of reducing the viscosity and density of the bitumen contained in said <b>oil</b> <b>sand,</b> obtaining a first mixture (slurry) comprising diluted bitumen; (b) mixing said slurry with a basic aqueous solution (BAS) possibly containing salts to increase its ionic strength, capable of removing said diluted bitumen from said <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> containing it, obtaining a second mixture (BAS-slurry) which can be separated into (i) a liquid phase comprising said diluted bitumen, a fraction of <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> free of the bitumen removed and water; (ii) a sediment comprising the remaining fraction of said <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> free of the bitumen removed, water and residual hydrocarbons which can be eliminated by subsequent washings; (c) separating a liquid phase comprising said diluted bitumen removed, from said BAS-slurry mixture; (d) recovering, from said liquid phase separated in phase (c), the removed diluted bitumen contained therein...|$|R
30|$|The {{reaction}} {{behavior of}} <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> from Inner Mongolia (China) were studied in a fluidized-bed pyrolysis process, and a comparative {{study was conducted}} on the properties of the liquid products obtained through fluidized-bed pyrolysis of <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> and the native bitumen obtained by solvent extraction. The results indicated that the fluidized-bed pyrolysis, a feasible carbon rejection process, can be used to upgrade <b>oil</b> <b>sand.</b> The reaction temperature and time were found to be the key operating parameters affecting the product distribution and yields in fluidized-bed pyrolysis of <b>oil</b> <b>sand.</b> The optimal temperature was 490 °C and the most suitable reaction time was 5 min. Under these operation conditions, the maximum yield of liquid product was 80 wt%. In addition, the pyrolysis kinetics of <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> at different heating rates of 5, 10, 20 and 30 °C/min was investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA).|$|R
5|$|Canada {{is one of}} the few {{developed}} nations that are net exporters of energy. Atlantic Canada possesses vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources. The vastness of the Athabasca <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> and other assets results in Canada having a 13% share of global oil reserves, comprising the world's third-largest share after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains. Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports; the country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal and lead. Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber. Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the three major Canadian <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> in Alberta, there is a fourth major <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> deposit in Canada, the Melville Island <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> in the Canadian Arctic islands, which are too remote to expect commercial production in the foreseeable future.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{production}} {{began in}} 1967 when Great Canadian <b>Oil</b> <b>Sands</b> (now Suncor) launched the world's first major <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> mine. Syncrude opened {{the second major}} facility in 1978. The third, by Shell Canada, started in 2003. The oil price increases of 2004-2007 made the <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> much more profitable, and by 2007 over $100 billion worth of new mines and thermal projects were under construction or on the drawing boards. Royal Dutch Shell announced that in 2006 its Canadian <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> operations were almost twice as profitable on a per-barrel basis as its international conventional oil operations and in July 2007, it announced it would start a massive $27 billion expansion of its <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> plants in Alberta.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{work was}} aimed {{to study the}} {{pyrolysis}} behaviour and mechanisms of Buton <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> via both experimentation and kinetic analysis. The non-isothermal pyrolysis experiments of the <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> and its main organic component, bitumen, were carried out using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) operating at various heating rates of 2, 5, 10 and 20 Kmin− 1 from room temperature to 823 K and in a nitrogen atmosphere. The activation energy of the <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> pyrolysis was estimated using an integral model-free method based on the TGA experimental data. The {{results showed that the}} content of the bitumen in the <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> was approximately 18 % by weight and the pyrolysis process of the bitumen completed at 823 K regardless of the heating rate. The calculated activation energy strongly depended on the degree of pyrolysis conversion (ranging from 100 kJmol− 1 to 250 kJmol− 1). Good agreement between the kinetic modelling and experimental data of dependence of conversion degree on temperature was obtained, suggesting that the integral model-free method can serve as an effective tool to predict the pyrolysis behaviour of the <b>oil</b> <b>sand...</b>|$|R

40|$|Canada {{has chosen}} to define its 174 billion barrels of <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> bitumen {{reserves}} as crude oil deposits, putting the country {{on a par with}} Saudi Arabia in potential oil production. However, the physical and economic definition of calling <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> bitumen crude <b>oil</b> needs to be questioned. On the face of it, these definitions make Canada look as powerful as OPEC's leading producer, or Russia, on the world oil market. However, a fuller analysis shows that Canadian <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> is quite different from crude oil and that Canada will have little if any effect on the global oil market, or on OPEC.

25|$|The Cold Lake <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> are {{northeast}} of Alberta's capital, Edmonton, {{near the border}} with Saskatchewan. A {{small portion of the}} Cold Lake deposit lies in Saskatchewan. Although smaller than the Athabasca <b>oil</b> <b>sands,</b> the Cold Lake <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> are important because some of the oil is fluid enough to be extracted by conventional methods. The Cold Lake bitumen contains more alkanes and less asphaltenes than the other major Alberta <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> and the oil is more fluid. As a result, cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) is commonly used for production.|$|E
25|$|Except for a {{fraction}} of the extra-heavy oil or bitumen which can be extracted by conventional oil well technology, <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> must be produced by strip mining or the oil made to flow into wells using sophisticated in-situ techniques. These methods usually use more water and require larger amounts of energy than conventional oil extraction. While much of Canada's <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> are being produced using open-pit mining, approximately 90% of Canadian <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> and all of Venezuela's <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> are too far below the surface to use surface mining.|$|E
25|$|The Peace River <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> {{located in}} northwest-central Alberta are the {{smallest}} of the three major <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> deposits in Alberta. The Peace River <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> lie generally in the watershed of the Peace River, the largest river in Alberta. The Peace and Athabasca rivers, which are by far the largest rivers in Alberta, flow through their respective <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> and merge at Lake Athabasca to form the Slave River, which flows into the MacKenzie River, one of the largest rivers in the world. All of the water from these rivers flow into the Arctic Ocean.|$|E

25|$|Shortages {{of natural}} gas for project fuel were {{forecast}} {{to be a problem}} for Canadian <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> production a few years ago, but recent increases in US shale gas production have eliminated much of the problem for North America. With the increasing use of hydraulic fracturing making US largely self-sufficient in natural gas and exporting more natural gas to Eastern Canada to replace Alberta gas, the Alberta government is using its powers under the NAFTA and the Canadian Constitution to reduce shipments {{of natural gas}} to the US and Eastern Canada, and divert the gas to domestic Alberta use, particularly for <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> fuel. The natural gas pipelines to the east and south are being converted to carry increasing <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> production to these destinations instead of gas. Canada also has huge undeveloped shale gas deposits in addition to those of the US, so natural gas for future <b>oil</b> <b>sands</b> production {{does not seem to be}} a serious problem.
