40|$|For {{applications}} like segmentation, {{feature extraction}} and classification of point sets {{it is essential}} to know the principal curvatures and the corresponding principal directions. For the purpose of curvature estimation conformal geometric algebra promises to be a natural mathematical language: Local curvatures can be described with the help of <b>osculating</b> <b>circles</b> or spheres. On one hand, conformal geometric algebra is able to directly compute with these geometric objects, as well as with lines and planes needed for the description of vanishing curvature. On the other hand, distance measures for fitting these objects into point sets can be handled in a linear way, leading to efficient algorithms. In this paper we use conformal geometric algebra advantageously in order to locally compute continuous curvatures as well as principal curvatures of point sets without the need of costly pre-processing of raw data. We show results on artificial and real data. Numerical verification on artificial data shows the accuracy of our approach. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple second-order, curvature based mobility analysis of planar curves in contact. The underlying theory deals with penetration and separation of curves with multiple contacts, based on relative configuration of <b>osculating</b> <b>circles</b> at points of contact for a second-order rotation about each {{point of the}} plane. Geometric and analytical treatment of mobility analysis is presented for generic as well as special contact geometries. For objects with a single contact, partitioning of the plane into four types of mobility regions has been shown. Using point based composition operations based on dual-number matrices, analysis has been extended to computationally handle multiple contacts scenario. A novel color coded directed line has been proposed to capture the contact scenario. Multiple contacts mobility is obtained through intersection of the mobility half-spaces. It is derived that mobility region comprises a pair of unbounded or a single bounded convex polygon. The theory {{has been used for}} analysis and synthesis of form closure configurations, revolute and prismatic kinematic pairs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
