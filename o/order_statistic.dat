Affine <b>order</b> [...] <b>statistic</b> filters operate effectively {{on a wide}} range of signal statistics, are sensitive to the dispersion of the observed data, and are therefore particularly useful in the processing of nonstationary signals. These properties result from the introduction of a tunable affinity function that measures the affinity, or closeness, of observation samples in their natural order to their corresponding order [...] statistics. The obtained affinity measures are utilized to control the influence of individual samples in the filtering process.

40|$|Abstract. In this contribution, KNIH {{algorithm}} and <b>Ordered</b> <b>Statistic</b> Decoding (OSD) algorithm are investigated, {{based on}} which, a novel KNIH-OSD parallel decoding scheme for LDPC codes is proposed. KNIH decoding algorithm processes certain LRPs of a received sequence, while OSD algorithm processes certain MRIPs of a received sequence. If {{there are too}} many errors in MRIPs, the OSD algorithm will fail, on the contrary, if {{there are too many}} errors in LRPs, the KNIH algorithm will fail. This contribution proposes a parallel decoding scheme based on the complementary characteristic of these two algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is feasible and effective. Compared with OSD and KNIH algorithm, the decoding performance is improved. ...|$|R

In this project, a web-based book ordering and system is developed for Petakom. Currently, FSKKP students in UMP are ordering book from Petakom manually. This method is time consuming and inconvenient for them. Besides that, lecturers in UMP are ordering their book for class through Faculty. This method is slow and inconvenient. On the other hand, Petakom is managing the book ordering manually. Hence, this system is developed to provide a solution for lecturer and student to order the personal and book for class from Petakom. At the same time, this system allows Petakom to manage the book ordering. Through this system, student and lecturer can order the books conveniently.

40|$|Despite the NP {{hardness}} {{of acquiring}} minimum distance $d_m$ for linear codes theoretically, {{in this paper}} we propose one experimental method of finding minimum-weight codewords, the weight of which is equal to $d_m$ for LDPC codes. One existing syndrome decoding method, called serial belief propagation (BP) with <b>ordered</b> <b>statistic</b> decoding (OSD), is adapted to serve our purpose. We hold the conjecture that among many candidate error patterns in OSD reprocessing, modulo 2 addition of the lightest error pattern with one of the left error patterns may generate a light codeword. When the decoding syndrome changes to all-zero state, the lightest error pattern reduces to all-zero, the lightest non-zero error pattern is a valid codeword to update lightest codeword list. Given sufficient codewords sending, the survived lightest codewords are likely to be the target. Compared with existing techniques, our method demonstrates its efficiency in the simulation of several interested LDPC codes. Comment: 8 pages, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of rare event probabilities using importance sampling (IS) is studied in this paper. A new method is {{suggested in the}} context of iid sums which makes full use of the form of the component density function of the sum. It is proved that this results in an estimation technique that enhances the power of IS biasing methods which do not explicitly use this knowledge. The method is suitable for finite sums. Optimization of the scheme and its performance are illustrated through example and asymptotic analysis and new asymptotic expansions for tail probability are given. This technique facilitates solution of the inverse IS problem. The inverse problem is one of finding a number or threshold that is exceeded by a random variable or sum with a given probability. It turns out that with a suitably decreasing threshold the simulation gain becomes asymptotically constant. These methods are then applied to CFAR detection algorithms.

30|$|In this paper, a new CFAR {{detector}} {{based on}} a switching algorithm and OS-CFAR for nonhomogeneous background environments is introduced. The new detector is named Switching <b>Ordered</b> <b>Statistic</b> CFAR type I (SOS CFAR I). The SOS CFAR I selects a set of suitable cells {{and then with the}} help of the ordering method, estimates the unknown background noise level. The proposed detector does not require any prior information about the background environment and uses cells with similar statistical specifications to estimate the background noise. The performance of SOS CFAR I is evaluated and compared with other detectors such as CA-CFAR, GO-CFAR, SO-CFAR, and OS-CFAR for the Swerling I target model in homogeneous and nonhomogeneous noise environments such as those with multiple interference and clutter edges. The results show that SOS CFAR I detectors considerably reduce the problem of excessive false alarm probability near clutter edges while maintaining good performance in other environments. Also, simulation results confirm the achievement of an optimum detection threshold in homogenous and nonhomogeneous radar environments by the mentioned processor.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the {{increasing}} demand on processing streaming data with high throughput and low latency {{has led to the}} development of specialized stream processing engines (SPE). Although existing SPEs show high performance in evaluating stateless operations and stateful operations with small windows, their performance degrades significantly when calculating exact answers for complex aggregate queries with huge windows. Examples include correlated aggregations, quantile and <b>ordering</b> <b>statistic</b> computation. Meanwhile, modern database systems have demonstrated the ability of processing complex analytical tasks efficiently over very large datasets, using technologies such as vertical storage, vectorized query execution, etc. This suggests the feasibility of leveraging database systems to assist SPEs to process complex aggregate queries to reduce their evaluation latency. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of combining database systems with SPEs in the context of stream processing so as to improve the overall query evaluation performance. To this end, the following two major topics will be addressed in this thesis: (1) dynamic migration of complex aggregate operations between the SPE and the database in response to varying system load and (2) efficient evaluation of continuous queries over streaming data that is migrated to the database...|$|R
40|$|Radar {{detection}} procedures {{involve the}} comparison of the received signal amplitud to a threshold. In order to obtain a constant false alarm rate (CFAR), an adaptative threshold must be applied reflecting the local clutter situation. This paper discusses the cell averaging and <b>ordered</b> <b>statistic</b> approaches for single receivers and presents a recursive formulation of an algorithm that permits for a system formed by N different CFAR detectors and a fixed level of false alarm in the data fusion center, to test the different intermediate fusion rules between the OR and AND rules, rules of rank K, with 1 = < K = < N, to obtain the rank K that maximizes the detection probability in the fusion center. The threshold values Ti of each CFAR detector, are calculated {{as a function of}} the probability of false alarm and decision rule (rank K) used in the fusion center. The algorithm also permits us to consider the receivers {{as a function of the}}ir quality or of the quality of the channel that connects them to the fusion center. The performances of the different procedures are shown in several figures. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Aiming at {{bridging}} {{the gap between the}} maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) and the suboptimal iterative decodings for short or medium length LDPC codes, we present a generalized <b>ordered</b> <b>statistic</b> decoding (OSD) in the form of syndrome decoding, to cascade with the belief propagation (BP) or enhanced min-sum decoding. The OSD is invoked only when the decoding failures are obtained for the preceded iterative decoding method. With respect to the existing OSD which is based on the accumulated log-likelihood ratio (LLR) metric, we extend the accumulative metric to the situation where the BP decoding is in the probability domain. Moreover, after generalizing the accumulative metric to the context of the normalized or offset min-sum decoding, the OSD shows appealing tradeoff between performance and complexity. In the OSD implementation, when deciding the true error pattern among many candidates, an alternative proposed proves to be effective {{to reduce the number of}} real additions without performance loss. Simulation results demonstrate that the cascade connection of enhanced minsum and OSD decodings outperforms the BP alone significantly, in terms of either performance or complexity. 1 Generalized reliability-based syndrome decoding for LDPC codes I...|$|R
