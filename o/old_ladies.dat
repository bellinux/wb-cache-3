5|$|Julianna Helt {{from the}} Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found that time travel forms a central theme as Miranda {{constantly}} wonders how time travel could be possible. In When You Reach Me, Marcus helps Miranda {{realize that the}} three <b>old</b> <b>ladies</b> from A Wrinkle in Time lied to Meg by promising they would return five minutes before they left. Marcus explains:"So the garden is where they appear when they get {{home at the end}} of the book. Remember? They land in the broccoli. So if they had gotten home five minutes before they left, like those ladies promised they would, then they would have seen themselves get back. Before they did".|$|E

Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry a Bible wherever they went. Mackay remained minister on St Kilda for 24 years.|$|E

25|$|Adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom was {{not made}} a {{requirement}} for entry into LDS Church temples until 1902. However, even then, church president Joseph F. Smith encouraged stake presidents to be liberal with old men who used tobacco and <b>old</b> <b>ladies</b> who drank tea. Of those who violated the revelation, it was mainly habitual drunkards that {{were excluded from the}} temple. Around the turn of the century, the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom were not strictly adhered to by such notable church leaders. Anthon H. Lund, a First Counselor in the First Presidency, drank beer and wine; apostle Matthias F. Cowley drank beer and wine; Charles W. Penrose, who also served as a First Counselor in the First Presidency, drank wine; Relief Society general president Emmeline B. Wells drank coffee; and church president George Albert Smith drank brandy for medicinal purposes. In 1921, church president Heber J.

A full chorus line called the Sepia Revue featured 12 showgirls dressed in [...] "black high heels, skimpy, sequined dresses, long boas and feathered headgear" [...] dancing with more and more abandon as the [...] "red hot" [...] house band backed them up. Another chorus line called Beige Beauties also performed artistic dance numbers. There was no applause at the club.

He made friends with the press and radio, he {{went out of his}} way to be congenial and likable." [...] Bullock indicated that regardless of the tactics used, Nixon would likely have beaten the incumbent given the national Republican tide that swept the party into power in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1931.|$|E

500|$|Coward was {{homosexual}} but, {{following the}} convention of his times, this was never publicly mentioned.

No private considerations have been allowed to deflect the drive of his career; like Gielgud and Rattigan, like the late Ivor Novello, he is a congenital bachelor." [...] Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering [...] "any sexual activities when over-advertised" [...] to be tasteless. Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, [...] "There are still a few <b>old</b> <b>ladies</b> in Worthing who don't know." [...] Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.|$|E
500|$|Their bickering and {{personality}} differences were {{often used for}} comic effect; however, in episode 248 of the show, scriptwriter Colin Brake notes that viewers were shown a different side to Ethel and Dot's friendship in the soaps second two-hander episode. The episode aired in July 1987 and featured just the two <b>old</b> <b>ladies</b> (although Dot was Ethel's junior by twenty years or so). Brake has described the episode as a [...] "mini-play about nostalgia and growing old", adding that [...] "some viewers found it too unusual, but many others were charmed by the change of pace". According to Brake, the episode gave Franklin and Brown the opportunity to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Ethel and Dot. The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by Mike Gibbon, a future producer of the show. Author Christine Geraghty has used the episode {{as an example of}} the fact that [...] "female conversation is the backbone to traditional soap".|$|E
500|$|Trollope's preface {{suggests}} that he anticipated controversy from the depiction of Carry Brattle in [...] The Vicar of Bullhampton. This did not happen. [...] The Times declared it [...] "a nice, easy, safe reading book for <b>old</b> <b>ladies</b> and young ladies... welcome in all well-regulated families". Contemporary reviewers tended to neglect the Carry Brattle subplot and focus on Mary Lowther, whose conduct was criticised by Blackwood's Magazine, by The Times, and by Mrs. Oliphant. The Saturday Review complained that [...] " [...] sort of savageness pervades the book", and that [...] "obody is pleasant", and described the novel as [...] "third-rate" [...] and as a [...] "not very satisfactory book". This was {{in keeping with the}} reaction of many readers and reviewers who had grown accustomed to the wholesome tone and genteel characters of the Barchester novels, and were not happy with the darker and more pessimistic tone of Trollope's later works.|$|E

500|$|In late 1963, Eastwood's co-star on Rawhide, Eric Fleming, {{rejected}} {{an offer}} to star in an Italian-made western called A Fistful of Dollars, to be directed in a remote region of Spain by the then relatively unknown Sergio Leone. Richard Harrison suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his Rawhide image. Eastwood signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for elevenweeks' work, with a bonus of a Mercedes automobile upon completion. Eastwood later spoke of {{the transition from a}} television western to A Fistful of Dollars: [...] "In Rawhide I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses <b>old</b> <b>ladies</b> and dogs and was kind to everybody. I {{decided it was time to}} be an anti-hero." [...] Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the [...] "mask" [...] he was attempting to create for the loner character.|$|E
500|$|During the mid-twenties Walpole {{produced}} {{two of his}} best-known novels in the macabre vein that he drew on from time to time, exploring the fascination of fear and cruelty. The <b>Old</b> <b>Ladies</b> (1924) is a study of a timid elderly spinster exploited and eventually frightened to death by a predatory widow. Portrait of a Man with Red Hair (1925) depicts the malign influence of a manipulative, insane father on his family and others. Walpole described it to his fellow author Frank Swinnerton as [...] "a simple shocker which it has amused me like anything to write, and won't bore you to read." [...] In contrast he continued a series of stories for children, begun in 1919 with Jeremy, taking the young hero's story forward with Jeremy and Hamlet (the latter being the boy's dog) in 1923, and Jeremy at Crale in 1927. Sadleir, writing in the 1950s, suggests that [...] "the most real Walpole of all– because the most unselfconscious, kindly, and understanding friend– is the Walpole of the Jeremy trilogy." [...] Of his other novels of the 1920s Wintersmoon (1928), his first attempt at a full-length love story, portrays a clash between traditionalism and modernism: his own sympathies, though not spelled out, were clearly with the traditionalists.|$|E
500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer. Among some officers' later recounting of the speech, bullshit would be replaced by baloney and fucking by fornicating. At least one account replaced [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the balls" [...] with [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the nose." [...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known {{that the two men}} were polar opposites in personality, and there is considerable evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, [...] "When I want my men to remember something important, to really make it stick, I give it to them double dirty. It may not sound nice to a bunch of little <b>old</b> <b>ladies,</b> at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You can't run an army without profanity, {{and it has to be}} eloquent profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight its way out of a piss-soaked paper bag." ...|$|E

500|$|Between March and May 1970 Morrison {{began work}} on the album at the A {{recording}} studios in New York City. He intended to create a full a capella record, and {{with this in mind}} assembled a vocal group he called the Street Choir, consisting of his friends Dahaud Shaar, Larry Goldsmith, Andrew Robinson and then wife, Janet [...] "Planet" [...] Rigsbee, who all lived near Woodstock. He had wanted the choir to feature only four vocalists, but was persuaded to allow two additional members to join: the wives of Keith Johnson and Jack Schroer (Martha Velez and Ellen Schroer). However, Morrison was later persuaded to abandon the use of a cappella: [...] "I had a group of people in mind for the Street Choir... I asked them if they wanted to sing... then the <b>old</b> <b>ladies</b> got involved and it ruined the whole thing." [...] He was unhappy with the tracks recorded with the choir, as he wanted to use the group for a different effect: [...] "I wanted these certain guys to form an a cappella group so that I could cut a lot of songs with just maybe one guitar. But it didn't turn out." [...] During this session Morrison recorded the same tracks used for the demo session in Woodstock, as well as [...] "Gypsy Queen" [...] and an additional instrumental, six of which were used on Street Choir. Elliot Scheiner was used as the engineer for this session, after he helped to produce Moondance. However, according to biographer Clinton Heylin, Scheiner and Morrison had a disagreement, so he was not used {{for the rest of the}} album.|$|E
