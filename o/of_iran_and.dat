5|$|Many rivers {{originating}} in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive {{a significant portion}} of their flow from snowmelt. This often makes the river's flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic flooding during the spring months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain West of the US or most <b>of</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> Afghanistan, very low flow {{for the rest of the}} year. In contrast, if much of the melt is from glaciated or nearly glaciated areas, the melt continues through the warm season, with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 609 medals (202 gold, 199 silver and 208 bronze) were awarded. The {{total number of}} bronze medals {{is greater than the}} total number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in boxing (except men's light heavyweight and heavyweight categories). In +100kg {{category}} of freestyle wrestling, a tie for the first position in between the wrestlers <b>of</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> Japan meant that no silver medal was awarded. In gymnastics, a tie for second place in the parallel bars event resulted in two silver medals and thus no bronze was awarded, similarly a tie for first place in the uneven bars event meant that no silver medal was awarded.|$|E
5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{like the}} {{previous}} Buyid rulers, maintained the Abbasids in Baghdad, which gave legitimacy to his dynasty {{in the eyes}} of some Sunni Muslims. However, he showed more interest than his predecessors to the pre-Islamic culture <b>of</b> <b>Iran,</b> <b>and</b> was proud of his Iranian origin. He visited Persepolis alongside Marasfand, the Zoroastrian chief priest (mobad) of Kazerun, who read the pre-Islamic inscriptions in the city for him. Adud al-Dawla later left an inscription in the city, which tells about his awareness of being heir of an ancient pre-Islamic civilization. Adud al-Dawla even claimed descent from the Sasanian king Bahram V Gor, minted coins of him wearing a Sasanian type crown, and carried the traditional Sasanian inscription; Shahanshah, may his glory increase. While the reverse side of the coin said: May Shah Fanna Khusraw live long.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Verbascum has not undergone any significant revision since Svanve Mürbeck's monographies in the 1930s, {{with the exception}} of the work of Arthur Huber-Morath, who used informal group in organizing the genus for the florae <b>of</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> Turkey to account for many intermediate species. Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, Mürbeck's treatment is the most current one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus. In Mürbeck's classification, V.thapsus is placed in section Bothrospermae subsect. Fasciculata (or sect. Verbascum subsect. Verbascum depending on nomenclatural choices) alongside species such as Verbascum nigrum (black or dark mullein), Verbascum lychnitis (white mullein) and Verbascum sinuatum (wavy-leaved mullein).|$|E

The only other Egyptian freestyle wrestler to take part in more than one bout was Ibrahim Farag in the 55 kg class, who lost against eventual silver medalist Vladimer Khinchegashvili of Georgia in the qualification round and Bulgaria's Radoslav Velikov in the repechage. He was African senior champion in 2010 and junior champion in 2009.|$|E
