40|$|Preliminary {{results from}} an intercomparison of five total <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> are presented. These are the Dobson spectrophotometer, the USSR M- 83 ozonometer, the Canterbury filter photometer, the SenTran Company filter photometer, and the Brewer grating spectrophotometer.

50|$|He was {{appointed}} University Lecturer in Meteorology, Oxford. By studying meteorites {{he noticed that}} the temperature profile of the tropopause was not constant, as had previously been believed (hence the name stratosphere). In fact there was, he showed, a region where the temperature sharply rose. This, he proposed, was happening because UV radiation was heating ozone in what has become known as the ozone layer.He noted the connection between sunspots and weather, and measured the ultraviolet levels of our star. He built the first Dobson <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> and studied the results over many years. The Dobson unit, a unit of measurement of vertically integrated atmospheric ozone density, is named after him. The Brewer-Dobson circulation is a semi-eponymous model of atmospheric currents that explains the distribution of ozone by latitude.|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{concentration}} cell (ECC) ozone-sonde observations, made {{in recent years}} at ten stations whose locations range from the Arctic to Antarctica, have yielded a self-consistent ozone data base from which mean seasonal and annual latitudinal ozone vertical distributions to 35 km have been derived. Ozone measurement uncertainties are estimated, and results are presented in the Bass-Paur (1985) ozone absorption coefficient scale adopted for use with Dobson <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> January 1, 1992. The data should be useful for comparison with model calculations of the global distribution of atmospheric ozone, for serving as apriori statistical information in deriving ozone vertical distributions from satellite and Umkehr observations, and for improving the satellite and Umkehr ozone inversion algorithms. Attention is drawn to similar results based on a less comprehensive data set published in Ozone in the Atmosphere, Proceedings of the 1988 Quadrennial Ozone Symposium where errors in data tabulations occurred for three of the stations due to inadvertent transposition of ozone partial pressure and air temperature values...|$|R

5000|$|Farkas {{monitored}} ozone {{from the}} 1950s until her retirement in 1986, undertaking world-leading {{research in the}} field of ozone monitoring over more than three decades. During 1960s her work shifted increasingly to the study of atmospheric ozone including the measurement of total ozone with the Dobson <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer.</b> She became one of a small international group of atmospheric scientists dedicated to the study of atmospheric ozone-interest in which, in that era, was largely in use as a tracer to aid atmospheric circulation studies. Her work contributed substantially towards the discovery of the [...] "hole in the ozone layer" [...] which changed the world's behavior towards pollution forever. Her interest in atmospheric ozone measurement led naturally to the application of her expertise to the monitoring of surface ozone as part of air pollution studies and also to the measurement of atmospheric turbidity.|$|E
50|$|The Dobson Unit {{is defined}} as the {{thickness}} (in units of 10 µm) of that layer of pure gas which would be formed by the total column amount at STP. This is sometimes referred to as a 'milli-atmo-centimeter.' A typical column amount of 300 DU of atmospheric ozone therefore would form a 3 mm layer of pure gas at the surface of the Earth if its temperature and pressure conformed to STP. The Dobson unit is named after Gordon Dobson, a researcher at the University of Oxford who in the 1920s built the first instrument to measure total ozone from the ground, making use of a double prism monochromator to measure the differential absorption of different bands of solar ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer. This instrument, called the Dobson <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer,</b> has formed the backbone of the global network for monitoring atmospheric ozone and was the source of the discovery in 1984 of the Antarctic ozone hole.|$|E
40|$|Five {{ground-based}} total <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> were intercompared at Wallops Island, VA between October 1979 and January 1981. The {{tests were}} conducted to evaluate the stability and accuracy of each instrument over an extended time period. Acceptable performance regarding these two characteristics is essential if an instrument is to be useful in field measurements and network monitoring of the atmospheric total ozone content. The Dobson spectrophotometer {{was used as the}} standard of comparison for the Brewer grating spectrophotometer, the USSR M- 83 ozonometer, the Canterbury filter photometer, and the SenTran filter photometer. The grating instrument was found to be potentially the equal of the Dobson but was subject to unreliable performance by its rather sophisticated electronic components. The filter photometers performed acceptably for short periods but filter aging and eventual degradation rendered both units unusable {{before the end of the}} intercomparison. Finally, the M- 83 results were found to be in acceptable agreement with the Dobson throughout the period when certain qualifications are invoked. The accuracy of a single M- 83 ozone measurement may be low. Averages tend to improve its agreement with the Dobson...|$|R
40|$|Analyses of {{stratospheric ozone}} data {{determined}} from Dobson Umkehr measurements since 1977 at the Syowa (69. 0 &deg; S, 39. 6 &deg; E), Antarctica station show {{a significant decrease}} in ozone at altitudes higher than that of the 4 hPa pressure level during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Ozone values over Syowa have remained low since 2001. The time series of upper stratospheric ozone from the homogenized NOAA (/ 2) SBUV 8. 6 overpass data (± 4 &deg;, 24 h) are in qualitative agreement with Syowa station data. Ozone recovery during the austral spring over Syowa station appears to be slower than predicted by the Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine (EESC) curve. The long-term changes in station's equivalent latitude are derived from MERRA analysis at ~ 2 hPa and ~ 50 hPa. These data are used to attribute some of the upper and middle stratospheric ozone changes to the changes in vortex position relative to station location. In addition, high correlation of the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM) with polar upper stratospheric ozone during years of maximum solar activity points toward a strong relationship between the strength of the Brewer-Dobson circulation and the polar stratospheric ozone recovery. We have analyzed the results of ozone profiles over Syowa determined from measurements of the Umkehr effect by Dobson <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometers.</b> The <b>ozone</b> depletion attributable to CFCs is clearly visible in the record, but the recovery is slower than predicted. Further research indicates that dynamical and other chemical changes in the atmosphere are delaying the recovery over this station...|$|R
40|$|The United States {{government}} has operated Dobson <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> at various sites, starting during the International Geophysical Year (1  July  1957 to 31  December  1958). A network of stations for long-term {{monitoring of the}} total column content (thickness of the ozone layer) of the atmosphere {{was established in the}} early 1960 s and eventually grew to 16 stations, 14 of which are still operational and submit data to the United States of America's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Seven of these sites are also part of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), an organization that maintains its own data archive. Due to recent changes in data processing software the entire dataset was re-evaluated for possible changes. To evaluate and minimize potential changes caused by the new processing software, the reprocessed data record was compared to the original data record archived in the World Ozone and UV Data Center (WOUDC) in Toronto, Canada. The history of the observations at the individual stations, the instruments used for the NOAA network monitoring at the station, the method for reducing zenith-sky observations to total ozone, and calibration procedures were re-evaluated using data quality control tools built into the new software. At the completion of the evaluation, the new datasets are to be published as an update to the WOUDC and NDACC archives, and the entire dataset is to be made available to the scientific community. The procedure for reprocessing Dobson data and the results of the reanalysis on the archived record are presented in this paper. A summary of historical changes to 14 station records is also provided...|$|R
5000|$|The Umkehr is {{the time}} {{variation}} of {{the ratio of the}} scattered intensity at two different wavelengths. The word means reversal in German. The Umkehr effect is observed when measurements are made with ultraviolet spectrophotometer of the ratio of the zenith sky light intensities of two wavelengths in the solar ultraviolet when the sun is near the horizon. The shorter of two wavelengths (intensity I) is strongly absorbed and other (intensity I [...] ) is weakly absorbed. If the value of log(I/I [...] ) is plotted against the suns zenith angle, it is observed that this log-intensity ratio decreases as the zenith angle increases until a minimum is reached for a zenith angle of about 80 (when the wavelengths are 3114 and 3324 A0). This effect was first noticed by Götz in 1930. The Umkehr measurement is known as customarily N-value and is given by the logarithm base 10 of the ratio of cloudless zenith sky intensitities at two different wavelengths scaled by a multiplicative factor 100 plus a constant which depends on instruments and extraterrestrial radiation. Methods for deriving vertical distribution from the umkehr measurements were developed by Götz, Dobson and Meetham in 1934, using the Dobson <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> developed by Gordon Dobson. In 1964 Carlton Mateer provided analysis on information content in umkehr measurements.|$|E
5000|$|He {{received}} dispens for his D Sc (Ph D) {{degree at}} the University of Uppsala in 1925 while still in Norway. He left the following year with {{the closure of the}} Haldde observatory (after a short time in Tromsö) to become 'docent' at the Meteorological Institute in Uppsala and was elected professor in 1936 to succeed Filip Åkerblom. The institute was at this time located in the 'Observatorieparken' since the late 19th century. The professorship did then include an adjacent eight-room house, very suitable for his family of six children and a new wife. The Seismograph housed in an adjacent building was at the time part of the Institute. The 'Instrumenthuset', another separate small building housed the Theorell meteorograph [...] an automatic weather station, registering the temperarature since 1853. A new Institute building was on Kōhler's initiative completed in 1949,also located in observatorieparken. During 1947-48 Kŏhler also established an observatory including a 30m high tower in Marsta a small community north about 10 km north of Uppsala. Wind-speeds and temperature were measured and registered at several heights at the tower. Instruments were mostly built in the workshop at the Uppsala Institute. The tower was considered unsafe in the 1980s because of corrosion and subsequently demolished. A second professorship in meteorology to specialize on weather prognosis was on Köhler's recommendation instituted and upheld by Tor Bergeron in 1949. The institute had 2-3 positions at the level of assistant. These had jour-duty associated with making weather observations that included calibrating the thermometer readings of the 'Theorell'. The institute {{has its roots in the}} works of Anders Celsius and Köhler had a keen interest in supporting this heritage and the daily observations was part of this.and so was the care-taking of original records and instruments including the Celsius thermometer. One example of his historical interest was his paper on the 'older history of the thermometer'.The snow and cloud investigations on Pårtetjåkko and Haldde now resulted in several publications as well as theoretical aspects of these investigations. The chlorine in form of salts (in particular sodium-chlorate) in the fog and clouds as well as droplet-sizes was the subject of his 1933 article ref. Another work on the similar subject but now also including an analysis of the chlorine content in sea-water The aim of this study was to prove (or disprove) that the nuclei of condensation in the clouds had the same composition as that of the sea-water.He was also interested in climatology and acquired a Dobson <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> collecting data 1951-1986.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Despite the {{extensive}} investigations {{to understand the}} difference between ground-based and space-borne measurements, there still exist differences in total ozone (TO) measured at those two different platforms. Comparisons were carried {{out for the first time}} between TO data obtaiend from the ground based Dobson and Brewer <b>spectrophotometers,</b> and the <b>Ozone</b> Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board EOS-Aura satellite in a megacity site in Northeast Asia. The TO values retrieved by the OMI-DOAS (Differential optical absorption spectroscopy) algorithm tend to be lower than those measured by the ground based sensors in spring and summer as well as the low solar zenith angle condition. We found that such underestimation of the OMI-DOAS TO is caused by tropospheric ozone underestimated by the OMI-DOAS algorithm when tropospheric ozone are significantly enhanced.

Measurements are performed with a Brewer <b>ozone</b> single <b>spectrophotometer</b> and with a Bentham DM 150 spectroradiometer (double monochromator). The influence of ozone, albedo and clouds on UV variability is evaluated separately using 10 -year climatology. It is found that the effect of total ozone on short-term variability of UV irradiance at 305 nm can be more than 200 % and on average more than 50 %. Clouds can cause variability of 150 % or more and on average 35 %. Variability caused by albedo is maximum 32 %. Long-term trends are investigated for the time period from 1994 to 2006 using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test.

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of temperature}} {{trends in the}} south polar stratosphere from 1979 - 1985 is detailed. A significant cooling {{has occurred in the}} stratosphere over this period. South polar October mean temperatures have declined 18 K at 24 km over the seven-year period. A large fraction of this decline occurs as a result of including 1979 temperatures in the trend. The years 1979 and 1982 differ from other years in that they include large mid-October wave events which produce significantly warmer polar temperatures. Nevertheless, a significant temperature decline has still occurred in the stratosphere even when the dynamically active years are not included. Comparing two relatively dynamically quiet years, 1980 and 1985, the largest temperature decrease in the 30 mb temperature field occurs not at the pole but in the subpolar temperature maximum centered near 60 deg S. The changes in temperature of both the maximum and the polar low regions correlate fairly well with total ozone changes observed by the Total <b>Ozone</b> Mapping <b>Spectrophotometer...</b>|$|R

The detailed latitudinal distribution of total ozone amount and height-latitude distributions of ozone concentration, temperature and wind at 5 -degree latitude intervals from the equatorial region to the Antarctic region were observed. From the ozonesonde observations, the injection of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere through the tropopause gap was deduced. The decreased ozone concentration in the lower stratosphere, similar to as same as the Antarctic ozone hole, was observed south of 60 °S.

40|$|The Dobson <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> {{measures}} {{the difference of}} intensity between selected wavelengths in the ultraviolet. The method uses an optical attenuator (the 'Wedge') in this measurement. The knowledge {{of the relationship of}} the wedge position to the attenuation is critical to the correct calculation of ozone from the measurement. The procedure to determine this relationship is time-consuming, and requires a highly skilled person to perform it correctly. The relationship has been found to change with time. For reliable ozone values, the procedure should be done on a Dobson instrument at regular intervals. Due to the skill and time necessary to perform this procedure, many instruments have gone as long as 15 years between procedures. This article describes an apparatus that performs the procedure under computer control, and is adaptable to the majority of existing Dobson instruments.

Here, we analyze temporal and spatial variability and trends in total ozone from the five US sites with long-term records. While similar long-term ozone changes are detected at all five sites, we find differences in the patterns of ozone variability on shorter time scales. In addition to standard evaluation techniques, STL-decomposition methods (Seasonal Trend decomposition of time series based on LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing, LOESS) are used to address temporal variability and trends in the Dobson data. The LOESS-smoothed trend components show a decline of total ozone between the 1970 s and 2000 s and a "stabilization" at lower levels in recent years, which is also confirmed by linear trend analysis. Methods from statistical extreme value theory (EVT) are used to characterize days with high and low total ozone (termed EHOs and ELOs, respectively) at each station and to analyze temporal changes in the frequency of ozone extremes and their relationship to dynamical features such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and El Niño Southern Oscillation. A comparison of the "fingerprints" detected in the frequency distribution of the extremes with those for standard metrics (i. e., the mean) shows that more "fingerprints" are found for the extremes, particularly for the positive phase of the NAO, at all five US monitoring sites. Results from the STL-decomposition support the findings of the EVT analysis. Finally, we analyze the relative influence of low and high ozone events on seasonal mean column ozone at each station. The results show that the influence of ELOs and EHOs on seasonal mean column ozone can be as much as ± 5 %, or about twice as large as the overall long-term decadal ozone trends...|$|R

This paper presents intercomparisons between ozone and NO 2 measured by the ACE and OSIRIS satellite instruments and by ground-based instruments at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL), which is located at Eureka, Canada (80 ° N, 86 ° W) and is operated by the Canadian Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Change (CANDAC). The ground-based instruments {{included in this study}} are four zenith-sky differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) instruments, one Bruker Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and four Brewer <b>spectrophotometers.</b> <b>Ozone</b> total columns measured by the DOAS instruments were retrieved using new Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) guidelines and agree to within 3. 2 %. The DOAS ozone columns agree with the Brewer spectrophotometers with mean relative differences that are smaller than 1. 5 %. This suggests that for these instruments the new NDACC data guidelines were successful in producing a homogenous and accurate ozone dataset at 80 ° N. Satellite 14 – 52 km ozone and 17 – 40 km NO 2 partial columns within 500 km of PEARL were calculated for ACE-FTS Version 2. 2 (v 2. 2) plus updates, ACE-FTS v 3. 0, ACE-MAESTRO (Measurements of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation) v 1. 2 and OSIRIS SaskMART v 5. 0 x ozone and Optimal Estimation v 3. 0 NO 2 data products. The new ACE-FTS v 3. 0 and the validated ACE-FTS v 2. 2 partial columns are nearly identical, with mean relative differences of 0. 0 ± 0. 2 % and − 0. 2 ± 0. 1 % for v 2. 2 minus v 3. 0 ozone and NO 2, respectively. Ozone columns were constructed from 14 – 52 km satellite and 0 – 14 km ozonesonde partial columns and compared with the ground-based total column measurements. The satellite-plus-sonde measurements agree with the ground-based ozone total columns with mean relative differences of 0. 1 – 7. 3 %. For NO 2, partial columns from 17 km upward were scaled to noon using a photochemical model. Mean relative differences between OSIRIS, ACE-FTS and ground-based NO 2 measurements do not exceed 20 %. ACE-MAESTRO measures more NO 2 than the other instruments, with mean relative differences of 25 – 52 %. Seasonal variation in the differences between NO 2 partial columns is observed, suggesting that there are systematic errors in the measurements and/or the photochemical model corrections. For ozone spring-time measurements, additional coincidence criteria based on stratospheric temperature and the location of the polar vortex were found to improve agreement between some of the instruments. For ACE-FTS v 2. 2 minus Bruker FTIR, the 2007 – 2009 spring-time mean relative difference improved from − 5. 0 ± 0. 4 % to − 3. 1 ± 0. 8 % with the dynamical selection criteria. This was the largest improvement, likely because both instruments measure direct sunlight and therefore have well-characterized lines-of-sight compared with scattered sunlight measurements. For NO 2, the addition of a ± 1 ° latitude coincidence criterion improved spring-time intercomparison results, likely due to the sharp latitudinal gradient of NO 2 during polar sunrise. The differences between satellite and ground-based measurements do not show any obvious trends over the missions, indicating that both the ACE and OSIRIS instruments continue to perform well...|$|R

These instruments were installed between 1957 and 1964 at five Canadian sites and replaced by the more advanced Brewer instruments in the mid- 1980 s. Ozone measurements have also been made from satellites and in particular the daily global total ozone has been measured by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) during the period October 1978 through May 1993. Since the 1970 s the vertical profile of ozone concentration has also been measured with balloonsondes at several Canadian sites. Recent studies of ozone trends over Canada have shown negative trends in total ozone (WMO, 1994). In this thesis ozone trends in the troposphere and the lower to midstratosphere are examined using the three types of data sets. The purpose has been to investigate the ozone variation pattern in the northern hemisphere and to determine the possible effects of some meteorological factors on this variation during the period from January 1979 to December 1992. A statistical model for a trend analysis of the ozone time series has been used. The model included terms for seasonal variations in mean ozone and seasonal variations in ozone trends as well as the effect of some meteorological factors. An attempt to assess stratospheric temperature and ozone-temperature trends in the troposphere and lower and mid-stratosphere has also been made.

The analysis not only gives {{an estimate of the}} long term annual and seasonal trends, but also provides statistics of means and variability on various temporal scales. The highest decreasing trend was found in spring, while the smallest seasonal trend was in summer. On an annual basis, the long term trend is determined as 2. 61 DU (0. 79 %) per year. The mean annual range of seasonal averages is as high as 96 DU (29. 2 %) with the maximum in October and the minimum in April. On average, variability in summer is much less than in winter whilst spring and autumn experience moderate variations. Large variations from day to day are found to be frequent. A spectral analysis on the daily values shows that the dominating oscillating periods are between 2. 1 and 4. 5 days, indicating the importance of the synoptic scale influences. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a trend of decreasing variability with decreasing ozone. To study the spatial variability, measurement from another similar instrument that is located in Oslo is compared to that in Norrköping. Daily values during 1994 – 1996 are compared, which shows a correlation coefficient of 0. 90. However, the difference between the stations can still be considerable. The standard deviation of the difference is 21. 8 DU and the maximum absolute difference is as high as 77. 5 DU. This certainly has implications for the regional variability of surface UV. © 1998 Royal Meteorological Society.

40|$|Summaries {{of ozone}} {{measurements}} made at Little America, Antarctica during 1957 and 1958 are presented. Data include both total ozone observations {{made with a}} Dobson <b>Ozone</b> <b>Spectrophotometer</b> and surface ozone concentrations measured with the automatic ozone recorder developed by Regeller. Wind and ozone roses were constructed to examine the variation of surface ozone with wind direction, and in addition the net meridional transport of surface ozone was computed for each month for a year. The computed northward transport of surface ozone {{during the winter months}} of June through September suggests a model for atmospheric circulation in the Antarctic. Assuming no ozone is created or destroyed by photochemical or other means during this dark period and that Little America is representative of its latitude, steady-state conditions require that the low-level outflow of ozone be compensated by inflow at ot'her levels. Both the lower stratospheric circumpolar jet inhibiting meridional transport and the stability of the Antarctic stratosphere inhibiting downward vertical transport lead us to ascribe the principal OZOIIC influx to the troposphere above the surface layer. Computations of the tropospheric ozone concentrations required to replace the low-level loss of ozone, using Itubin's values for the vertical distribution of the tropospheric mass transports, are in good agreement with the observations made by ozonesonde at Halley Bay. It thus appears that some of the ozone manufactured in the sunlit stratosphere of lower latitudes which enters the troposphere through the tropopause gap associated with the mid-latitude jet stream is transported into the Antarctic by winds of the vigorous winter storms which move around and into the continent, and finally sinks and then flows northward again as part of the 2 - to 3 -km. thick surface layer. 1...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) {{is a key}} {{component}} of the Earth's atmosphere, being involved in the ozone destruction and production and influencing the radiative balance of our planet. Furthermore, it impacts on human health and contributes to the tropospheric pollution. Techniques to measure atmospheric nitrogen dioxide from both the space and the ground have noticeably advanced in the last decades and provide valuable information, while also presenting some serious limitations. In 1985, an automated Brewer <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> was modified to add capability to measure solar visible radiation and retrieve atmospheric nitrogen dioxide besides total ozone and sulfur dioxide. Since then, more than 60 MKIV Brewer spectrophotometers have been put in operation in a worldwide network and long-term nitrogen dioxide records have been collected at several sites. However, the original algorithm, developed in the 1980 's, has never been officially updated and, although notable efforts have been done in the last years to improve the retrieval by the Brewer, high-quality estimates of nitrogen dioxide by this instrument are still difficult to acquire. This work introduces substantial innovation in measuring nitrogen dioxide with MKIV Brewers. For the first time, an instrument of this type was thoroughly characterised in its operating spectral range. A novel mathematical framework supporting observations was then developed to update the Brewer processing algorithm, to better understand its potentials and limitations and to optimise the measurement technique. The spectroscopic data sets used within the algorithm were completely updated using the most recently published absorption cross sections. Model calculations were performed with top-level radiative transfer codes to test the new algorithm, which not only allows more accurate estimates of nitrogen dioxide, but also introduces new capabilities in Brewer measurements, such as the retrieval of the oxygen dimer (O 4) and the degree of the linear polarisation of skylight. To test the new method, four field campaigns were organised. The limitations in the traditional calibration techniques due to the daily evolution of nitrogen dioxide were overcome by employing an innovative method and one Brewer (# 066) was successfully calibrated and compared to an instrument belonging to the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change. The two different observation techniques in which the Brewer operates, namely by looking directly to the sun or vertically to the zenith, were proven to be equivalent within the stated uncertainty. The latter was thoroughly evaluated by means of a Monte Carlo based method. The new algorithm was effectively applied to reprocess the long-term series recorded in the European Brewer stations of Saint-Christophe and Rome (Italy), Athens (Greece), Hradec Kralove (Czech Republic). To this purpose, two empirical methods to calibrate the Brewer instruments through statistical analyses were validated. The results were compared with satellite total column data retrieved from the SCIAMACHY, GOME- 2 and OMI instruments and with in-situ measurements of tropospheric concentrations {{to assess the impact of}} anthropogenic emissions...|$|E
40|$|Meteorological {{observations}} at Syowa Base in 5 th expedition {{were maintained}} {{in the year}} 1960 - 1962. Among scientific disciplines importance {{was attached to the}} meteorological section consisting of 4 members, to take various types of observation. General and characteristic features in meteorological observations are summarized in the following. A. Surface observation: 3 -hourly observations were made throughout the wintering period, 4 observations were transmitted to Mother Station (Mawson), twice daily. In addition to the specified observations, radiation, sunshine and ground temperature were also observed by continuous selfrecording instrument respectively. The special features of this year is that, compared with the appearance of the annual minimum temperature normally in September in the Antarctic, the minimum occurred in July and it is shown that the average temperature in September was 5. 5 ℃ higher than the normal value. B. Upper air observation: One time (12 Z) daily rawinsonde observations were made throughout the year except a few cases of only radiosonde observation. Twice daily (00 and 12 Z) rawinsonde observations were made during World Meteorological Interval of Post-IGY (July 16 -July 25). All observations were transmitted to Mother Station every day. Equipments used : D- 55 A type Automatic Direction Finder (Similar type with GMD- 1 A) JMA-RSII Rawinsonde, 1680 Mc JMA-SIII Radiosonde, 27 Mc 800 g Balloon (Latex) CaH_ 2 Cans for Hydrogen gas to fill balloons. Monthly average temperatures and heights were shown in respective figures. In September, combined with the surface temperature, the strong warm-air inflow throughout the troposphere below 300 mb could be seen. A rapid warming in the stratosphere in spring was also clearly observed. Wind rose at some selected pressure levels were shown in Figs. 7 - 10. In general, the wind is strong in winter, especially in the stratosphere and NE-ly and SW-ly winds are predominant in the troposphere, SW-ly or W-ly in the stratosphere. The E-ly winds were also observed above 30 mb in summer. C. Ozone observation: i) Total ozone observation Dobson <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> was used for this observation. Table 3 shows the results of only direct sunlight observation with reliable AD wave length setting. Comparison is made in Figs. 11 and 12 between Syowa Base, Little America and Halley Bay. Total ozone amount can be said to increase in spring from November to December over the Antarctic and the maximum seems to appear in summer. The 10 -days average values of Syowa Base and Halley Bay show to be in good similarity in spite of different year. It may also be noted that a good correlation exists between rapid increase of ozone amount and temperature of 50 mb in late November. ii) Surface ozone observation The density of surface ozone was measured on days without drifting snow from the end of February 1961. Based on Ehmert method, the equipment developed by Mr. KAWAMURA, Meteorological Research Institute, was used. It may be seen that the density increase in autumn and reaches its maximum value about 40 μg/m^ 3 in early June in polar night season, then decreases rapidly until the sun comes back and indicates minimum in early summer. It should be noted that there is 6 months 2 ̆ 7 phase difference between the surface ozone amount and the total ozone amount. D. Special observation: Snow accumulation Toward ENE-ly direction from the base, 6 snow stakes were erected and snow accumulation was observed several times every month. The result is shown in Table 4 in which the annual accumulation was 121 cm. Average density of snow was 0. 474 and the equivalent amount of water was 574 m/m...|$|E
