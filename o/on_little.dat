Chika Shirokiri returned after his work <b>on</b> <b>Little</b> Busters!, in which he wrote the scenario for Kudryavka.

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Russo-Turkish War brought on universal conscription of young men. At his family's urging, Adler bribed his way into becoming a sanitar, an assistant in the Red Cross Medical Corps. He was selected (apparently <b>on</b> <b>little</b> more than his appearance) by Prince Vladimir Petrovich Meshersky {{to work at a}} German hospital in Bender, Moldova, dealing mainly with typhus patients. In his four months there, he became a favorite with the established Jewish families there, and earned a Gold Medal for Outstanding Achievement for his brief service to the Tsar.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} on Ward's brigade was eventually too great, {{and he was}} forced to call for a retreat. Hood's division secured Devil's Den and the southern part of Houck's Ridge. The center of the fighting shifted to the northwest, to Rose Woods and the Wheatfield, while five regiments under Evander Law assaulted Little Round Top to the east. Benning's men spent the next 22 hours on Devil's Den, firing across the Valley of Death on Union troops massed <b>on</b> <b>Little</b> Round Top.|$|E

5|$|To {{fill the}} void left by {{the demise of the}} Susquehannocks, the Iroquois {{encouraged}} displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware). The valleys of Pine Creek and its tributaries in Cummings Township were used by the Iroquois and Algonkian tribes as a hunting ground. Historians believe {{that there may have been}} a Shawnee village and burial ground just to the north of Little Pine State Park <b>on</b> <b>Little</b> Pine Creek, just a few miles from what became Upper Pine Bottom State Park.|$|E
5|$|Two of Benning's Confederate regiments, the 2nd and 17th Georgia, {{moved down}} Plum Run Valley around Ward's flank. They {{received}} murderous {{fire from the}} 99th Pennsylvania and Hazlett's battery <b>on</b> <b>Little</b> Round Top, but they kept pushing forward. Capt. Smith's New York battery was under severe pressure from three sides, but its supporting infantry regiments were suffering severe casualties and could not protect it. Three 10-pound Parrott rifles were lost to the 1st Texas, and they were used against Union troops the next day.|$|E

5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested <b>on</b> <b>Little</b> Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|As {{fighting}} raged in the Wheatfield and Devil's Den, Col. Strong Vincent of V Corps had {{a precarious}} hold <b>on</b> <b>Little</b> Round Top, an important hill {{at the extreme}} left of the Union line. His brigade of four relatively small regiments was able to resist repeated assaults by Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's brigade of Hood's division. Meade's chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, had realized {{the importance of this}} position, and dispatched Vincent's brigade, an artillery battery, and the 140th New York to occupy Little Round Top mere minutes before Hood's troops arrived. The defense of Little Round Top with a bayonet charge by the 20th Maine, ordered by Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain but possibly led by Lt. Holman S. Melcher, {{was one of the most}} fabled episodes in the Civil War and propelled Col. Chamberlain into prominence after the war.|$|E
5|$|At Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard Meyer, and Bobbie Griffin {{attempted}} {{to re-create the}} Little Boy. They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ, an expert <b>on</b> <b>Little</b> Boy who served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory's Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured out how they went together. Eventually, they built six Little Boy assemblies. Although the casings, barrels, and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect {{was on its way}} to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.|$|E

His coach was so frustrated with him he threw him off the team. He went through a growth spurt before his sophomore year and added speed to his fastball. He also raised his GPA and was able {{to get back on the}} team, where he had a 9–3 record with a 1.18 earned run average (ERA) as a sophomore, tossing three no-hitters.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed an {{agreement}} known as the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. Some EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules and mask their deficit and debt levels {{through the use of}} complex currency and credit derivatives structures. The structures were designed by prominent US investment banks, who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took <b>on</b> <b>little</b> credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives counterparties. Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives—including greater access to government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets.|$|E
5|$|In June 1863, Hines led an {{invasion}} into Indiana with 25 Confederates {{posing as a}} Union unit in pursuit of deserters. Their goal was {{to see if the}} local Copperheads would support the invasion of John Hunt Morgan planned for July 1863. Traveling through Kentucky for eight days to obtain supplies for their mission, they crossed the Ohio River to enter Indiana, near the village of Derby, on June 18, 1863. Hines visited the local Copperhead leader, Dr. William A. Bowles, in French Lick, and learned {{that there would be no}} formal support for Morgan's Raid. On his way back to Kentucky, Hines and his men were discovered in Valeene, Indiana, leading to a small skirmish near Leavenworth, Indiana, <b>on</b> <b>Little</b> Blue Island. Hines had to abandon his men as he swam across the Ohio River under gunfire.|$|E
