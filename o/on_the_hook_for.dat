25|$|In 2009–10 {{injuries}} resurfaced. Three {{games into}} the season, Souray suffered a concussion after Calgary Flames captain Jarome Iginla checked {{him into the}} boards head-first on October 8, 2009. The injury, coupled with a hand injury (and subsequent infection) sustained when Souray fought Iginla during a rematch of the teams, limited him to just 37 games, with Souray scoring just four goals and 13 points in the campaign. During the 2010 off-season, citing irreconcilable differences with Oiler management due to their handling of his various ailments, Souray requested a trade out of Edmonton. The Oilers responded angrily, and a nasty media exchange followed, with the team ultimately placing Souray on waivers {{in the hope that}} he would be claimed by another NHL team so that Edmonton would no longer be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>for</b> the remainder of his contract. However, due to his high salary and previous year's injuries, few NHL teams were willing to take such a large financial risk on a player who might not be 100% healthy, talented as he may be. Souray cleared waivers without being claimed, and was told by management not to attend the Oilers' training camp. On October 6, 2010, Souray was assigned to the American Hockey League (AHL), being loaned to the Washington Capitals' minor league affiliate, the Hershey Bears. Souray accepted his demotion to the minors and posted a solid AHL season, as he battled and slowly recovered from his nagging injuries. Leading up to the NHL trade deadline, the Oilers once again placed Souray on waivers in a second attempt to unload his salary. However, NHL teams still had the same concerns about Souray's high salary and injury risk, so he cleared waivers a second time and remained under contract to Edmonton as relations between Souray and the Edmonton camp remained testy at best. Finally, in the summer of 2011, Edmonton bought-out the fifth and final year of Souray's contract. This allowed Souray to become a free agent and again pursue playing at the NHL level with another team.|$|E

2500|$|Credit/default: Default risk is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} borrower’s inability to meet interest payment obligations on time. [...] For ABS, default may occur when maintenance obligations on the underlying collateral are not sufficiently met as detailed in its prospectus. A key indicator of a particular security’s default risk is its credit rating. Different tranches within the ABS are rated differently, with senior classes of most issues receiving the highest rating, and subordinated classes receiving correspondingly lower credit ratings. Almost all mortgages, including reverse mortgages, and student loans, are now insured by the government, meaning that taxpayers are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>for</b> any of these loans that go bad even if the asset is massively over-inflated. In other words, there are no limits or curbs on over-spending, or the liabilities to taxpayers.|$|E

Joseph Guzman, 34, who uses a cane and a leg brace and has four bullets lodged in his body was to receive $3 million, and Trent Benefield, 26, was to receive $900,000. The total amount of the settlement was $7.15 million. Paultre Bell said, [...] "I believe the settlement is fair, {{but the most important}} thing is that our fight, my fight, doesn't end here.

[...] New York City Corporation Counsel stated, [...] "The city regrets the loss of life in this tragic case, and we share our deepest condolences with the Bell family." [...] The head of the New York City Detectives Endowment Association said he thought the settlement was [...] "a joke". [...] "The detectives were exonerated ... and now the taxpayer is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>for</b> $7 million, and the attorneys are in line to get $2 million, without suffering a scratch."

2500|$|In 2011, {{the agency}} {{had a number of}} other big banks in the {{crosshairs}} as well. JPMorgan (JPM) was one of 18 financial institutions the FHFA sued back in 2011, accusing them of selling Fannie and Freddie securities that [...] "had different and more risky characteristics than the descriptions contained in the marketing and sales materials". Fannie and Freddie, the government-backed housing finance firms, sustained massive losses on mortgage-backed securities as the housing market imploded, requiring a bailout of over $187 billion. The firms have been controlled by the FHFA since their 2008 rescue. Swiss lender UBS has already reached an $885 million settlement with the FHFA in connection with losses Fannie and Freddie sustained on over $6.4 billion worth of mortgage securities. The agency also settled for undisclosed sums earlier this year with Citigroup (C) and General Electric (GE). The FHFA is reportedly seeking $4 billion from JPMorgan to resolve its claims over $33 billion worth of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie by JPMorgan, Bear and WaMu. Bank of America (BAC), which acquired Countrywide and Merrill Lynch during the crisis era, could be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> <b>for</b> even more. The Charlotte-based firm is facing claims from the FHFA over $57 billion worth of mortgage bonds. In all, the 18 FHFA lawsuits cover more than $200 billion in allegedly misrepresented securities. The question of whether any individual bankers will be held to account is another matter. Thus far, criminal cases related to the packaging and sale of mortgage-backed securities have been conspicuously absent. The proposed JPMorgan settlement covers only civil charges, and would not settle the question of whether any individual executives engaged in wrongdoing. There is an ongoing federal criminal probe based in Sacramento, Calif., the state where Washington Mutual was based. JPMorgan originally sought to be protected from any criminal charges as part of this deal, but that request was rejected by the government.|$|E

Maggie thought this sort of knowledge was very wonderful,--much more difficult than remembering what was in the books; and she was rather in awe of Tom's superiority, for he was the only person who called her knowledge [...] "stuff," [...] and did not feel surprised at her cleverness. Tom, indeed, was of opinion that Maggie was a silly little thing; all girls were silly,--they couldn't throw a stone so as to hit anything, couldn't do anything with a pocket-knife, and were frightened at frogs.

40|$|The {{commercial}} {{importance of}} the Yellowtail Flounder (Limanda ferruginea Storer) {{in recent years has}} greatly increased, partly because of the greater use of otter trawlers in North American waters, and also {{as a response to the}} unprecedented demand for fish products during the war. This is particularly true in the case of Canada where, until recently, the traditional method of fishing was line trawling, a method which prevented the capture of yellowtails since its mouth is so small that one is rarely caught <b>on</b> <b>the</b> large <b>hooks</b> used <b>for</b> cod, haddock, and pollock. These factors have led to an extensive exploitation of the yellowtail fisheries, especially in New England waters where, in 1942, more than 65, 000, 000 pounds of yellowtails were landed. Since then yellowtail landings in New England have steadily decreased, although the fishing intensity has increased, and there are indications that this decrease may be the result of over-fishing. The position of the yellowtail upon the Canadian market, although much less important, is becoming increasingly significant. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{mortality}} of sharks {{in a commercial}} longline fishery in Australia. To examine the rate and biological, environmental and technological factors contributing to at-vessel mortality, four setlines with 120 gangions possessing ‘hook timers’ were deployed daily (for 7 h and 14 h) using conventional gears from two commercial fishing vessels during 2013. A total of 689 animals across 22 species and including 18 elasmobranchs were landed. For the five species (Carcharhinus spp.), and one genus (Sphyrna spp) where there were sufficient numbers for analysis, generalised linear mixed models showed that species and the elapsed time spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line after <b>hooking</b> were <b>the</b> strongest predictors of at-vessel mortality, with spinner (Carcharhinus brevipinna), blacktip (C. limbatus) and hammerhead (Sphyrna spp) sharks exhibiting the highest death rates.
