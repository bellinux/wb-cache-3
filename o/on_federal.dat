5|$|In 1989, annual {{timber harvest}} revenue <b>on</b> <b>federal</b> forest land {{nationwide}} peaked at $1.5 billion. Following that year, {{the impact of}} overharvesting and increased environmental concerns began to negatively impact timber sales on the O lands. In 1994, the federal Northwest Forest Plan was implemented. Designed to guide forest management of federal lands while protecting old-growth forest habitat for endangered species such as the Northern spotted owl, the plan restricted the land available for timber harvest. By 1998, revenue <b>on</b> <b>federal</b> forest lands fell {{to a third of}} the peak 1989 revenue, with areas in the Northwest particularly hard-hit.|$|E

5|$|Following Massachusetts' lead, the Federalist {{minorities}} in both Virginia and New York {{were able to}} obtain ratification in convention by linking ratification to recommended amendments.

5|$|The {{city was}} also the wartime home of Richard Jordan Gatling, a {{physician}} and entrepreneur, who invented the Gatling gun. Tested in Indianapolis and patented in November 1862, the hand-cranked, rapid-fire gun was a predecessor to the modern machine gun. The U.S. Navy adopted the Gatling gun during the war, where it was used <b>on</b> <b>federal</b> gunboats, but the U.S. Army did not formally adopt it for use until 1866.|$|E
5|$|The global oil-shale {{industry}} {{began to}} revive {{at the beginning}} of the 21st century. In 2003, an oil-shale development program restarted in the United States.

5|$|This was at {{odds with}} the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program, and {{resulted}} in pressure <b>on</b> <b>federal</b> officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures on the nuclear weapons program. In 1953 the Atomic Energy Commission presented a set of draft amendments to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy for consideration.

5|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} March 2015, {{when it was}} revealed by the State Department's inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained <b>on</b> <b>federal</b> government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred {{against the backdrop of}} Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.|$|E
5|$|A {{grand jury}} indicted Paul Schlesselman and Daniel Cowart on November 5, 2008, <b>on</b> <b>federal</b> charges of {{threatening}} {{to kill and}} inflict bodily harm upon a major presidential candidate, conspiracy, interstate unlawful transportation of an unregistered firearm, interstate transportation of a firearm {{with the intent to}} commit a felony, transporting a short-barreled shotgun across state lines without a license and unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Cowart was also charged with damaging religious property and use of a firearm during a crime of violence. On November 6, Schlesselman and Cowart pleaded not guilty before a federal magistrate in Memphis, Tennessee. The two were placed into federal custody without bail. The charges carry a maximum punishment of 50 years in prison and $540,000 in fines.|$|E
5|$|A {{search warrant}} {{executed}} on April 25, 2007, {{as part of}} a drug investigation of Vick's cousin Davon Boddie led to discovery of evidence of unlawful dog fighting activities at a property owned by Vick in rural Surry County in southeastern Virginia, with extensive facilities for the activity. Media attention quickly grew as state officials investigated, soon joined by federal authorities. As separate state and federal investigations progressed, more details emerged about an interstate dog-fighting ring that involved drugs and gambling. Gruesome details of abuse, torture, and execution of under-performing dogs galvanized animal rights activists and expressions of public outrage. Vick and several others were indicted <b>on</b> <b>federal</b> and Virginia state felony charges related to the operation.|$|E

5|$|After the war Helm {{identified}} with the Democratic Party, and {{he returned to the}} state senate in 1865. During his tenure he chaired the Committee <b>on</b> <b>Federal</b> Relations and fought against punitive and restrictive laws against ex-Confederates. On January 22, 1866 he presented to the state senate a protest against the actions of the United States Congress during the Civil War. It denounced the Reconstruction Amendments {{on the grounds that they}} granted powers to the federal government that were reserved for the states, and that they were passed while many southern states were not represented in Congress. He also decried the creation and operation of the Freedmen's Bureau. On January 29, 1867, Helm introduced legislation to organize a meeting in Louisville to rally support for President Andrew Johnson and his efforts to restore the Union.|$|E
5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living <b>on</b> <b>Federal</b> land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|As a senator, Walker {{continued}} {{to focus on}} finance, although his views on social policy sometimes saw him {{on the outside of}} his party. He supported the White Australia policy but disagreed with key elements, and was a leader in opposition to the dictation test, by which a potential immigrant was required to pass a test in any European language before their application was accepted. He also campaigned for a transcontinental railway and for a capital city to be located <b>on</b> <b>federal</b> territory. Attempts to guide financial reform through the parliament as a backbench senator led to frustration, and Walker retired due to ill health in 1913 with his legislation unpassed.|$|E
