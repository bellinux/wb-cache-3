50|$|Early PALs were 20-pin DIP {{components}} fabricated in silicon using {{bipolar transistor}} technology with <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> (OTP) titanium-tungsten programming fuses. Later devices were manufactured by Cypress, Lattice Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices using CMOS technology.|$|E
50|$|These small MCUs include up to 100 MIPS CPU, 12-bit ADC, 12-bit DACs {{and other}} vital analog {{peripherals}} such as integrated precision oscillator (±2%) and precision temperature sensor (±2 °C).

In addition, it offers secure memory with its CryptoMemory product line of EEPROMS in capacities from 1 to 256 kbits.|$|E
50|$|On 9 December 2011, SiliconBlue Technologies was {{acquired}} by Lattice Semiconductor in a $63.2 million cash buyout. As part of this buyout, Lattice received the iCE brand, manufacturing capabilities with TSMC, and a licence for various patents from Kilopass Technologies, including for its XPM <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> (OTP) memory technology.|$|E
5000|$|Programmable {{read-only}} memory (PROM), or <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> ROM (OTP), {{can be written}} to or programmed via a special device called a PROM programmer. Typically, this device uses high voltages to permanently destroy or create internal links (fuses or antifuses) within the chip. Consequently, a PROM can only be programmed once.|$|E
50|$|AVR is {{a family}} of {{microcontrollers}} developed by Atmel beginning in 1996. These are modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC single-chip microcontrollers. AVR {{was one of the}} first microcontroller families to use on-chip flash memory for program storage, as opposed to <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> ROM, EPROM, or EEPROM used by other microcontrollers at the time.|$|E
50|$|When a device's {{firmware}} {{is stored}} in mask ROM or <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> PROM, it cannot be modified without physically replacing the integrated circuit, so such a device cannot be field-programmable in the modern sense. EPROM-based firmware can be erased and reprogrammed, but only after lengthy exposure to a high-intensity ultraviolet light source.|$|E
50|$|Cards {{designed}} {{to the original}} specification (PCMCIA 1.0) are type I and feature a 16-bit interface. They are 3.3 mm thick and feature a dual row of 34 holes (68 in total) along a short edge as a connecting interface. Type-I PC Card devices are typically used for memory devices such as RAM, flash memory, OTP (<b>One-Time</b> <b>Programmable),</b> and SRAM cards.|$|E
50|$|The MSP430x3xx Series is {{the oldest}} generation, {{designed}} for portable instrumentation with an embedded LCD controller. This also includes a frequency-locked loop oscillator that can automatically synchronize to a low-speed (32 kHz) crystal. This generation does not support EEPROM memory, only mask ROM and UV-eraseable and <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> EPROM. Later generations provide only flash memory and mask ROM options. These devices offer 2.5-5.5 V operation, up to 32 KB ROM.|$|E
50|$|As {{the quartz}} window is {{expensive}} to make, OTP (<b>one-time</b> <b>programmable)</b> chips were introduced; here, the die is mounted in an opaque package so it cannot be erased after programming - this also {{eliminates the need}} to test the erase function, further reducing cost. OTP versions of both EPROMs and EPROM-based microcontrollers are manufactured. However, OTP EPROM (whether separate or {{part of a larger}} chip) is being increasingly replaced by EEPROM for small sizes, where the cell cost isn't too important, and flash for larger sizes.|$|E
50|$|EPROMs {{were sold}} in ceramic DIPs {{manufactured}} with a circular window of clear quartz over the chip die to allow the part to be erased by ultraviolet light. Often, the same chips were also sold in less expensive windowless PDIP or CERDIP packages as <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> (OTP) versions. Windowed and windowless packages were also used for microcontrollers, and other devices, containing EPROM memory. Windowed CERDIP-packaged EPROMs {{were used for the}} BIOS ROM of many early IBM PC clones with an adhesive label covering the window to prevent inadvertent erasure through exposure to ambient light.|$|E
50|$|The controller's BIOS is {{normally}} {{stored in a}} dedicated on-board Flash Memory Device, except that when the controller is integrated into a motherboard its BIOS and the motherboard's BIOS are often combined into one. Upgrading the BIOS can be difficult at best. Some controllers have <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> memorychips, which cannot be altered at all. Others use devices not supported by ITE's BIOS-flashing utility, though some users have reported success with the utility Uniflash. The BIOS cannot be configured for both RAID and ATAPI functioning at once, so users may be prevented by a manufacturer's decision from changing between these modes.|$|E
5000|$|In modern PCs, [...] "ROM" [...] (or flash) is used {{to store}} the basic {{bootstrapping}} firmware for the main processor, {{as well as the}} various firmware needed to internally control self-contained devices such as graphic cards, hard disks, DVD drives, TFT screens, etc., in the system. Today, many of these [...] "read-only" [...] memories - especially the BIOS - are often replaced with Flash memory (see below), to permit in-place reprogramming should the need for a firmware upgrade arise. However, simple and mature sub-systems (such as the keyboard or some communication controllers in the integrated circuits on the main board, for example) may employ mask ROM or OTP (<b>one-time</b> <b>programmable).</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{programmable}} {{read-only memory}} (PROM) or field {{programmable read-only memory}} (FPROM) or <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> non-volatile memory (OTP NVM) {{is a form of}} digital memory where the setting of each bit is locked by a fuse or antifuse. It is one type of ROM (read-only memory). The data in them is permanent and cannot be changed. PROMs are used in digital electronic devices to store permanent data, usually low level programs such as firmware (microcode). The key difference from a standard ROM is that the data is written into a ROM during manufacture, while with a PROM the data is programmed into them after manufacture. Thus, ROMs tend to be used only for large production runs with well-verified data, while PROMs are used to allow companies to test on a subset of the devices in an order before burning data into all of them.|$|E
50|$|XAP3 was an {{experimental}} 32-bit processor designed at Cambridge Consultants in 2003. It was optimised for low cost, low energy ASIC implementations using modern CMOS semiconductor process technologies. The instruction set was optimised for GNU GCC to achieve high code density. The XAP3 {{was the first}} of Cambridge Consultants’ processors to use a Von Neumann architecture with a logically shared address space for Program and Data. The physical program memory could be Flash or <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> EPROM or SRAM. ASIC design was simplified by using a single memory where {{there was no need to}} pre-determine the split between Program (instructions) and Data at design time. The XAP3's instruction set with the GCC compiler produced very high code density. This reduced the size of the program memory, which reduced the chip unit cost and reduced the energy consumption.|$|E
50|$|An EPROM is an {{erasable}} ROM {{that can}} be changed more than once. However, writing new data to an EPROM requires a special programmer circuit. EPROMs have a quartz window {{that allows them to}} be erased with ultraviolet light, but the whole device is cleared at one time. A <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> (OTP) device uses an EPROM chip but omits the quartz window in the package; this is less costly to manufacture. An electrically erasable programmable read-only memory EEPROM uses electrical signals to erase memory. These erasable memory devices require a significant amount of time to erase data and to write new data; they are not usually configured to be programmed by the processor of the target system. Data is stored by use of floating gate transistors which require special operating voltages to be applied to trap or release electric charge on an insulated control gate for storage sites.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Embedded {{nonvolatile}} memory (NVM) integrated in the back-end of line processes are of high interest, particularly for rugged environments (high temperature/radiation or vibration). This letter demonstrates {{the use of}} tantalum nitride microbeams as antifuse <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> (OTP) NVM. It needs a single mask process and can be integrated above an integrated circuit. Typical fusing current is 1 mA, operating voltage is 4 V, and the measured contact resistance is < 2 k.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we design}} a 1 -kb OTP (<b>One-time</b> <b>programmable)</b> memory IP in {{consideration}} of BCD process based EM (Electro-migration) and resistance variations of eFuse. We propose a method of precharging BL to VSS before activation of RWL (Read word-line) and an optimized design of read NMOS transistor to reduce read current through a non-programmed cell. Also, we propose a sensing margin test circuit with a variable pull-up load out of consideration for resistance variations of programmed eFuse. Peak current through the non-programmed eFuse is reduced from 728 µA to 61 µA when a simulation {{is done in the}} read mode. Furthermore, BL (Bit-line) sensing is possible even if sensed resistance of eFuse has fallen by about 9 kΩ in a wafer read test through a variable pull-up load resistance of BL S/A (Sense amplifier).

40|$|Existing FPGA {{architectures}} can {{be classified}} along two dimensions: reprogrammable vs. <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> and general-purpose vs. domain specific. The most challenging class of FPGA architectures to design is the reprogrammable, general-purpose FPGA, of which Xilinx is the most wellknown example. In this paper we describe Triptych, a new FPGA architecture that addresses two problems of current reprogrammable FPGAs: the large delays incurred in composing large functions and the strict division between routing and logic resources. Our studies indicate that Triptych is more areaefficient than current architectures and has comparable delay characteristics for a large range of circuits that include both data-path elements and control logic. INTRODUCTION The most common approach to field-programmable gate array architectures is to dedicate {{a portion of the}} total chip area to logic functions and the remainder to interconnection resources.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{breakdown}} properties of silicon nanowires fabricated with a top-down approach are investigated. The breaking voltages and currents of devices based on suspended silicon nanowires with different cross-section widths have been determined. It {{has been found}} that devices can be fused using a bias current in the range of 20 mu A for sufficiently thin nanowires. In this way a device based on a single nanowire can be used for the fabrication of a fully CMOS-compatible <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> (OTP) memory cell, where the wire conductance distinguishes the ON/OFF states. In the normal operation mode (ON state) the dissipated power can be very low. The solution seems to be promising in terms of scalability and low power consumption, which is a key factor in portable systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The Actel 1020 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is a {{low power}} CMOS device {{equivalent}} to 2000 logic gates.

40|$|Commonly, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) being {{developed}} in cPCI embedded systems include the bus interface in the FPGA. This complicates the development because the interface is complicated and {{requires a lot}} of development time and FPGA resources. In addition, flight qualification requires a substantial amount of time be devoted to just this interface. Another complication of putting the cPCI interface into the FPGA {{being developed}} is that configuration information loaded into the device by the cPCI microprocessor is lost when a new bit file is loaded, requiring cumbersome operations to return the system to an operational state. Finally, SRAM-based FPGAs are typically programmed via specialized cables and software, with programming files being loaded either directly into the FPGA, or into PROM devices. This can be cumbersome when doing FPGA development in an embedded environment, and does not have an easy path to flight. Currently, FPGAs used in space applications are usually programmed via multiple space-qualified PROM devices that are physically large and require extra circuitry (typically including a separate <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> FPGA) to enable them to be used for this application. This technology adds a cPCI interface device with a simple, flexible, high-performance backend interface supporting multiple backend FPGAs. It includes a mechanism for programming the FPGAs directly via the microprocessor in the embedded system, eliminating specialized hardware, software, and PROM devices and their associated circuitry. It has a direct path to flight, and no extra hardware and minimal software are required to support reprogramming in flight. The device added is currently a small FPGA, but an advantage of this technology is that the design of the device does not change, regardless of the application in which it is being used. This means that it needs to be qualified for flight only once, and is suitable for <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> devices or an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). An application programming interface (API) further reduces the development time needed to use the interface device in a system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The rapidly rising incidences of {{counterfeit}} Inte-grated Circuits (ICs) in {{the semiconductor}} supply chain pose a significant {{threat to the}} electronic industry. These ICs may suffer from functional, performance or reliability issues and can affect design houses, chip manufacturers, system designers as well as end users. The standard chip/package/system level tests are often inadequate in detecting various forms of counterfeit ICs. On the other hand, design approaches that enable IC authentication are often not attractive due to significant design effort, hardware overhead and test cost. In this paper, we propose a novel defense against counterfeiting attacks through a “chip locking approach”, where an IC is made non-operational by locking select pins through insertion of Antifuse (AF) devices in input/output circuitry. It can be unlocked through application of a hard-to-clone key. The key is internally stored in a <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> non-volatile memory. The key storage and comparison circuit is protected against reverse engineering and side-channel analysis attacks. Through mathematical analysis and simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed mech-anism provides high level of protection against all major forms of counterfeiting attacks (reselling, remarking and cloning) at ultralow overhead (< 0. 01 % area).

40|$|Orbital Research, Inc., developed, built, {{and tested}} three {{high-temperature}} components {{for use in}} the design of a data concentrator module in distributed turbine engine control. The concentrator receives analog and digital signals related to turbine engine control and communicates with a full authority digital engine control (FADEC) or high-level command processor. This data concentrator follows the Distributed Engine Controls Working Group (DECWG) roadmap for turbine engine distributed controls communication development that operates at temperatures at least up to 225 C. In Phase I, Orbital Research developed detailed specifications for each component needed for the system and defined the total system specifications. This entailed a combination of system design, compiling existing component specifications, laboratory testing, and simulation. The results showed the feasibility of the data concentrator. Phase II of this project focused on three key objectives. The first objective was to update the data concentrator design modifications from DECWG and prime contractors. Secondly, the project defined requirements for the three new high-temperature, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) : <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> (OTP), transient voltage suppression (TVS), and 3. 3 V.

40|$|Altera {{provides}} {{custom logic}} solutions and is, besides Xilinx, {{one of the}} biggest vendors in their sector. Altera’s Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are SRAM-based devices and thus volatile, which implies that they load their configuration from a configuration device or a flash memory at each new power-up. The FPGA designs are given {{in the form of a}} bitstream. In order to protect such a configuration design from being intercepted and thus cloned or modified, a solution called design security is offered. It is a feature based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption, and is available for the low-cost Cyclone III LS FPGAs, for the midrange FPGAs Aria II, and especially for the high-end FPGAs Stratix II, Stratix III, Stratix IV, and Stratix V. The design security is offered in two versions: A non-volatile variant that stores a <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> AES key or a volatile solution based on a backup battery, allowing to re-program the AES key or to erase it. The utilized AES engine is embedded on the FPGA as an additional unit. Its task is to decrypt previously encrypted configuration designs while they are downloaded fro...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a low power {{implementation of a}} secure EPC UHF Passive RFID Tag baseband system. To ensure the secure information transaction of the tag, traditionally {{the focus is on}} directly applying a low-complexity encryption engine. However, this approach could lead to the problem of known-plaintext attack (KPA). The attacker could make use of the known header to reveal the secret key. Our contributions are proposing a novel datanow solution enforced by an AES cryptography engine embedded inside the passive RFID tag. Also, various low power design techniques are proposed to reduce the power consumption of the baseband of the passive tag. In particular., we propose a moving window PIE decoding algorithm and an improved Tausworthe sequence generator to reduce the power consumption. Other low power design techniques such as clock gating, optimal clock driving and parallel operations are extensively used {{in the design of the}} tag. The complete RFID tag which consists of an analog frontend, 136 bits <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> (OTP) memory, charge pump, rectifier, clock divider., and the proposed baseband system, was designed using TSMC 0. 18 mu m process and verified.

40|$|The {{recycling}} of electronic components {{has become a}} major concern for the industry and government as it potentially impacts the security and reliability {{of a wide variety of}} electronic systems. The sheer number of component types (analog, digital, and mixed-signal) and sizes (large or small) makes it extremely challenging to find a one-sizefits- all solution to detect and prevent recycled ICs. In this paper, two types of on-chip lightweight sensors are proposed to identify recycled ICs by measuring circuit usage time when used in the field. These solutions include light-weight, onchip structures based on ring oscillators (RO-CDIR), anti-fuses (AF-CDIR). Each structure meets the unique needs and limitations of different part types and sizes providing excellent coverage of recycled parts. For RO-based sensors, statistical data analysis is used to separate process and temperature variations ’ effects on the sensor from aging experienced by the sensor in the ICs. For AF-based sensor, counters and embedded <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> memory are used to record the usage time of ICs by counting the cycle of system clock or switching activities of a certain number of nets in the design. Simulation results show the effectiveness of RO-based sensors for identification of recycled ICs. In addition, the analysis of usage time stored in AF-based sensors shows thatrecycled ICs, even used for a very short period, can be accurately identified...|$|E
40|$|Non-volatile {{memories}} (NVMs) {{are essential}} {{for a variety of}} embedded applications such as encryption keys, code storage, and analog trimming. One of the lowest-cost non-volatile memories is the <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> (OTP) memory. Most of the existing OTP memories are fabricated with special processes where extra masks are added to a standard CMOS process. It is, however, still necessary to develop an OTP memory in a pure CMOS process to further reduce the cost for many applications such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Different from conventional OTP memory designs, the targeted embedded applications in this work require ultra-low power consumption in both the read and the write operations. Because of that, power reduction strategies are provided during memory cell and circuit designs. Owing to the need for high voltages during write operations, gate-oxide reliability is also a major concern. To solve all the high voltage problems in the memory circuit, the Cascode technique is used extensively to maintain programming reliability. Various anti-fuse memory elements manufactured with a standard 0. 18 μm CMOS process from a major foundry are compared and the gate-oxide anti-fuse (GOAF) is chosen as the most suitable one when programming current is seriously constrained. Different combinations of GOAF memory cells have been fabricated, measured, and studied. A complete GOAF OTP memory circuit has been designed and fabricated with the above process. The functions of each part are described and measurement results are shown and analyzed in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|Selling {{integrated}} circuits (IC) in consumer markets places a high emphasis on cost. Average selling prices (ASP) {{tend to be}} low due to customer price pressure and competition. One of the largest costs associated with manufacturing ICs is the subsequent test cost. The test time for complex chips is approaching 50 % of total package-device cost. [1] This is broken down into hardware utilization time and man-hours. The more time that is spent testing one product means less time is available for testing other products. Getting capital expenditures approval to buy more test equipment is generally a hard sell, and even if approved the long lead times prove to be not convenient for alleviating test bottlenecks. One {{of the best ways}} to improve test costs is to reduce the test time per unit. Faster unit testing allows the existing hardware to test more products given the same amount of time. The first place to investigate potential savings is to start at the functional level. Semiconductor companies produce an electrical table highlighting the specifications of the part. The industry standard is to break down these specifications into three categories: minimum, maximum, and typical values. Specifications that fall under the heading of minimum or maximum are required to be guaranteed either by the design of the part or by production testing. This paper will discuss an analysis method designed to improve one of the more time-consuming tests, <b>one-time</b> <b>programmable</b> (OTP) trims...|$|E
