25|$|Instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new camp, these columns were {{marched to}} a set of {{prepared}} graves at a former Latvian army training ground in the Pogulianka woods, near the resort of Mežciems, where Germans and Latvian auxiliaries shot the people and pushed their bodies into previously excavated pits. It was reported however that babies were not shot, but simply thrown into a pit and buried alive. By July 28, 1941, old and sick people had also been taken out of the ghetto in a separate incident. They were also murdered. The earthen cover heaped on the graves was quite thin, and two boys only slightly wounded and {{on the top of the}} heaped bodies dug themselves out and escaped. Use of the forested area to conceal the murders was typical of mass shootings in Latvia; the murders in the Railroad Park were an exception.|$|E
500|$|Others {{have argued}} that the film is itself a metaphor for filmmaking, and that the filmgoing {{experience}} itself, images flashing before one's eyes in a darkened room, is akin to a dream. Writing in Wired, Jonah Lehrer supported this interpretation and presented neurological evidence that brain activity is strikingly similar during film-watching and sleeping. In both, the visual cortex is highly active and the prefrontal cortex, which deals with logic, deliberate analysis, and self-awareness, is quiet. Paul argued that the experience <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> picturehouse is itself an exercise in shared dreaming, particularly when viewing Inception: the film's sharp cutting between scenes forces the viewer to create larger narrative arcs to stitch the pieces together. This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images, {{on the part of the}} audience is analogous to dreaming itself. As in the film's story, in a cinema one enters into the space of another's dream, in this case Nolan's, as with any work of art, one's reading of it is ultimately influenced by one's own subjective desires and subconscious. At Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris, Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by adding facing mirrors underneath its struts, Stephanie Dreyfus in la Croix asked [...] "Is this not a strong, beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of {{his early}} influences, Roubini said, [...] "I {{was born into a}} {{relatively}} orthodox Jewish family in Iran, lived in Israel and Turkey, and then moved to Italy as a child. By the age of six, instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> yeshiva, I went to a secular Jewish school where I interacted with kids from all sorts of different backgrounds. Had I gone to an orthodox Jewish school, I would perhaps be orthodox now and may have never become a Global Nomad." ...|$|E

[...] 2007 saw the return of the Rossall Summer School - developed to give children from outside the UK the opportunity to develop their English speaking skills as well as being a chance for those thinking <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> boarding school to consider whether they are suited to the lifestyle.|$|E

"Attorney General Alberto Gonzales {{announced}} Padilla {{is being}} removed from military custody {{and charged with}} a series of crimes" [...] and [...] "There is no mention in the indictment of Padilla's alleged plot to use a dirty bomb in the United States. There is also no mention that Padilla ever planned to stage any attacks inside the country. And there is no direct mention of Al-Qaeda. Instead the indictment lays out a case involving five men who helped raise money and recruit volunteers in the 1990s to go overseas to countries including Chechnya, Bosnia, Somalia and Kosovo. Padilla, in fact, appears to play a minor role in the conspiracy. He is accused <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> jihad training camp in Afghanistan but his lawyers said the indictment offers no evidence he ever engaged in terrorist activity." ...|$|E

5000|$|Alongside the jests {{about how}} much {{children}} like to work, and so {{should be returned to}} Victorian workhouses, are points about letting children try to make their own breakfast (while the parents sleep), or camping in <b>a</b> field instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> [...] "antiseptic children's fun palace".

60|$|After eating this, {{he again}} took {{his way to}} the street, and walked along, looking for a moderate-priced hotel.
