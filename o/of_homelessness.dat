5|$|In 2003, Kon's third work, Tokyo Godfathers, was announced. The film {{centers on}} a trio of {{homeless}} persons in Tokyo who discover a baby on Christmas Eve {{and set out to}} search for her parents. Tokyo Godfathers cost more to make than Kon's previous two films (with a budget of approximately 300,000,000 yen), and centered on the themes <b>of</b> <b>homelessness</b> and abandonment, with a comedic touch worked in. The screenplay was written by Keiko Nobumoto.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 he and Kenneth Adam {{initiated}} the new anthology series The Wednesday Play, a BBC equivalent of Armchair Theatre, which had great success and critical acclaim with plays {{written and directed}} by the likes of Dennis Potter, Jeremy Sandford and Ken Loach. The strand attracted comment and debate for several of its productions, such as Cathy Come Home, a Tony Garnett production of a Jeremy Sandford script, which dealt with the issue <b>of</b> <b>homelessness.</b> There were also problems caused by Newman bringing in freelance directors to work on the programme, who sometimes overspent on their plays to try and increase their impact; with staff directors this could be compensated by reducing the budget of a subsequent production, but for a freelancer there would be no such recourse.|$|E
