5|$|Fürst Bismarck was {{designed}} before the naval arms race between Germany and the United Kingdom. Admiral Hollmann was the State Secretary of the Naval <b>Office</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.

This would be supplemented by a number of cruisers for overseas duties, including trade protection.|$|E

5|$|Opening to mixed reviews, Manhunter fared poorly {{at the box}} <b>office</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of its release, making only $8.6 {{million in}} the United States.

5|$|After further refusals {{from the}} USAF and DoD {{to provide the}} four {{officers}} for interview, Roth's committee gave the DoD and USAF until 14:30 on 31 October 1996 to provide the officers. The deadline passed without the officers appearing before the board. The next day the board sent senate subpoenas directly to the USAF headquarters <b>office</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Pentagon, which refused to accept them. After learning that the senate was now planning to individually serve the four subpoenas directly to the four officers, the associate chief of the Air Force litigation division accepted the subpoenas.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid <b>office</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E

5|$|Baseball {{had been}} {{governed by a}} three-man National Commission, {{consisting}} of American League President Ban Johnson, National League President John Heydler and Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann. In January 1920, Herrmann left <b>office</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> request of other club owners, leaving the Commission effectively deadlocked between Johnson and Heydler. A number of club owners, disliking one or both league presidents, preferred a single commissioner to rule over the game, but were willing to see the National Commission continue if Herrmann was replaced by someone who would provide strong leadership. Landis's name was mentioned in the press for this role, and the influential baseball newspaper The Sporting News sought his appointment.|$|E

5|$|Chotiner {{was given}} an <b>office</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> RNC, {{nominally}} as the official in charge of tickets for the inauguration.

Meanwhile, Nixon and his aides considered a new RNC chairman finally settling on Maryland Congressman Rogers Morton, who agreed to take the position once Bliss left, though Morton was not told of the promise to Chotiner. When the President-elect met with Bliss on January 10, 1969, he could {{not bring himself to}} fire the chairman. With the situation unresolved, and Morton's appointment unannounced, Chotiner sat in his RNC office for a month after the inauguration with nothing to do, as the RNC staff wondered at his presence.|$|E
