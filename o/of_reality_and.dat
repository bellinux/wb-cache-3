5|$|Ancient India, {{particularly}} the centuries {{in which the}} Mahavira and the Buddha lived, were one of intense intellectual debates, especially on the nature <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> self or soul. Jain view of soul differs from those found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and Jain view about jiva and ajiva (self, matter) utilizes anekantavada.|$|E
5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} their values on torture of other creatures that {{were opposed to}} their rule. Their aim was to rule the universe using a mysterious orb that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the orb became too powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of the Realm <b>of</b> <b>Reality</b> <b>and</b> the Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E
5|$|The {{analogy of}} a game was first {{proposed}} by Hans-Georg Gadamer {{in an attempt to}} demonstrate the epistemic unity of language. He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being. Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> that human language participates in a greater language; Christianity teaches this to be the divine word which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ.|$|E

5|$|Montalbán said in promotional {{interviews}} {{for the film}} he realized early on in his career that a good villain does not see himself as villainous. The villain may do villainous things, but he feels that he is doing them for righteous reasons. Montalbán further stated he always {{tried to find a}} flaw in the character, as no one is completely good or completely evil; while Khan had a rather distorted view <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> therefore performed acts of evil, he still felt that his vengeance was a noble cause because of the death of his wife. Khan quotes the character of Ahab from Moby-Dick throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him.|$|E
5|$|The crew took {{advantage}} of both natural and practical light at filming locations. The director sought various approaches to the lighting setups, for example choosing several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. He and the crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from {{the way in which the}} human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E

25|$|Hinduism has no {{traditional}} ecclesiastical order, no centralized religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus {{can choose}} to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monistic, or atheistic. Within this diffuse and open structure, spirituality in Hindu philosophy is an individual experience, and referred to as ksaitrajña (Sanskrit: क्षैत्रज्ञ). It defines spiritual practice as one's journey towards moksha, awareness of self, the discovery of higher truths, true nature <b>of</b> <b>reality,</b> <b>and</b> a consciousness that is liberated and content.|$|E
25|$|Unger's {{model of}} {{philosophical}} practice {{is closest to}} those philosophers who sought to form {{a view of the}} whole <b>of</b> <b>reality,</b> <b>and</b> to do so by using and resisting the specialized knowledge of their time. It has been read as a form of pragmatism, but also as an attempt to disengage ideas and experiences that developed in the West under the influence of Christianity from the categories of Greek philosophy. His thought has been called the inverse of Schopenhauer's philosophy, affirming the supreme value of life and the reality and depth of the self and eschewing fecklessness.|$|E
