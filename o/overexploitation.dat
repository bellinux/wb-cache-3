5|$|P.fluviatile {{has been}} {{harvested}} for food since classical antiquity, {{and is now}} threatened by <b>overexploitation.</b> Many of the island populations are particularly vulnerable, and the Maltese subspecies has become a conservation icon. A population in Rome may have been brought there before {{the founding of the}} Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|According to the IUCN, 97 {{freshwater}} fish species from the Western Ghats were considered threatened in 2011, including 12 critically endangered, 54 endangered and 31 vulnerable. All but one (Tor khudree) {{of these are}} endemic to the Western Ghats. An additional 26 species from the region are considered data deficient (their status is unclear at present). The primary threats are from habitat loss, but also from <b>overexploitation</b> and introduced species.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{they were}} {{supplied}} from local wild populations, but <b>overexploitation</b> {{led to a}} diminution in the supply. This resulted {{in the development of}} frog farming and a global trade in frogs. The main importing countries are France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the United States, while the chief exporting nations are Indonesia and China. The annual global trade in the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), mostly farmed in China, varies between 1200 and 2400 tonnes.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have been}} hunting mammals in Asia {{for at least}} 40,000years, but until recently, slow lorises were only hunted at a {{sustainable}} level. However, hunting pressure since the 1960s has become increasingly unsustainable, leading to <b>overexploitation,</b> because of growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife. In 1985, large wildlife markets {{began to appear in}} Phnom Penh and Sen Monorom, Cambodia, followed quickly by the development of networks of hunters, traders, and middlemen. Bright flashlights make spotting slow lorises much easier at night because of their eye shine, and in the 1990s, large-scale commercial harvesting of slow lorises began as improved batteries for spotlights became available.|$|E
5|$|In 1542, the New Laws {{were issued}} {{with the aim}} of {{protecting}} the indigenous peoples of the Spanish colonies from their <b>overexploitation</b> by the encomenderos. In an effort to enforce the New Laws, a fleet of 27 ships set out from Spain on 19 July 1544, carrying friar Bartolomé de las Casas and his religious followers. Las Casas arrived in Ciudad Real with 16 fellow Dominicans on 12 March 1545. The Dominicans were the first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population. Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives as they saw fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities.|$|E
5|$|The dog conch is an {{economically}} important {{species in the}} Indo-West Pacific, and several studies indicate {{that it may be}} suffering population declines due to overfishing and <b>overexploitation.</b> Malacologists and ecologists have recommended a reduction in its exploitation rate; initiatives in Thailand are attempting to ensure the possibility of reproduction in young-adult individuals and manage the natural populations in general. L.canarium demonstrates the imposex phenomenon, but is resistant to sterility caused by it; therefore, {{it has been suggested that}} this species might be useful as a bioindicator for organotin pollution monitoring near Malaysian ports.|$|E
5|$|Molecular dating {{indicates}} the caballoid lineage diverged from the non-caballoids 4 mya. Genetic {{results suggest that}} all North American fossils of caballine equines, as well as South American fossils traditionally placed in the subgenus E. (Amerhippus), belong to E. ferus. Remains attributed {{to a variety of}} species and lumped together as New World stilt-legged horses (including E. francisci, E. tau, and E. quinni) probably all belong to a second species that was endemic to North America. The possible causes of the extinction of horses in the Americas (ca. 12,000 years ago) have been a matter of debate. Hypotheses include climate change and <b>overexploitation</b> by newly arrived humans. Horses only returned to the American mainland {{with the arrival of the}} conquistadors in 1519.|$|E
5|$|In 1542, the New Laws {{were issued}} {{with the aim}} of {{protecting}} the indigenous peoples of the Spanish colonies from their <b>overexploitation</b> by the encomenderos. Friar Bartolomé de las Casas and his followers left Spain in July 1544 to enforce the New Laws. Las Casas arrived in Ciudad Real with 16 fellow Dominicans on 12 March 1545. The Dominicans were the first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population. Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives as they saw fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities. The Dominicans soon came into conflict with the established colonists. Colonial opposition to the Dominicans was such that the Dominicans were forced to flee Ciudad Real in fear of their lives. They established themselves nearby in two indigenous villages, the old site of Villa Real de Chiapa and Cinacantlán. From Villa Real, Bartolomé de las Casas and his companions prepared for the evangelisation of all the territory that fell within the Bishopric of Chiapa. The Dominicans promoted the veneration of Santiago Matamoros (St. James the Moor-slayer) as a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority. The Dominicans soon saw the need to reestablish themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real was placed.|$|E
25|$|Altieri {{and colleagues}} (2012) further {{hypothesized}} that historic, large-scale, industrialized <b>overexploitation</b> {{of fish in}} the northwest Atlantic (Lotze et al. 2006) increased marsh vulnerability {{to the effects of}} localized recreational fishing to the point that large-scale die off ensued, and that resultant localized die-offs could coalesce into complete, region-wide marsh die-off if <b>overexploitation</b> of top consumers continues (Altieri et al. 2012).|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Housing, Territorial Organization and Environmental (MVOTMA for its acronym in Spanish) {{considers}} that water quality in Uruguay is slowly decreasing {{due to the}} release of untreated effluents from industries and cities as well as agricultural runoff. In addition, uncontrolled groundwater use can lead to pollution or <b>overexploitation</b> of aquifers. In the Departments of Canelones and Maldonado, <b>overexploitation</b> has cause sea water intrusion into coastal aquifers and bacterial contamination.|$|E
25|$|The art of feather working {{has nearly}} died {{out because of}} the <b>overexploitation</b> of the primary material. However, some is still done in Ecatepec, La Paz, Rayon, San Martín de las Piramides, Teotihuacan, Tepotzotlan and Toluca.|$|E
25|$|Fishing boats on the Caribbean side bring shrimp {{as well as}} {{lobsters}} into {{processing plants}} at Puerto Cabezas, Bluefields, and Laguna de Perlas. A turtle fishery thrived on the Caribbean coast before it collapsed from <b>overexploitation.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{has long}} been a commercially {{important}} fish, as a source of food, shark fin, animal feed, and shark liver oil. <b>Overexploitation</b> has reduced its populations to the point where some have disappeared and others need protection.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, tourism harms DR’s water {{resources}} and environment. WRM {{issues associated with}} tourism include: dumping of untreated waste water and solid waste along the coast, <b>overexploitation</b> of groundwater, destruction of forest cover, and overfishing of coral reef and marine species.|$|E
25|$|Humans use {{intertidal}} regions {{for food}} and recreation. <b>Overexploitation</b> can damage intertidals directly. Other anthropogenic actions such as introducing invasive species and climate change have large negative effects. Marine Protected Areas are one option communities can apply to protect these areas and aid scientific research.|$|E
25|$|A. ocellaris are {{utilized}} {{as part of}} {{the tropical}} fish aquarium trade. However, only certain colors are in demand. In addition, A. ocellaris are used in research since they can be bred easily. This high demand in trade has been dangerous for A. ocellaris population due to <b>overexploitation.</b>|$|E
25|$|M. americanum, the American mastodon, is the {{youngest}} and best-known species of the genus. They disappeared from North America {{as part of a}} mass extinction of most of the Pleistocene megafauna, widely believed to have been related to <b>overexploitation</b> by Clovis hunters, and possibly also to climate change.|$|E
25|$|Intertidal {{regions are}} {{utilized}} by humans {{for food and}} recreation, but anthropogenic actions also have major impacts, with <b>overexploitation,</b> invasive species and climate change being among the problems faced by intertidal communities. In some places Marine Protected Areas have been established to protect these areas and aid in scientific research.|$|E
25|$|The fishing {{capacity}} {{problem is not}} only related to the {{conservation of fish stocks}} but also to the sustainability of fishing activity. Causes of the fishing problem {{can be found in the}} property rights regime of fishing resources. <b>Overexploitation</b> and rent dissipation of fishermen arise in open-access fisheries as was shown in Gordon.|$|E
25|$|The {{foremost}} water {{challenge in}} Greater Damascus {{is an increasing}} demand-supply imbalance, coupled with groundwater <b>overexploitation</b> and pollution. This imbalance leads to intermittent supply and coping costs {{in the form of}} expensive sales of water by tankers. Climate change may exacerbate this imbalance. Poor neighborhoods suffer disproportionately from the area’s water problems.|$|E
25|$|Exports of {{aquarium}} {{fish from}} the Maldives is increasing. Currently, about 100 species of fish are exported, with 20 species comprising over 75 percent of the trade. Some species exported are rare in the Maldives, and are vulnerable to <b>overexploitation.</b> Cyanide fishing is occasionally practiced in the Maldives to capture aquarium fish.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} {{range of}} mountains, the Sierra Madre, form a continuous chain {{along the border}} with Honduras. Elevations in this region range from 1,600 to 2,700 meters. The area was once heavily forested, but <b>overexploitation</b> led to extensive erosion, and it has become semibarren. As a result, it is the country's most sparsely populated zone, with little farming or other development.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} {{the context of}} water privatisation in Jakarta, {{it is useful to}} know the water use pattern of residents, in particular of the poor, the particular financial mechanism of the concessions in Jakarta, the various types of water resources and on which the city relies, and about other water-related challenges that are not directly related to privatisation such as floods, groundwater <b>overexploitation</b> and land subsidence.|$|E
25|$|Human {{pressures}} on global freshwater systems are having dramatic effects. The freshwater cycle is another boundary significantly affected by climate change. Freshwater resources, such as lakes and aquifers, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term fossil water is sometimes {{used to describe}} aquifers which don't recharge). <b>Overexploitation</b> occurs if a water resource is mined or extracted {{at a rate that}} exceeds the recharge rate. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. Forests enhance the recharge of aquifers in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer depletion. Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as nitrates, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean. This turns much of the world's underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil. Though Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources, their <b>overexploitation</b> can result in a Hubbert-like peak. A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} {{sturgeon}} are harvested for their roe which is processed into caviar—a luxury {{food and the}} reason why caviar-producing sturgeons are among the most valuable of all wildlife resources. They are particularly vulnerable to <b>overexploitation</b> and other threats, including pollution and habitat fragmentation. Most species of sturgeon are considered to be at risk of extinction, making them more critically endangered than any other group of species.|$|E
25|$|The NEAP, {{adopted in}} 1994, {{is the basic}} {{blueprint}} for environmental protection. The plan focuses on solving {{a small number of}} critical problems, collecting reliable information to aid in that process, and integrating environmental measures with economic and social development strategy. The initial planning period is to end in 1997. The main targets of that phase are inefficient water resource management, land degradation, <b>overexploitation</b> of forest reserves, loss of biodiversity, and pollution from inefficient mining and refining practices.|$|E
25|$|Rattans are {{threatened}} with <b>overexploitation,</b> as harvesters are cutting stems too young and reducing {{their ability to}} resprout. Unsustainable harvesting of rattan can lead to forest degradation, affecting overall forest ecosystem services. Processing can also be polluting. The use of toxic chemicals and petrol in the processing of rattan affects soil, air and water resources, and also ultimately people's health. Meanwhile, the conventional method of rattan production is threatening the plant's long-term supply, and the income of workers.|$|E
25|$|In Costa Rica, 2020 {{projections}} for water demand {{for all uses}} are estimated to reach 39km3, equivalent to 35% of the total water resources available. The key challenge is to properly manage the exponential growth in demand from 5% to 35% of available water resources. Urban development continues to increase the pressure on water resources {{and the use of}} water and groundwater in particular is becoming increasingly more complex due to rapid urbanization and <b>overexploitation</b> from domestic, industrial, and agricultural demand.|$|E
25|$|Overfishing {{is a form}} of <b>overexploitation</b> where {{fish stocks}} are reduced to below {{acceptable}} levels. Overfishing can occur in water bodies of any sizes, such as ponds, rivers, lakes or oceans, and can result in resource depletion, reduced biological growth rates and low biomass levels. Sustained overfishing can lead to critical depensation, where the fish population is no longer able to sustain itself. Some forms of overfishing, for example the overfishing of sharks, has led to the upset of entire marine ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|In some basins, {{such as that}} of the Barada around Damascus, total {{water use}} exceeds {{availability}} of renewable water resources, resulting in <b>overexploitation</b> of groundwater. In the Mleita plain around the town of Al-Nabk in the Kalamoon Mountains north of Damascus, for example, the water table declined from 35 meter in 1984 to below 250 meter in 2009. Agriculture all but disappeared and the fertile valley was turned into a dusty wasteland. Other areas of heavy groundwater overxploitation are the area around Mhardeh in Hama Governorate, Khan Shaykhun in Idlib Governorate and the Damascus Ghouta where groundwater levels dropped by more than 6 meters per year in some areas between 1993 and 2000. <b>Overexploitation</b> of groundwater has contributed to a decline in the flow of the Khabur River which has ceased to flow during summer since 1999. The number of wells in Syria has been estimated to have increased from 135,089 in 1999 to over 213,335 in 2007, according to the National Agricultural Policy Centre (NAPC). The lands irrigated by groundwater increased from 652,000ha in 1985 to 1.4m ha in 2005. Rural electrification, diesel subsidies and subsidized loans for the drilling and equipment of wells contributed to the boom in groundwater irrigation.|$|E
25|$|According to many critics, the {{economic}} crisis in the 1980s worsened environmental degradation in Brazil because it led to <b>overexploitation</b> of natural resources, stimulated settlement in fragile lands in both rural and urban areas, and weakened environmental protection. At the same time, however, the lower level of economic activity may have reduced pressure on the environment, such as the aforementioned decreased level of investment in large-scale clearing in the Amazon. That pressure could increase if economic growth accelerates, especially if consumption patterns remain unchanged and more sustainable forms of production are not found.|$|E
25|$|The poorest {{section of}} the {{population}} of Damascus live in the Southern neighborhoods which also receive the poorest service quality both in terms of quantity and quality. These neighborhoods are served primarily by wells whose quality is dubious, especially in terms of nitrates (see pollution). Due to <b>overexploitation</b> the amount of water available is insufficient for continuous supply, especially during summer when demand increases and groundwater levels drop (see intermittent supply). Due to pressure changes when supply is turned on and off, pollutants are sucked into leaky distribution pipes which further contaminates drinking water. This phenomenon is more widespread in the poorer neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|The {{tortoise}} (Freshwater turtle - guiban) and {{the turtle}} (Chinese softshell turtle - biejia) species used in traditional Chinese medicine are raised on farms, while restrictions {{are made on}} the accumulation and export of other endangered species. However, issues concerning the <b>overexploitation</b> of Asian turtles in China have not been completely solved. Australian scientists have developed methods to identify medicines containing DNA traces of endangered species. Finally, although not an endangered species, sharp rises in exports of donkeys and donkey hide from Africa to China to make the traditional remedy ejiao have prompted export restrictions by some African countries.|$|E
25|$|Water {{management}} in Greater Damascus, a metropolitan area {{with more than}} 4 million inhabitants, is characterized by numerous challenges, including groundwater <b>overexploitation,</b> increasing water demand, intermittent supply, and pollution. These challenges could be exacerbated by the impact of climate change, since projections indicate that a decrease in rainfall is likely. The quality of residential water supply mirrors social divisions within the metropolitan area, with the poorest neighborhoods receiving the worst service. Irrigation in the rural parts of Greater Damascus, in particular in the Ghouta, still accounts for about 70% of water use in the metropolitan area, with the remainder being used for residential, commercial and industrial use.|$|E
25|$|Human {{activities}} can trigger trophic cascades (Jefferies 1997), which {{occur when the}} predators that limit abundance of prey and thereby enhance survival of the next lower trophic level are depleted (Strong 1992). Depletion of top predators releases their prey from consumer control and leads to population declines of the next lower trophic level, often the primary producers. Trophic cascades occur across {{a minimum of three}} trophic levels and can impact community dynamics in a variety of systems (Estes et al. 1998). Trophic cascades can induce salt marsh die-off and transform green landscapes into barrens (Estes and Duggins 1995, Silliman et al. 2005). Primary triggers of trophic cascades through human action include introduction of invasive species, <b>overexploitation,</b> and climate change (Jackson et al. 2001, Lotze et al. 2006, Gedan et al. 2009, Gedan and Bertness 2011).|$|E
25|$|A {{classic example}} of a trophic cascade {{was caused by the}} <b>overexploitation</b> of sea otters in the 1980s (Estes & Duggins 1995). Sea otters eat urchins, which in turn graze on macroalgae in a food chain that, when altered, can lead to urchin barrens. Sea otters in Alaska were hunted to near {{extinction}} for their pelts. Where sea otter populations have persisted, they suppress the abundance of urchins and thus have an indirect positive effect on the density of macroalgae. In contrast, in sites where sea otters are absent, sea urchin populations have surged and caused urchin barrens to develop. Wherever sea otters have been reinstated, sea urchin populations have been reduced, and kelp densities have increased, returning the habitat to its original healthy state. This example demonstrates the potential for whole-ecosystem recovery with the reestablishment of consumers (Estes and Duggins 1995).|$|E
