In {{the case of}} a single target legitimate signal, we show that the existing result based on the simplification of the system model by neglecting the jamming channel leads to losing important insights regarding the effect of jamming power and jamming channel on the jamming strategy. We find a closed-form optimal solution for the problem under a positive semi-definite (PSD) condition without considering simplifications in the model. If the condition is not satisfied and the optimal solution may not exist in closed-form, we find the optimal solution using a numerical method and also propose a suboptimal solution in closed-form as a close approximation of the optimal solution.

In K-user <b>orthogonal</b> <b>transmission</b> scheme, each user occupies 1 /K {{of the time}} or frequency resources {{no matter what the}} SNRs and INRs are. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 4. We can see that the sum rate of the virtual IA scheme linearly increases with the number of users when K≥ 2, but its performance is not the best for all cases. In two-user or three-user interference channels, the proposed layered IA scheme can achieve higher sum rate. According to the optimization process in Section 2, the active level assignment is not an equal distribution among users. By contrast, the user with better channel conditions (e.g., large SNR and small INR) might be assigned more active levels to maximize the sum rate. Hence, when the number of users is not too much, the optimized level assignment scheme outperforms the scheme that each user exploits one half of the channel resource. In interference channels with more than three users, the virtual IA scheme will gradually dominate the performance due to the advantage that each user can exploit 1 / 2 DoF of the channel. No matter how many users exist, the achieved sum rate of the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>transmission</b> scheme always keeps unchanged.|$|E
