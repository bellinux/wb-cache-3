5|$|Oklahoma Territory was {{reported}} in 1892 to be around 85 percent white, 10 percent colored and 5 percent Indian. Oklahoma was awarded statehood in 1907, with a constitution that enshrined racial segregation (Jim Crow laws). In 1911 the local school had 555 white students and <b>one</b> <b>black.</b>|$|E
5|$|After its {{ratification}} of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865, the South Carolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black Codes. The Black Codes created a separate set of laws, punishments, and acceptable behaviors for anyone with more than <b>one</b> <b>black</b> great-grandparent. Under these Codes, Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and had few Constitutional rights. Restrictions on black land ownership threatened to make economic subservience permanent.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Keggy's {{introduction}} in 2003, a {{group of}} students stole the Keggy costume from its home in the Sigma Nu fraternity library and sent threatening notes to Keggy's creators, including photographs of the mascot bound and gagged with <b>one</b> <b>black</b> eye. Some thought this to be a publicity stunt by the creators, but the mascot had truly been stolen. Keggy was eventually returned with minor damage to the costume.|$|E

Loving <b>one’s</b> <b>black</b> image, loving <b>one’s</b> <b>black</b> family and loving <b>one’s</b> <b>black</b> culture are the essential ways. By doing so can black women retain their authentic identities. Keywords—Tony Morrison; identity confirmation; multiple oppression; The Bluest Eye I...|$|R

5|$|Starting in July 2000, the Senators reused the {{alternate}} logo on another third jersey, designed by Ottawa firm Hoselton Brunet, this <b>one</b> <b>black</b> {{with red and}} gold sleeves and a gold stripe with laurel leaves {{along the bottom of}} the jersey. On the shoulders, was {{a modified version of the}} original Peace Tower logo of the expansion campaign, which the management liked. Like the original logo, this design was leaked onto the Internet. This jersey was in use until the end of the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|The Port Chicago {{disaster}} highlighted systemic racial {{inequality in}} the Navy. A {{year before the}} disaster, in mid-1943, the U.S. Navy had over 100,000 African Americans in service but not <b>one</b> <b>black</b> officer. In the months following the disaster, the Pittsburgh Courier, a newspaper with a large nationwide subscription primarily of African Americans, related the incident and the subsequent mutiny trial in their Double V campaign, a push for victory over not just the Axis powers but also over racial inequality at home. The mutiny trial was seen as underscoring the tense race relations {{in the armed forces}} at the time.|$|E
5|$|African Americans were {{originally}} {{admitted to the}} university in the mid-1950s, but few attended until the 1970s; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated. Although a student fraternity committee emphasized the fraternities' rejection of racial discrimination, in 1969 only 5 of 578 fraternity pledges were black. African-American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university, although they presented themselves as service organizations rather than traditional social organizations. In the mid-1970s, although some black students were {{invited to join the}} heavily white fraternities, many preferred to join their own organizations. By the fall of 1973, four black fraternities and <b>one</b> <b>black</b> sorority had established chapters on grounds.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Shadow suffers from amnesia. Other than the events of Sonic Heroes that took place three months prior, Shadow remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter Maria, who was killed by G.U.N. soldiers. Having walked through a room filled with androids that looked like him during the events of Sonic Heroes, Shadow wonders if he too is an android. The game starts with Shadow reminiscing outside the city of Westopolis when the alien race Black Arms drops out of the sky and invades the city. <b>One</b> <b>Black</b> Arms alien, Doom's Eye, approaches Shadow, and the Black Arms's leader Black Doom tells Shadow of an old agreement Shadow made: to bring Black Doom the Chaos Emeralds. Stunned that Black Doom knew his name, Shadow searches for the Chaos Emeralds to learn about his past.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, three {{civil rights}} workers (two white and <b>one</b> <b>black)</b> who {{organize}} a voter registry for African Americans in Jessup County, Mississippi go missing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation sends two agents, Rupert Anderson—a former Mississippi sheriff—and Alan Ward, to investigate. The pair {{find it difficult}} to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies exert influence over the public and are linked to a branch of the Ku Klux Klan. The wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell reveals to Anderson in a discreet conversation that the three missing men have been murdered. Their bodies are later found buried in an earthen dam. Stuckey deduces Mrs Pell's confession to the FBI and informs Pell, who brutally beats his wife in retribution.|$|E
5|$|Miskovsky {{left the}} CIA in 1964, {{and worked for}} the Federal Maritime Commission and the Treasury Department for four years. In 1967, Miskovsky was {{appointed}} to lead an investigation concerning the 1967 Detroit riot for the Kerner Commission. During the investigation, Miskovsky interviewed civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Miskovsky's report concluded that the United States was transitioning into two separate societies, <b>one</b> <b>black</b> and the other white, and that the societies were inherently unequal. In 1968, Miskovsky was appointed the director of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization which gave legal aid to those whose civil liberties were violated. From 1977 to 1981, during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Miskovsky served as {{general counsel for the}} Federal Home Loan Bank Board.|$|E

5|$|Deaths during {{training}} accidents {{make up the}} majority of the SASR's fatalities. The worst accident in the regiment's history occurred on the evening of 12 June 1996 when two S-70-A9 Black Hawk helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment carrying SASR troopers collided during a live-fire counter-terrorism/special-recovery operation exercise at Fire Support Base Barbara in the High Range Training Area near Townsville, Queensland. This activity was part of Exercise Day Rotor 96 and took place {{on the second day of}} the exercise, sometime after 18:30, requiring the pilots to use night vision goggles. Six aircraft had been approaching the target area when, 30 seconds from the landing zone, one of the helicopters veered to the right, clipping the tail rotor of another helicopter. <b>One</b> <b>Black</b> Hawk crashed immediately killing 12 personnel on board, while the other was able to make a crash landing but burst into flames, killing six. Crash survivors, soldiers from the other helicopters and exercise staff risked the flames and exploding ammunition to rescue their comrades and retrieve the bodies of the dead. Fifteen members of the SASR and three from the 5th Aviation Regiment lost their lives in the accident. Fourteen personnel were later officially recognised for their part in the rescue and evacuation operation.|$|E
