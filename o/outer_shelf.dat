25|$|The depositional {{environment}} {{of the majority of}} Burgess-Shale-type assemblages is <b>outer</b> <b>shelf,</b> deeper water. The Emu Bay Shale in contrast, appears to represent deposition in restricted basins on the inner shelf, indicating that soft tissue preservation occurred in a range of environmental settings during the Cambrian. Some Emu Bay fossils display extensive mineralization of soft tissues, most often of blocky apatite or fibrous calcium carbonate, including the oldest phosphatized muscle tissue – along with records from Sirius Passet in Greenland, the first thus far reported from the Cambrian. Mid-gut glands are preserved three-dimensionally in calcium phosphate in the arthropods Isoxys and Oestokerkus, as in related species from the Burgess Shale.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{that move}} {{offshore}} {{generally do not}} leave continental shelf waters, however still penetrate to depths of 350 m, and possibly deeper. These individuals live on the <b>outer</b> <b>shelf</b> edges, sill reefs and upper slopes of the deep reef, and {{tend to be more}} solitary than juveniles. Adults have also been sighted around the large oil rig platforms throughout the Gulf of Mexico, where they use the man-made structure like a reef to hunt prey. The larvae and young juveniles of the species live pelagically offshore along the continental shelf and slope, and are also known to congregate around oil platforms, as well as natural floating debris such as sargassum mats.|$|E
40|$|Early 2009 saw {{a flurry}} of {{submissions}} of information on proposed <b>outer</b> continental <b>shelf</b> limits to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS).

The paper provides a global overview of the impact of extended continental shelf submissions. These substantial „additional‟ areas of continental shelf may contain valuable seabed resources, including hydrocarbons.

25|$|The {{blue runner}} is {{primarily}} an inshore fish {{throughout most of}} its range, however it is known to live on reefs in water depths greater than 100 m. Throughout much of its Central American range, it is quite rare inshore, instead more commonly sighted on the outer reefs. The blue runner is primarily a semi-pelagic fish, inhabiting both inshore reefs and the <b>outer</b> <b>shelf</b> edges, sill reefs and upper slopes of the deep reef. Those individuals on shallower reefs often move between reef patches over large sand expanses. Juvenile fish are also known to inhabit the shallow waters of inshore lagoons, taking refuge around mangroves or in seagrass amongst coral reef patches. Fishermen have also taken the species in the Mississippi delta, indicating it can tolerate lower salinities in almost estuarine environments.|$|E
2500|$|The Talkeetna Mountains Hadrosaur was a hadrosaurid of {{indeterminate}} classification whose carcass {{appeared to}} have been deposited in a bathyal or <b>outer</b> <b>shelf</b> environment that later became Alaska's Matanuska Formation. Every element of its skeleton not found in a concretion bore many closely spaced ovualar conical depressions ranging in diameter from [...] and [...] deep. These depressions are probably bite marks. The depressions are not symmetrical enough for gastropod drill marks and are not shaped like sponge borings. None of the preserved fish fossils of the Matanuska Formation fit the size or geometry of the borings. The size and spacing and shape by contrast, however, closely resembles the teeth of Tylosaurus proriger. The apparent tooth marks are unlikely to have occurred before the carcass was washed out to sea since that would have punctured the body, preventing the buildup of bloating gases that allowed the carcass to drift out to sea in the first place. The distribution of bite marks corresponds inversely to the presence of flesh in the animal. For instance, lower limb bones sustained the most damage because there was the least amount of flesh shielding the bones at those locations. The concretions formed as the flesh chemically reacted to the seafloor on the largest parts of the animal where the scavenging mosasaur would be unable to fully wrap its jaws around the carcass. Bones pulled free from the carcass were buried in the mud and preserved in mudstone.|$|E

50|$|The depositional {{profile of}} the {{northern}} Banc d'Arguin describes a flat-topped platform, on which extensive carbonate deposits developed largely in water depths <10 meters below sea level (mbsl). Vast areas of the Banc d'Arguin are covered by mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sediments dominated by barnacles and mollusk remains plus admixed eolian siliciclastics. These sediments accumulate into extensive shoals, occasionally causing water depths below 5 mbsl several dozens kilometers offshore the present shoreline. The bank edge forms a sharp morphological step, suddenly deepening from 10-20 mbsl down to 30-50 mbsl, and separates the inner shelf environments (<5-10 mbsl; carbonate bank) {{from those of the}} <b>outer</b> <b>shelf.</b> Assemblages formed by benthic foraminifers and mollusks and monospecific bivalve shell accumulations with admixed eolian silt characterize the platform cover in the <b>outer</b> <b>shelf.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Gulf of Papua shelf can {{be divided}} into four geomorphic zones: a low-relief, inner-shelf, deltaic zone; a high-relief, mid- to outer-shelf incised valley zone; a high-relief, {{southern}} reef zone; and a moderate to low-relief mid- to <b>outer</b> <b>shelf</b> zone in the east and northeast. The deltaic zone is an extensive flat, shallow surface in 5-30 m water depth. It is bordered by a relatively steep prodelta region in 20-50 m of water, that extends along the coast between the tide-dominated Fly and wave-dominated Purari River mouths. [...] The incised valley zone has a complex, offshore-onshore-trending seafloor topography on the middle to <b>outer</b> <b>shelf</b> between 50 m and 100 m water depth. Evidence suggests that the largest of these valleys formed by erosive tidal currents during the Pleistocene when sea level was about 30-50 m below its present position. [...] The reef zone is a complex of barrier and patch reefs south of 9° 30' lat., the bathymetry is rugged near steep-sided coral reefs which locally may have vertical sides. Between the reefs, however, the shelf is a mostly flat and featureless surface with water depths of 20-50 m. Water depths increase rapidly to the east of the GBR, which is located on the shelf margin of the Coral Sea basin in water 120-140 m deep. The moderate- to low-relief mid- to <b>outer</b> <b>shelf</b> zone lies north of the incised valleys and offshore from the deltaic zone. Although the 60 m to 80 m isobaths suggest the existence of east-west trending valleys, these are much lower in relief than those to the south. Generally, this zone forms a low-relief plain, gently dipping towards the shelf break which is in about 140 m of water. A drowned barrier reef system forms a rim near the shelf break along the southeastern part of the Gulf.|$|E
