5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Orange Bowl {{kicked off}} at 8:39pm EST on January 3, 2011 in Sun Life Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida. Bowl {{officials}} said 65,463tickets were sold for the game, but many went unused, and that official figure {{was more than}} 9,000 below stadium capacity. The game was televised on ESPN, and the announcers were Mike Tirico, Ron Jaworski, Jon Gruden and Michele Tafoya. An estimated 8.23million viewers watched the broadcast, earning it a Nielsen rating of 7.1. That figure was the second-lowest mark to date for a BCS game. For contributing teams to the Orange Bowl, the Atlantic Coast Conference and Pacific-10 each received large amounts <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> divided among their members. Because the Pac-10 had two BCS teams, that conference received $27.2million from the BCS. The ACC, which had only Virginia Tech in a BCS bowl, received $21.2million. In the ACC, Virginia Tech received a somewhat {{larger share of the}} money as a reward for winning the conference: All other ACC teams received $1.1million; Tech got $1.7million. Stanford received a similar amount, but the extra money was offset by the cost of sending 500 players, coaches, and staff to Miami.|$|E

25|$|From 2015 all buses in Scotland {{will have}} to be {{disabled}} accessible to meet the Disability Discrimination Act. This act has caused a great deal of resentment in the bus industry as it will require a large amount <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spent modifying or buying new buses that comply with the act, for what is perceived to be little benefit. It also sees a number of otherwise serviceable buses taken off the road and made worthless before the end of their natural life. In Scotland {{there are a number of}} situations where currently no suitable buses are manufactured that could operate due the hilly and uneven road conditions which damage disabled accessible vehicles. The Isle of Arran is one example, where extensive road improvements will be required before disabled accessible buses can be operated extensively on the island.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{great deal}} <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made in this way. The record breaker was the capture of the Spanish frigate Hermione, which was {{carrying}} treasure in 1762. The value of this was so great that each individual seaman netted £485 ($1.4million in 2008 dollars). The two captains responsible, Evans and Pownall, received £65,000 each ($188.4million). In January 1807 the frigate Caroline took the Spanish San Rafael which brought in £52,000 for her captain, Peter Rainier (who had been only a Midshipman some thirteen months before). All through the wars there are examples of this kind of luck falling on captains. Another famous 'capture' was that of the Spanish frigates Thetis and Santa Brigada which were loaded with gold specie. They were taken by four British frigates who shared the money, each captain receiving £40,730. Each lieutenant got £5,091, the Warrant Officer group, £2,468, the midshipmen £791 and the individual seamen £182.|$|E

2500|$|Due to this restriction, {{application}} of the income tax to income derived from real estate and specifically income {{in the form of}} dividends from personal property ownership such as stock shares was found to be unconstitutional because it was not apportioned among the states; that is to say, there was no guarantee that a State with 10% of the country's population paid 10% of those income taxes collected, because Congress had not fixed an amount <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> raised and apportioned it between the States according to their respective shares of the national population. [...] To permit the levying of such an income tax, Congress proposed and the states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment, which removed the restriction by specifically providing that Congress could levy a tax on income [...] "from whatever source derived" [...] without it being apportioned among the States or otherwise based on a State's share of the national population.|$|E

2500|$|While applauding Nixon's {{progressive}} policy agenda, environmentalists found much {{to criticize}} in his record. The administration strongly supported continued {{funding of the}} [...] "noise-polluting" [...] Supersonic transport (SST), which Congress dropped funding for in 1971. Additionally, he vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972, and after Congress overrode the veto, Nixon impounded the funds Congress had authorized to implement it. While not opposed to {{the goals of the}} legislation, Nixon objected to the amount <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spent on reaching them, which he deemed excessive. Faced as he was with a generally liberal Democratic Congress, perceived as being spendthrift (in 1972 John Ehrlichman used the term [...] "credit-card Congress"), Nixon used this power on multiple occasions during his presidency. Congress's response {{came in the form of}} the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which established a new budget process, and included a procedure providing congressional control over the impoundment of funds by the president. Nixon, mired in Watergate, signed the legislation July 12.|$|E
