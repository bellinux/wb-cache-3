By interpreting the age distribution diagram using numerical results from an extensive library of N-body calculations carried out during the last ten years, we reconstruct the recent star formation history of the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk.</b> Our analysis suggests that superimposed on a relatively small level of constant star formation activity mainly in small-N star clusters, the star formation rate has experienced at least 5 episodes of enhanced star formation lasting about 0. 2 Gyr with production of larger clusters.

40|$|Using deep HST/ACS observations, we {{demonstrate}} that the sub-solar stellar initial mass function (IMF) of 6 ultra-faint dwarf Milky Way Satellites (UFDs) is more bottom light than the IMF of the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk.</b> Our data have a lower mass limit of about 0. 45 M_, while the upper limit is ∼ 0. 8 M_, set by the turn-off mass of these old, metal poor systems. If formulated as a single power law, we obtain a shallower IMF slope than the "Salpeter" value of - 2. 3, ranging from - 1. 01 for Leo IV, to - 1. 87 for Boötes I. The significance of such deviations depends on the galaxy and is typically 95 % or more. When modeled as a log-normal, the IMF fit results in a larger peak mass than in the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk,</b> however a Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk</b> value for the characteristic system mass (∼ 0. 22 M_) is excluded only at 68 % significance, and only for some UFDs in the sample. We find that the IMF slope correlates well with the galaxy mean metallicity and, to a lesser degree, with the velocity dispersion and the total mass. The strength of the observed correlations is limited by shot noise {{in the number of}} observed stars, but future space-based missions like JWST and WFIRST will both enhance the number of dwarf Milky Way Satellites that can be studied in such detail, and the observation depth for individual galaxies.

40|$|The present-day {{state of}} the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk</b> can tell us much {{about the history of}} our Galaxy and provide {{insights}} into its formation. We have constructed a high-precision catalogue of disk stars using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and use these stars to probe the heating history as well as investigating the detailed phase-space distribution. We also show how this sample can be used to probe the global properties of the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk,</b> employing the Jeans equations to provide a simple model of the potential close to the disk.

40|$|The {{high-velocity}} {{clouds of}} atomic hydrogen, discovered about 35 years ago(1, 2), have velocities inconsistent with simple Galactic rotation models that generally fit {{the stars and}} gas in the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk.</b> Their origins and role in Galactic evolution remain poorly understood(3), largely for lack of information on their distances. The high-velocity clouds might result from gas blown from the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk</b> into the halo by supernovae(4, 5), in which case they would enrich the Galaxy with heavy elements as they fall back onto the disk. Alternatively, they may consist of metal-poor gas-remnants of the era of galaxy formation(2, 6 - 8), accreted by the Galaxy and reducing its metal abundance. Or they might be truly extragalactic objects in the Local Group of galaxies(7 - 9). Here we report a firm distance bracket for a large high-velocity cloud, chain A, which places it in the Milky Way halo (2. 5 to 7 kiloparsecs above the Galactic plane), rather than at an extragalactic distance, and constrains its gas mass to between 10 (5) and 2 x 10 (6) solar masses...|$|R

As a result of this open cluster survey, we have found that the outer most open clusters have different properties from most clusters. With further investigation, we have found that these outer, old open clusters seem to lie in an orbital plane concurrent with a newly found stellar tidal stream, and may not be part of Galactic disk. We present the first results of the chemo-dynamics of these, possibly accreted, clusters which will allow us to determine two things: 1) What are the properties of this new galaxy’s clusters system, and 2) What are the most distant open clusters that can be used reliably in the study of mass distribution in the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on a simple, but fairly successful, {{model of}} the {{chemical}} evolution of the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk,</b> we study {{the evolution of the}} abundances of the elements He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar and Fe.

We find that most observed abundance profiles are correctly reproduced by massive star yields, but C and N require supplementary sources. We argue that massive, mass losing stars can totally account for the abundance profile of C, while intermediate mass stars are the main source of N; in both cases, some conflict with corresponding data on extragalactic HII regions arises, at least if current observations in the Galaxy are taken at face value. The observed behaviour of Al is marginally compatible with current massive star yields, which probably overestimate the “odd-even ” effect. We also find that the adopted “inside-out ” formation scheme for the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk</b> produces abundance profiles steeper in the past.

Unlike for the stellar halo, the disk’s dissipative history means most of its dynamical information is lost. Any dynamical probing of the disk can only provide information up until the epoch of last dissipation or dynamical scattering event. However the chemical information survives. If star-forming aggregates have unique chemical signatures, we can use the method of chemical tagging to tag disk stars to a common formation event (Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn 2002). Detailed chemical abundance patterns offer the possibility to reconstruct now dispersed stellar aggregates of the protogalactic disk and so improve our basic understanding of the disk formation process (Bland-Hawthorn & Freeman 2004) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{reassess}} {{the applicability}} of the Toomre criterion in galactic disks and we study the local star formation law in 16 disk galaxies for which abundance gradients are published. The data we use consists of stellar light profiles, atomic and molecular gas (deduced from CO with a metallicity-dependent conversion factor), star formation rates (from H-alpha emissivities), metallicities, dispersion velocities and rotation curves. We show that the Toomre criterion applies successfully to the case of the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk,</b> but it has limited success with the data of our sample; depending on whether the stellar component is included or not in the stability analysis, we find average values for the threshold ratio of the gas surface density to the critical surface density in the range 0. 5 to 0. 7. We also test various star formation laws proposed in the literature, i. e. either the simple Schmidt law or modifications of it, that take into account dynamical factors. We find only small differences among them as far as the overall fit to our data is concerned; in particular, we find that all three SF laws (with parameters derived from the fits to our data) match particularly well observations in the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>disk.</b> In all cases we find that the exponent n of our best fit SFR has slightly higher values than in other recent works and we suggest several reasons that may cause that discrepancy.
