40|$|The paper {{contains}} substantiated expediency in {{application of}} machine tools for manufacturing lenses with low stiffness which {{make it possible}} to process simultaneously both actuating surfaces of optical parts. While doing so there is a possibility not only to improve quality of parts due to exclusion of their deformation at the blocking stage {{but there is also a}} possibility to ensure significant increase in productivity of the process which pre-supposes shape-formation of high-precision non-process optical elements and also to decrease energy consumption per unit of production. A basic diagram of the machine tool for simultaneous processing of two-sided optical parts with spherical surfaces under conditions of free lapping is presented in the paper. The paper describes the essence of the free lapping method which is one of the most widely used methods in optical instrument-making while obtaining parts with precision actuating surfaces.

40|$|Fuzzy {{control is}} applied to the {{superfinishing}} in order to optimize the cutting ability of the stone. The finishing performance of vitrified bonded WA stone is regarded as the fuzzy goal. At the beginning of cutting, the stone is in the stage of cutting to get high <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> rate. But the cutting ability is decreasing as the finishing proceeds and is lost at the end of finishing, resulting in getting the smooth surface. A cutting resistance is used to monitor the cutting condition of stone. The cutting ability of stone is controlled by both the stone pressure and the amount of electricity for electrolytic in-process dressing. A water-solution type coolant and metal bonded diamond stone are used. The main results obtained are as follows. Fuzzy control makes it possible to give the optimized cutting ability to the diamond stone. In the first case, it is possible to get the large <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> following the smooth surface in a limited time. In second case, it is possible to minimize the finishing time in which the finishing performance intended <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> and surface roughness is obtained.

40|$|Purpose: Electro {{discharge}} machining (EDM) {{is one of}} the most effective non-conventional machining methods. This method is the best condidate in machining of ceramics and carbide materials. Design/methodology/approach: The complexity and non-linear nature of EDM from one side, and occurrence of instability phenomenon due to the different input setting up parameters especially in machining of carbon-based materials such as non-oxide ceramics, on the other side, make the modeling of EDM process impossible with conventional methods. What is presented in this paper is the optimization and control of EDM process using the neural model predictive control method.

40|$|Purpose: Electro-discharge {{machining}} is {{an important}} manufacture technology in machining difficult-to-cut materials and to shape complicated contours and profiles with high material removal rate, low tool wear and good tolerances. Design/methodology/approach: In machining of carbon-based materials such as WC-Co and non-oxide ceramics which are growingly used, the complexity and non-linear nature of EDM is a serious problem. EDM is the best and nearly the only non-conventional method for machining of these kind of materials, but it shows high instability and tendency to arcing, compared with machining of steel. Occurrence of instability phenomenon due to the different input setting up parameters make the modeling of EDM process impossible with conventional methods. To achieve instantaneous data from machining condition, the new method of fuzzy analysis of single machining pulses and computing the magnitude of system condition {{in the form of}} a real number between 0 and 1, has been used.

A genetic algorithm has also been employed to optimize the input parameters and to create the optimized setting collection of process.

50|$|The most {{well-known}} research of Joseph Zeira is his paper with Oded Galor, the Galor-Zeira model. It shows that if capital markets are imperfect, poor families cannot supply education {{to their children}} and that reduces human capital and <b>output</b> <b>in</b> the economy. The paper also provides an economic justification to public education. Another line of research, initiated by Joseph Zeira, examines how missing aggregate information on potential growth and the gradual learning about {{it can lead to}} fluctuations, both <b>in</b> <b>output</b> and <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> prices. A third important contribution is the modelling of technologies, which are embedded in machines that replace workers. He has shown that such technologies can explain much of modern economic growth and much of the gaps between rich and poor countries as well. His research on the Israeli economy offers new insights on this economy that differ from the standard wisdom. One example is that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict costs Israel much more than the standard measure of defense costs, due to productivity losses, and potential recessions.|$|R

25|$|Steel blades are {{commonly}} shaped by forging or <b>stock</b> <b>removal.</b> Forged blades {{are made by}} heating {{a single piece of}} steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. <b>Stock</b> <b>removal</b> blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be heat treated. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> processes.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{centreless grinding}} machine was modified extensively to operate satisfactorily at high grinding wheel speeds and in the high rate centreless grinding regime. The principal modifications included the provision of a 75 k. W. d. c., variable speed, main drive motor which enables grinding wheel speeds up to 120 m/s to be employed and a coolant supply manifold was designed and manufactured-which was capable of delivering a high velocity coolant stream to the grinding zone. In addition, a measurement system was developed-which-allowed the grinding forces to be monitored and recorded in process. Two solutions for the accepted kinematic model of plunge feed cylindrical grinding are proposed. The general and more accurate solution takes account of the variable grit height and separation of the grinding wheel, whilst the particular and approximate analytical solution makes provision for variable grit separation only. The particular solution enabled parametric studies to be undertaken and allowed comparisons with the solutions proposed by other workers. The trends of theoretical grinding forces were predicted from analysis of the undeformed chip dimensions. The trends indicated two methods of achieving high <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> rates, firstly, for a constant force value, higher <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> rates are possible by increasing the grinding wheel speed and infeed-rate. Secondly, at a constant grinding wheel speed, and force level, reducing the workpiece speed and increasing the infeed-rate will yield higher <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> rates. Experimental results were in agreement with these predictions. An extensive experimental programme investigating plunge feed centreless grinding of ferrous components was undertaken. Results from approximately 300 grinding experiments were used to establish a data bank of grinding parameters {{for a range of}} grinding conditions. High-rate centreless grinding {{has been shown to be}} a feasible first machining process. It has also been shown that the choice of kinematic conditions is important <b>in</b> achieving high <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> rate grinding. Incorrect choice of kinematic conditions can cause problems of, workpiece burn, grinding vibrations and excessive power demands. Limit charts have been constructed which outline the boundaries to the process in terms of burn, grinding vibration and power limit. Operation between the boundaries is best achieved if the ratio of grinding wheel to workpiece speeds is in the range 90 - 200. The results enable a data based control strategy to be formulated and it is proposed that in process variable kinematics will allow a single cycle roughing and finishing operation on a suitably adapted {{centreless grinding machine}}...|$|R
