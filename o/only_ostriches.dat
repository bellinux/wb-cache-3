5000|$|The {{cassowary}} {{breeding season}} starts in May to June. Females lay three to eight large, bright green or pale green-blue eggs in each clutch into a prepared heap of leaf litter. The eggs measure about 9 by 14 cm — <b>only</b> <b>ostrich</b> and emu eggs are larger. The male incubates the eggs for 50-52 days, removing or adding litter {{to regulate the}} temperature, then protects the chicks, who stay in the nest for about nine months, defending them fiercely against all potential predators, including humans. The young males then go off to find a territory of their own. [...] The female does not care for the eggs or the chicks but moves on to lay eggs in the nests of several other males.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} extant species. The most common of these, the {{southern}} cassowary, is the third-tallest and second-heaviest living bird, smaller <b>only</b> than the <b>ostrich</b> and emu.|$|R
50|$|In Paleognathes, {{the male}} incubates the eggs. The male may include in his nest the eggs of one female {{or more than}} one. He may also have eggs {{deposited}} in his nest by females that did not breed with him, in cases of nest parasitism. <b>Only</b> in <b>ostriches</b> and the great spotted kiwi does the female also assist in incubating the eggs.|$|R
50|$|The remiges of ratites {{are soft}} and downy; they lack the {{interlocking}} hooks and barbules that help to stiffen the flight feathers of other birds. In addition, the emu's remiges are proportionately much reduced in size, while those of the cassowaries are reduced both in number and structure, consisting merely of 5-6 bare quills. Most ratites have completely lost their rectrices; <b>only</b> the <b>ostrich</b> still has them.|$|R

5000|$|In the Napoleonic era, the French first empire {{replaced}} the coronets of traditional ("royal") heraldry with a rigorously standardized system (as other respects of [...] "Napoleonic" [...] coats of arms) of toques, reflecting {{the rank of}} the bearer. Thus a Napoleonic duke used a toque with seven ostrich feathers and three lambrequins, a count a toque with five feathers and two lambrequins, a baron three feathers and one lambrequin, a knight <b>only</b> one <b>ostrich</b> feather (see Nobility of the First French Empire).|$|R
50|$|Ostrich leather was {{instantly}} popular in high fashion throughout Europe and the United States {{where it was}} used for cowboy boots. Notably, during the 1980s, demand was extremely high in the United States. During this period, apartheid and other political turmoil caused some countries, the United States included, {{to put pressure on}} South Africa in the form of trade sanctions. It was hard for ostrich leather to make it into the States, but it did. However, it came at a cost and the ostrich leather purveyors, brothers John G. Mahler and Wilfred Mahler of Dallas, TX, were the <b>only</b> importers of <b>ostrich</b> skin for many years. Just like the single channel KKLK, who had an iron grip on the exportation of the <b>only</b> viable <b>ostrich</b> skins, the Mahlers were able to control not only prices but also who got skins in the United States and how many they were allowed. Their control was so absolute that some bootmakers would be reprimanded by John if they sold his skins to other bootmakers. The entire arrangement has been compared to the DeBeers diamond cartel.|$|R

50|$|Although Dawg is {{normally}} portrayed as the straight man for Foghorn's pranks, in Mother Was a Rooster, he is portrayed {{in a very}} negative light, as he not <b>only</b> steals an <b>ostrich</b> egg (he justifies this by explaining that it's been kind of dull round the farm lately, giving reference to his four-year peace between him and Foghorn between Weasel While You Work and Mother Was a Rooster), he mocks the hatched ostrich, which Foghorn has adopted, and cheats in a boxing match with the rooster.|$|R
50|$|In practice, modern {{amphibians}} and reptiles have substantially modified this ancestral structure, {{based on}} their varied forms and lifestyles. The obturator foramen is generally very small in such animals, although most reptiles do possess a large gap between the pubis and ischium, {{referred to as the}} thyroid fenestra, which presents a similar appearance to the obturator foramen in mammals. In birds, the pubic symphysis is present <b>only</b> in the <b>ostrich,</b> and the two hip bones are usually widely separated, making it easier to lay large eggs.|$|R
50|$|A ratite is any of {{a diverse}} group of large, flightless birds of the infraclass Palaeognathae. The {{systematics}} involved have been in flux. Some sources state that ratites include all the flightless birds of the Palaeognathae; previously, all these birds had been assigned to the order Struthioniformes, which is more recently regarded as containing <b>only</b> the <b>ostrich.</b> The modern bird superorder Palaeognathae consists of ratites and flighted Neotropic tinamous (compare to Neognathae). Unlike other flightless birds, the ratites have no keel on their sternum - hence the name from the Latin ratis (for raft). Without this to anchor their wing muscles, they could not fly even if they were to develop suitable wings. Recent research has indicated that ratites are a paraphyletic group; tinamous fall within them, and are the sister group of the extinct moa. This implies that flightlessness is a trait that evolved independently multiple times in different ratite lineages.|$|R

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the causes of ostrich carcass and organ condemnations in Zimbabwe for the period 1999 - 2005. Records of meat inspection available at the single ostrich abattoir in Zimbabwe were used in this study. The number of ostriches slaughtered for the whole study period was 55 957. The total number of ostriches slaughtered decreased by 84. 8 % from 1999 - 2005. The average age and weight at slaughter were 11 months and 110 kg respectively. The liver was the most frequently condemned organ, mainly due to fatty degeneration, parasitic infestations, cysts, cirrhosis and melanosis. The second most condemned organ was the lung, mainly due to congestion. Traumatic lesions were the main macroscopic findings associated with wing and neck condemnations, while abscessation and pericarditis were mainly associated with gizzard and heart condemnations respectively. Septicaemia was the only cause of whole carcass condemnations and resulted in the condemnation of 0. 005 % of the slaughtered <b>ostriches.</b> <b>Only</b> a year effect was noted on liver condemnations, which peaked during 2004 and 2005 mainly involving months from May to August.

40|$|The {{presence}} of virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) since the 1993 - 94 epidemic in southern Africa holds major {{implications for the}} export of ostrich products from this region. A challenge experiment with this field strain was conducted in open-air feedlot facilities under strict biosecurity measures. The experiment was designed to follow vaccination and preslaughter quarantine regulations currently enforced in South African export ostrich facilities {{in order to determine}} the viremia period and immune response under these specific circumstances. One hundred forty-three slaughter ostriches were allocated into three test groups, according to the time period between pretrial vaccination and challenge (1 - 2 mo, 2 - 4 mo, 4 - 6 mo), and an unchallenged control group. All birds in the test groups were challenged by oral, tracheal, and ocular routes with a field isolate of NDV. They were slaughtered over the next 4 wk on nine separate occasions and bled on 12 occasions. Virus isolation was attempted from seven sets of pooled samples from each bird to determine the viremia period and the serum antibody concentrations were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods to establish an immune response curve. NDV could be back-isolated only up to day 9 postinfection and from <b>only</b> six <b>ostriches</b> with poor immune response titers and corresponding to a rise in antibody levels above an indirect ELISA optical density reading of 0. 33. Virus could be recovered only from brain and respiratory tract tissue. The HI test was less sensitive than the ELISA. Immune response curves did not differ significantly between the groups and peaked on day 14 postinfection. From these data, ELISA titers would appear to be a good indicator of the probability that an ostrich will be clinically infected after velogenic NDV challenge. These results also suggest that the current vaccination schedule enforced by the South African Veterinary Authorities results in protective immunity in up to 95 % of slaughter ostriches from export approved facilities. The standard 30 -day preslaughter quarantine period introduced as part of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus control measures also appears sufficient to encompass the determined NDV viremia period of 9 - 11 days in slaughter ostriches...|$|R

40|$|Wildlife {{populations are}} declining {{severely}} in many protected areas and unprotected pastoral areas of Africa. Rapid large-scale land use changes, poaching, climate change, rising population pressures, governance, policy, economic and socio-cultural transformations and competition with livestock {{all contribute to}} the declines in abundance. Here we analyze the population dynamics of 15 wildlife and four livestock species monitored using aerial surveys from 1977 to 2011 within Kajiado County of Kenya, with a rapidly expanding human population, settlements, cultivation and other developments. The abundance of the 14 most common wildlife species declined by 67 % on average (2 % / yr) between 1977 and 2011 in both Eastern (Amboseli Ecosystem) and Western Kajiado. The species that declined the most were buffalo, impala, wildebeest, waterbuck, oryx, hartebeest, Thomson’s gazelle and gerenuk in Eastern Kajiado (70 % to 88 %) and oryx, hartebeest, impala, buffalo, waterbuck, giraffe, eland and gerenuk in Western Kajiado (77 % to 99 %). Only elephant (115 %) and ostrich (216 %) numbers increased contemporaneously in Eastern and Western Kajiado, respectively. Cattle and donkey numbers also decreased on average by 78 % in Eastern Kajiado and by 37 % in Western Kajiado. Sheep and goats decreased the least in Eastern (28 %) but increased in Western (96 %) Kajiadio. Livestock dominated (70 - 80 %) the total large herbivore biomass throughout the 1977 - 2011 monitoring period. The distribution of wildlife contracted dramatically during 1977 - 2011, most especially for wildebeest, giraffe and impala. <b>Only</b> zebra and <b>ostrich</b> distributions expanded in the county. However, livestock distribution expanded to densely cover most of the county. Our findings point to recurrent droughts, intensifying human population pressures, land use changes and other anthropogenic impacts, decades of ineffective or failed government policies, legislations, law enforcement, management institutions and strategies as the salient causes of the declines and range compressions. We recommend several urgent measures to rehabilitate the depleted wildlife populations and habitat richness, restore their ecological resilience to droughts and secure pastoral livelihoods...|$|R
40|$|The ostrich is {{becoming}} {{an important source of}} meat for humans in developed and developing countries. This study was conducted to purify and characterize myofibrilbound serine protease (MBSP) and its endogenous inhibitor (MBSPI) from skeletal muscle of the ostrich. It is well documented that MBSP is tightly bound to myofibrils and its endogenous inhibitor has been purified from the same tissue of other studied mammalian species. Literature supports an association of MBSP and its endogenous inhibitor with the degradation of myofribrillar proteins, resulting in the softening of muscle that lead to the conversion of muscle into meat with the control of the inhibitor. MBSP was successfully dissociated from washed myofibrils by 40 percent ethylene glycol at pH 8. 5. Following centrifugation, MBSP was partially purified in two chromatographic steps, namely Toyopearl Super Q 650 S and p-aminobenzamidine-Agarose. On the other hand, MBSPI was fractionated from the sarcoplasmic fraction using 75 percent ammonium sulfate saturation, followed by centrifugation and partially purified by three chromatographic steps, namely Toyopearl Super Q 650 S, Superdex 200 and HiTrap SP HR. Ostrich MBSP was physicochemically and kinetically characterized, while MBSPI was <b>only</b> physicochemically characterized. <b>Ostrich</b> MBSP revealed an Mr of 21 kDa, cleaving synthetic fluorogenic substrates specifically at the carboxyl side of arginine residues. Optimum pH and temperature of ostrich MBSP were 8. 0 and 40 ˚C, respectively. Kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax values) were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The characteristics of ostrich MBSP were compared to the values obtained for commercial bovine trypsin in this study, as well as that obtained for MBSP from various fish species and mouse. The results suggest that ostrich MBSP is a trypsin-like serine protease, thereby confirming the existence of MBSP in ostrich skeletal muscle. Partially purified ostrich MBSPI (Mr 17 kDa) (one form) shares 100 percent identity to myoglobin from the same species, while 2 other forms of MBSPI (Mr values of 35 and 36 kDa) exhibited high sequence identity to glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (76 percent) from human and ra...|$|R
