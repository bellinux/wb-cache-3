5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, <b>on</b> seeing <b>the</b> {{outcome of the}} battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so {{it may have been}} after <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> retreated to <b>the</b> camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b> At first they misdirected <b>the</b> fleeing <b>Persian</b> contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing the outcome of the battle was certain, they began killing <b>the</b> fleeing <b>Persians.</b>|$|R
5|$|Herodotus {{does not}} mention {{specific}} figures for casualties, merely saying that losses were heavy on both sides. The Sicyonians in particular suffered, also losing their general Perilaus. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> side, the admiral Mardontes and the general Tigranes were both killed, though Artayntes escaped. Herodotus says that a few Persians troops escaped the battle and {{made their way to}} Sardis. Diodorus claims that there were 40,000 Persian casualties, and also suggests that the survivors made their way to Sardis.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> side, Kardarigan {{was also}} eager {{to fight and}} {{confident}} of victory. He arranged to be escorted by many camels carrying water for his troops in case the Byzantines refused to engage but continued to block access to the Arzamon, and had allegedly prepared iron bars and chains for the prisoners he would take. His movements, however, were detected when the Byzantines' Arab foederati captured {{a few of his}} men, allowing Philippicus to prepare his forces. This early warning was of particular importance since Kardarigan intended to attack on Sunday, a day of rest for the Christian Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|These {{numbers are}} (by ancient standards) consistent, {{and this could}} be {{interpreted}} that a number around 1,200 is correct.

5|$|During {{the first}} centuries AD, Palmyra's main trade route ran {{east to the}} Euphrates where it {{connected}} at the city of Hīt. The route then ran south along the river toward the port of Charax Spasinu <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf, where Palmyrene ships traveled {{back and forth to}} India. Goods were imported from India, China and Transoxiana, and exported west to Emesa (or Antioch) then the Mediterranean ports, from which they were distributed throughout the Roman Empire. In addition to the usual route some Palmyrene merchants used the Red Sea, probably {{as a result of the}} Roman–Parthian Wars. Goods were carried overland from the seaports to a Nile port, and then taken to the Egyptian Mediterranean ports for export. Inscriptions attesting a Palmyrene presence in Egypt date to the reign of Hadrian.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Caliph Umar, whose forces at Qadisiyah were {{threatened}} with confronting the Sassanid armies, ordered Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas {{to enter into}} negotiations with the Persians and send emissaries to Yazdegerd III and his commander Rostam Farrokhzād, apparently inviting them to Islam. This was most probably the delaying tactic employed by Umar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> front. Meanwhile, he sent reinforcements of 6,000 troops, mostly from Yemen, to Khalid. This force included 1,000 Sahaba (companions of Muhammad), among whom were 100 veterans of the Battle of Badr, the first battle in Islamic history, and included citizens of the highest rank, such as Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, Abu Sufyan, and his wife Hind bint Utbah.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day of the battle, news reached the Allies that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened; they {{therefore}} resolved to maintain their position. They staged a hit-and-run attack on some Cilician ships, capturing and destroying them. On the third day, however, the Persian fleet attacked the Allies lines in full force. In a day of savage fighting, the Allies held on to their position, but suffered severe losses (half the Athenian fleet was damaged); nevertheless, the Allies inflicted equal losses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet. That evening, the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allies at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, they retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines then {{launched}} an attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fort of Onoguris, {{but they were}} forced to abandon it at the unexpectedly quick arrival of Persian relief forces under Nachoragan. In spring 556, Justin was {{with the rest of the}} Byzantine forces at Nesos, when Nakhoragan invaded western Lazica, making for the town of Phasis. The Byzantines hastily departed for the town, managing to reach it before the Persian army and then proceeded to successfully defend it during a prolonged siege. Following this success, in early 556 Justin returned to Nesos to guard it together with Buzes, while the rest of the army marched against the Misimians, a tribe that had recently allied itself with the Persians and killed the Byzantine general Soterichus. Justin's only activity during this time was to dispatch one of his officers, Elminzur, to capture Rhodopolis (modern Vartsikhe) with 2,000 cavalry. In the next year, a general truce was agreed, which was finalized into a peace treaty in 562.|$|E
5|$|Two {{soldiers}} who feigned desertion {{were sent to}} Shahrbaraz, claiming that the Byzantines were fleeing before Shahin. Due to jealousy between the Persian commanders, Shahrbaraz hurried with his army {{to take part in}} the glory of the victory. Heraclius met them at Tigranakert and routed the forces of Shahraplakan and Shahin one after the other. Shahin lost his baggage train, and Shahraplakan (according to one source) was killed, though he re-appears later. After this victory, Heraclius crossed the Araxes and camped in the plains on the other side. Shahin, with the remnants of both his and Shahraplakan's armies joined Shahrbaraz in the pursuit of Heraclius, but marshes slowed them down. At Aliovit, Shahrbaraz split his forces, sending some 6,000 troops to ambush Heraclius while the remainder of the troops stayed at Aliovit. Heraclius instead launched a surprise night attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> main camp in February 625, destroying it. Shahrbaraz only barely escaped, naked and alone, having lost his harem, baggage, and men.|$|E
5|$|Both armies {{appear to}} have been {{composed}} exclusively of cavalry, comprising a mix of lancers and horse-archers, possibly with a few cataphract units included. When Philippicus' scouts reported the Persians' approach, he positioned his men on elevated ground facing the direction from which the Persian army advanced, with his left flank protected by the foothills of Mount Izalas. The Byzantines {{appear to have}} been arranged in a single battle line with three divisions. The left division was commanded by Eiliphredas, the dux of Phoenice Libanensis, and included a Hunnic contingent of horse-archers under Apsich. The centre was commanded by the general Heraclius the Elder, later Exarch of Africa and father of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641), while the right wing was commanded by the taxiarchos Vitalius. This arrangement was also adopted by the Persians as soon as they came into view of the Byzantine army. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> side, the right division was under Mebodes, the centre under Kardarigan himself, and the left wing under Kardarigan's nephew, Aphraates. Unlike the Persian general, Philippicus remained with a small force at some distance behind the main battle line, directing the battle.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} spring, the Allies {{assembled the}} largest ever hoplite army, and marched north from the isthmus to confront Mardonius.

25|$|During the 1720s, the Qasami had {{emigrated from}} the Persian coast and {{established}} {{themselves as a}} force in Sharjah and Julfar (Ras al-Khaimah, now part of UAE). In the period 1747-59, {{a branch of the}} Qasemi from Sharjah established itself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> littoral, but it was expelled in 1767. By 1780, the Qasemi branch was re-established <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> coast and began to feud with other coastal tribes over pasturage in the islands off Langeh. The Iranian argument for the ownership of the disputed islands is that the Qasami controlled the islands while they were located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> coast, not when they later emigrated to the UAE coast. In April 1873, the islands were reported as a dependency of the Persian Fars province to the British Resident, which the Resident acknowledged. In the period 1786-1835 the official British opinion, surveys, and maps identified the Tonbs as part of Langeh, subject to the government of the province of Fars. Chief among them were the works of Lt. John McCluer (1786), political counselor John Macdonald Kinneir (1813), and Lt. George Barns Brucks (1829).|$|E

5|$|Thucydides gives {{only the}} barest of details for this battle; the most {{reliable}} detailed account is given by Plutarch.

Cimon, sailing from Phaselis, made to attack <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> before <b>the</b> reinforcements arrived, whereupon <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet, eager to avoid fighting, retreated into the river itself. However, when Cimon continued to bear down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> they accepted battle. Regardless of their numbers, <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> battle line was quickly breached, and <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> ships then turned about, and made for the river bank.
