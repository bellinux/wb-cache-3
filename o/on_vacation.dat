40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to explore how the {{interactive}} social games take effect in their work with the group <b>on</b> youth <b>vacationing.</b> In the theoretical part I result from the social vulnerability of children and youth from socially disadvantaged families. One of the actions to reduce poverty and social exclusion is among other things vacationing, which I have devoted to below. I researched what is vacationing, what significance it has for the participants, what is important when working with a group <b>on</b> <b>vacationing,</b> how the group dynamics functions {{and what are the}} characteristics of the population of participants. Since these are very often children and adolescents with poorly developed social skills, I was wondering, what are the social skills and how they can learn them. One of the most successful ways of learning is experiential learning with interactive social games and I was interested, what the interactive social games are, what are their characteristics, significance and potential use in a wider context. In the empirical part I carried out an action research, within which I have prepared a project for educators <b>on</b> <b>vacationing,</b> which included the preparation of a manual with the interactive social games, additional attachments and accessories, practical training and individual support during the holidays. One of the key findings is that the interactive social games are suitable, but a relatively rare method of working with a group <b>on</b> <b>vacationing.</b> It turned out, that the manual with games, tailored to the needs of a specific population of participants and on the context of this type of holidays, is a welcome novelty that makes sense to continue to promote and develop. ...|$|R
