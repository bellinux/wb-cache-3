In a multi-method qualitative study based on individual interviews with TB patients, facility observations and focus group discussions with health workers (HWs) in 13 public health facilities, and key informant interviews with {{governmental and non-governmental}} experts, we describe TB contact investigation {{in the context of}} an urban setting in Kenya and identify opportunities for optimization. Invitation of TB patients to bring close contacts by HWs was key for all patient decisions that led to contact screening in addition to patients' understanding of TB transmission and desire to avoid contacts suffering from TB. Sub-optimal HW enquiry of TB patients and contacts presenting at the facility were missed opportunities which stemmed from lack of standardized <b>operational</b> procedures, <b>documentation</b> tools and HW training.

40|$|A {{regional}} counselling {{service was}} established to handle all accidental blood exposures using a standardized protocol. Levels of risk were assessed using an algorithm. Accidents that posed a risk for the transmission of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were classified as 'high risk', whereas accidents that posed a risk for HBV alone were classified as 'low risk'. Medical interventions were implemented according {{to the level of}} risk. During a one-year period, all accidents were registered and analysed for adherence to the standard protocol. In 2003, the centre handled 454 incidents. Of these, 36 (7. 9 %) incidents were assessed as no risk, 329 (72. 5 %) were assessed as low risk, and 67 (14. 8 %) were assessed as high risk. Due to incomplete registration, 22 (4. 8 %) incidents could not be analysed further. In total, 36 % of the incidents with risk for HBV transmission and 40 % of the incidents with risk for HCV and HIV transmission were not handled according to the proposed protocol. Breaches consisted of over-reaction (25 / 396) as well as insufficient response (123 / 396). Potentially inadequate treatment occurred for HIV postexposure prophylaxis in 12 of 63 incidents. Incomplete follow-up for HCV occurred in 11 of 63 incidents, and lack of HBV immunoglobulin administration occurred in five of 396 incidents, including three high-risk incidents.

40|$|When an {{aircraft}} component needs replacement of a serially controlled item, a maintenance {{officer in the}} U. S. navy uses the Scheduled Removal Component (SRC) card to confirm the component’s life cycle, to verify that the part is ready-for-issue, and to verify how many flight-hours it still has left. Unfortunately, replacement components are often missing the SRC cards. Further, when the cards are received simultaneously with the aircraft component requiring replacement, their encoded data are unreliable, which then precludes the part from being immediately installed. in this article, the authors analyze the impact of current paper-based life-cycle management of serially controlled parts, and investigate item-unique identification and radio-frequency identifi-cation technologies as alternative ways of tracking these parts to increase <b>operational</b> availability.

5000|$|From 1963 to 1977 the Maxey Flat Low Level Radioactive Waste {{facility}} {{served as}} a dump for 832 corporations and government agencies. The site covered 252 acre and consisted {{of a series of}} 52 unlined trenches that are an average of 360 ft long, 70 ft wide and 20 ft deep. Approximately [...] of Low Level Radioactive Waste was deposited on-site. These trenches were capped with dirt when they reached their capacity. Because of the heavy rainfall, soil collapsed into the trenches and they filled with water. It has since been referred to as the [...] "bathtub effect." [...] The water became radioactive and had to be disposed of. Under the direction of President and Chief Executive Officer James N. Neel, Nuclear Engineering Company (referred to in <b>operational</b> <b>documentation</b> as 'NECO'), now known as 'American Ecology' (Nasdaq: ECOL), installed an evaporator and disposed of the accumulated radioactive water as steam from 1973 to April 1986, nearly 9 years after the site had stopped accepting waste materials. The evaporator generally operated 24 hours a day. Approximately six million gallons of liquid were processed by the evaporator. In addition to the trenches for Low Level Radioactive Waste there were [...] "Hot Wells" [...] that were used to store Special nuclear material (plutonium and enriched uranium). The Hot Wells were typically 10 to 15 ft deep, constructed of concrete, coated steel pipe or tile, and capped with a slab of concrete.

40|$|Little doubt {{exists that}} {{technologies}} for precisely, and automatically measuring energy use are timely. Pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, {{the potential for}} a generation shortfall, and rising energy prices, modern building complexities, mean that estimating building energy use patterns, profiling of building energy use, and energy failure mode identification can help to maintain energy efficiency. However, further uses exist beyond operational management; These include urgently required meta-analysis of building stock by sector, up to national stock levels, to inform policymakers, since a dearth of national stock data exists at government level in many countries. Many existing systems use radio telemetry, often producing unclean data. Analysis of energy data for large datasets becomes expensive due to incompatible formats, hampering use of old data on new systems, and data from different systems should we acquire new data, or as we acquire physical buildings. We argue that a standard should include basic specifications for fundamentals such as date formats, but a secondary scalable layer will allow future-proofing of datasets for longitudinal study, and open the door to advanced analysis techniques such as complex event processing. Disaggregation to plant level, as well as building related activities, such as manufacturing activity, also becomes possible with a scalable data structure.

The first sections of the chapter focus on the strengths of territorial cooperation in the case study area, discussing the cultural and geographical conditions, the underlying motivations and domains in which TC takes place, and governance structures. In the subsequent sections, the weaknesses of territorial cooperation and territorial integration identified in the case study area are discussed. These include inaccessibility and peripherality, lack of impact, and lack of engagement with some groups of partners, particularly private sector partners. The findings are based primarily on semi-structured interviews with 40 subjects in the case study area. The subjects included 12 interviewees from Norway, 12 from Sweden and 16 from Scotland.

40|$|Cost control must be {{implemented}} through {{the establishment of}} requirements and controlled continually by managing to these requirements. Cost control of the non-recurring side of life cycle cost has traditionally been implemented in both commercial and government programs. The government uses the budget process to implement this control. The commercial approach {{is to use a}} similar process of allocating the non-recurring cost to major elements of the program. This type of control generally manages through a work breakdown structure (WBS) by defining the major elements of the program. If the cost control is to be applied across the entire program life cycle cost (LCC), the approach must be addressed very differently. A functional breakdown structure (FBS) is defined and recommended. Use of a FBS provides the visibifity to allow the choice of an integrated solution reducing the cost of providing many different elements of like function. The different functional solutions that drive the hardware logistics, quantity of <b>documentation,</b> <b>operational</b> labor, reliability and maintainability balance, and total integration of the entire system from DDT&E through the life of the program must be fully defined, compared, and final decisions made among these competing solutions. The major drivers of recurring cost have been identified and are presented and discussed. The LCC requirements must be established and flowed down to provide control of LCC. This LCC control will require a structured rigid process similar to the one traditionally used to control weight/performance for space transportation systems throughout the entire program. It has been demonstrated over the last 30 years that without a firm requirement and methodically structured cost control, it is unlikely that affordable and sustainable space transportation system LCC will be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{demonstrates}} {{a process of}} estimation phenomenological parameters of a first-principle nonlinear model based on the hydraulic damper system. Design/methodology/approach: First-principle (FP) models are formulated using a system of continuous ordinary differential equations capturing usually nonlinear relations among variables of the model. The considering model applies three categories of parameters: geometrical, physical and phenomenological. Geometrical and physical parameters are deduced from construction or <b>operational</b> <b>documentation.</b> The phenomenological parameters are the adjustable ones, which are estimated or adjusted based on their roughly known values, e. g. friction/damping coefficients. Findings: A phenomenological parameter, friction coefficient, was successfully estimated based on the experimental data. The error between the model response and experimental data is not greater than 10 %. Research limitations/implications: Adjusting a model to data is, in most cases, a non-convex optimization problem and the criterion function may have several local minima. This is a case when multiple parameters are simultaneously estimated. Practical implications: First-principle models are fundamental tools for understanding, optimizing, designing, and diagnosing technical systems since they are updatable using operational measurements. Originality/value: First-principle models are frequently adjusted by trial-and-error, {{which can lead to}} nonoptimal results. In order to avoid deficiencies of the trial-and-error approach, a formalized mathematical method using optimization techniques to minimize the error criterion, and find optimal values of tunable model parameters, was proposed and demonstrated in this work...|$|E

Design The authors analysed the quality of information across elements of allergies to medications and the history of present illness (HPI) collected during a quasi-experimental intervention study where control periods with usual care alternated with intervention periods when ParentLink was <b>operational.</b> <b>Documentation</b> by emergency department (ED) providers was abstracted and compared with information generated through ParentLink. The criterion standard for the history of allergies to medications was a structured telephone interview with parents after the ED visit. A valid report for a medication allergy was one that was both accurate and complete. Completeness of the HPI for acute head trauma was evaluated across seven elements relevant to an evidence-based risk assessment. Results Of 1410 enrolled parents, 1111 / 1410 (79 %) completed the criterion standard interview. Parents' valid reports of allergies to medications were higher than those of nurses (parents 94 %, nurses 88 %, p< 0. 0001). Parents' valid reports of allergies to medications were greater than those of physicians (parent 94 %, physicians 83 %, p< 0. 0001).
