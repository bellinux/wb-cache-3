40|$|The most {{important}} chemical compounds for wheat dough are gluten proteins -gliadins and glutenins {{which have the}} distinctive rheological ability to form a dough matrix that determines bread quality. <b>Other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>flours</b> as rye flour do not have these unique properties, but they can improve nutritional aspects of daily consumed breads such as higher intake of fibre which has {{a positive effect on}} digestion and decreases risk of hypercholesterolemia, obesity and heart disease, and current trend in bakery is to replace part of wheat flour with rye flour. In this work 11 ratios of wheat-rye mixtures were prepared; flour quality (Zeleny sedimentation volume, Hagberg falling number, water absorption), machine workability of dough and consequently bread quality characteristics (bread shape, mean bread volume, dough yield, pastry yield, baking loss, texture parameters, image analysis) were investigated.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteKaren SchmidtFlour is {{essential}} to bread production as it provides structure, texture, and flavor. The most common, wheat flour, is unique compared to <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>flours</b> as it forms gluten {{that is capable of}} forming viscoelastic dough, which retains gas produced during fermentation and helps create cohesive dough, all of which are critical to bread development. However, a certain percentage of the population has a rare autoimmune disorder, celiac disease, which is triggered by gluten. A gluten-free diet is the only remedy for celiac disease. Traditionally, in gluten-free breads, hydrocolloids, or gums have been used to mimic the behavior of gluten. However, the lack of a protein structure in breads made with hydrocolloids leads to an almost batter-like viscosity. Therefore, research has focused on gluten-free alternatives, particularly non-wheat cereal proteins that can be altered to mimic gluten’s dough forming properties. For example, zein has an average molecular weight and larger peptides than gluten, which contribute to its hydrophobic behavior. In fact, zein from maize flour is an ideal alternative as it can be manipulated to behave like gluten under certain conditions. The main difference between gluten and zein is that zein does not exhibit a large disulfide-linked polymer. Zein is also more hydrophobic than gluten. However, zein has been found to exhibit viscoelastic properties similar to gluten’s at temperatures higher than its glass transition. Other research has found the secondary structure of zein, in particular the β-sheet structure, increases at temperatures above its glass transition. This suggests that temperature and shear are not the only factors necessary to form and maintain the viscoelastic properties of zein; apparently, the β-sheet structures also affect viscoelasticity. Finally, differences such as maize variety and particle size also affect the properties of zein in bakery applications...|$|R
40|$|Buckwheat {{is grown}} {{primarily}} because of its grain which, after undergoing the processes of dehulling, grinding and sieving, is used to produce buckwheat flour which {{is characterized by a}} considerable content of antioxidants, especially polyphenols and tocopherols. Buckwheat polyphenols are represented by phenolic acids and flavonoids, mainly rutin, a proven potent antioxidant. The content of polyphenols and tocopherols in buckwheat grain primarily depends on the buckwheat species, growing area, climate and growing conditions. Common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Möench), which is often used for the production of light and wholegrain buckwheat flour, contains less polyphenols than tartary buckwheat. The content of polyphenols in common buckwheat grain varies depending on the grain part. As their largest amount is contained in the hull and the outer layers of the grain, the wholegrain buckwheat flour is superior in polyphenols than the light buckwheat flour. Therefore, the wholegrain buckwheat flour is characterized by a higher antioxidant capacity. Polyphenols in buckwheat flour exist in free and bound forms, where the contribution of free polyphenols ranges between 48 - 64 %. Due to a relatively high content of antioxidants in light and wholegrain buckwheat flour, they are used for substitution of wheat or <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>flours</b> in bakery, pasta and confectionary formulations in order to create either added value or gluten-free products. The aim of a long-term consumption of buckwheat flours is to achieve health benefits and protect from many chronic diseases. Technological procedures and some treatments used during the food preparation influence polyphenol composition and content and consequently the functionality of food. Therefore, in order to minimize polyphenol losses and preserve the antioxidant capacity of the final products it is necessary to understand the thermal treatments and their mechanisms.

Therefore, in this research the microbial and total aflatoxins analysis of selected <b>cereal</b> <b>flours</b> processed and sold in Abakaliki metropolis was carried out. A total of four cereal samples (maize, millet, sorghum and wheat) were studied. The total aflatoxins were analyzed using highly sensitive competitive Enzyme Link Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader. The cereal samples were also analyzed for total fungal count using digital colony counting machine (CCM China).
