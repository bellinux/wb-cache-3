40|$|The {{dynamics}} of reactive systems, e. g. CCS, {{has often been}} de ned using a labelled transition system (LTS). More recently it has become natural in de ning dynamics to use reaction rules | i. e. unlabelled transition rules | together with a structural congruence. But LTSs lead more naturally to behavioural equivalences. So one would like to derive from reaction rules a suitable LTS. This paper shows how to derive an LTS {{for a wide range}} of reactive systems. A label for an agent a is de ned to be any <b>context</b> <b>F</b> which intuitively is just large enough so that the agent Fa (in <b>context</b> <b>F</b> ") is able to perform a reaction.

40|$|Speech {{recognition}} by second language (L 2) learners in optimal and suboptimal conditions has been examined extensively with English as the target language in most previous studies. This study extended existing experimental protocols (Wang et al., 2013) to investigate Mandarin speech {{recognition by}} Japanese learners of Mandarin at two different levels (elementary vs. intermediate) of proficiency. The overall {{results showed that}} in addition to L 2 proficiency, semantic <b>context,</b> <b>F</b> 0 contours, and listening condition all affected the recognition performance on the Mandarin sentences. However, the effects of semantic <b>context</b> and <b>F</b> 0 contours on L 2 speech recognition diverged to some extent. Specifically, there was significant modulation effect of listening condition on semantic context, indicating that L 2 learners made use of semantic context less efficiently in the interfering background than in quiet. In contrast, no significant modulation effect of listening condition on F 0 contours was found. Furthermore, there was significant interaction between semantic <b>context</b> and <b>F</b> 0 contours, indicating that semantic context becomes more important for L 2 speech recognition when F 0 information is degraded. None of these effects were found to be modulated by L 2 proficiency. The discrepancy in the effects of semantic <b>context</b> and <b>F</b> 0 contours on L 2 speech recognition in the interfering background might be related to differences in processing capacities required by the two types of information in adverse listening conditions. 8 page(s...|$|R

A specialized corpus of 104 research articles published between 2007 and 2010 taken from applied linguistics and chemistry written in English and Indonesian by the respective native speaker scholars were quantitatively analyzed using 2 x 2 Factorial ANOVA. The results showed that there was a significant main effect of sociocultural <b>context,</b> <b>F</b> (1, 100) = 44, 34, p < 0, 05, ŋ 2 = 0, 307, a significant main effect of discipline, F (1, 100) = 19, 16, p < 0, 05, ŋ 2 = 0, 161, and a significant interaction between sociocultural <b>context</b> and discipline, <b>F</b> (1, 100) = 6, 90, p < 0, 05, ŋ 2 = 0, 065.

The interfaces differ in terms of (1) window arrangement and (2) positioning of detailed information relative to the user.

In terms of interface design on a 3 D workbench, it is important to provide an up-close view of the cur-rent region of interest for fast scene navigation and an easy way to change viewing direction to see the 3 D information from more comfortable directions.

However, high levels might be associated with physiological costs, such as immunosuppression. Immunostimulant carotenoids underpin the expression of many red-yellow ornaments, but are regulated by testosterone and constrained by parasites. We manipulated testosterone and nematode burdens in red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) in two populations to tease apart their effects on carotenoid levels, ornament size and colouration in three time-step periods. We found no evidence for interactive effects of testosterone and parasites on ornament size and colouration. We showed that ornament colouration was testosterone-driven. However, parasites decreased comb size with a time delay and testosterone increased carotenoid levels in one of the populations. This suggests that environmental context {{plays a key role in}} determining how individuals resolve the trade-off between allocating carotenoids for ornamental coloration or for self-maintenance needs.

I then situate the relevant ethical obligations within the <b>context</b> <b>f</b> the healthcare professional-patient relationship which subsequently allows me to develop a textured model of consent. The model is predicated {{on the theory that}} consent is a secondary right, derivative on the underlying right which it controls. By giving or withholding consent, the autonomous person determines who may justifiably infringe the primary right. Importantly, however, the context of the professional-patent relationship highlights the relevance of consent, not just as permission, but also as agreement. I subsequently utilise the model of consent to analyse the current law, which is found to be deficient. I explore the conceptual difficulties of the split regulation between the torts of battery and negligence. I examine the current standard of disclosure and conclude that while it seems to be moving towards more autonomy respecting prudent patient standard, the courts may still be affording expert witnesses too much say in determining which risks should be disclosed. Most importantly I expose the thin and unsatisfactory conception of autonomy that appears to ground the current legal approach. Some of the common law’s deficiencies lie in tort law’s focus on the outcome rather than the process of the interaction between healthcare professional and the patient. There are three responses to these deficiencies. The common law could be allowed to continue its piecemeal development. The deficiencies of the common law could be patched up by developing professional regulation, or new legislation could be drafted to deal specifically with consent to medical treatment. If there is a genuine commitment to patient autonomy and patient centred care then I submit that legislation is justified...|$|R
