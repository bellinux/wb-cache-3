5|$|As {{the novel}} progresses, Clay learns that Rip {{also had a}} fling with Rain and is now obsessed with her. When Clay discovers that Julian is {{currently}} Rain's boyfriend, he conspires with Rip to hand Julian over to him. When Julian is then found murdered, Rain confronts Clay {{about his role in}} the affair and is raped by him in response. He later receives a video of Julian's murder from Rip which has been overdubbed with an angry voicemail from Clay as a means to implicate him in the crime. The novel then depicts sequences of the savage sexual and physical abuse <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> young girl and young boy, perpetrated by Clay. Clay experiences no feelings of remorse or guilt for this, for Julian's death, or for exploiting and raping Rain. In the last scenes, it is strongly implied that Blair has been hiring people to follow Clay. In return for his giving her what she wants, she offers to provide Clay with a false alibi that will prevent the police from arresting him as an accomplice to Julian's murder.|$|E
5|$|At the beginning, Lasker {{tried to}} attack but Schlechter had no {{difficulty}} defending, {{so that the}} first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at {{the middle of the}} match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a big advantage, but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing. Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.|$|E

5|$|The New South Wales waratah {{featured}} {{prominently in}} the folklore of the Darug and Tharawal people in the Sydney basin and Gandangara people to the southwest. A dreamtime legend from the Eora tells of a female wonga pigeon searching for her husband who has been lost while out hunting. A hawk attacks and wounds her, and she hides in a waratah bush. Her husband calls and as she struggles in the bush her blood turns the white waratah blooms red. A tale from the Burragorang Valley tells <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> maiden named Krubi, who wore a red cloak of rock wallaby adorned with the feathers of the gang-gang cockatoo. She {{fell in love with}} a young warrior who did not return from battle. Grief-stricken, she died, and up from the ground grew the first waratah. The Dharawal people regarded it as a totem, using it in ceremonies and timing ceremonies to its flowering.|$|E
5|$|The {{last chapter}} {{of the body of}} the book – if Chapter 10 is {{considered}} more or less an epilogue – covers towns seen as part of the English landscape. Hoskins justifies this on the grounds that understanding towns brings pleasure. He describes in turn planned towns, the open-field town, and the market town. Towns were planned as early as Norman times, Abbot Baldwin planning Bury St Edmunds between 1066 and 1086; Stratford-on-Avon was laid out in 1196. Another burst of town planning came with the spa towns in the late 18th century, and of new industrial towns like Middlesbrough and Barrow-in-Furness in the mid 19th century. Open-field towns like Nottingham, Leicester, and Stamford grew naturally in their own open fields, but were trapped by pasture rights from growing in the 19th century, giving Nottingham slums, and Leicester a problem that it just managed to solve, growing across its fields: while Stamford stopped growing entirely, becoming fossilised as what Hoskins calls a museum piece <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> 17th and 18th century town. Finally, the market towns like Marlborough grew up around their often large and handsome market places, which are however of any number of shapes.|$|E
