5|$|The Moine Thrust in Assynt {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied {{geological}} features in the world. Its discovery in the 1880s was a milestone in the history of geology as it was one of the first thrust belts in the world to be identified. Investigations by John Horne and Benjamin Peach resolved a dispute between Murchison and Geikie on the one hand and James Nicol and Charles Lapworth on the other. The latter believed that older Moine rocks lay on top of younger Cambrian rocks at Knockan Crag, and Horne and Peach's work confirmed this in their classic paper The Geological Structure of the Northwest Highlands of Scotland, which was published in 1907. A statue to these two pioneers <b>of</b> <b>fieldwork</b> was erected at Inchnadamph near the hotel there which played a prominent part in the annals of early geology. This area is at the heart of the 'North West Highlands Geopark'.|$|E

25|$|Pre-war {{geological}} {{investigations in}} Iraq had been suspended {{as a result}} of civil disturbances, and were not resumed until 1946 when 'a planned campaign of stratigraphic research was set afoot'. Under the overall charge of Colonel Henson, the project involved a vast amount <b>of</b> <b>fieldwork</b> and laboratory studies. René Wetzel directed most of the work in Kurdistan, the Sinjar and the western desert, assisted by Morton {{and a number of other}} geologists such as Dr R.G.S. Hudson ('Doc'), Charles André, Harold Dunnington and Henry Hotchkiss over a period of six years. Deeper wells were drilled to locate older deposits: this resulted in oil being discovered in the Middle Cretaceous at Ain Zalah, Kirkuk and Bai Hasan.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Wilder and Chandler had {{intended}} to retain as much of Cain’s original dialogue as possible. It was Chandler who first realized that the dialogue from the novella would not translate well to the screen. Wilder disagreed and was annoyed that Chandler was not putting more of it into the script. To settle it, Wilder hired a couple of contract players from the studio to read passages of Cain’s original dialogue aloud. To Wilder's astonishment, Chandler was right and, in the end, the movie’s cynical and provocative dialogue was more Chandler and Wilder than it was Cain. Chandler also did a lot <b>of</b> <b>fieldwork</b> while working on the script and took large volumes of notes. By visiting various locations that figured into the film, {{he was able to}} bring a sense of realism about Los Angeles that seeped into the script. For example, he hung around Jerry's Market on Melrose Avenue in preparation for the scene where Phyllis and Walter would discreetly meet to plan the murder.|$|E

500|$|Berger became {{interested}} in studying the Wiccan and Pagan movement in 1986, when she presented a lecture on the subject at the Boston Public Library. Subsequently becoming acquainted {{with members of the}} New England Pagan community, she undertook fieldwork in both a local Wiccan coven, the Circle of Light, and a wider Pagan organisation, the EarthSpirit Community (ESC). In total, Berger underwent 11 years <b>of</b> <b>fieldwork</b> among the Pagan community. Along with ESC founder Andras Corban Arthen, Berger also undertook a [...] "Pagan Census" [...] survey of the U.S. in the mid-1990s to obtain more data on the country's Pagan community.|$|E
500|$|On {{the fifth}} day <b>of</b> <b>fieldwork,</b> Ryszard Gradziński, the {{geologist}} of the expedition, found a concretion of well-preserved bones which promised {{to belong to a}} fairly complete skeleton. Excavation started on the next day, revealing a nearly complete skeleton lacking only the head and neck. Until today, this specimen remains by far the most complete find of this dinosaur. The transport of the specimen out of rough terrain caused major technical problems. Stone blocks containing the fossils had to be moved some 580 m on improvised metal sledges made out of petrol drums before they could be loaded onto trucks. Because the skeleton was embedded in very hard sandstone layers, several blocks weighed over a ton. On the 9th of July, the packing of the skeleton into 35 crates started for transportation to Dalanzadgad; together, the crates weighed about 12 tons.|$|E
500|$|On {{returning}} to Britain, Grinsell {{went back to}} his job at Barclays Bank. In 1947 he became the treasurer of the Prehistoric Society, a position that he retained until 1970, during which he helped to secure the organisation's post-war reconstruction. In 1949 the archaeologist Christopher Hawkes invited Grinsell to join him and Stuart Piggott as a project assistant at Victoria County History in order to compile the Victoria County History of Wiltshire. Grinsell accepted, leaving his bank job and moving to the Wiltshire town of Devizes, thus becoming a professional archaeologist. Thomas later stated that the Victoria County History of Wiltshire [...] "represents the high point in [...] combined powers <b>of</b> <b>fieldwork,</b> grasp of secondary sources and handling of a great deal of detailed information." [...] Grinsell later published the book The Archaeology of Wessex, which was based on his experience during this period.|$|E

500|$|Risley {{was born}} in Buckinghamshire, England, in 1851 and {{attended}} New College, Oxford University prior to joining the Indian Civil Service (ICS). He was initially posted to Bengal, where his professional duties engaged him in statistical and ethnographic research, and he soon developed an interest in anthropology. His decision to indulge these interests curtailed his initial rapid advancement {{through the ranks of}} the Service, although he was later [...] appointed Census Commissioner and, shortly before his death in 1911, became Permanent Secretary at the India Office in London. In the intervening years he compiled various studies of Indian communities based on ideas that are now considered to constitute [...] scientific racism. He emphasised the value <b>of</b> <b>fieldwork</b> and anthropometrical studies, in contrast to the reliance on old texts and folklore that had historically been the methodology of Indologists and which was still a significant approach in his lifetime.|$|E
500|$|Throughout her 11-year period <b>of</b> <b>fieldwork,</b> Berger {{had to use}} snowball {{sampling}} {{to retrieve}} her data on the Pagan community, something that she attributed to the [...] "secrecy of groups and practitioners". She conducted formal interviews with over 40 practicing Pagans, and over 60 others instead were informally interviewed during conversations at Pagan events, following which Berger recorded their responses in her fieldnotes. She participated in rituals with ten different Wiccan covens, two of which were all-female covens, and the other eight of which were mixed-gender in structure, but all of whom assembled in the Northeastern United States. Accepting that this regional focus might affect her results, she supplemented her fieldwork by reading literature on Paganism from across the country, concluding that [...] "the differences among groups and practitioners within the United States are {{less important than the}} similarities." [...] Unlike the sociologists Margot Adler and Loretta Orion, both of whom had been or became Pagans whilst studying the movement, Berger stated that she had not joined the religion, thereby remaining an [...] "outsider" [...] throughout her research, but had made many friends within the Pagan community.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Time {{magazine}} {{said that}} Jamaica {{may be the}} most homophobic country in the world. The country's laws criminalising same-sex activity between males were introduced in 1864, during the British colonial administration. According to the Sexual Offences Act of 2009, any man convicted under these laws must register as a sex offender. These laws have been cited as contributing to wider homophobic attitudes among the Jamaican populace, including the view that gay people are criminals {{regardless of whether or not}} they have committed any criminal act. Anti-LGBT perspectives have been furthered by the island's conservative Christian churches. Many reggae and dancehall songs, among them Buju Banton's [...] "Boom Bye Bye", call for the killing of gays. Writing for the International Business Times in the summer of 2013, the journalist Palash Gosh noted that while Jamaica was [...] "awash in crime and violence, gays and lesbians are particularly prominent targets of wanton brutality." [...] In the mid-2000s, two of Jamaica's best-known LGBT rights activists, Brian Williamson and Steve Harvey, were murdered. In the summer of 2013, Human Rights Watch carried out five weeks <b>of</b> <b>fieldwork</b> among Jamaica's LGBT community, reporting that over half of those interviewed had experienced violence as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity, sometimes on more than one occasion.|$|E

While fieldwork is itself unpredictable, there may be many unanticipated ‘catches’. Moreover, there is often an ethnographic ‘imp’ that intrudes itself, questioning the very desirability or good sense <b>of</b> the <b>fieldwork</b> itself. The imps arise unbidden but can pose searching, sometimes unwelcome – though ultimately productive – questions.
