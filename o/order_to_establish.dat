The Ahanta leaders found it equally beneficial to enter into such an agreement. The 1656 treaty signalled the definitive switch in European jurisdiction in the area until 1872.|$|E

In the years after the war, the U.S. tested 1,100 compounds, and field trials of the more promising ones were done at British stations in India and Australia, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> their effects in tropical conditions, as well as at the U.S.'s testing ground in Florida.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt {{extensively}} used {{executive orders}} {{on a number}} of occasions to protect forest and wildlife lands during his tenure as President. By the end of his second term in office, Roosevelt used executive <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> 150 million acres of reserved forestry land. Roosevelt was unapologetic about his extensive use of executive <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> protect the environment, despite the perception in Congress that he was encroaching on too many lands. Eventually, Senator Charles Fulton (R-OH) attached an amendment to an agricultural appropriations bill that effectively prevented the president from reserving any further land. Before signing that bill into law, Roosevelt used executive <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> an additional 21 forest reserves, waiting until the last minute to sign the bill into law. In total, Roosevelt used executive <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> 121 forest reserves in 31 states. Prior to Roosevelt, only one president had issued over 200 executive orders, Grover Cleveland (253). The first 25 presidents issued a total of 1,262 executive orders. Roosevelt issued 1,081.|$|R

5|$|An enemy scout {{discovered}} Nulli Secunda quietly {{attempting to}} regain control with their Territorial Control Units (TCU). At around 14:00 UTC, with an hour remaining before Nulli Secunda could regain control, the CFC and Russian coalition sent a capital fleet to the station. RAZOR Alliance took the station, and the Russians destroyed the N3/PL Territorial Control Unit and set up its own TCU in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> control. Capturing the B-R5RB system would enable the CFC and Russian coalition to trap Pandemic Legion assets, including hundreds of capital and sub-capital ships, thus preventing those ships from joining the war.

Regardless of whatever feelings Roosevelt may have had regarding this amendment, he signed the bill into law. However, prior to doing so, he again used executive <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> an additional 21 forest reserves, waiting until the last minute to sign the bill into law. Roosevelt's willingness to make extensive use of executive <b>orders</b> pertaining <b>to</b> land conservation may have been fueled by his belief that the preservation of the forests and waterways was the most important domestic issue facing the country in that period. In total, Roosevelt used executive <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> 121 forest reserves in 31 states. Roosevelt's use of executive <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> protect the environment was another example of the extent to which Roosevelt's use of {{executive orders}} differed from past presidents.|$|R

According to Böwering, in contrast with pre-Islamic Arabian polytheism, God in Islam does not have associates and companions, nor is there any kinship between God and jinn. Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God.|$|E

In the 17th century a lucrative trade developed between Native Americans who trapped animals near the Great Lakes and traders who shipped the animal furs to Europe. For two centuries this trade network was the prime economic driver in the area. A notable result of this trade network was the Métis people, a mixed-race community descended from Native Americans and French traders, {{as well as other}} mixed-race peoples.
