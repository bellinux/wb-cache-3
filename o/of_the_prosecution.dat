The suspects were released on the condition that they remain available to police. On September 14, all restrictions on them were removed by the Combined Appeals Court of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{authorized}} {{and actual}} sentence, upon demand, a criminal defendant {{has a right}} to trial by jury. The defendant does not have a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> If the defendant is charged with crimes for which the authorized sentence exceeds six months, whether in state or federal court, the defendant {{has a right to}} a jury. Further, the defendant has a right to a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g. contempt of court).|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 1995, Rice was {{the manager}} of Dismas House, a halfway house for ex-convicts. In his first {{legislative}} campaign, Rice was criticized for his association with Dismas House founder Bob Sylvester, who was found guilty in 2000 of sexually abusing inmates. The incidents for which Sylvester was tried occurred after Rice left his employment at Dismas, and Rice testified on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> during Sylvester's trial.|$|E

50|$|Born in Hartland, New York, Dempsey was an {{assistant}} United States Attorney from 1899 to 1907. He was a {{special assistant to the}} Attorney General from 1907 to 1912 and was in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> <b>of</b> Standard Oil and certain railroad companies.|$|R
5|$|Hashimoto's {{submarine}} {{then returned}} to Japan, {{one of the few}} such ships to survive the war. Hashimoto was called to testify on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> at the court-martial of Charles B. McVay III, the commanding officer of Indianapolis, a move which was controversial at the time. He was later {{part of an effort to}} exonerate McVay, which was eventually successful. Hashimoto later became a Shinto priest. He died in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show the court that a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hastings first rose to {{prominence}} {{as a result}} of the Case of the Hooded Man in 1912, and became noted for his skill at cross-examinations. After his success in Gruban v Booth in 1917, his practice steadily grew, and in 1919 he became a King's Counsel (KC). Following various successes as a KC in cases such as Sievier v Wootton and Russell v Russell, his practice was put on hold in 1922 when he was returned as the Labour Member of Parliament for Wallsend. Hastings was appointed Attorney General for England and Wales in 1924, by the first Labour government, and knighted. His authorisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> of J. R. Campbell in what became known as the Campbell Case, however, led to the fall of the government after less than a year in power.|$|E

25|$|According to <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> State, <b>the</b> U.S. was {{identified}} as a Tier 1 country with unspecified federal agencies charging 181 individuals with trafficking other humans and obtaining 141 convictions in 103 human trafficking <b>prosecutions.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> reported by <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> State, 32 were labor trafficking cases and 71 were sex trafficking cases.|$|R
5|$|However, Soeprapto {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with Minister of Justice Moeljatno over the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general's office, {{under the control of}} the Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence; on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to be accountable only to the cabinet. This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister of Justice, which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957.|$|E
5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> case collapsed.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 2009, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia {{issued an}} arrest warrant for Guandique. He was {{returned}} to {{the custody of the}} District of Columbia Department of Corrections on April 20 via the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City. Two days later, Guandique was charged in D.C. with Levy's murder. He was indicted by a grand jury on six counts: kidnapping, first-degree murder committed during a kidnapping, attempted first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree murder committed during a sexual offense, attempted robbery, and first-degree murder committed during a robbery. Guandique pleaded not guilty at his arraignment, where a trial date was initially set for January 27, 2010. His lawyers argued that Guandique's federal prison cell was outside the jurisdiction of a court-ordered search. After errors in processing contaminated some of the gathered evidence with DNA from employees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> the start date of the trial at the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse was moved to October 4, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|This {{aggravation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> Paragraph 175 in 1935 increased <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> convictions tenfold, to 8,000 annually. Only {{about half}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> resulted from police work; about 40 percent resulted from private accusations (Strafanzeige) by non-participating observers, and about 10 percent were denouncements by employers and institutions.

50|$|He is {{regarded}} {{by some as}} an extreme leftist activist and troublemaker.

25|$|The House of Representatives {{was having}} a {{difficult}} time on naming other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> with Magtanggol Gunigundo I (Lakas-Kampi, Valenzuela–2nd) being added; Elpidio Barzaga (NUP, Dasmariñas (Cavite–4th)) was reportedly considered but his links to Arroyo was seen to be too strong.|$|E
25|$|It is {{incumbent}} upon {{the defense to}} file a motion with the court that it believes that the failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> to produce the document {{is a violation of}} the Jencks Act.

50|$|During {{the next}} decade, four United States Attorneys -- Thomas P. Sullivan, Dan K. Webb, Anton R. Valukas and Fred Foreman—supervised <b>the</b> {{investigations}} and <b>prosecutions.</b> First Assistant United States Attorney Daniel Reidy and Assistant United States Attorneys (AUSA) Charles Sklarsky, Scott Lassar, Scott Mendeloff and Candace J. Fabri led many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions.</b> In 1985, Valukus and AUSA James Schweitzer indicted 22 corrupt court personnel, along with Judge Raymond Sodini, {{who presided over}} the corruption in his courtroom at Chicago Police Headquarters.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{case was}} {{hampered}} by a shifting theory on <b>the</b> medical cause <b>of</b> death. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> proposed that Mr. Anderson died of improper use of force, then of suffocation, then of failure to act.

25|$|The Attorney General has {{supervisory}} powers over <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>of</b> criminal offences, {{but is not}} personally involved with prosecutions; however, some prosecutions (e.g. Riot) cannot be commenced without their consent, {{and they have the}} power to halt prosecutions generally. Criminal <b>prosecutions</b> are <b>the</b> responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crown <b>Prosecution</b> Service, headed by <b>the</b> Director <b>of</b> Public <b>Prosecutions.</b> <b>The</b> Attorney General may appeal cases to the higher courts where, although the particular case is settled, there may be a point of law of public importance at issue.|$|R

40|$|THESIS 5287 This {{thesis is}} a {{critical}} evaluation of criminal procedure and mental health in Ireland, concentrating in particular on fitness to plead, insanity acquittals, transfers from ordinary mental hospitals to the Central Mental Hospital and transfers from prisons to mental hospitals. Throughout the thesis, constitutional and human rights considerations are emphasised. A broadening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing definition <b>of</b> fitness to plead is suggested, to cover defendants? analytic capacity {{as well as their}} cognitive abilities. A ?trial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facts? procedure is proposed to ensure that <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution?s</b> case is tested before it is possible to detain a person. However, proposals to allow postponement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> fitness until <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> case has ended would conflict with the right to a fair trial. <b>The</b> question <b>of</b> fitness to plead in the District Court needs to be clarified in legislation...|$|R
