40|$|At present {{there are}} 1425 <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> quotas (TRQs) {{notified}} by member countries to the World Trade Organization. TRQs were provided {{for in the}} Uruguay Round as a trade policy instrument to guarantee minimum market access for politically sensitive agricultural imports, {{and in some cases}} to continue managed trade regimes. This article evaluates the developmental relevance of TRQs and discusses how the various methods TRQ administration methods influence market access in Switzerland for agricultural products from developing countries. The findings show that existing TRQ management in Switzerland is complicated and lacks transparency. Further, the manner in which TRQs are administered results in high transaction costs, a situation that fails to liberate trade opportunities from rents and influences trade flows of the partner countries. Proposed reforms are establishment of a more efficient administrative mechanism, modalities to liberalize trade with TRQs through reduction of <b>out-of-quota</b> <b>tariffs,</b> and capacity building in developing countries; such reforms would maximize market access opportunities from a development perspective. developing countries, Switzerland, <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> quotas, Agribusiness, Agricultural Finance, International Development, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|Several {{proposals}} for liberalising agricultural <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> quotas (TRQs) {{have been proposed}} within the WTO Doha Development Round. The literature suggests that the effectiveness of liberalisation depends upon which of the three elements of a TRQ constrains imports. Most contributions assume perfect competition. This article uses an oligopoly two-stage capacity constrained model, in which the mode of competition is endogenous, to investigate the impact of different liberalisation options of TRQs, that is, {{the reduction in the}} in-quota and <b>out-of-quota</b> <b>tariffs</b> and the expansion of the quota. This article shows that consideration of the nature of competition between traders may provide unconventional conclusions about the effectiveness of the various TRQ liberalisation options; furthermore, the article shows how {{an increase in the number}} of rivals, under certain circumstances, may be more effective in increasing trade than reducing tariff...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} trade liberalization of tariff-rate quotas under import "state trading enterprises" (STEs) in agriculture. An analytical framework is provided to determine the importance of which instrument is binding under competition (the in-quota or <b>out-of-quota</b> <b>tariff</b> or the quota) and under the initial STE equilibrium. It also depends {{on whether or not}} the STE controls both the domestic market prices and owns/controls the import quota (and whether it is obligated to fill the quota or not). An empirical example of the rice STE in South Korea has simulations showing that an increase in imports can be achieved through a moderate expansion of the quota or a decrease in the <b>out-of-quota</b> <b>tariff</b> to the level where it becomes binding. However, a significant level of quota expansion induces the STE to switch to the autarky solution and social welfare declines.

40|$|After {{joining the}} WTO in 2002, Taiwan allowed rice imports {{for the first}} time by {{implementing}} an import quota subject to a special safeguard tariff. In 2003, the import quota was expanded to a two-tier <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> import quota system. Although Taiwan maintained land set-asides and domestic support prices for producer sales to the State Trading Enterprise, the latter was limited to importing only 65 percent of the import quota with the rest sold to private traders. This sudden transformation of the Taiwanese import regime and rice market along with the government proposal for a "strategic alliance" amongst traders highlights the importance of studying the effects of policy reforms in the framework of imperfect domestic market structure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze Taiwanese rice policy reforms using a computational partial equilibrium model. The impact of import controls, price supports, land set-aside and alternative market structures are assessed, including the potential change in regimes within the tariff quota system. Our results show that the "strategic alliance" proposed by the agricultural authority will further distort the domestic market. Elimination of the domestic support price and land set-aside improves social welfare independent of the market structure while a change in the market structure towards competition is always social welfare improving regardless of domestic policy instruments. But the policy regime of the tariff quota (the in-quota <b>tariff</b> versus the <b>out-of-quota</b> <b>tariff</b> versus the quota) and hence social welfare is sensitive to changes in both domestic policy instruments and market structure. <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> quota, strategic alliance, domestic support, market structure, Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade, Q 17, Q 18,...|$|R

However, the welfare effects of adoption of genetically modified (GM) food and feed crop varieties are being affected not only by some countriesÂ’ strict regulations governing GM food production and consumption, but also by their choice of food trade policy instruments. Specifically, notwithstanding the ending of the European UnionÂ’s GM moratorium in April 2004, the continuing use by the EU of strict labeling and liability laws and of variable trade taxes-cum-subsidies and <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> quotas is reducing the aggregate gains from new biotechnologies and the incentive for EU taxpayers and for life science companies to support GM food research.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{properties}} of an external <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> set by a government in a free trade area (FTA) may change drastically when endogenizing foreign direct investment (FDI) policy. We use a three-country model which is a FTA variant of the “third country model ” of the strategic trade policy. We assume that firms outside the FTA may supply, either by export or by FDI, homogeneous goods to the home market and that the home government can choose a fixed cost, as a FDI policy, that outside firms must incur {{in order to have}} production plants in the home country. First, when FDI cost is exogenous, if that cost is sufficiently low, the optimal external <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> is the critical rate at which the outside firms switch their supply mode from export to FDI. This <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> is lower when the demand in the home market is larger and/or the difference in marginal costs is larger between inside and outside firms. Furthermore, this optimal <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> will be lower when the number of outside firms is smaller while the effects of the number of inside firms is ambiguous. Second, when FDI policy is endogenously determined, the optimal external <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> is the <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> at which the home welfare is maximized when outside firms choose export.
