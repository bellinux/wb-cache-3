40|$|Mercury is a {{ubiquitous}} pollutant that when absorbed is extremely toxic {{to a wide}} variety of biochemical processes. Mercury (II) is a strong, “invisible” poison that is rapidly absorbed by tissues of the intestinal tract, kidneys, and liver upon ingestion. In this study, a novel fluorescence-based biosensor is presented that allows for the direct monitoring of the uptake and distribution of the metal under noninvasive in vivo conditions. With the introduction of a cysteine residue at position 205, located in close proximity to the chromophore, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea victoria was converted into a highly specific biosensor for this metal ion. The mutant protein exhibits a dramatic absorbance and fluorescence change upon mercuration at neutral pH. Absorbance and fluorescence properties with respect to the metal concentration exhibit sigmoidal binding behavior with a detection limit in the low nanomolar range. Time-resolved binding studies indicate rapid subsecond binding of the metal to the protein. The crystal structures <b>obtained</b> <b>of</b> <b>mutant</b> eGFP 205 C indicate a possible access route of the metal into the core of the protein. To our knowledge, this engineered protein is a first example of a biosensor that allows for noninvasive and real-time imaging of mercury uptake in a living cell. A major advantage is that its expression can be genetically controlled in many organisms to enable unprecedented studies of tissue specific mercury uptake...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Acinetobacter baumannii is a multidrug-resistant {{bacterium}} responsible for nosocomial infections in hospitals worldwide. Study <b>of</b> <b>mutant</b> phenotypes is fundamental for understanding gene function. The methodologies developed to inactivate A. baumannii genes are complicated and time-consuming; sometimes result in unstable mutants, {{and do not}} enable construction of double (or more) gene knockout <b>mutant</b> strains <b>of</b> A. baumannii. Results We describe here a rapid and simple method <b>of</b> <b>obtaining</b> A. baumannii <b>mutants</b> by gene replacement via double crossover recombination, by use of a PCR product that carries an antibiotic resistance cassette flanked by regions homologous to the target locus. To demonstrate the reproducibility of the approach, we produced <b>mutants</b> <b>of</b> three different chromosomal genes (omp 33, oxyR, and soxR) by this method. In addition, we disrupted one of these genes (omp 33) by integration of a plasmid into the chromosome by single crossover recombination, {{the most widely used}} method <b>of</b> <b>obtaining</b> A. baumannii <b>mutants.</b> Comparison <b>of</b> the different techniques revealed absolute stability when the gene was replaced by a double recombination event, whereas up to 40 % of the population reverted to wild-type when the plasmid was disrupting the target gene after 10 passages in broth without selective pressure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the combination of both gene disruption and gene replacement techniques is an easy and useful procedure for obtaining double gene knockout mutants in A. baumannii. Conclusions This study provides a rapid and simple method <b>of</b> <b>obtaining</b> stable <b>mutants</b> <b>of</b> A. baumannii free of foreign plasmidic DNA, which does not require cloning steps, and enables construction of multiple gene knockout mutants. </p...|$|R

40|$|When Escherichia coli strain B is plated with {{an excess}} of T 1 coliphage, two main types of T 1 re-sistant mutants can be {{isolated}} (Demerec and Fano, 1945). One type, designated B/i, 6, is also resistant to Ts coliphage and, like the phage-sensitive wild type, it shows no specific require-ment for growth. The other type, B/i,trp is sensitive to T 5 and is nutritionally different from the wild type in that tryptophan is required for growth (Anderson, 1946). Thus, a tryptophan-requiring <b>mutant</b> <b>of</b> E. coli strain B may be isolated by selection with T, coliphage. Another method <b>of</b> <b>obtaining</b> trypto-phan-requiring <b>mutants</b> <b>of</b> this strain is by selection for auxotrophy with penicillin (Davis, 1949). Tryptophanless mutants so obtained {{have been shown to}} be different from the B/i,trp type, not only in their sensitivity to T 1 phage but in nutritional response patterns and types of inter-mediates accumulated (Gots et al., 1954). Iso-lation of B/ 1,trp by selection for its tryptophan requirement could not be accomplished even from populations in which they were known to be heavily concentrated as determined by fluctu-ation analysis and selection for phage resistance. The inability to isolate these mutants by the penicillin method of auxotrophic selection pre-sents a paradox. An investigation into the nature of this paradox has revealed that the B/ 1,trp mutants cannot be isolated by the penicillin method because the action of the penicillin on the parent wild type population creates an environ-ment which is deadly for the B/ 1,trp <b>mutants.</b> A description <b>of</b> this unique phenomenon is the subject of this paper...|$|R

The first step consists of designing directed oligonucleotides with specific tails for isolating recombination fragments and a resistance marker cassette to an antibiotic by PCR. The three inserts are cloned by homologous recombination in three specific vectors, in a single step. The last step consists of multisite-directed recombination of the three donor vectors to the pK 18 -attR destination vector.

Sequence analysis and further genetic analysis indicated that insertions of the first group are localized in the occ region of the Ti plasmid. Insertions of the second group were localized to a gene encoding ornithine cyclodeaminase. This gene is very similar to, but distinct from, a homolog located on the Ti plasmid. This gene is located immediately downstream from a gene encoding an arginase. Genetic experiments indicated that this arginase gene is essential for octopine and arginine catabolism.

40|$|Abstract Directed {{evolution}} in vitro {{is a powerful}} tool {{in the study and}} design of protein function. However, screening the desired mutants is a difficult task. To facili-tate the screening, a method is proposed to eliminate wild type sequences and increase mutated DNA sequences, which is based on the preferential binding of MutS protein to heteroduplex DNA. Following error-prone PCR, amplified products are denatured and re-annealed to form heteroduplex and homoduplex DNA. Heteroduplexes are selectively bound to an engineered MutS protein and immobilized on a Strep-Tactin column. Homoduplexes are effectively removed by washing, and the final elution is enriched in mutated DNA sequences. One round of muta-ted DNA enrichment resulted in an about 2. 3 -fold of increase in mutation frequency compared to the control. The percentage <b>of</b> <b>mutants</b> rose from 44 % in the control sample to 72 % in the enrichment sample.

40|$|When Escherichia coli strain B/r {{is exposed}} to 10 to 20 μg of nitrofurazone per ml, mutants with roughly {{threefold}} resistance are <b>obtained.</b> Treatment <b>of</b> these <b>mutants</b> with higher concentrations of nitrofurazone yields strains with six- to seven-fold resistance over strain B/r. Each of these steps toward nitrofurazone resistance is accompanied by loss of soluble nitrofurazone reductase activity. When sensitive bacteria are exposed to labeled nitrofurazone or labeled 2 -nitrofuran, {{a considerable amount of}} radioactivity becomes bound to the cold trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction. Very little activity becomes bound in the mutants with six- to seven-fold resistance; mutants with intermediate resistance show intermediate levels of binding. Partially purified nitrofurazone reductase preparations catalyze the conversion of nitrofurazone to compounds which bind to protein and are not removed by prolonged dialysis against 8 m urea or by cold acid. Nitrofurazone reduced by xanthine oxidase or electrolytically reduced also yields compounds which react with protein to form stable derivatives...|$|R
40|$|The chromophore-binding {{properties}} of the higher plant light-harvesting protein CP 29 have been studied by using site-directed mutagenesis of pigment- binding residues. Overexpression of the apoproteins in bacteria was followed by reconstitution in vitro with purified pigments, thus <b>obtaining</b> a family <b>of</b> <b>mutant</b> CP 29 proteins lacking individual chromophore-binding sites. Biochemical characterization allowed identification of the eight porphyrins and two xanthophyll-binding sites. It is shown that the four porphyrin- binding sites (A 1, A 2, A 4, and AS) situated in the central, twofold- symmetrical domain of the protein are selective for Chl-a, whereas the four peripheral sites (A 3, B 3, B 5, and B 6) have mixed Chl-a-Chl-b specificity. Within a site, porphyrin coordination by glutamine increases affinity for Chl-b as compared with glutamate. Xanthophyll site L 1 is occupied by lutein, whereas site L 2 can bind violaxanthin or neoxanthin. The protein is relatively stable when site L 2 site is empty, suggesting that xanthophylls can be exchanged during operation of xanthophyll cycle-dependent photoprotection mechanism. Differential absorption spectroscopy allowed determination of transition energy levels for individual chromophores, thus opening the way to calculation of energy-transfer rates between Chl in higher plant antenna proteins...|$|R
40|$|Rodent tuber (Typhonium flagelliforme Lodd.) is a herbal plant {{from the}} Araceae family. The plant has high medical {{potential}} and is effective to cure cancer. However, {{the low level}} of its genetic variation limits its exploration for desirable traits. The low level of genetic variation in Rodent tuber is mainly due to its asexual reproduction system. It usually reproduces vegetatively via tuber separation. Therefore, gamma irradiation had been applied to rodent tuber in vitro to increase its genetic diversity. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the genetic diversity of the first generation (MV 1) of gamma irradiated rodent tuber mutant using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. A total <b>of</b> 14 <b>mutant</b> DNA samples were analyzed with 14 RAPD primers. The result showed that 67 out of 123 DNA bands were polymorphic among mutant lines. Based on cluster analysis these mutants showed 0. 78 - 0. 97 genetic similarity. Cutting of dendogram at genetic distance of 0. 89 produced four main clusters. Mutants with high genetic variation are now available. This increases the opportunity <b>of</b> <b>obtaining</b> <b>mutant</b> lines with high anti-cancer activity...|$|R

40|$|A caseinase- {{and bound}} coagulase-negative mutant was {{isolated}} from Staphylococcus aureus BB by treatment with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The virulence <b>of</b> the <b>mutant</b> strain was {{compared with that}} of the parental strain in mice infected by the intravenous and intraperitoneal routes. The ratio between the LDso <b>of</b> the <b>mutant</b> and that <b>of</b> the parent was 1, 841 for intravenous infection and 106 for intraperitoneal infec-tion. Viable staphylococci were counted in renal tissue three days after intravenous in-fection with 3 x 106 bacteria; the count was 8 x 107 cfu/IOO mg of tissue for the paren-tal strain and 1. 2 x 102 cfu/IOO mg for the mutant strain. Staphylococcus aureus is found in diseased tissues and in pus obtained from human abscesses and produces many kinds of extracellular toxins and enzymes. The role of those toxins and enzymes and their relation to the virulence of S aureus in humans and animals have been studied. Jeljasze-wicz [1] compared the enzymatic activities of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative strains and concluded that free and bound coagulase, along with phosphatase, occurred more frequently in potentially pathogenic staphylococcal strains. McCabe [2] could not establish any direct relation between virulence and the production of coagu-lase, gelatinase, or lipase, but he found that fibrinolysin activity correlated well with virulence. We have been striving to <b>obtain</b> a set <b>of</b> <b>mutants</b> from one original staphylococcal strain {{that can be used to}} elucidate the contribution of each genetic characteristic of the organism to its viru-lence. In a previous study, two kinds <b>of</b> deficient <b>mutants</b> were derived from S aureus BB [3]. The virulence <b>of</b> these <b>mutants</b> and that <b>of</b> the parental strain were compared in mice. The ratios between the LD so values of three free, coagulase-negative mutants and the LD so of the parental strain ranged from 201 to 403 for iv infection and from 30. 7 to 52. 7 for ip infection. In the present study, S aureus BB was again used Received for publication August 31, 1983, and in revise...|$|R
