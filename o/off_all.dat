5|$|After {{discovering}} that Tracy {{is still in}} contact with NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), Jack realizes that their relationship {{is the key to}} bringing Tracy back to TGS. Jack, therefore, orders Kenneth to break <b>off</b> <b>all</b> contact with Tracy, although this fails because of Kenneth's relationship with Tracy. Seeing an opportunity, Jack states that since Kenneth's duties were primarily taking care of Tracy, and Tracy no longer works at NBC, Kenneth is no longer needed. Not wanting Kenneth to lose his job, Tracy agrees to return on the stipulation that Kenneth keeps his job.|$|E
5|$|Although Douglas {{had been}} {{the cause of his}} misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at Rouen. This meeting was disapproved of by the friends and {{families}} of both men. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow him to see their sons, though she sent him money – a meagre three pounds a week. During the latter part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples for a few months until they were separated by their families under the threat of cutting <b>off</b> <b>all</b> funds.|$|E

Until then, the court was unaware that Deshin Shekpa had died in 1415. The Ming court had believed that {{the representatives of the}} Karma Kagyu who continued to visit the Ming capital were sent by the Karmapa.|$|E

5|$|In Liao custom betrothal {{was seen}} as being equally serious to, if not more serious than, {{marriage}} itself, and was difficult to annul. The groom would pledge to work for three years for the bride's family, pay a bride price, and lavish the bride's family with gifts. After the three years, the groom {{would be allowed to}} take the bride back to his home, and the bride would usually cut <b>off</b> <b>all</b> ties with her family.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) killed <b>off</b> <b>all</b> the elms {{that once}} {{populated}} {{the park and}} crab apples were planted to replace the elms along the pedestrian mall. After deteriorating over the decades Washington Park saw a revival in the 1990s and 2000s with the flower beds being restored to their original specifications, the pedestrian mall removed of pavement and widened to its original dimensions with disease-resistant elms planted to form a canopy, the King Fountain relit at night, and the lilac shrub border around {{the periphery of the}} park being restored.|$|E
5|$|Pakistani {{authorities}} {{tried to}} contact their NATO counterparts {{in an effort to}} inform them of the situation but the Pakistani request reportedly failed to reach the attacking force. The helicopters returned a second time engaging Boulder border post again.

Later, Major General Abbas expressed that it was beyond comprehension why the NATO forces returned to attack the second time.|$|E

5|$|The Rhind Papyrus {{illustrates}} some of Ahmose's {{military strategy}} when attacking the Delta. Entering Heliopolis in July, he {{moved down the}} eastern delta to take Tjaru, the major border fortification on the Horus Road, the road from Egypt to Canaan, in October, totally avoiding Avaris. In taking Tjaru he cut <b>off</b> <b>all</b> traffic between Canaan and Avaris. This indicates he was planning a blockade of Avaris, isolating the Hyksos capital from help or supplies coming from Canaan.|$|E

Even after leaving the nest, the juveniles will follow their parents around and beg food from them. Juveniles become capable of sustained flight two weeks after fledging.|$|E

Upon the unsuccessful April 2004 release of Home on the Range, Disney, led by executive Bob Lambert, officially announced its conversion of Walt Disney Feature Animation into a fully CGI studio– a process begun two years prior– now with a staff of 600 people and began selling <b>off</b> <b>all</b> of its traditional animation equipment.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the treaty}} signed at the {{conclusion}} of the war, Hierapytna agreed to break <b>off</b> <b>all</b> relations and alliances with foreign powers and to place all its harbors and bases at Rhodes' disposal. Olous, among the ruins of which the terms of the treaty have been found, had to accept Rhodian domination. As a result, Rhodes was left with control of a significant part of eastern Crete after the war. The conclusion of the war left the Rhodians free to help their allies in the Second Macedonian War.|$|E
5|$|Cooke {{resolved}} to kill Sharp herself. The next time Sharp was in Bowling Green on business, she {{sent a letter}} to him that denounced Beauchamp's actions and claimed she had broken <b>off</b> <b>all</b> contact with him. She asked Sharp to visit her at her plantation before he left town. Sharp questioned the messenger who delivered the letter, as he suspected a trap. He replied to her, saying he would visit at the time appointed. Beauchamp and Cooke awaited the visit, but Sharp never arrived. When Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green to investigate, he learned that Sharp had left for Frankfort two days earlier, leaving substantial unfinished business. Beauchamp concluded that Sharp would eventually have to return to Bowling Green to finish his business there. Determined to await Sharp's return, Beauchamp opened a legal practice in the city. Throughout 1822 and 1823, Beauchamp practiced law and waited for Sharp to return. He never did.|$|E

5|$|Faced with stiff {{competition}} and {{an inability to}} increase its own capacity, Rogers Locomotive Works was purchased by ALCO in 1905. Rogers' last independently built locomotive was serial number 6271, a 0-6-0 tank locomotive built for W. R. Grace & Company in February 1905. ALCO continued building locomotives at the Rogers plant until 1913 when manufacturing at the plant ceased permanently. Locomotives built at the Rogers plant under ALCO are generally referred to as locomotives built by ALCO-Rogers. ALCO used the Rogers plant buildings as warehouses well into the 1920s, but eventually sold <b>off</b> <b>all</b> of the property. The original Rogers erecting shop was converted into office space and was still in use in that manner as late as 1992.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain and France {{had been}} at war {{for more than two}} years by April 1795, and British {{dominance}} at sea was well established, with the Royal Navy maintaining substantial blockade fleets <b>off</b> <b>all</b> of the principal French naval ports. The biggest port on the French Atlantic coast was at Brest in Brittany, from which French raiders could attack British shipping in the English Channel and Western Atlantic. The most efficient commerce raiders were frigates, light and fast warships that could strike rapidly and with devastating effect if left unopposed. One of the major roles of the British blockade squadrons was the detection and elimination of French frigates as they emerged from their bases.|$|E
5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave <b>off</b> <b>all</b> his fur. Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and does what others, for fear of reaction from the people around them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E

5|$|Reid {{occupied}} high-ranking cabinet {{positions in}} Greenfield's government {{and that of}} his successor, John Edward Brownlee. Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921. In the former capacity, he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards. He also proposed a program of eugenics through the sterilisation of the mentally handicapped, which in 1928 led to the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta. As an advocate of government-wide economy, he laid <b>off</b> <b>all</b> school inspection nurses and many public health nurses. This inclination towards thrift was also evident in his performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs, in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer a greater proportion of the responsibility for caring for indigents to the province. In 1929, he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10% of the old age pensions paid to their residents.|$|E
5|$|SR 50, the Paradise Parkway, {{was part}} of Proposition 300 in 1985, but {{was removed from the}} system in December 1994, when then Arizona {{governor}} Fife Symington made some funding cuts that included removal of the Paradise Parkway and Estrella Freeway from the system entirely. (The Estrella Freeway was re-added to the system when Proposition 400 was passed ten years later in 2004.) Route 50 will not be re-added to the system, because in February 1996 the ADOT auctioned <b>off</b> <b>all</b> the right-of-way it had purchased for the freeway, which was to be located between Loop 101 and Route 51 in the Central Valley.|$|E
5|$|Sir Stanley V. Goodall, Director of Naval Construction (DNC), {{proposed}} {{a variety of}} designs, both open and closed hangar. On 8 October 1943, the Board of Admiralty selected a closed-hangar design with an armoured flight deck and five propeller shafts. Reports of American operations in the Pacific convinced the Board to reconsider hangar design; American experience had shown {{that the ability to}} fly <b>off</b> <b>all</b> of a carrier's aircraft in a single airstrike was vital. That required a well-ventilated, open-hangar design, which would reduce the time required to launch the aircraft by allowing them to begin the typical 15-minute engine warm-up while still in the hangar. On 15 May 1944, the Board reversed itself and ordered the DNC to produce an open-hangar design with deck-edge lifts. An unarmoured flight deck was agreed upon in June by the Controller of the Navy and the Fifth Sea Lord.|$|E
