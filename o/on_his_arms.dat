5|$|At a {{preliminary}} hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While {{there was no question}} as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E

25|$|Commerford is {{also known}} for his {{numerous}} tattoos. His first tattoo was a solid black band around his left arm to remember his mother by. He soon had half of a face (a painting by graphic artist Mirko Ilić) tattooed on his back, and various other designs <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> In 1993, he began work on an intricate design on his left leg. By 1996 this tattoo covered over 65% of his body (covering his arms, left leg, chest, back, and two swirls on his posterior).|$|E

Frusciante had lost contact with most of his friends. However, Flea always remained in contact, and he helped talk Frusciante into admitting himself to Las Encinas Drug Rehabilitation Center in January 1998. He concluded the process in February of that year and began renting a small apartment in Silver Lake. He acquired many injuries and problems in the years of his addiction, some requiring surgery, including permanent scarring <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> a restructured nose, and an oral infection, which led to his teeth being removed and replaced with dental implants.|$|E
25|$|Many Russians {{believed}} that tsars and tsarevichs bore special marks {{on their bodies}} symbolising their royal status, which became known as royal marks. Four of the pretenders claiming to be Peter III showed royal marks to legitimise their claims. The first fake Peter to have royal marks was Gavrila Kremnev who Lev Evdokimov recognised because of a cross on Kremnev's foot. Lev Evdokimov claimed that he {{had worked as a}} chorister at the royal palace and had held the real Peter III in his arms as a child therefore giving credibility to Kremnev's claims. Despite Kremnev's marking, he never gained many supporters and was flogged and branded with the words, “deserter and pretender”. The next fake Peter III to show a royal mark of some sort was Fedot Kazin-Bogomolov in 1772. He showed a guard where he was imprisoned a cross on his chest and claimed he had two more on his arm and head allowing him to gain many supporters. The government branded Kazin-Bogomolov despite his markings. The third Peter III with royal marks was the most famous of the four and the most successful pretender of the time, Pugachev. In 1773 Pugachev staged a revealing of his royal identity to a cossack, Eremina Kuritsa, leading other cossacks to challenge Pugachev at dinner, which resulted in him showing scars on his chest and head to the cossacks. Pugachev claimed the scars on his chest were caused from the coup against him and that the scars on his forehead were from smallpox. Pugachev's rational reasoning for his markings caused him to continually gain supporters throughout his stand as a pretender. Unlike the first two pretenders to show royal marks, Pugachev's efforts cost him his life since his punishment was execution. The final pretender during Catherine's reign to reveal royal marks was Makar Mosiakin in 1774. Mosiakin entered a peasant hut claiming to be Peter III and then showed the peasants crosses <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> claiming they represented royal inheritance. According to the official report of the Mosiakin he had made the cross marks himself to convince people that he was Peter III and he actually had some success as he managed to gain followers from various villages as he went from house to house.|$|E

[...] Like Kippax, whose style was uncannily similar, Jackson wore his shirt-sleeves almost down to his wrists. This was not in imitation but to conceal the blemishes <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> caused by psoriasis. Kippax was not seen by some as the best person to imitate, with Charles Kelleway critical of Jackson's flourishes, wishing {{he would not be}} so, [...] "... cramped in copying other batsman's styles".|$|E

500|$|While {{there was}} no {{question}} as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. Judge Joseph Kelly presided over the trial proceedings, which began on December 8, 1969. Crown counsel John Malone called as witnesses the officers who discovered the drugs and the lab technicians who identified them as heroin; the prosecution rested after three hours of testimony. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the drugs belonged to Hendrix. Mervin Wilson, the customs agent who discovered the drugs, agreed with O'Driscoll's assertion that Hendrix had drawn attention to himself at the airport by wearing what O'Driscoll described as [...] "obviously mod clothing". Wilson stated that Hendrix had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage, and Constable W.J. Matheson confirmed that Hendrix had no needle tracks <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
500|$|As {{shown in}} [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", the Doctor joins his friends at Lake Silencio and then {{approaches}} the astronaut, now {{known to be}} a younger version of River Song, Amy and Rory's daughter, trained to kill the Doctor by the Silence and Madame Kovarian. River does not want to kill him but is unable to fight the suit's control, and the Doctor says he forgives her and reminds her that the event is inevitable. River, despite his warning against interfering with a fixed point, surprises the Doctor by draining the astronaut suit's weapons systems and averting his death. Time becomes [...] "stuck" [...] as a result and begins to disintegrate; all of Earth's history begins to run simultaneously at a fixed moment of 5:02p.m. on 22 April 2011. In London, Holy Roman Emperor Winston Churchill takes the Doctor, his [...] "soothsayer", out from his locked cell to ask him about the condition of time. The Doctor explains the preceding events, as tally marks begin appearing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> indicating the presence of the Silence. After noticing a Silence nest overhead, they are rescued by Amy and a squad of soldiers under her command. Due to the effects of the crack in her bedroom, Amy is cognizant of the altered timeline, though she is unaware that her trusted captain is her husband Rory. Amy takes the Doctor to [...] "Area 52", a hollowed-out Giza pyramid, where they have captured over a hundred Silence and Madame Kovarian. River is also there; aware of the consequences of her actions, she refuses to allow the Doctor to touch her, an event that would [...] "unfreeze" [...] time and allow it to resume. They all wear [...] "eyedrives", external memory eye patches which enable them to avoid the Silence's effect of erasing themselves from memory.|$|E
