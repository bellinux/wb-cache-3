40|$|For simple digital circuits, {{conventional}} method <b>of</b> <b>designing</b> circuits {{can easily}} be applied. But for complex digital circuits, the conventional method <b>of</b> <b>designing</b> circuits is not fruitfully applicable because it is time-consuming. On the contrary, Genetic Programming is used mostly for automatic program generation. The modern approach for designing Arithmetic circuits, commonly digital circuits, is based on Graphs. This graph-based evolutionary <b>design</b> <b>of</b> arithmetic circuits is a method <b>of</b> optimized <b>designing</b> <b>of</b> arithmetic circuits. In this paper, a new technique for evolutionary <b>design</b> <b>of</b> digital circuits is proposed using Genetic Programming (GP) with Subtree Mutation in place <b>of</b> Graph-based <b>design.</b> The results obtained using this technique demonstrates the potential capability of genetic programming in digital circuit design with limited computer algorithms.

40|$|Looking at {{incidence}} matrices <b>of</b> t-(v,k,λ) <b>designs</b> as v × b matrices with 2 possible entries, each {{of which}} indicates incidences of a t-design, we introduce {{the notion of a}} c-mosaic <b>of</b> <b>designs,</b> having the same number of points and blocks, as a matrix with c different entries, such that each entry defines incidences <b>of</b> a <b>design.</b> In fact, a v × b matrix is decomposed in c incidence matrices <b>of</b> <b>designs,</b> each denoted by a different colour, hence this decomposition might be seen as a tiling of a matrix with incidence matrices <b>of</b> <b>designs</b> as well. These mosaics have applications in experiment design when considering a simultaneous run of several different experiments.
