40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} six {{studies that have}} {{examined}} a new conceptualisation <b>of</b> distress <b>intolerance,</b> the measurement issues {{in this area and}} the relation networks <b>of</b> distress <b>intolerance.</b> In particular, the studies address three issues which are fundamental to understanding the nature <b>of</b> distress <b>intolerance.</b> Furthermore, an examination of these issues is essential if a fully comprehensive account <b>of</b> distress <b>intolerance,</b> which is currently not well specified, is to be gained. The first issue to be addressed is insularity and the multifaceted conceptualisation <b>of</b> distress <b>intolerance.</b> This issue was investigated in Study One, whereby a new conceptualisation <b>of</b> distress <b>intolerance</b> was employed. The second issue here pertains to measuring the construct <b>of</b> distress <b>intolerance.</b> This issue was investigated in Studies One, Two and Three. Study One introduced the Distress Intolerance Five Factor – Short (DIFF-S), as a parsimonious measure of the general factor and the five facets <b>of</b> distress <b>intolerance.</b> Study Two supported the concurrent and construct validity and the test–retest reliability of the DIFF-S. Study Three suggested that the DIFF-S demonstrates an association with the Mirror-Tracing Persistence Task and the Cold Pressor Task. The third issue here is the relation networks <b>of</b> distress <b>intolerance</b> as they relate to other relevant constructs. This was investigated in Studies Four, Five and Six. Study Four suggests that there is an emphasis on neuroticism in predicting general distress intolerance and the majority <b>of</b> the distress <b>intolerance</b> facets. Study Five suggests the involvement of attentional networks and directed attention {{in the structure of the}} five facets <b>of</b> distress <b>intolerance.</b> Study Six reveal that, retrospectively, the mechanisms of the family of origin and parental bonding are involved in the five facets <b>of</b> distress <b>intolerance.</b> Overall, this thesis provides an advanced solution as to the conceptualisation and measurement issues <b>of</b> distress <b>intolerance</b> and also explores its relation networks...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{individual differences in}} the effects of interpersonal stress coping on mental health among adolescents. The respondents were 173 college students (76 males, 93 females) {{with a mean age}} of 19. 7 years. They answered the Interpersonal Stress-Coping Inventory (consisting of positive relationship-oriented coping, negative relationship-oriented coping, and postponed-solution coping), measures of mental health (depression and loneliness), and an individual difference measure <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity. Positive relationship-oriented coping was significantly related to loneliness only among people with high levels <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity. Results also indicated that postponed-solution coping was significantly correlated with loneliness only among people with low levels <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> ambiguity. 上薗恒太郎教授退職記念...|$|R

5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree <b>of</b> <b>intolerance</b> at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E
5|$|The king, while Catholic, {{was very}} {{tolerant}} {{and did not}} support the more aggressive policies of the Counter-Reformation. When he took power, the Senate of Poland had 6 Protestant members; {{at the time of his}} death, it had 11. Despite his support for religious tolerance, he did fail, however, to resolve the conflict stemming from the Union of Brest split. Despite his support for the Protestants, he did not stop the growing tide <b>of</b> <b>intolerance,</b> either in Poland or abroad, as shown by the fate of the Racovian Academy, or an international disagreement between the faiths. Neither did he get involved with the disagreement about the Orthodox Cossacks, a group that he respected and counted on in his plans.|$|E
5|$|Other {{victims were}} college students, {{many of whom}} were {{expelled}} from their institutions and had their careers destroyed, academic teachers who tried to defend the students and the academic institutions themselves: Warsaw University had several departments administratively dissolved. Liberal intelligentsia members, Jewish or not, were removed from the government and other places of employment. Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left of their faith in the ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment <b>of</b> <b>intolerance</b> and hatred. The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomułka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which, early in his term, gave Gomułka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} how meta-worry and <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty {{relate to}} pathological worry, generalised anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, and depression. University students (n = 253) completed a questionnaire battery. A series of {{regression analyses were}} conducted. The results indicated that meta-worry was associated with GAD, social phobia, obsessive compulsive, and depressive symptoms. <b>Intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty was related to GAD, social phobia, and obsessive compulsive symptoms, but not depressive symptoms. The importance <b>of</b> meta-worry and <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty as predictors of pathological worry, GAD, social phobia, obsessive compulsive and depressive symptoms was also examined. Even though both factors significantly predicted the aforementioned symptoms, meta-worry emerged as a stronger predictor of GAD and obsessive compulsive symptoms than did <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty. <b>Intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, compared with meta-worry, appeared as a stronger predictor of social phobia symptoms. Findings emphasise the importance of addressing meta-worry and/or <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty {{not only for the}} assessment and treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), but also obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, and depression...|$|R

40|$|A 5 year, ten wave {{longitudinal}} study of 338 adolescents assessed the association between two forms <b>of</b> cognitive vulnerability (<b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty and fear of anxiety) and worry. Multilevel mediational analyses revealed a bidirectional and reciprocal relation between <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty and worry in which change in one variable partially explained change in the other. Fear of anxiety and worry also showed evidence of a bidirectional relation, although change in fear of anxiety had a much weaker mediational effect on change in worry than vice versa.

40|$|Cold {{intolerance}} is a well-recognized {{complication of}} crushing injuries and amputations in the hand. These symptoms are usually thought to resolve within 2  years of injury. The objectives {{of our study}} were to determine the prevalence and course over time of self-reported symptoms <b>of</b> cold <b>intolerance</b> in workers with hand injuries. Files from a large worker’s compensation carrier {{were randomly selected from}} index years  2, 4, 6, and 10 after a claim was made. Cohorts comprising cases with diagnostic codes corresponding to traumatic hand injuries and codes referring to non-trauma diagnoses in the hand were assembled for each of the years under consideration. A questionnaire was mailed to a total of 7, 088 asking questions related to the symptom <b>of</b> cold <b>intolerance.</b> Twenty-five percent <b>of</b> the surveys were returned. Over 90 % of trauma patients from all 4  years reported symptoms <b>of</b> cold <b>intolerance.</b> The rate <b>of</b> cold <b>intolerance</b> in the non-trauma group was between 59 % and 69 %.

In societies where lactose intolerance is the norm, it is not considered a condition that requires treatment. However, where dairy is a larger component of the normal diet, a number of efforts may be useful. There are four general principles in dealing with lactose intolerance: avoidance of dietary lactose, substitution to maintain nutrient intake, regulation of calcium intake, and use of enzyme substitute. Regular consumption of dairy food by lactase deficient individuals may also reduce symptoms <b>of</b> <b>intolerance</b> by promoting colonic bacteria adaptation.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} was to investigate the relationship between worry, <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, and fear of anxiety in a community sample of adolescents. Study 1 examined the association between adolescent worry, <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, and fear of anxiety (N = 258). The results showed that <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty and fear of anxiety were strongly, uniquely, and specifically related to adolescent worry above and beyond shared variance with gender, depression, and trait anxiety. The interaction between <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty and fear of anxiety did not significantly predict worry above their separate and unique effects. Study 2 sought to delineate the normative adolescent trajectories <b>of</b> worry, <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, and fear of anxiety over time, and explored the longitudinal nature of the associations between worry and <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, and between worry and fear of anxiety (N = 338). Data were collected from each participant twice a year for five years. The findings revealed modest, concave upward (i. e. U-shaped) trajectories for adolescent worry, <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, and fear of anxiety over the 10 assessment points. Gender differences in these trajectories were observed, with girls reporting more worry and fear of anxiety than boys across the study period. Unexpectedly, <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty increased between the midpoint and endpoint of the study for girls, but not for boys. Support was found for a bidirectional and reciprocal relationship between adolescent worry and <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, with change in one partially mediating change in the other, even when controlling for depression and trait anxiety. Conversely, adolescent worry and fear of anxiety showed a predominantly unidirectional relationship, with change in worry showing a stronger mediational effect on change in fear of anxiety than vice versa, a result which remained once the variance with depression and trait anxiety was partialled out. Overall, the findings highlight the important role of cognitive processes, such as <b>intolerance</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty and fear of anxiety, in our understanding of adolescent worry. These findings have important implications for our understanding of worry during this critical period of development...|$|R

Volumes II and III of Guardians had introductions by Arthur White, affirming his support for his mother's intolerant ideologies, primarily but not exclusively in regard to anti-Catholicism.
