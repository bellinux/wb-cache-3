40|$|The European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders (the guidelines) are an EU {{external}} relations policy tool providing European diplomats with <b>operational</b> <b>recommendations</b> {{to support and}} protect human rights defenders (HRDs) in third country missions, recognising the critical need to protect those working on the frontlines to ensure human rights obligations are enforced in their countries. Implementation of the guidelines by the EU and its member states has resulted in many good practice actions towards the support and protection of HRDs. However the guidelines’ recommendations are not systematically implemented by all European member states and implementation in EU mission {{countries around the world}} is patchy and inconsistent. This article considers EU commitments to effectively implement the guidelines policy tool in practice, including steps taken to integrate the guidelines’ <b>operational</b> <b>recommendations</b> within the relatively new process of planning EU Human Rights Country Strategies in mission countries. Drawing from a study for the European Parliament assessing implementation of the guidelines in Kyrgyzstan, Thailand and Tunisia, the author identifies key areas of stakeholders’ concerns, and argues for the need to link the EU’s efforts towards coherence in human rights policy with on-the-ground approaches towards the protection of HRDs in third countries...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at showing and {{understanding}} the spatial regional disparities hidden behind average national statistics on road fatalities in Europe; special attention is given on the EU last enlargement. The work is not limited on differences descriptions, but unveils what is hidden behind the observed infra-national heterogeneity in terms of road risk. It is indeed common practice to compare countries in terms of road safety performance and to rank {{them in terms of}} a risk indicator such as the mortality rate, which is often expressed by the number of fatalities due to road accidents per 100, 000 inhabitants. Some countries are known for their very bad risk records and are often pointed out by national or international authorities, without any understanding of the regional differences hidden behind a national mean value. The data analysis shows that changes in the level of spatial aggregation of the data produce significant differences in the variables describing the level of road safety, and hence in <b>operational</b> <b>recommendation</b> and conclusions. Beside the differences in national conditions and polices, the regional differences in road environment characteristics, traffic performance, road user mix, travel speeds, seat-belt use, and availability of emergency care have been major contributors to these variations. Road safety professionals and decision makers {{should be aware of the}} differences existing when trying to reduce road toll of the country in sustainable and cost-effective way. ...|$|R

40|$|The seller {{behavior}} and selling strategies in electronic marketplaces {{have not been}} well studied in literature. In this dissertation, we classify sellers into new sellers and experienced sellers according to their feedback scores. We find that new sellers have higher listing error rates, lower auction success rates, and lower auction prices than experienced sellers. New sellers are also less likely to receive positive feedback {{and more likely to}} receive negative feedback rates, more easily become frustrated by auction failure, and get more fraud claims and suspensions than experienced sellers. We also find that there are structural differences in auction success and price determinants between new sellers and experienced sellers and between new items and used items. Based on these findings, we classify online auctions into four segments and find that sellers in these segments behave significantly differently. We also find that signaling strategies are relatively more important for auction success than marketing strategies. The time series analysis shows that sellers learn only most recent completed auctions, and these completed auctions have more impact on experienced sellers than on new sellers. ^ In addition, the existing studies on selling strategies neither provided <b>operational</b> selling <b>recommendations</b> nor integrated multiple objectives of sellers. In this dissertation, we incorporate seller and product heterogeneity into our analytical framework and implement data mining analysis to explore <b>operational</b> selling <b>recommendations.</b> We use two data mining techniques, classification and regression tree (CART) and association analysis, to identify the critical factors along with their sequences for auction success and prices. We find different determinants for auction success and prices among these four auction segments. The CART also provides operational selling strategies. We propose that, by using expected auction prices with the classification and regression trees, sellers can integrate auction success with prices in their selling strategies. The association rules derived from the real business dataset provide useful tools for sellers to avoid auction failure and boost online transactions. Overall, this dissertation contributes to the literature by providing knowledge about seller {{behavior and}} effective selling strategies, which are essential for building effective and efficient electronic marketplaces. ...|$|R
