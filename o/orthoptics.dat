50|$|Various {{forms of}} visual therapy {{have been used}} for centuries. The concept of vision therapy was {{introduced}} {{in the late nineteenth century}} for the non-surgical treatment of strabismus. This early and traditional form of vision therapy was the foundation of what is now known as <b>orthoptics.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Orthoptics</b> has a {{long history}} in {{supporting}} ophthalmic care. French ophthalmologist Louis Emile Javal, began using ocular exercises to treat strabismus (wandering eye) and described the practice of <b>orthoptics</b> in his writings in the late 19th century. Mary Maddox pioneered the orthoptic profession and was the first documented orthoptist. She was trained by her father, Ernest E. Maddox, in response to increasing patient demand and time needed to examine and treat patients. Dr Ernest Maddox was a reputed ophthalmologist as well as the inventor of various instruments for investigating binocular vision. Mary Maddox started her own practice in London in the early 1920s and her first hospital clinic opened at the Royal Westminster Hospital in 1928. The first Australian hospital clinic with orthoptists was established at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne in 1931.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, most vision therapy is done by optometrists, while traditional <b>orthoptics</b> continues to be practiced by orthoptists and ophthalmologists. Based on assessments of claims and studies of published data, ophthalmologists claim that, except for near point of convergence exercises, vision therapy lacks documented evidence of effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|In 1972 she {{graduated}} as an Orthoptist from the NSW School of <b>Orthoptics.</b> During her orthoptic training, she met Fred Hollows, {{with whom she}} did {{a great deal of}} work treating Aboriginal Australians for a range of eye conditions including trachoma. Over a period of three years, they visited over 465 remote communities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orthoptics</b> aims {{to treat}} {{binocular}} vision {{disorders such as}} strabismus, and diplopia. Key factors involved include: Eye Movement Control, Simultaneous Focus at Far, Sustaining Focus at Far, Simultaneous Focus at Near, Sustaining Focus at Near, Simultaneous Alignment at Far, Sustaining Alignment at Far, Simultaneous Alignment at Near, Sustaining Alignment at Near, Central Vision (Visual Acuity) and Depth Awareness.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, {{particularly}} optometry, ophthalmology and <b>orthoptics,</b> refraction (also {{known as}} refractometry) is a clinical test {{in which a}} phoropter may {{be used by the}} appropriate eye care professional to determine the eye's refractive error and the best corrective lenses to be prescribed. A series of test lenses in graded optical powers or focal lengths are presented to determine which provides the sharpest, clearest vision.|$|E

50|$|These {{functions}} {{develop in}} early childhood. Some {{people who have}} strabismus disrupt the development of stereopsis, however <b>orthoptics</b> treatment {{can be used to}} improve binocular vision. A person's stereoacuity determines the minimum image disparity they can perceive as depth. It is believed that approximately 12% of people are unable to properly see 3D images, due to a variety of medical conditions. According to another experiment up to 30% of people have very weak stereoscopic vision preventing them from depth perception based on stereo disparity. This nullifies or greatly decreases immersion effects of stereo to them.|$|E

Other treatment may include wearing eye patches aimed at strengthening the weaker eye while inhibiting the stronger eye, an alternative to eye patches is the use of an opaque lens, other treatments may include eye drops to temporarily inhibit the stronger eye and at any age eye muscle surgery can be done to correct the muscular balance of the ocular muscles.|$|E

40|$|Intermittent exotropia [X(T) ] has various {{clinical}} aspects, such as {{the occurrence}} of strabismus {{despite the presence of}} underlying binocular single vision and postoperative recurrence. This paper discusses the <b>orthoptics</b> used in treating X(T) in order to reduce deviation. Typical X(T) recurred four years after strabismus surgery, although the binocular function was still maintained. In recurring cases with a deviation of 20 A X(T) or more, V-type exotropia recurred despite surgical recession of the inferior oblique muscle. In 23 patients that used Uchida color lenses after surgery, it was noted that squinting disappeared in more tban 93 % of the cases, and the angle of deviation decreased in 83 % of the patients. Botulinum therapy was administered in cases which showed surplus discharge from the lateral rectus muscle on EMG. As a result, exophoria was normalized in 6 (50 %) of 12 patients. From these results, it was concluded that because X(T) has various clinical aspects, careful planning for <b>orthoptics</b> is required...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground/aims Health related {{quality of}} life (HRQoL) {{measures}} are used in health care to help inform clinical decision-making and policy-making decisions. A number of disease-specific or condition-specific measures have been developed and applied in ophthalmology; however their use in the specific field of <b>orthoptics</b> is not as established. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify and discuss specific HRQoL instruments which may be used in the investigation and management of orthoptic patients. Methods A systematic literature review was undertaken in November 2009. The electronic databases of AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine: 1985 to November 2009); British Nursing Index and Archive (1985 to October 2009); Ovid Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations and Ovid Medline (1950 to present); and PsycINFO (1806 to November Week 1 2009) were searched. No language restrictions were applied to the search. Results Four instruments were identified; the Amblyopia and Strabismus Questionnaire (A&SQ), the Amblyopia Treatment Index (ATI); the Adult Strabismus Questionnaire (AS- 20) and the Intermittent Exotropia Questionnaire (IXTQ). Conclusion The use of HRQoL measures in <b>orthoptics</b> is a developing area.
