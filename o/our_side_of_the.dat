25|$|The theory {{contains}} only one half {{the explanation of}} man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on – man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine {{as well as a}} human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours – we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject. He can not go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.|$|E
2500|$|The Engineering Department also {{established}} an aircraft salvage and repair facility in Building B-1 to salvage, reclaim and repair crashed airplanes retrieved from the front. All aircraft engine installation {{was done by}} this department, however engines salvaged from crashed aircraft were {{turned over to the}} Engine Overhaul Shop. When an aircraft was damaged in combat, or would crash on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front line, a crew would be sent from the 1st Air Depot to dismantle the plane and bring it back to be repaired, if possible. [...] French aircraft were taken to Colombey, while American aircraft were sent to Romorantin. [...] Here if the aircraft could be repaired, it was, or it was placed on a salvage pile [...] where it could be cannibalized for usable parts.|$|E
2500|$|Grant {{was also}} {{concerned}} about the situation in neighboring Mexico, where 40,000 French soldiers propped up the puppet regime of Austrian Archduke Maximilian. He gave Sheridan permission to gather a large Texas occupation force. Sheridan assembled 50,000 men in three corps, quickly occupied Texas coastal cities, spread inland, and began to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border. The Army's presence, U.S. political pressure, and the growing resistance of Benito Juárez induced the French to abandon their claims against Mexico. Napoleon III withdrew his troops in 1866, and the following year Emperor Maximilian was executed for treason. Sheridan later admitted in his memoirs that he had supplied arms and ammunition to Juárez's forces: [...] "... which we left at convenient places on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river to fall into their hands".|$|E

60|$|YALLOBALLY RECORD.--"That incompetent shuffler, General Osbourne, {{has again}} put his foot into it.

"We must hope," [...] {{the colonel}} said, [...] "that Irish troops are not employed, {{only because it}} is {{intended}} that another expedition will sail to Ireland, in which case we may be sure {{that some of us}} will have an opportunity of fighting, again, on <b>our</b> own <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. Moreover, between France and Scotland there has long been a close connection and friendship, and <b>the</b> employment <b>of</b> French troops would, therefore, better suit the Scots than would be the case with Irishmen.

A force of Burgundians occupied Marguy; another was camped at Clairoix, a couple <b>of</b> miles above <b>the</b> raised road; and a body of English was holding Venette, {{a mile and a}} half below it.

6000|$|On page 13, {{pamphlet}} edition, {{speaking of}} [...] "a hairy veil" [...] over {{the eyes of}} a species of bison, the author says: [...] "It immediately occurred to the acute mind of Dr. Herschel that this was a providential contrivance to protect the eyes of the animal from the great extremes of light and darkness to which all the inhabitants of <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon are periodically subjected."

40|$|Providing heroin to heroin addicts {{taking part}} in medical trials to assess <b>the</b> {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug as a treatment alternative, breaches ethical research standards, some ethicists maintain.

In this article we therefore offer a fuller conception, one which allows for a more flexible, case-to-case approach in which some heroin addicts are considered capable of consenting voluntarily, others not.
