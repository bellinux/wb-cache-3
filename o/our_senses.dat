5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that {{the speed of light}} is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from <b>our</b> <b>senses.</b> Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.|$|E
5|$|Stratton saw humans not as {{machines}} {{to be analyzed}} mechanistically, but also as seating will, emotion and drives, all of which had to analyzed as scientifically as the traditional psychological concepts of sensation, perception and memory. He also believed in a supreme actuality behind the world registered by <b>our</b> <b>senses.</b> This was the theme of his last published book, Man-Creator or Destroyer, completed in 1952 when he was eighty-seven years old. His book Developing Mental Power was a foray into educational psychology, addressing the question of general versus specific training in terms teachers could understand and use. Stratton aimed at this goal via a simple and generally applicable look at the basic workings of mental life. John F. Dashiell, writing in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, found this a failure. Dashiell saw the path from the psychological concepts—emotion, intelligence, and will—to teaching methodology, not clearly described in the book. Stratton also applied psychological concepts {{to figure out how}} to avert war. He was optimistic it was possible to harness the creative and destructive facets of individuals to get nations to coexist peacefully. He saw nations as consisting of ethnicities and races which had to coexist in harmony. In line with the prevailing view in his field, he did not see the races as inherently equally intelligent.|$|E

25|$|Once one accepts The Matrix as a {{generated}} {{reality of}} malicious machines invention {{then this is}} Descartes' First Meditation, or evil demon, a hypothesis that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise {{can be found in}} Hilary Putnam's brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s. One can make a connection between the premise of The Matrix and Plato's Allegory of the Cave; once one accepts that The Matrix is an illusion, then the allegory of the cave becomes clear. The allegory is related to Plato's theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with <b>our</b> <b>senses,</b> but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.|$|E
25|$|Visual memory {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} perceptual processing and the encoding, storage and retrieval of the resulting neural representations. Visual memory occurs over a broad time range spanning from eye movements to years in order to visually navigate to a previously visited location. Visual memory {{is a form of}} memory which preserves some characteristics of <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> pertaining to visual experience. We are able to place in memory visual information which resembles objects, places, animals or people in a mental image. The experience of visual memory is also referred to as the mind's eye through which we can retrieve from our memory a mental image of original objects, places, animals or people. Visual memory is one of several cognitive systems, which are all interconnected parts that combine to form the human memory. Types of palinopsia, the persistence or recurrence of a visual image after the stimulus has been removed, is a dysfunction of visual memory.|$|E
25|$|Karl Popper {{tried to}} {{establish}} a criterion of demarcation between science and metaphysics, but the speculative turn taken by certain developments in theoretical physics has contributed to muddle the issue again. Mosterín has been concerned {{with the question of}} the reliability of theories and claims. He makes a distinction between the standard core of a scientific discipline, that at a certain point in time should only include relatively reliable and empirically supported ideas, and the cloud of speculative hypotheses surrounding it. Part of the theoretical progress consists in the incorporation of newly tested hypotheses of the cloud to the standard core. In this connection, he has analyzed epistemic notions like detection and observation. Observation, but not detection, is accompanied by awareness. Detection is always mediated by technological instruments, but observation only sometimes (like glasses in vision). The signals received by detectors have to be transduced into types of energy accessible to <b>our</b> <b>senses.</b> Following the path open by Patrick Suppes, Mosterín has paid much attention to the structure of metric concepts, because of their indispensable mediating role at the interface between theory and observation where reliability is tested. He has also made contributions to the study of mathematical modeling and of the limits of the axiomatic method in the characterization of real-world structures. The real world is extremely complex, and sometimes {{the best we can do}} is to apply the method of theoretical science: to pick up in the set-theoretical universe a mathematical structure with some formal similarities with the situation we are interested in, and use it as a model of that parcel of the world. Together with Roberto Torretti, Mosterín has written a uniquely comprehensive encyclopedic dictionary of logic and philosophy of science.|$|E

Thus the Forms are the really existing things. As models for the individual objects we sense, the Forms cause ordinary objects to appear the way they do and lend them some secondary [...] kind of existence.|$|E

2500|$|At a Fordham lecture in 1999, Tom Wolfe {{suggested}} that a major under-acknowledged influence on McLuhan's work is the Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin whose ideas anticipated those of McLuhan, especially {{the evolution of the}} human mind into the [...] "noosphere". In fact, McLuhan warns against outright dismissing or whole-heartedly accepting de Chardin's observations early on in his first published book The Mechanical Bride (p.32): [...] "This externalization of <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> creates what de Chardin calls the 'noosphere' or a technological brain for the world. Instead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as in an infantile piece of science fiction.

30|$|As the {{analysis}} mentioned in Section 3.1, {{to capture the}} discriminative spatio-temporal feature of the fall, it requires that the system can sense the time-varying HME of each sub-region. In <b>our</b> <b>sensing</b> model design, each sampling cell corresponds to a sub-region of the monitored region, and the PIR sensors are employed to capture the time-varying HME of these sampling cells. Therefore, <b>our</b> <b>sensing</b> model satisfies the design requirements. <b>Our</b> <b>sensing</b> model is an intrinsic non-isomorphic model, which means the number of PIR sensors M {{is less than the}} number of sampling cells L, and the measurement of each PIR sensor is a linear combination of the sampling cells [30]. However, its sensing efficiency is high, that is, it can robustly detect the fall by processing low-dimensional sensor data directly. The reason lies in that the <b>our</b> <b>sensing</b> model captures the most discriminative spatio-temporal feature of the fall by efficient spatial segmentation. In Section 5, we will elaborate the system implementation, and list the specification of the reference structure.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and discuss}} {{a notion of}} fuzzy uniform structure that provides a direct link with the classical theory of uniform spaces.

Moreover, we also describe the inverse functor and, then, we discuss completeness and completion of these fuzzy uniform structures. It follows from our results that each fuzzy uniform structure in <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> induces a Hutton [0, 1]-uniformity and, conversely, each Hutton [0, 1]-uniformity induces a fuzzy uniform structure in <b>our</b> <b>sense.</b> © 2009 Elsevier B.

2500|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{disagreed}} with his teacher, Plato, in several important respects.

2500|$|There are {{two kinds}} of knowing, the one he calls [...] "legitimate" [...] (γνησίη, gnēsiē, [...] "genuine") and the other [...] "bastard" [...] (σκοτίη, skotiē, [...] "secret"). The [...] "bastard" [...] {{knowledge}} is concerned with the perception through the senses; therefore it is insufficient and subjective. The reason is that the sensual perception is due to the effluences of the atoms from the objects to the senses. When these different shapes of atoms come to us, they stimulate <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> according to their shape, and our sensual impressions arise from those stimulations.|$|E
