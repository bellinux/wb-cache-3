30|$|The {{results of}} shift-share-analyses carried out suggest that nonstandard work {{arrangements}} have developed largely independently of {{shifts in the}} demographic and industry composition of employment. Thus, even without the increases in services, in women’s labour market participation, in aging and in skill levels, the trend of nonstandard work arrangements would have evolved roughly as it did. It is mainly increased rates of nonstandard work arrangements within certain industries and within demographic groups of the workforce that have driven the increased rates of nonstandard work arrangements. There are only few exemptions which indicate that shift effects have {{played an important role}} (industry change with respect to part-time employment) or at least a certain role (female labour market participation with respect to part-time employment; aging with respect to <b>one-person</b> <b>businesses</b> and with respect to fixed-term contracts; rise in skill levels with respect to fixed-term contracts).|$|R

With the purpose of addressing this void, we investigate the SOHO professionals' adoption patterns of multigenerational IT products. Accordingly, we develop and empirically estimate an individual SOHO-level initial- and repeat-purchase logit model that captures the procurement patterns for successive generations of technological products, namely the PC category. Specifically, we find that SOHO professionals' procurement choices are influenced by a number of salient dimensions (i. e., income, performance, price, interpurchase time, network externalities). Furthermore, some SOHO owners are found to have a preference for a future (expected) generation (over a currently available one), which is explained via their business dispositions (i. e., technology orientation, result orientation, search orientation) toward accepting technological incertitude.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades {{self-employment}} has gained in {{importance in the}} majority of EU Member States. In particular the proportion of small and <b>one-person</b> <b>businesses</b> shows an increasing trend. In contrast to the classical research into business start-ups, which usually focuses on sustainability {{in the sense of the}} longest possible survival of the enterprises, this paper determinedly goes into the dynamics and flexibility on the labour market of solo-self-employment. In the context of the theory of transitional labour markets, a mobility concept is developed and the dynamics of solo-self-employment in five European countries (Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Great Britain and Sweden) are compared on the basis of mobility rates and mobility patterns (inflows, outflows, durations). The analyses are based on data from the European Employment Sample (1993 - 2003) and the European Community Household Panel (1994 - 2001). The results of the analyses show a higher level of employment mobility of the solo-self-employed compared with other employment forms in all of the countries. Almost every year women show a higher rate of mobility than men in all of the countries. Solo-self-employment also concerns far more people over time than the aggregate data for individual years show at first sight. In the country comparison Germany shows the highest mobility rate of solo-self-employed people (since 1996). Finally the paper looks at the institutional protection of mobility and transitions, which differs from country to country. Taking the state pension insurance systems as an example, the paper shows that with regard to social security law, changes in employment status into and out of solo-self-employment are associated with more or less serious specific disadvantages in all of the countries observed. In Germany, the country with the highest mobility rate of solo-self-employed people, these disadvantages are particularly clear. In the sense of the concept of risk management, the strategy of a European social policy should focus on being able to guarantee a minimum of continuous basic protection despite discontinuous employment histories. Depending on the way that the social security systems are organised nationally, there is in this respect a more or less urgent need for action.

It is observed that the designers of complex games refuse to take sufficiently into account the imposed limitations. Seven design problems are identified and examples of these problems in actual games are given, including ways of solving them. Consequently we propose a list of five design rules which may alleviate the problems. Finally, we conclude that now the time is ripe for <b>one-person</b> Palm game <b>businesses.</b> We expect this to last only a few years...|$|R
40|$|This report {{examines}} {{what factors}} could support the empirically emerging {{dynamics of the}} change in employment forms. The 'regular employment relationship' is frequently criticised as being overregulated, and the solution to the current labour market problems is seen in more flexibility concerning the arrangement of employment relationships. A differentiated view of labour market regulations, taking into account both legal and economic aspects, reveals many different ambivalences and conflicts of aims. An economic justification for restrictions in contractual freedom is therefore seen in the necessity to correct market failure due to distribution and allocation. However, employment law can also become the cause of policy failure. The empirical development - on the basis of evaluations of the microcensus - documents that movement has entered the employment structure since the mid- 1980 s. Regular employment relationships, defined as employment contracts of white- and blue-collar workers in full-time permanent employment excluding agency workers, have become less significant in particular in the 1990 s (1990 / 1995 from 59 % to 56. 2 % of the whole working population) at the expense of part-time work and self-employment (excluding agriculture). Restructuring of significance in quantitative terms to fixed-term full-time employment or temporary agency work has not occurred so far. In contrast, other differentiations have increased, for example {{in the form of a}} greater significance of <b>one-person</b> <b>businesses</b> or marginal part-time employment. In the new Länder in the mid- 1990 s the employment structures still differed clearly from those in western Germany: regular employment relationships carried relatively more weight, whereas part-time work and forms of self-employment showed accordingly lower shares. On the whole the regular employment relationship so far remains by far the most common form of employment. The identification of possible determinants of the empirically emerging change in employment forms does not only help to analyse the development in the past, but also provides indications concerning a possible future development that could lead to approaches in labour market prognosis. According to shift analyses, sectoral and gender-specific changes in the employment structure explain the change in employment forms to only a small extent, it is more the case that causes which are independent of this predominate. Initial qualitative considerations are made about some further factors which influence the choice of an employment form. The report includes discussion of the effect of changes in legal regulations (e. g. the deregulation initiatives under way since 1985), in company personnel policy and in the supply behaviour of workers (e. g. due to the level of and changes in labour costs as well as earned income and transfer incomes) and finally the influence of the particular labour market situation (e. g. of unemployment as a 'push factor'). On the basis of the previous findings and considerations two scenarios seem to be conceivable for the change in employment forms: (1) increasing loss of importance of the regular employment relationship (as a result of an even wider variety of employment forms), (2) reform of the regular employment relationship (e. g. by lowering social insurance contributions) resulting in the slowing down of signs of disintegration. It is not yet possible to predict today which of the two scenarios will become established in the future labour market reality. It seems to be clear, however, that policy and the social partners have creative scope and are able to influence development processes.
