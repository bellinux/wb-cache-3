5|$|Casualties {{during the}} {{fighting}} around Isurava have been variously reported. In the immediate post war era, Australian sources tended {{to report a}} ratio of around five Japanese killed for every one Australian, with the Australians estimating that they had killed around 700 Japanese; however, in recent times this has been revised. The Japanese also initially <b>over-estimated</b> the casualties they inflicted on the Australians, claiming 1,000 killed, before reducing this to 300. It is now thought that the casualties were more even, although still favouring the Australians. For the Australians, casualties are now reported as 99 killed and 111 wounded while the Japanese {{are thought to have}} lost 140 killed and 231 wounded.|$|E

500|$|The {{gigantic}} {{proportions of}} A. fragillimus have been debated by paleontologists. Carpenter {{has argued that}} {{there is every reason}} to take Cope at his word, noting that the paleontologist's reputation was at stake. The discovery took place during the Bone Wars, and Cope's rival Marsh, who was [...] "ever ready to humiliate" [...] Cope, never called the claims into question. Marsh was known to have employed spies to monitor Cope's discoveries, and may have even had confirmation of the enormous size of the Amphicoelias fragillimus bones. Paleontologists Henry Fairfield Osborn and C.C. Mook in 1921, as well as John S. McIntosh in 1998, also accepted Cope's data without question in published reviews. Other paleontologists have been more critical. In an analysis of the evidence and circumstances surrounding the publication and interpretation of A. fragillimus, Woodruff and Foster (2015) concluded that its size has been <b>over-estimated</b> and that modern palaeontologists were accepting Cope's interpretation without due scepticism. They note that no comparably gigantic sauropod fossils have been discovered in the Morrison Formation or elsewhere, that 19th century palaeontologists - including Cope himself - paid no attention to the size of A. fragillimus (even when it may have substantiated Cope's Rule of size increase in animal lineages over time), and that typographical errors in his measurements - such as reporting vertebral measurements in meters rather than millimeters - undermine their reliability. They concluded that the super-gigantic A. fragillimus is a 'highly unlikely' creature based on unquestioning interpretation of Cope's report.|$|E

[...] The War Cabinet had dealt an [...] "irreparable blow to Jewish Britons", wrote Montagu. [...] Curzon's memo was mainly {{concerned}} by the non-Jews in Palestine to secure their civil rights. [...] Worldwide there were 12 million Jews, and about 365,000 in Palestine by 1932. [...] Cabinet ministers were worried about Germany playing the Zionist card. [...] If the Germans were in control, it would hasten support for Turkey, and collapse of Kerensky's government. [...] Curzon went on towards an advanced Imperial view: that since most Jews had Zionist views, it was as well to support these majority voices. [...] "If {{we could make a}} declaration favourable to such an ideal {{we should be able to}} carry on extremely useful propaganda." [...] Weizmann [...] "was absolutely loyal to Great Britain". The Zionists had been approached by the Germans, Weizmann told William Ormsby-Gore. [...] But the British miscalculated the effects of immigration to Palestine, and <b>over-estimated</b> German control over Turkey. [...] The Turks were in no position to prevent movement. [...] Sykes reported the Declaration to Weizmann with elation all round: [...] he repeated [...] "mazel tov" [...] over and over. [...] The Entente had fulfilled its commitment to both Sharif Husein and Chaim Weizmann The Arab Revolt threatened to upset the apple cart.

40|$|Markov random fields (MRFs) are {{difficult}} to evaluate as generative models because comput-ing the test log-probabilities requires the in-tractable partition function. Annealed impor-tance sampling (AIS) is widely used to estimate MRF partition functions, and often yields quite accurate results. However, AIS is prone to <b>over-estimate</b> the log-likelihood with little indication that anything is wrong. We present the Re-verse AIS Estimator (RAISE), a stochastic lower bound on the log-likelihood of an approximation to the original MRF model. RAISE requires only the same MCMC transition operators as standard AIS. Experimental results indicate that RAISE agrees closely with AIS log-probability estimates for RBMs, DBMs, and DBNs, but typically errs {{on the side of}} underestimating, rather than <b>over-estimating,</b> the log-likelihood. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a novel model-based technique, the Delphi algorithm, for {{inferring}} the instantaneous volume of competing cross-traffic across an end-to-end path.

Unique to the algorithm is an efficient exponentially spaced probing packet train and a parsimonious multifractal parametric model for the cross-traffic that captures its multiscale statistical properties (including long-range dependence) and queuing behavior. The algorithm is adaptive; it requires no a priori traffic statistics and effectively tracks changes in network conditions. ns (network simulator) experiments reveal that Delphi gives accurate cross-traffic estimates for higher link utilization levels while at lower utilizations it <b>over-estimates</b> the cross-traffic. Also, when Delphi's single bottleneck assumption does not hold it <b>over-estimates</b> the crosstraffic...|$|R
