40|$|Context: Alloys {{have been}} {{considered}} to be of paramount importance {{in the field of}} prosthodontics. Long span prosthesis may often require joining of one or more individual castings to obtain better fit, occlusal harmony and esthetics in comparison to <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting.</b> Aim: This study was undertaken to evaluate the mechanical properties of base metal alloys joined by two different techniques, namely, gas oxygen torch soldering and laser fusion, compared to a <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting.</b> Mechanical properties evaluated were tensile strength, percentage of elongation and hardness of the solder joint. In addition, corrosion properties and scanning electron microscopic appearance of the joints were also evaluated. Materials and Methods: The samples were prepared according to American Society for Testing Materials specifications (ASTM, E 8). Specimens were made with self-cure acrylic and then invested in phosphate-bonded investment material. Casting was done in induction casting machine. Thirty specimens were thus prepared for each group and compared with 30 specimens of the <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting</b> group. Statistical Analysis Used: SPSS software (version 10. 0, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. ANOVA and Benferroni post hoc tests were done for multiple comparisons between the groups and within the groups for mean difference and standard error. Results: Results showed that tensile strength of the <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting</b> was higher than laser fused and gas oxygen torch soldered joints. Laser fused joints exhibited higher hardness values compared to that of gas oxygen torch soldered joints. Scanning electron microscopic examination revealed greater porosity in the gas oxygen torch soldered joints. This contributed to the reduction in the strength of the joint. Gas oxygen torch soldered joints showed less corrosion resistance when compared to laser fused joints and <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting.</b> Conclusion: Laser fusion, which is a recent introduction to the field of prosthodontics, produces joints which have properties between those of <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting</b> and the gas oxygen torch soldering...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the passivity by measuring the passive fit and strain development of frameworks screwed on abutments, made by CAD/CAM technology, and to compare these parts with samples manufactured by conventional casting. Using CAD/CAM technology, four samples were made from zirconia (Zircad) and four samples were manufactured from cobalt-chrome (CoCrcad). The control groups were four specimens of cobalt-chrome, made by <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting</b> (CoCrci), with a total of 12 frameworks. To evaluate the passive fit, the vertical misfit at the abutment-framework interface was measured with scanning electron microscopy (250 &# 215;) when only one screw was tightened. The mean strain in these frameworks was analyzed by photoelasticity test. A significant difference in the passive fit was observed between the control and sample groups. CoCrcad exhibited the best value of passive fit (48. 76 &# 177; 13. 45 &# 181;m) and CoCrci the worst (187. 55 &# 177; 103. 63 &# 181;m); Zircad presented an intermediate value (103. 81 &# 177; 43. 15 &# 181;m). When compared to the other groups, CoCrci showed the highest average stress around the implants (17. 19 &# 177; 7. 22 kPa). It was concluded that CAD/CAM-fabricated frameworks exhibited better passivity compared with conventionally fabricated frameworks. CAD/CAM-fabricated Co-Cr frameworks may exhibit better passive fit compared with CAD/CAM-fabricated zirconia frameworks. Even so, similar levels of stress were achieved for CAD/CAM-fabricated frameworks...|$|R

50|$|Most bombards {{started with}} the {{construction}} of a wooden core surrounded by iron bars. Then, iron hoops were driven over these bars in order to surround and cover them.

40|$|Different {{protocols}} {{have been}} developed in case of immediate loading for a full arch replacement. Several reports show that a syncrystallization - welded framework exhibits a more precise fit than a <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting.</b> The intra-olral syncrystallization welding technology can not only create a passive-fitting implant prosthesis, but also pre-fabricate implant components, including titanium bars and attachments, and can be syncrysallization-assembled directly on the master cast. This article describes a technique developed to fabricate an immediately loaded prosthesis using syncrysallization a new component for welding a passive-fitting implant prosthesis. The aim {{of this article was}} to describe a technique developed for an accelerated rigid splinting of multiple implants for same-day immediate loading with metal-reinforced provisional restorations using a technique of welding temporary implant abutments with a prefabricated titanium connection tab directly performed in the oral cavity. Between June 2009 and July 2011, immediate loading of threaded implants with a metal- reinforced acrylic resin provisional restoration at stage 1 surgery was evaluated in 22 consecutive patients. A total of 232 implants were placed in selected edentulous patients using the syncrystallization technique. All of the 232 rigidly temporized immediately loaded implants were osseointegrated. An implant success rate of 100 % was achieved over a period of 6 months postplacement. No fracture or luting cement failure of the provisional restoration occurred during the observation time. The technique allows for a highly accurate, passively fitting prosthesis in only 6 hours with excellent patient satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Statement of the problem: Conventional {{techniques}} for implant framework fabrication {{have been shown}} to produce errors that are inconsistent with the passive-fit requirement for osseointegrated implant frameworks. Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the three-dimensional distortion inherent in casting of full arch, screw-retained titanium implant frameworks. Materials and methods: A conventional commercial laboratory <b>one-piece</b> <b>casting,</b> using the lost-wax technique was used. Five wax patterns were fabricated on a die-stone cast poured from a plaster impression of a five-fixture brass analogue. A reflex microscope was used to determine the three-dimensional casting error, by measuring horizontal and vertical distances for each wax pattern and its corresponding cast titanium framework, as well as offset distances from the horizontal reference plane. Results: Significant differences were found in the amount of distortion between wax patterns and cast frameworks, with the castings being approximately 416 μm to 477 μm larger than the wax frameworks. The greatest amount of distortion occurred at the terminal implant abutments, and in the vertical dimension. However, there was inconsistency in these differences, indicating the three-dimensional nature of the overall distortion of the cast frameworks. Conclusions: It is doubtful whether any conventionally cast framework can be made to the degree of accuracy required to fit passively on its abutments because of the multiple variables inherent in this process. It is therefore recommended that all full-arch, cast titanium frameworks be cast in sections, or alternatively be sectioned, indexed and soldered before being seated intraorally...|$|R
