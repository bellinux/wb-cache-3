40|$|The {{effects of}} two {{different}} types and five levels of oil on some physical and chemical characteristics of sediments and plants were investigated in four mangrove species under field conditions. The sediments in which four mangrove species (Rhizophora stylosa, Rhizophora mucronata, Ceriops tagal and Avicennia marina) were growing, were treated with Kuwait Crude Oil (KCO) and North West Shelf Condensate (NWSC) at application rates of 0, 1375, 2750, 5500 and 11 000 g m- 2. The effects varied with species. The <b>oil</b> <b>treatments</b> usually increased concentrations of most nutrient elements in R. stylosa and R. mucronata, had mixed effects on C. tagal and mostly decreased concentrations in A. marina. KCO significantly decreased concentrations of every element examined in A. marina. The effects on sediments also varied with oil type. NWSC decreased concentrations of {{about half of the}} elements tested in the sediments and had no significant effect the others. In contrast, KCO increased concentrations of about half of the elements tested in the sediments and had no significant effect on most of the others. The concentrations of hydrocarbons in leaves increased with increasing oil application to the sediments, but the effects varied in the different species. A. marina accumulated between two and six times more hydrocarbons in leaves than the other species. The concentration of hydrocarbons in sediments treated with NWSC decreased by about an order of magnitude in the 24 weeks after application, but the rate of decrease was less for KCO than for NWSC. Sediment pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, redox potential and the salinity of interstitial water were decreased by <b>oil</b> <b>treatments,</b> causing the <b>oiled</b> sediments to become poorly oxygenated with strongly reducing conditions. It was concluded that these experimental <b>oil</b> <b>treatments</b> in the field caused changes in sediment characteristics and uptake of oil components by mangroves, depending on the characteristics of the oil and the mangrove species...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the effect of fatty acid chain length and {{quantity}} on the bioavailability of calcium. Thirteen healthy subjects were randomly assigned to a series of 5 test meals containing varying types and levels of fat and calciumconsumed over a three week time period. The test meals included 10 grams MCT oil (MCT 10), 20 grams MCT oil (MCT 20), 10 grams beef fat (BT 10), 20 grams beef fat (BT 20), and calcium only (Ca). Calcium absorption was assessed using timed urine collections following a specified calcium load. Three day food records were obtained to assess typical nutrient intakes of the subjects coming into and during the study. MCT oil provided better absorption of the calcium supplement than did the beef tallow. A difference was also noted in the absorption of calcium based on the amount of fat consumed. A higher intake of MCT oil (10 g vs. 20 g) appeared to favor the absorption of calcium. Urine calcium excretion was significantly greater (p <. 009) during the MCT <b>oil</b> <b>treatments</b> (MCT 10, MCT 20) compared to the beef fat treatments (BT 10, BT 20), suggesting reduced calcium absorption during the beef fat treatments. There were no differences in mean calcium excretion based on quantity of fat consumed (10 g vs. 20 g), nor any interaction between type of fat and amount. Tests for detecting differences between individual treatments indicated a significance difference (p <. 05) in calcium excretion between MCT 20 and BT 10 treatments. Urine calcium excretion was corrected for body size using urine calcium/creatinine ratio (Ca/Cr). There was a significant time effect between the 0 - 2, 2 - 4 hour time periods (p <. 005) and the various treatments for Ca/Cr. Though not significant, mean Ca/Cr was highest for the calcium treatment (0. 42), compared to the MCT <b>oil</b> <b>treatments</b> (36, z of MCT 10 & MCT 20), and beef fat treatments (28, x of BT 10 & BT 20).
