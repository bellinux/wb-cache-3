50|$|While the Wattle class craft were {{scheduled}} to be disposed of in 1997, they were transferred to DMS Maritime instead. As of 2007, all three remained in service, with Wattle being located at Darwin {{and the other two}} craft at Sydney. Their main role is to transport ammunition and other stores for the RAN, though they {{can also be used to}} control oil spills or tow <b>other</b> <b>lighters.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{consequence}} of the windproofing {{is that it is}} hard to extinguish a Zippo by blowing out the flame. However, if the flame is blown from the top down, it will be easily extinguished. The proper way to extinguish the lighter is to close the top half, which starves the flame of oxygen, but unlike <b>other</b> <b>lighters,</b> this does not cut the fuel. One of the recognizable features of Zippo is the fact that it burns with a wick. Opening the top lid produces an easily recognizable [...] "clink" [...] sound for which Zippo lighters are known, and a different but similarly recognizable [...] "clunk" [...] when the lighter is closed. This noise is produced by the spring-loaded toggling cam, a little lever that keeps the lid closed or opened securely.|$|E
50|$|The {{short film}} took {{four and a}} half years, on and off, to create. Originally, Acker wanted to make it as stop motion, but then went for CGI when realizing it would have turned out too expensive. He used Maya 1.5 - 5.5 for 3D modeling, Photoshop for the textures, After Effects for compositing, and Premiere for editing. There are homages to Acker's {{influences}} like Brothers Quay and Pixar placed throughout. Most of it was rendered at 720x540 pixels on a three-computer dual-processor render farm. For distribution at film festivals like Sundance, Rhythm and Hues Studios offered to print the short film to 35mm using their film printer and image resizing techniques. The credits show that beyond Acker, there were five other animators and three <b>other</b> <b>lighters</b> that worked on the film. The music was provided by Eric Olsen and his band the Earganic.|$|E
5000|$|The fuel-saturated striker/wick {{assembly}} is unscrewed to remove, {{and scratched}} against a flint {{on the side}} of the case to create a spark. Its concealed wick catches fire, resembling a match. The flame is extinguished by screwing the [...] "match" [...] back into the shell, where it absorbs fuel for the next use. An advantage over <b>other</b> naphtha <b>lighters</b> is that the fuel compartment is sealed shut with a rubber o-ring, which slows or stops fuel evaporation.|$|R

40|$|WO 2005039844 A UPAB: 20050608 NOVELTY - Lightweight {{components}} are extruded from a composite material containing a thermoplastic reinforced with wood fibers 2 to 20 mm long with an aspect ratio greater than 5. The fibers are {{obtained from a}} thermo-mechanical refiner method and are initially blended with a thermoplastic under controlled heating. With increasing friction the final temperature is increased rapidly to 150 to 180 deg. C to coat the fibers while retaining their length. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - After cooling, the fiber aggregate is {{in a form that}} can be poured. It is then fed to an extruder, which is arranged to give as little shear as possible to maintain the fiber length, to produce the final shape. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) A light-weight building section made in this way, e. g. with a surface weight 2 to 5 kg/m 2 and rib thickness of 2 to 4 mm; (2) The use of wood fibers 2 to 20 mm long with an aspect ratio greater than 5 obtained by a thermo-mechanical refiner process in lightweight building components. USE - Extruded lightweight composite component, e. g. decking for building construction. ADVANTAGE - Improved mechanical properties compared with composites using wood fibers from <b>other</b> sources. <b>Lighter</b> than glass fiber reinforced composite...|$|R
40|$|Background. Foreign {{bodies in}} the {{gastrointestinal}} tract are important morbid and mortal clinical conditions. Particularly, emergency treatment is required for cutting and drilling bodies. The majority of ingested foreign bodies (80 – 90 %) leave gastrointestinal tract without creating problems. In 10 – 20 % of cases, intervention is absolutely required. Less than 1 % of cases need surgery. In this paper, we present a schizophrenia patient who swallowed multiple lighters. Case. A 21 -year-old male schizophrenic patient who uses psychotic drugs presented to the emergency department with the complaints of abdominal pain, severe vomiting, and inability to swallow for a week. His physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness. A plain radiograph of the abdomen revealed multiple tiny metallic densities. Gastroscopy was performed. The lighters were not allowing the passage, {{and some of them}} had penetrated the gastric mucosa, and bezoars were observed. One lighter was extracted {{with the help of the}} polypectomy snare. <b>Other</b> <b>lighters</b> as a bezoar were removed by surgery. Conclusion. Excessive vomiting of swallowed foreign {{bodies in the}} etiology of psychotic patients should be kept in mind. Endoscopic therapy can be performed in the early stages in these patients, but in the late stage surgery is inevitable...|$|E
5|$|Astatine's {{alpha decay}} {{energies}} {{follow the same}} trend as for <b>other</b> heavy elements. <b>Lighter</b> astatine isotopes have quite high energies of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, {{because it has a}} nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a magic number corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1hours for astatine-210 and 7.2hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%. The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope. Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, because of the increasing role of beta decay (electron emission). This decay mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay. Beta decay modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine-213, -214, -215, and -216m. Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay (positron emission), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes electron capture.|$|R
60|$|A small flame {{appeared}} burning quite straight. It showed fragmentarily the stout {{ribs and}} planking in the hollow, empty {{part of the}} lighter. Decoud could see Nostromo standing up to pull. He saw him {{as high as the}} red sash on his waist, with a gleam of a white-handled revolver and the wooden haft of a long knife protruding on his left side. Decoud nerved himself for the effort of rowing. Certainly there was not enough wind to blow the candle out, but its flame swayed a little to the slow movement of the heavy boat. It was so big that with their utmost efforts they could not move it quicker than about a mile an hour. This was sufficient, however, to sweep them amongst the Isabels long before daylight came. There was a good six hours of darkness before them, and the distance from the harbour to the Great Isabel did not exceed two miles. Decoud put this heavy toil to the account of the Capataz's impatience. Sometimes they paused, and then strained their ears to hear the boat from Esmeralda. In this perfect quietness a steamer moving would have been heard from far off. As to seeing anything it was out of the question. They could not see each <b>other.</b> Even the <b>lighter's</b> sail, which remained set, was invisible. Very often they rested.|$|R

The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the highest amount of energy of all astatine isotopes. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope. Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists; this happens due to the increasing role of beta decay.

Among other isotopes: astatine-210 and the lighter isotopes decay by positron emission); astatine-216 and the heavier isotopes undergo beta decay; astatine-212 decays via either ways; and astatine-211 decays by electron capture instead.|$|R
500|$|Lara Croft's {{likeness}} {{has been}} a model for merchandise. The first action figures were produced by Toy Biz, based on the video game version of the character. Playmates Toys released a series of action figures that depict Croft in different outfits and accessories from the video games, later producing figures modelled after Jolie for Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. Graphic designer Marc Klinnert of Studio OXMOX released [...] scale model kits of the character, and later built a full-scale version. Arcade: The Videogame Magazine and PlayStation Magazine promoted life-size Croft statues as contest prizes. Spurred by a rumour that Eidos provided Lara Croft autographs, fans wrote to the company to obtain them. The quantity prompted Eidos to quickly produce autographed cards to meet demand. Tomb Raider: Underworld themes and wallpapers featuring the character were released for the PlayStation 3. Xbox Live Marketplace released Xbox 360 avatars in conjunction with Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. Eidos released a brand of Lara Croft apparel and accessories, marketed under the label [...] "LARA". The line included wallets, watches, bathrobes, and Zippo <b>lighters.</b> <b>Other</b> third-party apparel are hiking boots, backpacks, leather jackets, and thermoses. Croft's likeness has also appeared on French postage stamps, PlayStation memory cards, and trading cards {{as part of a}} collectible card game. In October 1997, Eidos held an art exhibition titled [...] "Lara Goes Art" [...] in Hamburg, Germany to promote Tomb Raider II. The exhibit featured selected artwork of the character submitted by artists and fans. Pieces included oil and airbrushed paintings, photo comics, and Klinnert's model; SZM Studios provided the computer-generated footage it had created for Die Ärzte's music video and the Brigitte magazine television commercial.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} pertinent design {{practices of}} selecting types of monitors, monitor unit placement, setpoint selection, and maintenance considerations for gas monitors. While hydrogen gas monitors and enriched oxygen atmosphere monitors {{as they would}} be needed for hydrogen production experiments are {{the primary focus of}} this paper, monitors for carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are also discussed. The experiences of designing, installing, and calibrating gas monitors for a laboratory where experiments in support of the DOE Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative (NHI) are described along with codes, standards, and regulations for these monitors. Information from the literature about best operating practices is also presented. The NHI program has two types of activities. The first, near-term activity is laboratory and pilot-plant experimentation with different processes in the kilogram per day scale to select the most promising types of processes for future applications of hydrogen production. Prudent design calls for indoor gas monitors to sense any hydrogen leaks within these laboratory rooms. The second, longer-term activity is the prototype, or large-scale plants to produce tons of hydrogen per day. These large, outdoor production plants will require area (or “fencepost”) monitoring of hydrogen gas leaks. Some processes will have oxygen production with hydrogen production, and any oxygen releases are also safety concerns since oxygen gas is the strongest oxidizer. Monitoring of these gases is important for personnel safety of both indoor and outdoor experiments. There is some guidance available about proper placement of monitors. The fixed point, stationary monitor can only function if the intruding gas contacts the monitor. Therefore, monitor placement is vital to proper monitoring of the room or area. Factors in sensor location selection include: indoor or outdoor site, the location and nature of potential vapor/gas sources, chemical and physical data of the gases or vapors, liquids with volatility need sensors near the potential sources of release, nature and concentration of gas releases, natural and mechanical ventilation, detector installation locations not vulnerable to mechanical or water damage from normal operations, and locations that lend themselves to convenient maintenance and calibration. The guidance also states that sensors should be located in all areas where hazardous accumulations of gas may occur. Such areas might not be close to release points but might be areas with restricted air movement. Heavier than air gases are likely to accumulate in pits, trenches, drains, and <b>other</b> low areas. <b>Lighter</b> than air gases are more likely to accumulate in overhead spaces, above drop ceilings, etc. In general, sensors should be located close to any potential sources of major release of gas. The paper gives data on monitor sensitivity and expected lifetimes to support the monitor selection process. Proper selection of indoor and outdoor locations for monitors is described, accounting for the vapor densities of hydrogen and oxygen. The latest information on monitor alarm setpoint selection is presented. Typically, monitors require recalibration at least every six months, or more frequently for inhospitable locations, so ready access to the monitors is an important issue to consider in monitor siting. Gas monitors, depending on their type, can be susceptible to blockages of the detector element (i. e., du...|$|R
