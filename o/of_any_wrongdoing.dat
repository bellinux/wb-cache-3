5|$|Born in Sylvan Lake, New York, {{he played}} {{organized}} baseball {{from the time}} that he was a child, from playing in the local sandlots to the semi-professional Actives of Wappingers Falls, New York. On July 7, , while running the bases, he collided at home plate with a catcher, named Johnny Quigley, of the Clippers of Harlem. Quigley was knocked unconscious, having suffered a traumatic head injury, and later died from these injuries on August 12. The 19-year-old Brouthers was cleared <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> by the authorities.|$|E
5|$|Davidson's later {{career as}} a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His {{attempts}} at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles {{that he had not}} been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing,</b> and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and that he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.|$|E
50|$|Bannon {{remained}} as Premier during three inquiries, {{the last two}} of which cleared him <b>of</b> <b>any</b> deliberate <b>wrongdoing.</b>|$|R

50|$|Ramsaroop {{returned}} to Guyana in 2004 {{after the company}} he founded was acquired. He then founded a political party contesting the Guyana presidential election in 2011. Ramsaroop was a fierce opposition candidate to the government. In 2010 during his campaign for the Presidency, he was accused by a tenant of having cameras {{in one of his}} real estate buildings. This was later categorized as a political scandal since no evidence was found <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoings.</b> The Chief Justice of Guyana ordered the police to stop the investigations and return the equipment they had seized.|$|R
5|$|Former McKinsey senior executives, Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, {{were among}} those convicted in a {{government}} investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with Galleon Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam. Though McKinsey was not accused <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing,</b> the convictions were embarrassing for the firm, since it prides itself for integrity and client confidentiality. Following the initial allegations McKinsey no longer maintains a relationship with either senior partner, though {{the manner in which}} it severed ties attracted controversy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{series of the}} 1924 season, the Giants were playing the Philadelphia Phillies at the Polo Grounds and battling for the pennant with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Jimmy O'Connell offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 to {{intentionally}} lose the games. Sand rejected the bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It {{eventually led to the}} lifetime suspension of O'Connell and Giants coach Cozy Dolan by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. O'Connell implicated Kelly, Frankie Frisch, and Ross Youngs as co-conspirators. However, Commissioner Landis cleared Kelly, Frisch and Youngs <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Now in {{possession}} of the Royal Navy, President and her crew were ordered to proceed to Bermuda with Endymion. During the journey, they encountered a dangerous gale. The storm destroyed Presidents masts and strained Endymions timbers so badly that all the upper-deck guns were thrown overboard to prevent her from sinking. Decatur and his crew were briefly held prisoner in Bermuda. Upon the prisoners' return to the United States, a U.S. Navy court martial board acquitted Decatur, his officers, and his men <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> in the surrender of President.|$|E
50|$|Following 'errors' {{found in}} his expense reports, he {{resigned}} all portfolio positions in February 2010. He was reinstated to his ministerial portfolios the following month after a report which cleared him <b>of</b> <b>any</b> deliberate <b>wrongdoing.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 2012, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) {{appointed}} by the Indian Supreme Court found no [...] "prosecutable evidence" [...] against Modi. The Supreme Court of India absolved Narendra Modi <b>of</b> <b>any</b> criminal <b>wrongdoing</b> during the 2002 Gujarat riots.|$|R
50|$|She {{resigned}} {{these roles}} after a controversy surrounding her claims for a residential allowance, {{although she was}} later cleared <b>of</b> <b>any</b> deliberate <b>wrongdoing.</b> When the Alliance began to collapse in 2002, Bunkle sided with Jim Anderton's faction, but decided not to seek re-election.|$|R
5|$|Some contemporaries {{alleged that}} Bonaparte was put {{under house arrest}} at Nice for his {{association}} with the Robespierres following their fall in the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794, but Napoleon's secretary Bourrienne disputed the allegation in his memoirs. According to Bourrienne, jealousy was responsible, between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy (with whom Napoleon was seconded at the time). Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defense {{in a letter to}} the commissar Saliceti, and he was subsequently acquitted <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Giro {{featured}} {{an assortment}} of contenders for the overall victory. Defending champion Danilo Di Luca had faced potential bans which would have {{kept him out of}} the race, after investigations into his involvement with the Oil for Drugs scandal and an irregular doping test given after stage 17 of the 2007 Giro d'Italia, either of which could have resulted in a two-year suspension. Though he was suspended for three months because of Oil for Drugs, he was cleared by the Italian National Olympic Committee <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> in the 2007 Giro, and was thus permitted to start.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} {{context of the}} event, coupled {{with a variety of}} curious circumstances (for instance, the Russian agent Kim Philby was head of counter-intelligence for MI6 in Gibaltar at the time), immediately gave rise to numerous speculation that Sikorski's death had been no accident, and may have been the direct result of a Soviet, British, or even Polish conspiracy. Some modern sources note that the accident is not fully explained However, as Roman Wapiński noted in his biographical entry on Sikorski in the Polish Biographical Dictionary in 1997, no conclusive evidence <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> has been found, and Sikorski's official cause of death is listed as an accident.|$|E
50|$|The Army-McCarthy {{hearings}} absolved McCarthy <b>of</b> <b>any</b> direct <b>wrongdoing,</b> blaming Cohn alone. The {{exposure of}} McCarthy and his methods before a television audience, however, {{is widely considered}} {{the beginning of the}} end of his career. Roy Cohn resigned from McCarthy's staff shortly after the hearings.|$|R
50|$|While the Belmont {{investigation}} {{cleared the}} Los Angeles Unified School District <b>of</b> <b>any</b> criminal <b>wrongdoing,</b> {{the task force}} recommends strict oversight, including written protocols, a vigorous Office of the Inspector General, and other recommendations if it decides to continue to use the design-build approach.|$|R
5000|$|The City of Ottawa's {{investigation}} into propertyrights.ca that implicated McRae reportedly cost the city about $1,500 in overtime. The investigation cleared McRae <b>of</b> <b>any</b> intentional <b>wrongdoing</b> with Chief Corporate Services Officer Greg Geddes stating that McRae's actions were {{nothing more than}} an [...] "innocent mistake." ...|$|R
5|$|As governor, Carroll {{increased}} funding {{for public education}} and promoted the use of coal {{as a means of}} alleviating the 1973 energy crisis. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system following voters' approval of a constitutional amendment in 1975. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the Great Blizzard of 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance kickback scheme, but Carroll was not convicted <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing.</b> In 2004, {{he was elected to the}} Kentucky Senate. Re-elected in 2008 and 2012, he won a fourth term without opposition in 2016.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{day of the}} siege the gunmen had become {{increasingly}} frustrated {{at the lack of}} progress in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed one of the hostages and threw his body out of the embassy. As a result, the government ordered the Special Air Service (SAS), a special forces regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault—Operation Nimrod—to rescue the remaining hostages. Shortly afterwards, SAS soldiers abseiled from the roof of the building and forced entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid, they rescued {{all but one of the}} remaining hostages, and killed five of the six hostage-takers. The soldiers later faced accusations of unnecessarily killing two of the five, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing.</b> The sole remaining gunman was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.|$|E
5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, {{even to the point of}} being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, he seems to have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E
25|$|Justification {{for such}} wide {{recovery}} {{has been made}} in several areas. The first is that, as is common in tort law, policy reasons should allow those injured to have means of compensation. Employers generally have larger assets, and greater means with which to offset any losses (deep pocket compensation) Secondly, it is under the instruction of an employer by which a tort is committed; the employer can be seen to gain from the duties of their employees, and thus must bear the consequences <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoings</b> committed by them. Lastly, it has been justified as a way to reduce the taking of risks by employers, and to ensure adequate precautions are taken in conducting business.|$|R
2500|$|Terry Melcher {{stated that}} his adoptive father's {{premature}} death saved Day from financial ruin. It remains unresolved whether Marty Melcher had himself also been duped. Day stated publicly {{that she believed}} her husband innocent <b>of</b> <b>any</b> deliberate <b>wrongdoing,</b> stating that he [...] "simply trusted the wrong person".|$|R
50|$|She {{resigned}} from the legislature on January 19, 2007, after she was named in a report by provincial auditor John Noseworthy as having double-billed $3,818 in constituency expenses. Goudie, who attributed the double-billing to a clerical error, repaid the amount and was cleared <b>of</b> <b>any</b> criminal <b>wrongdoing.</b>|$|R
5|$|In late February–early March 1878, Louis {{was still}} {{serving on the}} Sultan as it lay in the Bosphorus during the Russo-Turkish War. He was criticised for visiting his brother, Prince Alexander, who was serving with the Russian forces, but an {{investigation}} cleared both Louis and Alexander, as well as Prince Alfred, <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing.</b> For {{the next two years}} Louis served on HMS Agincourt and on the Royal Yacht, HMY Osborne, but in October 1879 he refused further service on the Royal Yacht, saying it was damaging his professional career, and requested half-pay until he could be given an active duty. On 17 February 1880 he, his father, and Tsar Alexander II witnessed an explosion at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, when Stephen Chalturin unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate the Tsar with dynamite beneath the great dining room.|$|E
5|$|Renwick {{resisted}} the BBC's attempt to broadcast the episode at Christmas, feeling that such scheduling would contrast unfavourably with the grimness of the show, {{and would be}} viewed as an overt attempt to garner high ratings. The controller of BBC1 relented and the episode was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000. The broadcast coincided with the transmission of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?s first UK jackpot win. Some people within the BBC alleged that Celador, the production company in charge of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had rigged Judith Keppel's victory to spoil the BBC's expected high ratings for the sitcom's finale. The Independent Television Commission (ITC) cleared Celador and ITV <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two {{successive}} inquiries {{failed to}} find evidence against Clayton. The legislature refused to continue, all charges were dropped, and Clayton was exonerated. In fact, he was never found guilty <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> while governor. Finally a deal was reached. Johnson, now politically badly damaged by his impeachment ordeal and willing to take any position he could get, resigned as lieutenant governor, was appointed Secretary of State, and was given a compensation of several thousand dollars for his loss of power and prestige, since he would not become governor. A staunch Clayton supporter, O.A. Hadley, was then appointed lieutenant governor. Three days later, Clayton left the state for Washington, D.C., to join the US Senate, and Hadley succeeded him as governor.|$|E

50|$|Janssen {{was almost}} {{certainly}} innocent <b>of</b> <b>any</b> deliberate <b>wrongdoing,</b> and this was recognised {{by the amount of}} his fortune that he was permitted to retain when the rest was taken to compensate investors - he was allowed to keep £50,000, a much-higher proportion than most of the other directors.|$|R

5|$|In 1826, Metcalfe {{served on}} a House {{committee}} that investigated allegations that Vice-President John C. Calhoun had improperly benefited from a contract he awarded while serving as Secretary of War in 1822. While Calhoun was cleared <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing,</b> his friend, South Carolina Representative George McDuffie, began an exchange of correspondence with Metcalfe regarding the proceedings. The correspondence became heated, and McDuffie challenged Metcalfe to a duel. As {{the recipient of the}} challenge, Metcalfe had the right to choose the terms of the engagement. He chose rifles as the weapon at a distance of 90 feet. McDuffie insisted that wounds from a previous duel had left him incapable of handling a rifle, and proposed pistols as an alternative. Metcalfe replied that he had never handled a pistol in his life. Unable to come to an agreement on the conditions of the duel, both sides eventually dropped the matter entirely.|$|E
5|$|Ricardo Carvalho, Frank Lampard and Avram Grant all {{refused to}} point the finger of blame at John Terry, but {{assistant}} manager Henk ten Cate admitted that Terry was not originally due {{to take one of}} the first five penalties (if Drogba had not been sent off, he would have taken the fifth penalty). Chelsea offered Terry counselling {{as a result of his}} devastation following the miss of his penalty, and subsequently, the loss of the final. Terry was later accused of spitting at Manchester United striker Carlos Tevez, but a UEFA report into the video evidence cleared him <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing.</b> Terry also wrote an open letter, published on Chelsea's official website, apologising for missing the penalty and costing Chelsea the trophy. Nicolas Anelka, who took the decisive kick, revealed he did not actually want to take a penalty, citing lack of warm-up time.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during his}} senior year, James was the {{centerpiece}} of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing LeBron's future earning power as a professional athlete. This prompted {{an investigation by the}} Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> because he had accepted the gift from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source. Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.|$|E
50|$|Later that year, Adams {{was cleared}} <b>of</b> <b>any</b> {{criminal}} <b>wrongdoing</b> {{related to a}} consensual sexual relationship with a young adult he met in 2005. Adams said the deception about the relationship was warranted because a political opponent had falsely accused him {{of having sex with}} a minor, but later apologized.|$|R
5000|$|Palin's {{attorney}} {{issued a}} five-page statement condemning the Branchflower report as misleading and {{wrong on the}} law. Palin responded to the report by saying, [...] "About the Tasergate issue...

[...] This statement was criticized as inconsistent with {{the contents of the}} report by the media and by Democratic state senator Kim Elton.|$|R
5000|$|Smuts {{was widely}} {{condemned}} from almost all quarters. The courts, the trade unions, the Labour Party, and the Old Boers complained, but Smuts could still rely upon {{the support of}} his own party. With a working majority, Smuts presented a bill, the Indemnity and Undesirables Special Importation Bill, to Parliament that would retrospectively make his actions legal and clear Smuts and the government <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>wrongdoings.</b> Despite the howls of protest from the two major opposition parties, his bill was passed. In Smuts' own words, [...] "A smashing blow had to be struck at syndicalism in South Africa. I gave that blow." [...] It was this forceful attack on trade unionism that forged the Old Boers, the unions, and the Labour Party together, as a united front against what they saw as treason and tyranny.|$|R
