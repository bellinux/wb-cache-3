2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1980s, the Swiss Federal Railways began {{drafting}} a new computer compatible and UIC compliant numbering system for its motive power. The superscript indices in the existing scheme (e.g. Re 4/4IV, V, VI…) presented a particular problem for this draft new system's planned method of data collection. By 1988, the drafting process had led to a first draft of a UIC compliant numbering scheme, which, however, never came fully into operation. [...] At that time, the plan was that the first digit of a vehicle's number would denote the number of drive axles, and the second digit would correspond with the superscript used for that vehicle's series under the original system (e.g. Re 4/4II would become Re 420). [...] For locomotives with carrying axles, the <b>oblique</b> <b>stroke</b> included in the old name would be replaced by the digit 9 (e.g. Ae 4/7 would become Ae 497).|$|R

50|$|A {{series of}} writing {{exercises}} were presented {{for students to}} develop their skills in rapid penmanship of the business writing style, which he also termed: page writing, body writing, and miscellaneous word writing. Similar exercises featured in most business writing courses of the era.Mills's business writing {{was based on the}} muscular arm movement, first published as the Palmer Method; forearms resting on a horizontal surface, the wrist of the writing hand raised from the page, and the pen controlled using the arm instead of fingers; commonly promoted at the time to reduce hand fatigue and to which Mills referred as free arm movement. He emphasized holding the wrist of the writing hand nearly flat to have the arm best act upon the muscles forward of the elbow. Exercises to help students acquire this movement began with drills of push-pull (<b>oblique)</b> <b>strokes</b> directed using the middle of the body and ovals made by rolling on the forearm muscles. Gradually letter forms were introduced based on the 'correct' movement followed by extensive repetition intended to instil muscle memory for rapid writing.|$|R
50|$|This period {{ranges from}} Yan Zhenqing’s fifties to sixty-five. During these years, he wrote some famous pieces like Guojia Miao Stele (郭傢廟碑) and Magu Shan Xiantan Ji (痲姑山仙墰記). Having {{experienced}} An Lushan Rebellion and frequent vicissitudes in his civil career, Yan Zhenqing’s style was maturing. He increased waist force while wielding the brush, and blended techniques from the zhuan (篆) and li (隷) Scripts {{into his own}} style, making the start and ending of his brushline gentler. For individual strokes, he adopted the rule of “thin horizontal and thick vertical strokes”; strokes’ widths were varied to show the curvature and flow, and the dots and <b>oblique</b> <b>strokes</b> were finished with sharp edges. For character structure, Yan style displays squared shape and modest arrangement, with spacious center portion and tight outer strokes; this structure resembles more the more dated Zhuan and Li Scripts. From {{the point of view}} of spacing, his characters are compact vertically, leaving relatively more space in between lines. Hence, the emerging Yan style had abandoned the sumptuous trend of early Tang calligraphers: it is rather upright, muscular, fitting, rich and controlled; compared to the style of the early Tang which was sloped, feminine, pretty, slim and capricious.|$|R

The papyrus preserves the account of Phoibammon for expenses paid to the carpenter(s) (l. 6 – 9), for a window (l. 11), and for unknown purposes in the months of Phamenoth and Pharmouthi. The scribe started with registering three keratia up to Phamenoth 28, followed by a fourth on an unknown day of Phamenoth (l. 9), which he indicated also by adding l. 5 to the title, and then he continued with three extra entries in Pharmouthi. The second line, which was also added subsequently, might sum up ll. 10 – 12, in which case the account is complete, or it might constitute an extra entry. The most remarkable feature of this account is the insertion of one item (ϩⲓ ϣⲱϣⲧ l. 11) in Coptic, which also breaks the organization principle of the lines (date fi rst).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a few ideas}} on how to solve certain geometrical problems arising very often in character design, not directly solvable by METAFONTs plain macros. The first part of the paper presents two geometrical problems: the "k problem" and the "x problem", their solutions using dichotomy, and a different solution using path intersections. The latter was proposed earlier on the net by the author; although geometrically correct, it does not work in real-world METAFONT practice: a nice example of METAFONT code : : : to avoid. The second part of the paper presents two simple macro for drawing "loose" Bezier curves; in a sense, the opposite of the tension operator. Finally, the third part solves a problem stated by Alan Hoenig: how to extract text and data out of a METAFONT run, without using the log file. This is done in a straightforward manner by running a Flex-generated preprocessor over the GF file: the Flex code for this utility is given in appendix B. 1 Two Geometrical Problems, Solved by Iterated Calculations 1. 1 Description Suppose you want to design a character `K', as on the left part of fig. 1. The character should fit inside a box of width w and height h, and should consist of three strokes: the vertical stroke z 0 Γ 0 0, and the two <b>oblique</b> <b>strokes</b> z 1 Γ 2 and z 1 0 Γ 2 0.

This problem is not trivial, because METAFONT cannot compute pen positions without knowing in advance the angle of the pen (this stands both for defining a new pen with command pickup pen as for defining a simulated pen with command penpos) [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|The M3 {{was first}} issued to U.S. Army {{soldiers}} in March 1943, {{with the first}} knives going to elite units such as airborne troops and the U.S. Army Rangers. Despite ordnance descriptions of the knife as being designed for hand-to-hand warfare, the M3 did not receive universal praise as a close-quarters fighting knife upon issue to combat units. While the knife itself was generally well-made and balanced (some paratroopers and rangers {{mastered the art of}} using the M3 as a throwing knife), the long narrow dagger-like steel blade, designed to economize on priority steel requirements, was best used as a thrusting or stabbing weapon, and performed less well when used for <b>slashing</b> <b>strokes.</b> Reports of blade failures on M3s in service increased as soldiers began to use their trench knives for ordinary utility tasks such as opening ammo crates and food ration tins, a role for which the M3 had not been designed. Some soldiers also found the M3's cutting edge to be difficult to maintain in the field. As issued, the blade's secondary or false edge was intentionally sharpened and beveled for only a portion of its length, leaving an unsharpened spine {{on the top of the}} blade in an effort to stiffen the relatively narrow blade. This limited the usefulness of the M3 when employed for backhand <b>slashing</b> <b>strokes.</b>|$|R

This type is similar to that found in sea turtles and sea lions. It has a relatively slower acceleration rate than the rowing type, especially since adults have proportionally smaller paddles than juveniles. But since the larger sizes of adults mean a higher drag coefficient, using this type of propulsion is more energy-efficient.|$|R

30|$|The {{second stage}} is {{characterized}} by brushwork of a distinctly different character. Straight lines of paint were applied with a wide brush in Saul’s cloak: opaque yellow and orange-red strokes along the forward edge of the cloak, and a tangle of orange-red strokes that extended the cloak across {{the arm of the}} chair and over Saul’s leg (the “wild strokes of paint across Saul’s thigh” noted by De Vries et al.) [3]. The false-color reflectance image in Fig.  2 clearly shows the bold <b>slashing</b> <b>strokes</b> of the second stage. Although these create a vigorous effect on the painting’s surface they do not convincingly suggest the folds in three dimensions. However, they may never have been intended to be fully visible since {{there is some evidence that}} they were once covered by a semi-transparent layer of smalt (the blue glass pigment), which apparently was lost in earlier restorations [28].|$|R
30|$|Close visual {{examination}} of the paint surface, along with chemical imaging described in this paper, is consistent with—and expands on—previous art historical scholarship exploring the two stages {{in the creation of}} Saul and David. The first stage of the painting’s creation ranges from a preliminary design (painted sketch) in black with yellow and white highlights, best seen in parts of Saul’s tunic, to finished passages such as the figure of David, which were close to completion when the painting was set aside. The wild brushwork of the second stage of Saul and David—the broadly brushed revisions now visible in Saul’s cloak and David’s right sleeve—can be explained in two different ways: either that an associate of Rembrandt’s used exaggerated <b>slashing</b> <b>strokes</b> to imitate his habit of leaving some underpaint visible in the final image; or that Rembrandt himself reworked the picture by applying exaggerated strokes that were intended to be largely hidden by a paint layer that was later lost in restorations.|$|R
