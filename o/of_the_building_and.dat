5|$|A week later, on April 13, Liberty Property Trust sold an 80-percent {{interest}} in the Comcast Center to German real estate firm CommerzLeasing & Immobilien AG, a subsidiary of Commerzbank AG.

One of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of Henry Cavendish, from which it appeared that Cavendish researched, amongst other things, such questions as the density of the Earth and the composition of water.|$|E

5|$|In late December 2006, the Chicago Tribune {{reported}} that the developer was soliciting opinions on a further revision from community leaders.

5|$|Plans for {{restoring}} the courthouse had been proposed {{even before it}} fell into disuse. In 1961, the architectural modelist Theodore Conrad proposed converting the building into a new city hall for Jersey City. The plan would have created a mall in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> surrounded it with additional city buildings and a museum. Another proposal would house {{a branch of the}} New Jersey State Museum in the building. Conrad led a citizens group that lobbied for the preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> <b>and</b> got it listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The award-winning restoration project resulted in the courthouse being reopened in 1985 {{for the use of the}} civil courts and other county offices.|$|E
5|$|St Edern's {{is built}} in the Perpendicular style using local stone, with blocks of cut {{sandstone}} as the external face.

5|$|Sydenham Hill {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{locations}} in London; 109metres (357ft) above sea level (spot height on Ordnance Survey Map); {{and the size of the}} Palace and prominence of the site made it easy to identify from much of London. This led to the residential area around the building becoming known as Crystal Palace instead of Sydenham Hill. The Palace was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936 and the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> its grounds is now known as Crystal Palace Park.|$|E
5|$|Tapp is {{beginning}} to learn that these people all have a dark connection to him.

Tapp saves Oswald, but he is swiftly killed by a compacting metal slab before either have a chance to react.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is formed by a composite steel and concrete frame, with various setbacks in its profile, meaning {{the upper floors}} are much smaller in area than lower levels. Outrigger trusses at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> at the various setbacks help to stiffen the building's reinforced concrete core against the strong winds prevalent in the area. The base of the building features a small park, for which the tower is named.|$|E

5|$|The {{penultimate}} restoration {{was undertaken}} by the Restoration Laboratory of the Vatican Museum between 1935–38.

5|$|A {{large number}} of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed there when not working. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several bottles of wine, {{a copy of a}} St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in the winery to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the winery Greystone Cellars.|$|E

5|$|After {{peace was}} {{achieved}} with France in 1558, military attention shifted towards the Spanish {{threat to the}} increasingly prosperous south-west side of England. Tensions with Spain grew and invasion appeared likely in 1589, resulting in royal permission being given to reuse the stonework from the East Blockhouse for new coastal defences, but this work was not carried out. The fort continued to decay until the 20th century. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in 1939, the East Blockhouse was adapted for use by the British military. The interior was cleared out and a shed was built in one corner. A slit trench was dug {{on the north side of}} the building, a rifle embrasure formed on the east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> <b>and</b> a machine-gun position was dug out and protected with sandbags outside it.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town. The 40th had taken up a position just outside town, {{on the north side}} of a ravine. The 55th formed up to the left of the 40th. The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>and</b> laid down their arms.|$|E
5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows {{in the basement and}} nine sash windows on each of the ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> <b>and</b> broad shallow steps leading down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and kitchen garden.|$|E
