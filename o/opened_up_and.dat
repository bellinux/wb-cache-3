Led by Edward Gardner and Ian Warfield, the FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project was formed to standardize changes and maintain a core engine for others to take advantage of. Using the new fan-updated engine, projects such as Beyond the Red Line, based on the new Battlestar Galactica, and The Babylon Project, based on Babylon 5, have become possible. PXO, the free Internet gaming service handling SquadWar, was initially acquired by THQ in their 2002 acquisition of Outrage Entertainment (renamed as Outrage Games). The service was continued until July 2003, when Outrage Games was dissolved and PXO terminated. The components of its website were, however, later handed over to the FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project to help them create a similar service in tracking statistics and rankings.|$|E
25|$|The {{ending of}} Östersund's {{status as a}} {{garrison}} town has however created a larger enthusiasm regarding the city's future as the private sector has grown larger and more companies are being established, much of {{which is due to}} the financial compensation the State offered.

The Indian lawyer and {{follower}} of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, Khwaja Kamal-ud-Din, just arrived in England, was inspired to establish an Islamic mission in the mosque. The Khwaja, with the help of some prominent Indian Muslims in England, such as Syed Ameer Ali, went to court and had the Mosque placed under a Trust.|$|E

25|$|Proposals to link Taupo with Rotorua and {{the greater}} Bay of Plenty with a railway date back to 1911. It had long been {{intended}} that the Rotorua Branch would be extended into the Bay of Plenty {{to connect with the}} line being built from Gisborne. A railway into the Bay of Plenty would link Rotorua and surrounding regions to the Port of Tauranga. Rotorua interests at the time lobbied very hard to have a line built between Rotorua and the Bay of Plenty, claiming the considerable amounts of land which would be <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> linked to the port, particularly if the line were to be extended to Taupo.|$|E
25|$|Most notably, vast {{areas of}} deck space were <b>opened</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> {{extended}} at the stern. A large lido deck was created {{at the very}} aft, built so wide, to accommodate as many sunbathing passengers as possible, that it cantilevered over the hull below, which narrowed in towards the stern at that point. The terrace off the First Class Smoking Room {{was lost in the}} construction of an outdoor buffet restaurant, and the Patio Provençal on the Sun Deck was filled in with a top-side swimming pool. This last addition created an odd space on Norway, where a tunnel-like space remained around the tank of the pool, into which the original exterior windows and doors of the surrounding cabins, which once looked into the Patio Provençal, still opened, all in their original 1960s colours.|$|E

25|$|Tatum arrived off Okinawa's Hagushi beaches on 19 May and {{reported}} for duty with the antiaircraft and antisubmarine pickets stationed around the island. At dusk on 29 May, the warship was proceeding to her radar picket station {{when she was}} attacked by four enemy planes. As the first intruder swooped in across her bow, Tatums guns <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> scored hits on his wing and fuselage. He banked sharply {{and headed for the}} ship's starboard side. About 40feet from her, the plane's left wing and tail struck the water, jarring loose his bomb. It skipped off the surface, struck and careened off the underside of a gun sponson, and pierced Tatums hull and two of her longitudinal bulkheads. The dud came to rest with its nose protruding eight inches into the passageway inboard of the executive officer's stateroom. The plane also skimmed over the water into Tatum, dented her hull, and knocked out her director fire control and communications with the engine room.|$|E
25|$|The 1799 {{campaign}} in Italy {{began with the}} Battle of Verona, a series of costly but indecisive clashes around Verona on 26 March. At the Battle of Magnano on 5 April, the Habsburg Austrian army of Paul Kray triumphed over the Republican French army of Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer. While suffering losses of 4,000 killed and wounded and 2,000 captured, Kray's Austrians inflicted casualties of 3,500 killed and wounded and captured 4,500 men, 18 artillery pieces and seven colors from the French. Two days later, a distraught Schérer begged to be relieved of command. Michael von Melas arrived to take command of the Austrian army from Kray on 9 April. Hearing that 12,000 Austrians were approaching from the Tyrol to the north, Schérer abandoned {{the line of the}} Mincio River on 12 April. Leaving 12,000 troops in the fortress of Mantua and 1,600 more in Peschiera del Garda, the demoralized French commander ordered his crippled army to withdraw. As the soldiers fell back, the skies <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> turned the retreat into a sodden nightmare.|$|E

500|$|In the stanzas that follow, Helgi {{responds}} {{that none}} of these things have occurred, and so Sigrún's maid goes home to Sigrún. The maid tells Sigrún that the burial mound has <b>opened</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> that Sigrún should go to Helgi there, as Helgi has asked her to come and tend his wounds, which have <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> are bleeding. Sigrún goes into the mound, and finds that Helgi is drenched in gore, his hair is thick with frost. Filled with joy at the reunion, Sigrún kisses him before he can remove his coat of mail, and asks how she can heal him. Sigrún makes a bed there, and the two sleep together in the enclosed burial mound. Helgi awakens, stating that he must [...] "ride along the blood-red roads, to set the pale horse to tread the path of the sky," [...] and [...] return before the rooster Salgófnir crows. Helgi and the host of men ride away, and Sigrún and her servant go back to their house. Sigrún has her maid wait for him by the mound the next night, but when she arrives at dawn, she finds that he has not returned. The prose narrative {{at the end of the}} poem relates that Sigrún dies of sadness, but that the two are thought to have been reborn as Helgi Haddingjaskati and the valkyrie Kára.|$|E
500|$|XLVIII Panzer Corps regrouped {{during the}} night of 6/7 July, and the 11th Panzer Division {{continued}} its advance towards Oboyan on 7 July, alongside the Großdeutschland Division. Over the next few days, the two divisions overcame resistance {{from a series of}} Soviet strongpoints, along with their desperate counterattacks. By 10 July they had reached a position east of the Kursk-Kharkov road, on the heights [...] south of Oboyan, having defeated advanced elements of the Soviet 10th Tank Corps. At this point the previously rough terrain <b>opened</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> with the aid of binoculars the men of the division could see the vast plain behind Oboyan in which the two pincers of Operation Citadel were planned to meet. But the northern pincer had been stalled north of Kursk in heavy fighting, and the 11th Panzer Division had gained the most northern penetration into the Soviet salient achieved by Army Group South during the operation.|$|E
500|$|Endurance's {{progress}} was frustratingly slow, until on 22 December leads <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{the ship was}} able to continue steadily southward. [...] This continued {{for the next two}} weeks, taking the party deep into the Weddell Sea. [...] Further delays then slowed progress {{after the turn of the}} year, before a lengthy run south during 7–10 January 1915 brought them close to the [...] ice walls which guarded the Antarctic coastal region of Coats Land. This territory had been discovered and named by William Speirs Bruce in 1904, during the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition. On 15 January Endurance came abreast of a great glacier, the edge of which formed a bay which appeared a good landing place. [...] However, Shackleton considered it too far north of Vahsel Bay for a landing, [...] "except under pressure of necessity"—a decision he would later regret. On 17 January the ship reached a latitude of 76°27′S, where land was faintly discernible. Shackleton named it Caird Coast, after his principal backer. Bad weather forced the ship to shelter in the lee of a stranded iceberg.|$|E

500|$|As Alex moved {{north toward}} the Azores, {{decreasing}} sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear {{caused it to}} weaken late on January14 and into January15. The hurricane's eyewall <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> its convective structure decayed, indicating the start of its transition back into an extratropical cyclone. Becoming increasingly tilted with height due to shear, Alex weakened to a tropical storm before making landfall over Terceira Island at 13:15UTC with winds of 65mph (100km/h). Less than five hours later, the system completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone, with its circulation becoming more elongated and the radius of maximum winds expanding significantly. Furthermore, the overall structure became more [...] "comma shaped", a feature of frontal systems. Turning northwest, the system deepened slightly to 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg) as it approached Greenland. Hurricane-force winds developed along the southeastern coast of Greenland due to interaction with the island's mountains, rather than {{the result of the}} storm intensifying. By 06:00UTC on January17, the remnants of Alex were absorbed by a larger extratropical low over the North Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{a major part of}} Gaga's The Fame Ball Tour as the second number of the set list, and was {{performed}} alongside album track, [...] "Starstruck". Gaga wore a silver and black short skirt looking like a tutu and shaped like a peplum. She had a triangular piece attached on the dress on her right breast, and completed her look with high heeled ultra spike shoes. Gaga's hair was made an austere blond bob, and she accessorized with black sunglasses. Her dancers surrounded the stage, holding plates encrusted with crystals, which completely hid them. As the performance of the opening number [...] "Paparazzi" [...] ended, the plates <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> Gaga started singing the song [...] "Starstruck" [...] while standing on the platform. Pre-recorded music and mixing were provided in the background by DJ Space Cowboy. Gaga also brought out the disco stick for the performance of [...] "LoveGame".

500|$|The {{first leg}} of the journey eastward took Fram across the Barents Sea towards Novaya Zemlya {{and then to the}} North Russian {{settlement}} of Khabarova where the first batch of dogs was brought on board. [...] On 3 August Fram weighed anchor and moved cautiously eastward, entering the Kara Sea the next day. Few ships had sailed the Kara Sea before, and charts were incomplete. On 18 August, {{in the area of the}} Yenisei River delta, an uncharted island was discovered and named Sverdrup Island after Fram's commander. Fram was now moving towards the Taimyr Peninsula and Cape Chelyuskin, the most northerly point of the Eurasian continental mass. Heavy ice slowed the expedition's progress, and at the end of August it was held up for four days while the ship's boiler was repaired and cleaned. The crew also experienced the dead water phenomenon, where a ship's forward progress is impeded by energy dissipation caused by a layer of fresh water lying on top of heavier salt water. On 9 September a wide stretch of ice-free water <b>opened</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> next day Fram rounded Cape Chelyuskin—the second ship to do so, after Nordenskiöld's Vega in 1878—and entered the Laptev Sea.|$|E
