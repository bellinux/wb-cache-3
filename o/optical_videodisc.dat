5000|$|LaserDisc {{was first}} {{available}} on the market, in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15, 1978, {{two years after the}} introduction of the VHS VCR, and four years before the introduction of the CD (which is based on laser disc technology). Initially licensed, sold, and marketed as MCA DiscoVision (also known as simply [...] "DiscoVision") in North America in 1978, the technology was previously referred to internally as <b>Optical</b> <b>Videodisc</b> System, Reflective <b>Optical</b> <b>Videodisc,</b> Laser <b>Optical</b> <b>Videodisc,</b> and Disco-Vision (with a dash), with the first players referring to the format as [...] "Video Long Play".|$|E

50|$|Both Gregg's and Russell's disc are floppy media read in {{transparent}} mode, which impose serious drawbacks. In the Netherlands in 1969, Philips Research physicist, Pieter Kramer invented an <b>optical</b> <b>videodisc</b> in reflective mode with {{a protective}} layer read by a {{focused laser beam}} , filed 1972, issued 1991. Kramer's physical format is used in all optical discs. In 1975, Philips and MCA began to work together, and in 1978, commercially much too late, they presented their long-awaited Laserdisc in Atlanta. MCA delivered the discs and Philips the players. However, the presentation was a commercial failure, and the cooperation ended.|$|E
50|$|MCA DiscoVision Inc. was a {{division}} of entertainment giant MCA, established in 1969 to develop and sell an <b>optical</b> <b>videodisc</b> system. MCA released discs pressed in Carson and Costa Mesa, California on the DiscoVision label from the format's Atlanta, Georgia launch in 1978 to 1982 {{and the release of}} the film, The Four Seasons. DiscoVision titles included films from Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Walt Disney Pictures. Agreements were made with Columbia Pictures and United Artists, though no discs were released on the DiscoVision label from either studio. Most of these companies later established their own labels for the format, the first being Paramount with a dozen movies released on the Paramount Home Video label in the summer of 1981.|$|E
5000|$|During its development, MCA, which co-owned the technology, {{referred}} to it as the <b>Optical</b> <b>Videodisc</b> System, [...] "Reflective Optical Videodisc" [...] or [...] "Laser Optical Videodisc", depending on the document; changing the name once in 1969 to Disco-Vision and then again in 1978 to DiscoVision (without the hyphen), which became the official spelling. Technical documents and brochures produced by MCA Disco-Vision during the early and mid-'70s also used the term [...] "Disco-Vision Records" [...] to refer to the pressed discs. MCA owned the rights to the largest catalog of films in the world during this time, and they manufactured and distributed the DiscoVision releases of those films under the [...] "MCA DiscoVision" [...] software and manufacturing label; consumer sale of those titles began on December 15, 1978, with the aforementioned Jaws.|$|E
5000|$|A Pockels cell {{was used}} by MCA Disco-Vision (DiscoVision) {{engineers}} in the <b>optical</b> <b>videodisc</b> mastering system. Light from an argon-ion laser was passed through the Pockels cell to create pulse modulations corresponding to the original FM video and audio signals to be recorded on the master videodisc. MCA used the Pockels cell in videodisc mastering until the sale to Pioneer Electronics. To increase {{the quality of the}} recordings, MCA patented a Pockels cell stabilizer that reduced the second-harmonic distortion that could be created by the Pockels cell during mastering. MCA used either a DRAW (Direct Read After Write) mastering system or a photoresist system. The DRAW system was originally preferred, since it didn't require clean-room conditions during disc recording and allowed instant quality checking during mastering. The original single-sided test pressings from 1976/77 were mastered with the DRAW system as were the [...] "educational", non-feature titles at the format's release in December 1978.|$|E
50|$|Around 1976, Philips and Sony showed prototypes {{of digital}} audio disc players, which were based on <b>optical</b> <b>videodisc</b> technology. In the {{interview}} by Tekla Perry for the IEEE Spectrum, May 2017, Immink explains that he got involved in the CD project {{at the end of}} 1979 when Sony and Philips had decided to jointly settle one design. Both Philips and Sony had shown prototype CD players to the press in 1978. The team at Philips, he says, “needed someone to do measurements of the two competing systems, the quality, how they coped with scratches, how they coped with imperfections of the disc. My job with the LaserDisc was finished, so I said, ‘Sure, I could do it.’ ” Both Philips and Sony had come up with different rules for translating digital audio data to sequences of pits and lands. After a lot of experimentation, Immink improved the playing time by thirty percent by inventing a code that could better cope with the servo systems. The encoding system Immink devised came to be called Eight-to-fourteen modulation (EFM).|$|E
40|$|The <b>optical</b> <b>videodisc</b> is a {{publishing}} medium that permanently stores {{large amounts of}} visual and aural data. The technology needed to support videodiscs is understood and available. Digital augmentation of the <b>optical</b> <b>videodisc</b> can exploit this technology for dat{{a publishing}}. Not only can this data be used in raw form, it can also reference the video that it augments. Publishing requires an author to create the publishable material, and this thesis addresses the problem of authoring digitally augmented videodiscs. by Steven Edward Yelick. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

40|$|A {{technique}} of pictorially synthesizing facial imagery using optical videodiscs under computer control is described. Search, selection and averaging processes are performed on {{a catalogue of}} whole faces and facial features to yield a composite, expressive, recognizable face. An immediate application of this technique is the reconstruction of a particular face from memory for police identification, thus the project is called, IDENTIDISC. Part I-PACEMAKER describes the production {{and implementation of the}} IDENTIDISC system to produce composite faces. Part II-EXPRESSIONMAKER describes animation techniques to add expression and motion to composite faces. Expression sequences are manipulated to make 'anyface' make any face. Historical precedents of making facial composites, theories of facial recognition, classification and expression are also discussed. This thesis is accompanied by two copies of PACEMAKER-III, an <b>optical</b> <b>videodisc</b> produced at the Architecture Machine Group in 1982. The disc can be played on an <b>optical</b> <b>videodisc</b> player. The length is approximately 15, 0000 frames. Frame numbers are indicated in the text by []. by Peggy Weil. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

40|$|Laser <b>optical</b> <b>videodisc</b> {{technology}} harbors great {{possibilities for}} information organization, storage, retrieval and transfer. It {{is unique in}} that it permits high-density storage of multi-media, multi-formatted, and multi-dimensional information on a single disc. Thus, it will surely revolutionize libraries and their future services. In regards to international cooperation, the relevant traits of <b>optical</b> <b>videodisc</b> technology will be addressed. However, the ultimate power of the videodisc is only revealed if, in an interactive mode, it is allied with a computer. An online demonstration of the interactive videodisc, &quot;The First Emperor of China, &quot; a product of PROJECT EMPEROR-I, will vividly illustrate this. &quot;PROJECT EMPEROR-I: China's Treasure Revealed via Videodisc Technology&quot;, to which the author is the Project Director and Principal Investigator, {{is supported by the}} Humanities Project in Libraries, US National Endowment for the Humanities. In its presentation and interpretation of a most significant historical/archaeological period of China's pat, the Project utilizes the most current videodisc technology. The period is that of the First Emperor of China. The artifacts that are recorded and presented include the terra-cotta figures of warriors and horses found near his tomb in Xian. This project exemplifies the significant role which new technology can play in information sharing. In doing so, it has furthered cross-cultural appreciation, and international cooperation and relationship...|$|E

40|$|In a new {{approach}} to medical computer based education (CBE) students at several U. S. and Canadian health professions schools have been using an <b>optical</b> <b>videodisc</b> under computer control to study basic medical pathology. Each side of the videodisc has a single concept program which supports linear playback and can also serve as visual and audio databases for interactive presentation. The experimental programs were in use at twenty-two alpha test sites in 1983 - 84; thirty-five sites will be used in the 1984 - 85 academic year. Over five hundred students have evaluated the courseware, and preliminary data show that students learn the material by using the programs and that they rate various features of the programs at four-plus on a one-to-five scale. In their written comments, students have indicated that they believe such programs provide highly valuable learning tools. They say that they want more...|$|E
40|$|The {{organization}} and archival storage of visual records takes {{a variety of}} forms, from the family photograph album to the large picture files maintained by the news media. Common to all systems {{is the problem of}} the location and retrieval of particular images, to serve any purpose from page layout to illustrating a story. The thesis will examine ways to personalize the cataloging of large bodies of visual data. Single frames of an <b>optical</b> <b>videodisc</b> will provide the storage mechanism and computer control of the disc will facilitate search procedures. Manipulation of a database associated with the disc frames allows the development of {{more than one way to}} order this sea of information, whether by a card catalogue system like the picture file or some personal chronology like the photograph album. by Paul Paternoster.
