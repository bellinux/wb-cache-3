50|$|Unlike most opioid derivatives, <b>oxpheneridine</b> is not {{specifically}} listed as an illegal drug. In the UNODC narcotics report of 1958, they state {{that it was}} not possible to administer <b>oxpheneridine</b> in high doses as it is poorly soluble and highly irritating, and at the low doses administered it did not produce addiction in animals. This appears to be the only time <b>oxpheneridine</b> has been investigated, and so its pharmacological properties have not been well established.|$|E

5000|$|In Canada, <b>Oxpheneridine</b> is {{specifically}} {{excluded from the}} illegal drugs list on the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act schedules, presumably {{on the basis of}} the lack of addictive potential found by the UNODC. Canada also lists [...] "Carbamethidine" [...] as another excluded drug on its schedule, but this appears to be a double entry as the chemical name listed for carbamethidine is actually the chemical name of <b>oxpheneridine,</b> and the chemical name given for <b>oxpheneridine</b> on the Canadian drug schedules is chemically incorrect and does not correspond to a compound that could exist.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxpheneridine</b> (Carbamethidine) is a 4-phenylpiperidine {{derivative}} that {{is related}} to the opioid analgesic drug pethidine (meperidine).|$|E
50|$|Norpethidine {{can be used}} as a precuror in {{synthesis}} of other drugs, including etoxeridine, benzethidine, furethidine, morpheridine, anileridine, phenoperidine, Piminodine and <b>oxpheneridine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxpheneridine</b> is not {{currently}} used in medicine. Presumably it has similar effects to other opioid derivatives, such as analgesia, sedation, nausea and respiratory depression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxpheneridine</b> would {{probably}} {{be regarded as a}} controlled substance analogue of pethidine on the grounds of its related chemical structure in some jurisdictions such as the United States, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
