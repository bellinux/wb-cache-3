500|$|A more {{negative}} review came from EW.com's Ken Tucker, {{who called the}} animation clunky, which he said made Hanna-Barbera's animation look like state-of-the-art. Tucker also said in his review that he hoped that smart people would use the Family Guy half-hour to turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> set and start a debate over the air strikes in Kosovo. He also called the show [...] "The Simpsons as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows".

500|$|Mixed {{assessments}} {{came from}} Robin Pierson of The TV Critic, giving the season an overall mixed score of 59 out of 100. Though he praised the series as [...] "a {{different kind of}} animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can't do" [...] and found [...] "enough promise to believe the show could become really funny", he criticized the season's [...] "slightly lame collection of flashback jokes." [...] Pierson considered [...] "I Never Met the Dead Man" [...] {{to be the best}} episode of the season, and regarded [...] "The Son Also Draws" [...] as the season's poorest. The ending joke of [...] "The Son Also Draws" [...] (which consisted of Peter stating that [...] "Canada sucks"), caused controversy with Canadian viewers. Ken Tucker gave the series a D in Entertainment Weekly, calling the animation clunky, which he said made Hanna-Barbera's animation look [...] state-of-the-art. He also hoped that smart people would use the Family Guy half hour to turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> set and start a debate over the air strikes in Kosovo. The premiere of Family Guy was the Super Bowl XXXIII lead out program, achieving a total of 22.01 million viewers.|$|E

2500|$|On 5 November 2009 {{a public}} {{memorial}} {{was held for}} Lane at the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club. The memorial was open to {{all members of the}} public, who were asked only for a donation to Alzheimer's Australia. Over 1,100 people crammed into the showroom at the club which had a usual capacity of only 600. Other members of the public viewed the memorial on televisions around the club. The memorial celebration featured live performances and speeches from Lane's close friends, such as Rhonda Burchmore, Bert Newton, Mike McColl-Jones, Mike Cleary, Toni Lamond and Helen Reddy. Lane's son opened the memorial with [...] "They're Playing Our Song", which was his father's opening number, and earned a standing ovation for his performance.

2500|$|After {{his initial}} failure as a Test batsman in 1955 Barrington [...] "set out to {{eliminate}} fun from his game {{and replace it}} with something very near impregnability". Ian Chappell wrote with feeling [...] "Every so often you encounter a player whose bat seem about a yard wide. It's not, of course. It just seems that way. England's Ken Barrington was one. Our own Bill Lawry was another. Gee, they were hard to dislodge". This was not always appreciated by the selectors, spectators and the press; and he once met a man on a train who told him [...] "I always switch <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> when you come in". This lack of appreciation may have been affected {{by the fact that he}} scored most of his centuries overseas and that he could play entertaining strokes, but chose not to do so. He was controversially dropped from the England team after 57 Tests for taking over seven hours to make 137 against a weak New Zealand attack in 1965 in which he [...] "almost brought the game to a standstill". But when quick runs were needed in the Fifth Test at Melbourne in 1962–63 he surprised everyone by smashing a hundred off 122 balls and bringing up the century with a six into the stands. Though he rarely expressed open dissent he used to pull faces if he disagreed with an umpire or thought that the light was too bad or the bouncers too frequent. His grimacing and nervous jump when receiving hostile fast bowling led some to believe that he was afraid, but he stood up to Wes Hall, Chester Watson, Charlie Griffith and Peter Pollock even if injured.|$|E
