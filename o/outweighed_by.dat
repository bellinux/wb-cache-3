5|$|While HIAG only {{partially}} achieved its goals {{of legal and}} economic rehabilitation of Waffen-SS, its propaganda efforts led to the reshaping {{of the image of}} Waffen-SS in popular culture. The results are still felt, with scholarly treatments being <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> a large amount of amateur historical studies, memoirs, picture books, websites and wargames.|$|E
5|$|Although a 2007 study {{estimated}} that introducing DST to Japan would reduce household lighting energy consumption, a 2007 simulation {{estimated that}} DST would increase overall energy use in Osaka residences by 0.13%, with a 0.02% decrease due to less lighting more than <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> a 0.15% increase due to extra cooling; neither study examined non-residential energy use. This is probably because DST's effect on lighting energy use is mainly noticeable in residences.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the gains}} {{provided}} by Harvey were <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> Lindwall's absence, which severely hampered Australia's bowling {{and made their}} eventual victory much more difficult. England made 441 and Australia reached their target of 98 on the final afternoon to complete an eight-wicket victory. Due to his injury, Lindwall was omitted from the team for the two matches {{leading up to the}} Second Test. Australia proceeded to defeat Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing with Yorkshire.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Occurrence== Generally, ultramafic and mafic {{igneous rocks}} have {{relatively}} high, and granites low, PGE trace content. Geochemically anomalous traces occur predominantly in chromian spinels and sulfides. Mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks host practically all primary PGM ore of the world. Mafic layered intrusions, including the Bushveld Complex, <b>outweigh</b> <b>by</b> far all other geological settings of platinum deposits. Other economically significant PGE deposits include mafic intrusions related to flood basalts, and ultramafic complexes of the Alaska, Urals type.|$|R
50|$|The Florida {{football}} team {{opened the season}} with a loss to the Mercer Baptists for the third consecutive season, 24-0. Mercer <b>outweighed</b> Florida <b>by</b> 20 pounds.|$|R
50|$|The Florida team {{suffered}} a defeat to the Savannah Athletic Club, 27-2. Savannah <b>outweighed</b> Florida <b>by</b> some 30 pounds, and Florida {{was proud of}} giving Savannah a better game than Stetson.|$|R
5|$|No {{discernible}} {{variation in}} size or appearance in green and golden bell frogs between different geographic areas is found. Fluctuations {{in size and}} appearance between different populations are <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> variations within the populations themselves. Females {{are more likely to}} be found away from breeding sites, while the opposite applies for males. Metamorphlings are divided in roughly equal numbers between males and females, while juvenile frogs are observed less often than their mature counterparts, although scientists are not sure whether this is due to lower abundance or increased reclusiveness.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
5|$|In {{ex parte}} Hosenball, Lord Denning {{referred}} to Lord Reid's comments in R. v. Lewes Justices, ex parte Secretary of State for Home Department (1972), {{that there was}} a public interest for certain documents in the police's possession not to be produced during court proceedings, otherwise members of the public might withhold information from the police if they realized the potential existed for the information to be disclosed to the Gaming Board. Such withholding of information would prevent the police from properly discharging their statutory duty of ensuring that unsuitable persons were not granted licences to run gaming establishments. Lord Reid stated that the requirement for natural justice in that case was clearly <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> the public interest.|$|E
50|$|Renda {{made his}} {{professional}} boxing debut on 30 September 2004, where he defeated the previously unbeaten Mark Ellwood in a 2nd round technical knockout. Ellwood <b>outweighed</b> Renda <b>by</b> almost a stone in weight.|$|R
50|$|Weir {{was known}} for his clever ducking and rapid countering, rather than a strong punch. He {{defeated}} a number of middleweights in his career, some <b>outweighing</b> him <b>by</b> as much as fifty pounds.|$|R

5|$|Some reviewers fondly {{recalled}} serendipitous in-game encounters as {{they learned}} the game environment's unwritten rules. Not knowing how foreign figures would react, Rock, Paper, Shotgun reviewer treated new encounters as puzzles. This experimentation led to moments of fearful scrambling across {{a room to}} avoid a new, encroaching enemy type, and discovering that other enemies that are harmless if left alone. Rain World was abundant with opportunities for a player to demonstrate ingenuity and improvisation, according to GameSpot reviewer, whose highlights included making a mouse into a dark room's lantern, using weapons as climbable objects, and luring enemies into battle to distract from the Slugcat's presence. Those critics considered these mysterious, perceptive interactions {{to be among the}} game's best features, though far <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> Rain World punishing game mechanics.|$|E
5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E
5|$|This {{exception}} arises due to competing {{horizontal and}} vertical trends in the nuclear charge. Going along a period, the nuclear charge increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons. The additional pull on outer electrons as nuclear charge increases generally outweighs the screening effect of having more electrons. With some irregularities, atoms therefore become smaller, ionization energy increases, {{and there is a}} gradual change in character, across a period, from strongly metallic, to weakly metallic, to weakly nonmetallic, to strongly nonmetallic elements. Going down a main group, the effect of increasing nuclear charge is generally <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus. Atoms generally become larger, ionization energy falls, and metallic character increases. The net effect is that the location of the metalâ€“nonmetal transition zone shifts to the right in going down a group, and analogous diagonal similarities are seen elsewhere in the periodic table, as noted.|$|E
25|$|Recent total {{net assets}} for the U.S. Fund {{industry}} are as follows: total net assets $2.6 trillion: $1.4 trillion in Prime money funds, $907 billion in Treasury money funds, $257 billion in Tax-exempt. Total Institutional assets <b>outweigh</b> Retail <b>by</b> roughly 2:1.|$|R
50|$|To {{close the}} regular season, Cumberland beat Alabama, LSU, and Tulane all by shutout in five days. Red Smith and Head {{starred in the}} 44 - 0 defeat of Alabama. Cumberland <b>outweighed</b> Alabama <b>by</b> an average of nearly 30 pounds.|$|R

5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said that the game had changed his idea of what can make for a great game, and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said that the game revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface would make it a good choice for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but said that they were <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> the feeling of accomplishment from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt that the game was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E
5|$|In October 1857 the inquisitor of Bologna, a Dominican friar called Father Pier Gaetano Feletti, {{learned of}} rumours {{to the effect}} that a secret baptism had been {{administered}} to one of the city's Jewish children by a Catholic servant. If true, this would make the child a Catholic {{in the eyes of the}} Churchâ€”a fact with secular as well as spiritual ramifications since the Church stance was that children they considered to be Christians could not be raised by non-Christians, and should be taken from their parents in such circumstances. Cases like this were not uncommon in 19th-century Italy, and often revolved around the baptism of a Jewish child by a Christian servant. The official Church position was that Catholics should not baptise Jewish children without the parents' consent, except if a child was on the brink of deathâ€”in these cases the Church considered the customary deferment to parental authority to be <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> the importance of allowing the child's soul to be saved and go to Heaven, and permitted baptism without the parents' assent. Many Jewish families feared clandestine baptisms by their Christian maids; to counter this perceived threat some households required Christians leaving their employment to sign notarised statements confirming that they had never baptised any of the children.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists accept Allosaurus as {{an active}} {{predator}} of large animals. There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on Stegosaurus, including an Allosaurus tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a Stegosaurus tail spike, and a Stegosaurus neck plate with a U-shaped wound that correlates well with an Allosaurus snout. Sauropods seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of scavenging, based {{on the presence of}} scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones. However, as Gregory Paul noted in 1988, Allosaurus was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods, unless it hunted in packs, as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth, and was greatly <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> contemporaneous sauropods. Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults. Research in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century may have found other solutions to this question. Robert T. Bakker, comparing Allosaurus to Cenozoic sabre-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although Allosaurus did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a saw-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.|$|E

25|$|The {{jury found}} in Christie's favour by a 10â€“2 majority. The judge ordered that McVicar should {{be bound by}} an {{injunction}} restraining him from accusing Christie of taking banned substances. The modest Â£40,000 damages awarded were <b>outweighed</b> <b>by</b> the legal costs that Christie incurred to bring the case.|$|E
40|$|Concerns {{about the}} content of total and free purine bases in muscle foods and their {{retentions}} upon cooking have been since long established (BrulÃ© et al., 1988). Recently, though, an important rÃ´le has been acknowledged to dietary sources of preformed purines for the growth of tissues with a rapid turnover and for optimal function of the cellular immune response, up {{to the point that the}} positive features of these nutrients seem to <b>outweigh</b> <b>by</b> far the negative ones (ILSI, 1998). Scanty information exists about the total purine content of raw ovine meat, the only available sources of data being a survey by Herbel and Montag (1987) on purine and pyrimidine contents of protein-rich foods and the comprehensive collection of food composition tables compiled by Scherz and Senser (1994) [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Eshelby stress (static energy momentum) tensor {{is derived}} for bone {{modelled}} as an inhomogeneous piezoelectric and piezomagnetic Cosserat (micropolar) medium. The divergence of this tensor is the configurational force felt by material gradients and defects in the medium. Just as in inhomogeneous elastic media, this force is {{identified with the}} thermodynamic force for phase transformations, in bone it is the thermodynamic cause of structural transformations, i. e. remodelling and growth. The thermodynamic approach shows that some terms of driving force are proportional to the stress, and some acting on material inhomogeneities are quadratic in the stressâ€”the latter <b>outweigh</b> <b>by</b> far the former. Since inertial forces due to acceleration enter the energyâ€“momentum tensor, {{it follows that the}} rate of loading matters and that both tension and compression stimulate growth, which is favoured at heterogeneities...|$|R
