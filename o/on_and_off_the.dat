The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such world-class players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.|$|E
