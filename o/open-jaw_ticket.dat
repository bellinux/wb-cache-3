50|$|In some cases, {{this type}} of {{arrangement}} is needed for boat cruises that do {{not return to the}} departure city. In other cases, the traveler wishes to explore between two points and {{not have to worry about}} using time to return to the arrival city. For example, a traveller might fly from London to Bangkok, travel around Thailand by public transport and fly back home to London from Phuket. Another example would be a traveler flying from New York City to San Francisco but then returning to Washington, D.C. <b>Open-jaw</b> <b>tickets</b> are a flexible and relatively inexpensive way of flying, as such tickets are almost always less expensive than purchasing two one-way flights between the destinations visited.|$|R
