5|$|Acarya Ananda Jha, {{the author}} of the Chinnamasta Tattva, prescribes her worship by {{soldiers}} as she embodies self-control of lust, heroic self-sacrifice for the benefit of others, and fearlessness in the face of death. In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her generosity to others. Other goals common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one's foes, removal of obstacles, ability to sway kings, ability to attract others, conquest <b>over</b> <b>other</b> kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).|$|E

The Advertiser took <b>over</b> <b>other</b> community newspapers and became the Southern Cross, which Isaacson edited and published along with Sunday Observer and various business and industry magazines. In 1986 Peter Isaacson Publications took over the Asher Joel Media Group. Southern Cross was bought by APN News & Media in 1993 and Isaacson became APN's director, serving until 1998. He chaired TW Media from 1997 to 2005.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{as a source of}} nectar for the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) in winter to early summer (May to December), from field studies in the Scott National Park, replaced by Adenanthos meisneri in the summer.

5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored <b>over</b> <b>other</b> processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E

5|$|Elk {{range in}} forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark. Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year. Males also engage in ritualized mating {{behaviors}} during the rut, including posturing, antler wrestling (sparring), and bugling, a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance <b>over</b> <b>other</b> males and attracts females.|$|E

A piece is {{captured}} (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).|$|E

5|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his brother, Ceolwulf; a post-Conquest legend claims {{that his son}} Cynehelm was murdered to gain the succession. Within two years Ceolwulf had been deposed, and the kingship passed {{permanently}} out of Coenwulf's family. Coenwulf was the last king of Mercia to exercise substantial dominance <b>over</b> <b>other</b> Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Within a decade of his death, the rise of Wessex had begun under King Egbert, and Mercia never recovered its former position of power.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the newspaper's {{supervisory}} council hired {{school teacher}} Fredrik Monsen {{to be the}} new editor. Olav Larssen started his journalist career as a subeditor in the same year. In the newspaper's supervisory council vote, Monsen edged out Waldemar Carlsen with 22 to 4 votes, and also prevailed <b>over</b> <b>other</b> applicants who were seasoned editors, such as Ingvald Førre and Eugène Olaussen. Larssen prevailed over Carlsen and Førre in the vote for the new subeditor.|$|E
5|$|In the {{unfolding}} plot, the player learns that Tachikawa and Elaine were killed (by the sabotage of their gun-ships) to procure microchips implanted in their brains. These chips can record a pilot's knowledge and combat skills; Nanosoft desired them {{to power the}} artificial intelligence in their weapons. The G-Police commander Horton is assassinated by Slater's traitorous wingman Ricardo, also to this end. The game ends with {{the destruction of a}} large spacecraft by Slater; the closing sequence reveals that Nanosoft had planned to use this to exert military dominance <b>over</b> <b>other</b> corporations.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta was a {{divisive}} figure; prior to Kenyan independence, {{many of its}} white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, {{he was given the}} honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation. His rulership was criticised as dictatorial and authoritarian, of favouring Kikuyu <b>over</b> <b>other</b> ethnic groups, and of overseeing a growth in corruption and cronyism which have generated long-term problems for Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis has no {{commercial}} uses but {{is sometimes}} kept in reef aquaria. It requires high water movement and bright light to flourish and its health can {{be judged by}} its colour, a yellow hue showing health whereas a darker brown colour can indicate too little light.
