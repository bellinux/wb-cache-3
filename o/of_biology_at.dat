5|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> the {{molecular}} level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly those of genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology is {{a study of the}} interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and how those interactions are regulated.|$|E
5|$|Plath {{was born}} on October 27, 1932, in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. Her mother, Aurelia Schober Plath (1906–1994), was a second-generation American of Austrian descent, and her father, Otto Plath (1885–1940), was from Grabow, Germany. Plath's father was an {{entomologist}} and a professor <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> Boston University who authored a book about bumblebees.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Division <b>of</b> <b>Biology</b> <b>at</b> Caltech, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (and its precursors) at Cambridge, {{and a handful of}} other institutions, the Pasteur Institute became a major center for molecular biology research in the late 1950s. Scientists at Cambridge, led by Max Perutz and John Kendrew, focused on the rapidly developing field of structural biology, combining X-ray crystallography with Molecular modelling and the new computational possibilities of digital computing (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the military funding of science). A number of biochemists led by Frederick Sanger later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of macromolecular structure and function. At the Pasteur Institute, François Jacob and Jacques Monod followed the 1959 PaJaMo experiment with a series of publications regarding the lac operon that established the concept of gene regulation and identified what came to be known as messenger RNA. By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of molecular biology—a model for the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction— was largely complete.|$|E

25|$|The site at Sutton Bonington {{continued}} to grow during {{the latter part of}} the 20th century, during this period the two initial faculties were merged into one: the faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences. The end of the 20th century saw the faculty initially merged with the faculty of Biology to form the School <b>of</b> <b>Biology.</b> <b>At</b> the time this was seen as a move to transfer the biology department from University Park to Sutton Bonington, in a move designed to free up much needed building land, the university however denied that this was their motive. Shortly after the purchase of the new Jubilee Campus, the school was split into the School of life sciences (based at University Park) and the School of Biosciences (based at Sutton Bonington). This period also saw the construction of new Plant and Food science buildings at Sutton Bonington.|$|E
25|$|Chapters of The Second Sex were {{originally}} published in Les Temps modernes, in June 1949. The second volume came {{a few months after}} the first in France. It was very quickly published in America due to the quick translation by Howard Parshley, as prompted by Blanche Knopf, wife of publisher Alfred A. Knopf. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a professor <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> Smith College), much of de Beauvoir's book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message. For years, Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of de Beauvoir's work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars. Only in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.|$|E
