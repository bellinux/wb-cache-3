5|$|The {{south side}} visitor entrance, which now houses a shop and visitor facilities, was {{previously}} the airfield's armoury. The various buildings are arranged roughly {{parallel to the}} A505; AirSpace is furthest east, with Hangars 2, 3, 4 and 5 running westwards, followed by the American Air Museum and the Land Warfare Hall. The museum site is approximately 1800m from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> and a visitor bus operates during opening hours.|$|E
5|$|However, more conveniently, {{a pair of}} indices (n,m) is used instead. The indices {{refer to}} equally long unit vectors at 60° angles to each other across a single 6-member carbon ring. Taking the origin as carbon number 1, the a1 unit vector may be {{considered}} the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 3, and the a2 unit vector is then the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 5. (See the upper {{right corner of the}} diagram at right.) To visualize a CNT with indices (n,m), draw n a1 unit vectors across the graphene sheet, then draw m a2 unit vectors at a 60° angle to the a1 vectors, then add the vectors together. The line representing the sum of the vectors will define the circumference of the CNT along the plane perpendicular to its long axis, connecting <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> In the diagram at right, Ch is a (4,2) vector: the sum of 4 unit vectors from the origin directly to the right, then 2 unit vectors at a 60° angle down and to the right.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal kicked-off {{the match}} {{and within the}} first two minutes forced Manchester United defender Gary Neville to concede a throw-in. In the fifth minute, Manchester United won a free kick, but nothing {{came out of it}} as José Antonio Reyes blocked Paul Scholes's shot. Good play by Reyes and Henry {{fashioned}} a chance for Bergkamp in the ninth minute, but his strike was off target. Two minutes later a shot by Bergkamp from outside the box was saved by Manchester United goalkeeper Tim Howard. Before Henry was about to take a corner for Arsenal in the 16th minute, a cigarette lighter was thrown at him from the section occupied by Manchester United supporters – this resulted in police making two arrests during the game. Quinton Fortune used his pace to get the better of Lauren, but his cross into the Arsenal penalty area was cleared by Pascal Cygan. Arsenal continued to threaten – Henry's free kick prompted Howard to make a save and tip the ball over the crossbar, and Bergkamp came close to scoring in the 27th minute after clever play to lose his marker John O'Shea. The football continued to move from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> with Giggs and Reyes causing problems for their respective defences. In stoppage time {{at the end of the}} first half, Henry had his shot saved by Howard, while Scholes was similarly denied by Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.|$|E

25|$|Some {{satellites}} {{with long}} conductive tethers can also experience orbital decay because of electromagnetic drag from the Earth's magnetic field. As the wire cuts {{the magnetic field}} it acts as a generator, moving electrons from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The orbital energy is converted to heat in the wire.|$|E
25|$|The Edna S. Purcell house, or the “Little Joker,” as Elmslie nicknamed it, {{is known}} for its {{innovative}} arrangement of space. Occupying a deep, narrow lot, the plan of the house was organized on a single axis, open from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> evoking spaciousness within the relatively small interior.|$|E
25|$|The {{equations}} of {{the theory}} of general relativity have valid solutions that contain wormholes. The first type of wormhole solution discovered was the Schwarzschild wormhole, which would be present in the Schwarzschild metric describing an eternal black hole, but it was found that it would collapse too quickly for anything to cross from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Wormholes that could be crossed in both directions, known as traversable wormholes, would only be possible if exotic matter with negative energy density could be used to stabilize them.|$|E

5000|$|Liszt {{initially}} requested Wagner {{to carefully}} translate his {{essay on the}} opera from French into German, {{that he might be}} the principal and long-standing interpreter of the work - a work which, after performing, he regarded as [...] "a sublime work from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other".|$|R
25|$|The university's main {{campus is}} located on Claverton Down, {{approximately}} 1.5 miles from the centre of Bath. The site is compact; {{it is possible to}} walk from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> in fifteen minutes. The design involved the separation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, with road traffic on the ground floors and pedestrians on a raised central thoroughfare, known as the Parade. Buildings would line the parade and student residences built on tower blocks rise from the central thoroughfare. Such plans were mostly followed.|$|E
25|$|The Dallas/Fort Worth Airport had {{recently}} started construction, and a people mover {{was one of}} their requirements. The airport consisted of four semi-circular terminal areas arranged in a line with large parking lots on either ends of the line, and two hotel towers in the middle. It was miles from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> so some form of rapid transit was needed to move people around the complex. DFW wanted the system to transport not only people, but mail, trash, supplies, and baggage as well. Varo Corp. {{had recently}} purchased the Monocab concept from its private developer and were pitching the system to DFW. LTV was asked to join them in a joint proposal, which was submitted late in 1970, along with two others from different providers. However, all three were over the price the airport had budgeted, and the companies were asked to re-submit.|$|E
25|$|Most spider fights {{are done}} with {{a single piece of}} dried coconut leaf midrib (usually taken from a broom made from such midribs; Cebuano: gungi, Tagalog: walis tingting) or bamboo. Spiders are placed at both ends and {{encouraged}} to move toward each other and fight. The sticks are thin enough to ensure that the spiders {{have no choice but to}} meet. It is held by one child who ensures that the spiders do not escape by alternately switching grip from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> How a fight ends is agreed upon beforehand. Fights to the death will end with one spider being bitten, paralyzed, and swiftly wrapped in silk. Non-lethal matches end when one spider falls from the stick (once or several times, depending on the agreement). Occasionally, the child holding the stick may need to quickly intervene in a non-lethal fight to prevent the winning spider from eating the losing spider.|$|E
50|$|The {{collateral}} ligaments of metatarsophalangeal joints are strong, rounded cords, placed one {{on either}} side of each joint, and attached, by <b>one</b> <b>end,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> posterior tubercle {{on the side of the}} head of the metatarsal bone, and, by <b>the</b> other, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contiguous extremity of the phalanx.|$|R

"No," [...] replied his father, [...] "you cannot {{perceive}} {{any difference}} in so short a string, but {{if we had a}} string, or a wire, a mile long, I presume that we should find that it would require a sensible period of time <b>to</b> transmit <b>the</b> vibrations from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other." ...|$|R
50|$|Terminal A {{contains}} gates prefixed A. It {{opened in}} 1971, {{and it is}} used exclusively by flights to and from destinations inside the Schengen Area, including domestic flights within Switzerland. Since its expansion in 1982-1985, it {{takes the form of}} a finger pier, directly connected at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Airside Centre.|$|R
25|$|Fly rods are, {{in modern}} manufacture, almost always {{built out of}} carbon {{graphite}}. The graphite fibres are laid down in increasingly sophisticated patterns to keep the rod from flattening when stressed (usually referred to as hoop strength). The rod tapers from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{and the degree of}} taper determines how much of the rod flexes when stressed. The larger amount of the rod that flexes the 'slower' the rod. Slower rods are easier to cast, create lighter presentations but create a wider loop on the forward cast that reduces casting distance and is subject to the effects of wind. Furthermore, the process of wrapping graphite fibre sheets to build a rod creates imperfections that result in rod twist during casting. Rod twist is minimized by orienting the rod guides {{along the side of the}} rod with the most 'give'. This is done by flexing the rod and feeling for the point of most give or by using computerized rod testing.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} by Datta indirectly supports the idea that memory benefits from sleep. A box was constructed wherein a single rat could move freely from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The bottom of the box was made of a steel grate. A light would shine in the box accompanied by a sound. After a five-second delay, an electrical shock would be applied. Once the shock commenced, the rat could move {{to the other end}} of the box, ending the shock immediately. The rat could also use the five-second delay to move {{to the other end of}} the box and avoid the shock entirely. The length of the shock never exceeded five seconds. This was repeated 30 times for half the rats. The other half, the control group, was placed in the same trial, but the rats were shocked regardless of their reaction. After each of the training sessions, the rat would be placed in a recording cage for six hours of polygraphic recordings. This process was repeated for three consecutive days. During the posttrial sleep recording session, rats spent 25.47% more time in REM sleep after learning trials than after control trials.|$|E
500|$|Thru-hikers {{attempt to}} hike the trail in its {{entirety}} in a single season — more than 2,700 people thru-hiked the trail in 2014 — and some hike from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> {{then turn around and}} thru-hike the trail the other way, known as a [...] "yo-yo". Many books, memoirs, websites, and fan organizations are dedicated to these pursuits.|$|E
50|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence that {{disorders such as}} the Capgras or Fregoli syndromes are associated with disorders of face perception and recognition. However, {{it has been suggested}} that all misidentification problems exist on a continuum of anomalies of familiarity, from déjà vu at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formation of delusional beliefs at the other.|$|R
25|$|The gland's visible, or external, part is {{termed the}} spinneret. Depending on the {{complexity}} of the species, spiders will have two to eight spinnerets, usually in pairs. There exist highly different specialised glands in different spiders, ranging from simply a sac with an opening at <b>one</b> <b>end,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> complex, multiple-section major ampullate glands of the golden silk orb-weavers.|$|R
50|$|The {{frenulum}} (Latin {{for little}} bridle) is an elastic band of tissue attached by its <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clitoral shaft and glans and by its other <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prepuce. It allows two-way shifting of the clitoral hood: firstly, it can extend <b>to</b> let <b>the</b> hood be moved upwards <b>to</b> expose <b>the</b> glans for stimulation or hygienic cleansing, and, secondly. it contracts <b>to</b> pull <b>the</b> hood back <b>to</b> protect it.|$|R
500|$|By retort orientation: [...] "Ex-situ" [...] {{technologies}} are sometimes classified as vertical or horizontal. Vertical retorts are usually shaft kilns where {{a bed of}} shale moves {{from top to bottom}} by gravity. [...] Horizontal retorts are usually horizontal rotating drums or screws where shale moves from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> [...] As a general rule, vertical retorts process lumps using a gas heat carrier, while horizontal retorts process fines using solid heat carrier.|$|E
500|$|Gage's {{thoughts}} on the reasons for colonial unrest {{played an important role}} in furthering the unrest. He at first believed that the popular unrest after the 1765 Stamp Act was primarily due to a small number of colonial elites, led by those in Boston. In 1768 he recommended the deployment of two regiments to occupy Boston, a move that further inflamed the city. Among the troops quartered in the city was the 29th Regiment of Foot, which had previously clashed with colonists in Quebec and New York, and had a reputation for poor discipline. This occupation eventually led to the Boston Massacre in 1770. [...] Later that year he wrote that [...] "America is a mere bully, from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> and the Bostonians by far the greatest bullies." ...|$|E
500|$|The Copenhagen Metro {{opened in}} 2002, with {{additional}} stations opened in 2003, and the M2 branch {{to the airport}} completed in 2007. M1 and M2 are in total [...] long, of which [...] is in tunnels and [...] is elevated. Each line takes 23minutes to travel from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The City Circle Line is intended to form a [...] loop around the city center, with a full circumference taking 25minutes. The plan is for M3 to operate the full circle and for M4 to only operate the eastern half. The system is owned by Metroselskabet, a company owned jointly by the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, {{and the government of}} Denmark. The metro and its 34 trains are operated by the private company Metro Service.|$|E
50|$|Lymphatic {{capillaries}} {{are slightly}} larger in diameter than blood capillaries, and have closed ends (unlike the blood capillaries open at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arterioles and open at <b>the</b> other <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> venules). This structure permits interstitial fluid to flow into them but not out. Lymph capillaries {{have a greater}} internal oncotic pressure than blood capillaries, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> greater concentration of plasma proteins in the lymph.|$|R
