5|$|In 1621, a {{bill was}} {{presented}} to Parliament to renew Magna Carta; although this bill failed, lawyer John Selden argued during Darnell's Case in 1627 that the right of habeas corpus was backed by Magna Carta. Coke supported the Petition <b>of</b> <b>Right</b> in 1628, which cited Magna Carta in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary. The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on Magna Carta. Charles initially did not agree to the Petition <b>of</b> <b>Right,</b> and refused to confirm Magna Carta {{in any way that}} would reduce his independence as King.|$|E
5|$|In response, the House of Commons {{prepared}} {{a set of}} four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the legal requirement of habeas corpus. These were rejected by Charles, who also announced that Parliament would be dissolved; in response, the Commons met on 6 May to discuss alternatives, and concluded that a petition <b>of</b> <b>right</b> was the way forward. Accordingly, a committee under Sir Edward Coke drafted such a petition, and it {{was passed by the}} Commons on 8 May and sent to the House of Lords. After three weeks of debates and conferences between the two chambers, the Petition <b>of</b> <b>Right</b> was ratified by both houses on the 26th and 27 May. Following additional debates in which the King restricted the right of the Commons to freely speak, he bowed to the pressure; in need of Parliamentary support for the war effort, the Petition was accepted on 2 June. Unhappy with the method chosen, both houses joined together and demanded the King fully ratify the Petition, which he did on 7 June.|$|E
40|$|State bills <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> {{preceded the}} federal Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights.</b> From June 1776, when the Virginia Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> (the first state bill <b>of</b> <b>rights)</b> was adopted, until December 1791, {{when the federal}} Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> was ratified, eight states each adopted a bill <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> as a {{separate}} part of their state constitution.

It is likely that the framers of the Constitution thought that the first bulwark of defense for the protection <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> citizens would be state bills <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> One reason given at the 1787 Convention for not adding a bill <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> to the completed Constitution was that the state bills <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> remained undisturbed and were 2 ̆ 2 sufficient 2 ̆ 2 to protect against oppression by government...|$|R

5|$|Brown {{was elected}} to Parliament on his second attempt as a Labour MP for Dunfermline East in 1983 general election.

Brown was Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1987 to 1989 and then Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, before becoming Shadow Chancellor in 1992. Having led the Labour Movement Yes campaign, refusing to join the cross-party Yes for Scotland campaign, during the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum, while other senior Labour politicians – including Robin Cook, Tam Dalyell and Brian Wilson – campaigned for a No vote, Brown was subsequently a key participant in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, signing the Claim <b>of</b> <b>Right</b> for Scotland in 1989.|$|E
50|$|However, {{in order}} to apply the Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> indirectly, a court must {{obviously}} {{determine the effect of}} the provisions of the Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights.</b> A court cannot interpret or develop the ordinary law with reference to the values contained in the Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> without knowing what they are.

The first English Army regiments, including elements of the disbanded New Model Army, were formed between November 1660 and January 1661 and became a standing military force for Britain (financed by Parliament). The Royal Scots and Irish Armies were financed by the parliaments of Scotland and Ireland.

5|$|Coke {{undertook}} {{the central}} role in framing and writing the Petition <b>of</b> <b>Right.</b> The ongoing struggles over martial law and civil liberties, along with {{the rejection of the}} Resolutions seriously concerned the Commons. Accordingly, Coke convinced the Lords to meet with the Commons in April 1628 in order to discuss a petition to the King confirming the rights and liberties of royal subjects. The Commons immediately accepted this, and after a struggle, the Lords agreed to allow a committee chaired by Coke to draft the eventual document. Hearing of this, the King sent a message to Parliament forbidding the Commons from discussing matters of state. The resulting debate led to some MPs being unable to speak due to their fear that the King was threatening them with the destruction of Parliament. Coke, despite the fear in Parliament, stood and spoke, citing historical precedents supporting the principle that members of the Commons could, within Parliament, say whatever they wished – something now codified as Parliamentary privilege.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been officially}} {{suspended}} {{at the end}} of the Cromwellian regime, parliament returned after the Restoration of Charles II in 1661. This parliament, later known disparagingly as the 'Drunken Parliament', revoked most of the Presbyterian gains of the last thirty years. Subsequently Charles' absence from Scotland and use of commissioners to rule his northern kingdom undermined the authority of the body. James' parliament supported him against rivals and attempted rebellions, but after his escape to exile in 1689, William's first parliament was dominated by his supporters and, in contrast to the situation in England, effectively deposed James under the Claim <b>of</b> <b>Right,</b> which offered the crown to William and Mary, placing important limitations on royal power, including the abolition of the Lords of the Articles.
