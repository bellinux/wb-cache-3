5|$|In {{his early}} years with the Steelers, Greene was at times uncontrollable, and often let his temper get the best <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> <b>On</b> one {{occasion}} during a 1975 game against the rival Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Municipal Stadium, Greene repeatedly kicked Browns lineman Bob McKay in the groin while McKay {{was lying on the}} ground. He also punched Denver Broncos guard Paul Howard and spat at quarterback Fran Tarkenton, and he frequently clashed with officials.|$|E

Chance was scouted by other teams, but chose the Cubs as Tim Donohue was the only catcher ahead <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the Cubs' depth chart.|$|E

The art is by Ann Hirsch of Somerville, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston. The statue was unveiled on November 1, 2013, with Russell in attendance.|$|E
5|$|Dean was {{the highest}} ranking UN {{prisoner}} of war of the Korean War. He was also the highest ranking Medal of Honor recipient. His story of capture and imprisonment by the North Koreans was recorded by numerous publications. His initial capture was covered by Life Magazine in July 1950 with a photo essay detailing his life. In December 1951, when he was discovered to be alive, TIME Magazine did an article on his story and imprisonment, featuring an image <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the magazine's front cover. He subsequently received more attention from the press. Multiple media outlets attempted to interview Dean but the North Koreans rarely allowed it. Few photos and little information on his status was released, mostly that which showed him in good condition. After his release, Dean's story, as well as Lee's, was told in Life Magazine.|$|E

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} Brussels sprout farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} {{the purchase of}} a tractor with her father Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him aside to tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in men like them, and that Esther is probably just dating him so that her father can take advantage <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the tractor deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E

He was on pace to win the stage, but he dramatically crashed in the final kilometer, with his bike skidding well out in front <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the wet cobbles. Support staff from his team car gave him a very quick bike change and he was back up in moments, finishing 24 seconds back on the stage to preserve his overall victory in the Giro.|$|E
5|$|In Austria, Kepler {{left behind}} such a {{historical}} legacy {{that he was}} one of the motifs of a silver collector's coin: the 10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin, minted on September 10, 2002. The reverse side of the coin has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas. Kepler was acquainted with Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg personally, and he probably influenced the construction of Eggenberg Castle (the motif of the obverse of the coin). In front <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from Mysterium Cosmographicum.|$|E

In the magazine, Chappuis and his future wife were also featured about the Michigan campus. He expressed an interest in first playing professional football for a few years before going into the porcelain business with his father.|$|E
5|$|Talented but temperamental, Pistrucci {{refused to}} copy the work of other artists. When in 1823 George IV demanded that an unflattering {{portrait}} <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the coinage be changed with a new likeness {{to be based on}} the work of Francis Chantrey, Pistrucci refused and was nearly sacked. The Mint did not dismiss him, lest the money already spent on the Waterloo Medal be wasted. Pistrucci kept his place with the Mint for the rest of his life, eventually completing the Waterloo Medal in 1849, though because of its great size it could not be struck. After Pistrucci's death, the George and Dragon design was restored to the sovereign coin, and is still used today.|$|E
5|$|Against the Baltimore Ravens in {{the preseason}} opener on August 11, Kafka {{replaced}} Young at quarterback during the second quarter and played into the fourth quarter. He went 13-of-19 for 132yards with one interception thrown to Ravens safety Bernard Pollard in the game. In {{the second week of}} the preseason on August 18 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kafka entered the game in the fourth quarter and led the Eagles to two scoring drives in a 24–14 loss. With less than four minutes remaining in the game, he threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Gerald Jones, and with only 19 seconds left on the following drive, threw a second touchdown pass to Jones for sevenyards. He finished the game going 14-for-19 for 160yards along with the two scores. Kafka played in garbage time in the next preseason game against the Cleveland Browns, handing the ball off twice and kneeling down twice. Against the New York Jets {{in the preseason}} finale, he filled in for the injured Young, who started the game, to start the third quarter. Kafka had the wind knocked out <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a sack, but was able to play the rest of the game despite a rib contusion. He finished the game 7-for-11 for 76yards and one interception. He went 34-for-49 for 369yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the preseason overall.|$|E

5|$|Edwards passed Earnhardt {{to reclaim}} the lead on lap 195, while Earnhardt lost a further {{position}} after Kenseth got ahead <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the same lap. Ten laps later, Biffle moved ahead of Harvick to take fifth place, while his teammate Kenseth had a 1.5-second lead over the second-place Edwards by the 211th lap. Three laps later, the seventh caution was issued when officials located debris in the turn-two groove. The leaders, including Edwards, chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments. One tire from Edwards' car went outside his pit box {{but he was not}} penalized because a cameraman blocked Edwards' crew from retrieving the tire. Kenseth led the field back up to speed on the lap-219 restart; Earnhardt was in second place and Edwards third. Casey Mears hit Vickers, who spun and triggered the eighth caution on lap 224; both drivers avoided contacting the wall. Kenseth maintained the lead on the lap-227 restart. Edwards drove up the track in an attempt to take the lead on lap 229, but Kenseth kept the position. Four laps later, the ninth caution was needed when Dale Jarrett spun and hit the turn-two outside wall. Kenseth remained the leader at the restart on lap 236. Edwards passed teammate Kenseth for the lead two laps later, and began to pull away. Earnhardt caught up to Kenseth by lap 243 and ten laps later he passed Kenseth for second.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable moments in the race came from a near-fatal {{accident}} when stunt man Joe Canutt, Yakima Canutt's son, was tossed into the air by accident; he incurred a minor chin injury. Marton {{wanted to keep the}} shot, but Zimbalist felt the footage was unusable. Marton conceived the idea of showing that Ben-Hur was able to land on and cling to the front of his chariot, then scramble back into the quadriga while the horses kept going. The long shot of Canutt's accident was cut together with a close-up of Heston climbing back aboard, resulting in one of the race's most memorable moments. Boyd did all but two of his own stunts. For the sequence where Messala is dragged beneath a chariot's horses and trampled, Boyd wore steel armor under his costume and acted out the close-up shot and the shot <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> his back, attempting to climb up into the horses' harness to escape injury. A dummy was used to obtain the trampling shot in this sequence.|$|E

25|$|In {{the words}} of one reviewer, “The play is refreshingly {{illuminating}} on the relationship between Socrates’ execution and the lasting influence of Aristophanes’ negative depiction <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the evolution of the Athenian psyche.” According to another, the play not only gives an entertaining portrayal of Plato's famous mentor, but also a fascinating introduction to the “pompous, arrogant and often petulant” individual presented by Aristophanes, giving modern audiences a greater understanding of why Socrates eventually ended up being sentenced to death.|$|E
