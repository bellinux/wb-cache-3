40|$|Despite {{widespread}} acknowledgement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex, holistic and context-specific nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coaching</b> process, {{research has}} rarely focused upon coaching {{practice as a}} comprehensive, integrated and situated endeavour. This thesis examined <b>the</b> <b>coaching</b> process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head <b>coach</b> <b>of</b> a national women's rugby union team using data collected throughout a competitive international season. A methodological bricolage consisting of ethnographic participant observation, systematic practice observations, audio-visual recordings, semi-structured interviews and stimulated recall interviews was adopted to investigate both the broad parameters and detailed properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coach's</b> work. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data led to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a grounded theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coaching</b> process, which {{was found to be}} constituted by <b>the</b> interactions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coach,</b> a variety <b>of</b> associates, and <b>the</b> <b>coaching</b> context. Numerous and interrelated personal, social and contextual factors were identified that functioned to create opportunities and challenges that <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> responded to through their practice. The findings contribute to a fuller understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complexity and holism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coaching</b> process in top-level women's rugby union, as well as a valuable conceptual framework and methodology to guide and conduct future research in different contexts...|$|R

He also returned to Australia during the Czech offseason and played for the Sydney Ice Dogs of the Australian Ice Hockey League.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{appointment}} of the first Chamois Niortais manager, the Swiss coach Franchina, there have been 31 different first-team managers. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coaches,</b> Kazimir Hnatow, Robert Charrier and Pascal Gastien, have {{had more than one}} spell in charge of the club. The current manager is Pascal Gastien, who was given the job in 2009 after Denis Troch was sacked following the side's relegation from the Championnat National. Gastien, a former Chamois Niortais player, is currently in his third spell as manager. To date, the only manager to have coached the club in the top division of French football is Patrick Parizon, during the 1987–88 season. The club's longest-serving manager was Ferdinand Faczinek, who had a five-year tenure between 1943 and 1948.|$|E

The locomotives weighed 44 tons and were largely unsprung, causing severe vibration problems in properties near the line. In {{an effort to}} resolve the problem, four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coaches</b> were fitted with motors, in the first trial in Britain of the Sprague-Thomson-Houston multiple unit control system. The trials were a success, and multiple unit trains were running by 1903.

They worked in this form until about 1910, when batteries were fitted. They were renumbered L22 and L23 in 1929, and were scrapped in 1936 and 1937.|$|E
