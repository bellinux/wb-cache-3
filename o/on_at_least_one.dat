The length of high-voltage transmission lines is nearly {{equal to that of}} the United States (322000 km of 230 kV and above) but transmits far less electricity. The HV transmission lines (132 kV and above) installed in the country is nearly 700000 km (i.e. <b>on</b> average, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> ≥13 kV transmission line within 4.5 km distance). The length of transmission lines (400 V and above and excluding 220 V lines) is 10558177 km as on 31 March 2015 in the country. The spread of total transmission lines (≥400 V) is such that it can form a square matrix of area 36.8 km2 (i.e. <b>on</b> average, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> transmission line within 3 km distance) in entire area of the country.|$|R

50|$|Through their {{correspondence}} in 1654, Fermat and Blaise Pascal helped lay {{the foundation}} for the theory of probability. From this brief but productive collaboration on the problem of points, they are now regarded as joint founders of probability theory. Fermat is credited with carrying out the first ever rigorous probability calculation. In it, he was asked by a professional gambler why if he bet <b>on</b> rolling <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> six in four throws of a die he won in the long term, whereas betting <b>on</b> throwing <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> double-six in 24 throws of two dice resulted in his losing. Fermat showed mathematically why this was the case.|$|R

5|$|Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a {{negative}} score are automatically {{eliminated from the}} game at that point and awarded the third place prize. <b>On</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played. This rule is still in-place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested {{that it is not}} set in stone and that executive producer Harry Friedman may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur. During Celebrity Jeopardy! games, contestants with a $0 or negative score are given $1,000 for the Final Jeopardy! round.|$|E
5|$|Governor David Paterson's {{selection}} process {{began with a}} number of prominent names and high-ranking New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she could be a good complement to Chuck Schumer. Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice {{in the days before the}} official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.|$|E
5|$|Hybridisation {{between the}} Eurasian tree sparrow {{and the house}} sparrow has been {{recorded}} {{in many parts of}} the world with male hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with the house sparrow. A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. <b>On</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young. A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta, which are intermediate between the Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis) and Italian sparrows (P. italiae), was recorded in Malta in 1975.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} years, {{independent}} Vermont continued to experience rapid population growth, and Allen sold {{a great deal}} of his land, but also reinvested much the proceeds in more land. A lack of cash, complicated by Vermont's currency problems, placed a strain on Fanny's relatively free hand on spending, which was further exacerbated by the cost of publishing Reason, and of {{the construction of a new}} home near the mouth of the Onion River. He was threatened with debtors' prison <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> occasion, and was at times reduced to borrowing money and calling in old debts to make ends meet.|$|E
5|$|Justice Simpson's {{report was}} tabled in the House of Representatives on 28 June 1951 {{by the new}} Minister for Civil Aviation, Larry Anthony. The Inquiry found that the Amana {{suffered}} total loss of engine power <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> occasion, followed by rapid loss of height until it struck the ground. However, the evidence did not allow the court to {{determine the cause of}} the total loss of engine power. Consequently, the court was unable to determine the cause of the accident. Simpson stated he was satisfied water had not been introduced into the Amana's fuel system in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth.|$|E
5|$|The {{participants}} are ranked {{based on their}} individual scores. Medals are awarded to the highest ranked participants; slightly {{fewer than half of}} them receive a medal. The cutoffs (minimum scores required to receive a gold, silver or bronze medal respectively) are then chosen so that the numbers of gold, silver and bronze medals awarded are approximately in the ratios 1:2:3. Participants who do not win a medal but who score seven points <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> problem receive an honorable mention.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} of the engines was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises – sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by a very loud, high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> occasion. The Investigators did not find a likely source for the water.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the rates of self-harm are much higher among young people with the average age of onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young people could be as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E

5|$|Each {{station was}} {{built as a}} one-storey {{building}} around a square courtyard. The side adjacent to the railway line was left open, and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side. Other than the brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, {{and a set of}} apartments for LNC staff. The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed (permitted to sell alcohol). The train crews would generally wait in these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London, and <b>on</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> occasion (on 12 January 1867) the driver became so drunk that the fireman had to drive the train back to London. This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR and from that time the LNC provided the train crew with a free lunch, provided they drank no more than one pint of beer.|$|E
5|$|Izsha is a zerg advisor {{in service}} to Sarah Kerrigan. She is a unique type of zerg; one of a kind. Izsha exemplifies a {{midpoint}} for Kerrigan, standing between Kerrigan's cold rationality and the feral nature of the Swarm. She harkens back to {{the ideology of the}} Overmind, but is still a rational individual. In earlier times, Kerrigan used her to store her thoughts and plans. <b>On</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> occasion she entrusted Izsha with a plan to infest a planet using the hyper-evolutionary virus through its water supply. Izsha reunited with Kerrigan following the latter's de-infestation and subsequent return to the Swarm.
