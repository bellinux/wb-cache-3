5|$|Using a {{technique}} pioneered <b>on</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> the Future Part II, another {{shot with a}} different lighting scheme was filmed. By combining separate key light and fill light passes, optical effects could generate any amount of contrast they wanted without causing spillage. Because Paramount continued to add new shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and {{a shot of the}} Bird of Prey firing. Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.|$|E

TransÉnergie mainly relies <b>on</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> back HVDC converters to export or import electricity from other jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of the {{national}} championship game was tightly contested, with neither team leading by more than six points. At halftime, the score was tied at 31. Wisconsin scored first in the second half, and slowly built the lead as high as nine points. However, Duke fought back, and tied the score at 54 with 7 minutes to go. Duke took the lead {{for the first time in}} the second half with 5:30 remaining, but the game remained tight. With 3:30 remaining, Duke held a one-point lead, when Jahlil Okafor re-entered the game after sitting most of the second half in foul trouble. He scored <b>on</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> back possessions, giving Duke a 63–58 lead. After that, the closest Wisconsin got was 66–63 with 45 seconds left. Duke hit two foul shots and Wisconsin did not score again for a 68–63 final margin. The win gave Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski his fifth title, putting him in second place all-time for Division I Men's Basketball Titles.|$|E

25|$|Dallas {{played into}} their {{traditional}} Thanksgiving home game, this time against division rival Philadelphia. Both teams were vying {{for first place}} in the division with identical 8–3 records. The Eagles got off to a fast start and the Cowboys were unable to catch up, losing 33–10. They would rebound the next week where on the road Thursday night game they defeated Chicago 41–28 for their 9th win of the year to clinch their first winning season since 2009. This {{was the first time that}} Dallas played <b>on</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> back Thursdays. Week 15 was a rematch against 1st place Philadelphia. This time it was the Cowboys who got off to a fast start going up 21–0. Then the Eagles put up 24 answered points but Dallas came back to win 38–27 to go into first place for the first time in the season and improve to 10–4. Going into their Week 16 matchup at home against Indianapolis, Dallas was in a position to clinch their first division title since 2009 by defeating the Colts thanks to the Eagles losing that week to the Redskins. They would not disappoint as they blew out the Colts 42–7 to become the 2014 NFC East Champions, eliminating the Eagles from the playoffs. Dallas would end the regular season with a 12–4 record and an 8–0 away record when they won on the road against Washington 44–17. They would also finish December 4–0 which was huge for the Cowboys since they had struggled in the recent years in the month of December.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{night on}} Raw, Owens entered a feud with Dolph Ziggler, {{with the two}} trading victories over each other <b>on</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> back episodes of Raw. On the February 15 episode of Raw, Owens won the Intercontinental Championship for a second time, defeating former champion Dean Ambrose, Stardust, Tyler Breeze and Ziggler in a fatal five-way match. At Fastlane, Owens successfully defended the Intercontinental Championship against Ziggler. On March 12, Owens defeated AJ Styles in a 30-Minute Iron Man match at a live event in Atlantic City, New Jersey to retain his championship. At WrestleMania 32, Owens defended the Intercontinental Championship in a ladder match against Sami Zayn, Dolph Ziggler, The Miz, Stardust, Sin Cara and Zack Ryder; Owens lost the title when Ryder won the match after Zayn took {{him out of the}} match. The night after WrestleMania on Raw, Owens faced AJ Styles, Chris Jericho, and the returning Cesaro in a fatal four-way match to determine the #1 contender for Roman Reigns' newly won WWE World Heavyweight Championship; however, Owens lost the match when Styles pinned Jericho. He resumed the feud with longtime rival Sami Zayn after he attacked him on Raw, which led to a match at Payback, where Owens defeated Zayn. At Extreme Rules, Owens faced Zayn, Cesaro and Miz in a fatal four-way match for the Intercontinental Championship, but failed to regain the title when Miz pinned Cesaro. Despite not winning the Intercontinental title, this match meant Owens had become the only other WWE wrestler, besides The Undertaker, to appear on every pay-per-view event in their debut year on the main roster. The following night on Raw, Owens defeated AJ Styles to qualify for the 2016 Money in the Bank ladder match, but he failed to win the match.|$|E
500|$|On 10 October, Wings taped [...] "Getting Closer" [...] at Abbey Road, {{along with}} a demo of [...] "Baby's Request".

The band then continued with overdubs on these and other songs intermittently through October and November, finishing at Abbey Road on 1 December.|$|E

500|$|Although London Town had {{featured}} a significant level of contribution from Laine as a songwriter, {{all but one}} of the songs <b>on</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> the Egg are credited to McCartney alone. The album was originally planned around a loose conceptual theme, about which authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter write in their book Eight Arms to Hold You: [...] "The idea was to have a theme of a working band, getting back on the road... or 'back to the egg' (or protective shell) of touring." [...] In the original LP format, the two album sides were labelled with the egg-related titles [...] "Sunny Side Up" [...] and [...] "Over Easy".|$|E

Frustrated at the {{impending}} unavailability of Abbey Road's Studio Two – which studio owner and record company EMI needed for its other acts, besides Wings – McCartney had constructed an exact replica of Studio Two in the basement at MPL. Among the work done <b>on</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> the Egg at Replica, the band replaced the final twenty seconds of [...] "So Glad to See You Here" [...] with what Madinger and Easter describe as [...] "a reggae-styled coda", containing the [...] "We're Open Tonight" [...] reprise.|$|E

[...] In 1931, his work on Resurrection was described as [...] "... brilliant and sweeping". During 1932, Kurrle was the director of photography on ten feature films which were released that year. In September and October 1932, he worked <b>on</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> back films. The first was The Match King, featuring Warren William and Lily Damita, followed by Lawyer Man, starring William Powell and Joan Blondell. Lawyer Man was his final film.|$|E
500|$|Mitch Winehouse later {{revealed}} that the influence for the bold red lipstick, thick eyebrows and heavy eyeliner came from Latinas she saw in Miami, on her trip there to work with Salaam Remi <b>on</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> Black.

At {{the same time that}} the NME Awards nominated Winehouse in the categories of [...] "Best Solo Artist" [...] and [...] "Best Music DVD" [...] in 2008, they awarded her [...] "Worst Dressed Performer."

500|$|The second disc of Back to Basics {{opens with}} [...] "Enter the Circus", {{described}} as a [...] "carnival-creepy orchestration that sounds like Danny Elfman soundtracking Cabaret" [...] by Tampa Bay Times, and followed by the soft rock-inspired [...] "Welcome". [...] "Candyman" [...] draws inspirations from jazz, blues and swing, and was musically inspired by The Andrews Sisters' 1941 hit [...] "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy". Similarly, [...] "Nasty Naughty Boy" [...] also contains elements of jazz and blues and features [...] "blaring horn section" [...] in its arrangement. On [...] "I Got Trouble", Aguilera sings over a blues-inspired theme that is reminiscent of songs by Bessie Smith. [...] "Mercy on Me" [...] features gospel elements, while the acoustic track [...] "Save Me from Myself" [...] is inspired by country rock genre, {{different from any other}} tracks <b>on</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> Basics.|$|E

500|$|The album's opening song is [...] "Reception", an instrumental, {{in which}} McCartney {{attempted}} {{to capture the}} effect of turning a radio dial and finding [...] "about four stations at once". The track features a guitar-controlled synthesizer (played by Juber) over a funk-inspired bassline, and spoken voices, including a reading of part of [...] "The Poodle and the Pug", from Vivian Ellis's opera Big Ben (1946). A brief segment from the track [...] "The Broadcast", which appears later <b>on</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> the Egg, is previewed in this opening piece. The next three songs – [...] "Getting Closer", [...] "We're Open Tonight" [...] and [...] "Spin It On" [...] – adhere to the proposed album-wide concept. Writing in Melody Maker in June 1979, Mark Williams interpreted [...] "Reception" [...] as representing a radio being tuned in a car, whereby [...] "the occupant {{is on his way}} to a gig, hence 'Getting Closer' [...] and, upon arrival, 'We're Open Tonight'". The notion of live performance is then reflected in the sequencing of what Madinger and Easter term [...] "heavier rock tracks such as 'Spin It On'".|$|E
500|$|... "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Dan Gennoe of UK Yahoo!

He further wrote that the song makes [...] "you sit up and take notice" [...] and deemed [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] "the best pop/R crossover" [...] since Beyoncé's [...] "Crazy in Love". Jody Rosen from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the track [...] "whizzes past at such a furious pace", while Kelefa Sanneh for The New York Times praised the song as [...] "the album's glorious, mile-a-minute hit single, which proves once again {{that no one can}} roar like Ms. Aguilera". Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine deemed [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{as one of the best}} tracks <b>on</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> Basics. Jenny Eliscu for Rolling Stone was positive toward the song, selected the track as one of the best materials throughout the first disc. Writing for The Morning Call, Len Righi commented that [...] "Ain't No Other Man", [...] "Understand" [...] and [...] "Slow Down Baby" [...] "put her at Aretha Franklin's doorstep".|$|E
