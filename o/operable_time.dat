Methods:An in vitro study was performed to evaluate the prolonging-effect of self-blood on PMMA bone cement. The effect of prolonging was evaluated by the dough time (TD) and <b>operable</b> <b>time</b> (TO). Moreover, hardness test, squeezing value test and peak temperature test were also conducted to complete the evaluation of this program. Results:The self-blood, especially the plasma, could greatly prolong the handling time of PMMA bone cement without affecting its basic characteristics including hardness, leakage level and peak temperature. On the other hand, we found that in some abnormal conditions, for example with hyperlipemia, self-blood though can also prolong the handling time, would cause some sideeffects. Conclusion: We report a new effective way to prolong the handling time of PMMA bone cement by adding moderate amount of self-blood. But "individualized medicine" should be noticed because some abnormal conditions like hyperlipemia would cause undesired side-effects.

40|$|Purpose: More than 6, 500 megavoltage {{teletherapy}} {{units are}} needed worldwide, many in low-resource settings. Cobalt- 60 units or linear accelerators (linacs) can fill this need. We have evaluated machine {{performance on the}} basis of patient throughput to provide insight into machine viability under various conditions {{in such a way that}} conclusions can be generalized to a vast array of clinical scenarios. Materials and Methods: Data from patient treatment plans, peer-reviewed studies, and international organizations were combined to assess the relative patient throughput of linacs and cobalt- 60 units that deliver radiotherapy with standard techniques under various power and maintenance support conditions. Data concerning the frequency and duration of power outages and downtime characteristics of the machines were used to model teletherapy operation in low-resource settings. Results: Modeled average daily throughput was decreased for linacs because of lack of power infrastructure and for cobalt- 60 units because of limited and decaying source strength. For conformal radiotherapy delivered with multileaf collimators, average daily patient throughput over 8 years of operation was equal for cobalt- 60 units and linacs when an average of 1. 83 hours of power outage occurred per 10 -hour working day. Relative to conformal treatments delivered with multileaf collimators on the respective machines, the use of advanced techniques on linacs decreased throughput between 20 % and 32 % and, for cobalt machines, the need to manually place blocks reduced throughput up to 37 %. Conclusion: Our patient throughput data indicate that cobalt- 60 units are generally best suited for implementation when machine operation might be 70 % or less of total <b>operable</b> <b>time</b> because of power outages or mechanical repair. However, each implementation scenario is unique and requires consideration of all variables affecting implementation...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the current state of}} practice for crack sealing/filling. In addition, the INDOT crack sealing/filling practice was experimentally evaluated for the effectiveness of crack sealing/filling, the effectiveness of routing, the performance of the different types of crack sealants and fillers, the validity of sealant performance grade system, and the crack sealing/filling equipment performance. The key findings from an extensive literature review and nationwide/statewide survey performed in 2012 are the following: 1) 65 % of the responses indicated that the routing is required for the crack sealing/filling application; 2) ASTM D 6690 Type II was the most widely used sealant type and only Missouri and Indiana included emulsions in their specifications as crack sealing/filling materials; and 3) crack sealing/filling equipment availability and their maintenance were the biggest concerns. Based on the two-year experimental investigation, the crack sealing/filling was determined to be effective in preventing the occurrence of pavement surface crack distress. The crack sealing/filling was concluded to be effective in maintaining crack integrity and resisting sealant and filler deformations due to the seasonal crack movement. The routing was not determined to be effective in terms of the pavement performances. However, Adhesive/Cohesive/Spalling (ACS) failure results showed that the routed sections significantly outperformed the non-routed sections. In addition, the test results indicated that the ASTM 6690 Type II crack sealants performed relatively well in terms of pavement and crack performance. The correlation between the sealant performance grades and the pavement and crack performances with different types of sealants and fillers were poor and insignificant. The mixed results regarding the effectiveness of the routing were obtained from the literature review and the field evaluation. As a result, it was recommended from the SAC meeting that routing in the 2090 Activity be limited to a single transverse crack (reflective cracks) on asphalt concrete over concrete pavements. INDOT currently uses the ASTM Type II crack sealants, which showed an overall good pavement and crack performances in the evaluation. Therefore, the current INDOT crack sealant material selection process (ASTM Type II) is concluded to be adequate. The experimental results showed that the cracks on wet pavement treated with HAL had significantly higher bonding between the materials and the asphalt pavement surface than the cracks treated with the conventional air compressor. Therefore, the incorporation of a hot air lance in the wet condition is recommended to extend the <b>operable</b> <b>time</b> and seasonal availability for crack filling and sealing construction (2070 and 2090 Activities) ...|$|E

40|$|Ship {{seakeeping}} operability {{refers to}} the quantification of motion performance in waves relative to mission requirements. This is used {{to make decisions about}} preferred vessel designs, {{but it can also be}} used as comprehensive assessment of the benefits of ship-motion-control systems. Traditionally, operability computation aggregates statistics of motion computed over over the envelope of likely environmental conditions in order to determine a coefficient in the range from 0 to 1 called operability. When used for assessment of motion-control systems, the increase of operability is taken as the key performance indicator. The operability coefficient is often given the interpretation of the percentage of <b>time</b> <b>operable.</b> This paper considers an alternative probabilistic approach to this traditional computation of operability. It characterises operability not as a number to which a frequency interpretation is attached, but as a hypothesis that a vessel will attain the desired performance in one mission considering the envelope of likely operational conditions. This enables the use of Bayesian theory to compute the probability of that this hypothesis is true conditional on data from simulations. Thus, the metric considered is the probability of operability. This formulation not only adheres to recent developments in reliability and risk analysis, but also allows incorporating into the analysis more accurate descriptions of ship-motion-control systems since the analysis is not limited to linear ship responses in the frequency domain. The paper also discusses an extension of the approach to the case of assessment of increased levels of autonomy for unmanned marine craft...|$|R

40|$|Hindering the {{degradation}} of amines in the CO 2 -capturing process is important both for economical purposes {{when it comes to}} loss of solvent and impacts on the process, and to prevent emissions of volatile degradation compounds such as ammonia, nitrosamines and formaldehyde. To prevent the absorbent from degrading, either a non-degrading absorbent can be developed or a degradation inhibitor can be added to minimize {{the degradation}}. The degradation inhibitors tested in this thesis are meant to inhibit the oxidative degradation that mainly occurs in the absorber. The carbamate polymerization degradation due to CO 2 and temperature has to be addressed on its own. The inhibitor screening apparatus was new, and a part of the assignment was testing this setup. The first experiment conducted on the inhibitor screening apparatus used a gas blend of 6 % O 2 / 2 % CO 2 (N 2 balance). This did not give enough degradation, which caused the need for rebuilding the rig. In the other experiments on the screening apparatus, a gas composition of 98 % O 2 / 2 % CO 2 was used to get sufficient amount of degradation for inhibitor screening. Inhibitor screening experiments were done using 150 mL of a 30 weight% (wt%) 2 -aminoethanol (MEA) solution loaded with 0, 4 mol CO 2 /mol MEA, at 55 &# 176;C with a gas flow of 10 mL/min. To test the stability of the inhibitors at higher temperature, thermal experiments with inhibitors were conducted. 7 mL solution was filled in stainless steel cylinders and heated at 135 &# 176;C, for a period of five weeks. The solution was 30 wt% MEA loaded with 0, 5 mol CO 2 /mol MEA. Hydrazine was screened for inhibitory effect using a circulative closed loop apparatus because of the hazards related to this compound. The experiment was run with air, using a 30 wt% MEA solution loaded with 0, 4 mol CO 2 /mol MEA, at 55 &# 176;C. Since experiments with both 6 % and 98 % oxygen were conducted, it was natural to compare the impact of oxygen concentration on the degradation products. Results indicated that 2 -oxazolidinone (OZD) was preferred at the conditions with high oxygen, while N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) glycine (HeGly) concentrations increased with decreasing oxygen content. The effect of metals on product composition was also investigated. The degradation compound N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) imidazole (HEI) seems to be dependent on the metal concentrations, increasing in the presence of metals. For the inhibitors screened, the inhibition ranged from 23, 59 - 67, 81 %. Two compounds gave an increase in degradation. 1 -hydroxyethane 1, 1 -diphosphonic acid (HEDP) was the only chelating agent stable at thermal conditions. The inhibitors did not appear to have a substantial effect on the carbamate polymerization. Quantification of degradation compounds in the samples was done using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and anion chromatography-electrochemical detector (IC-EC). Amine loss and CO 2 -loading were determined using titration methods. Metal concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Some analyses were done gravimetrically while others were done volumetrically. For comparison purposes, simple density measurements were done, and the data converted according to the amine loss in the sample. The initial intention was to use gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyze the samples from the thermal experiments. The system was however not <b>operable</b> during the <b>time</b> available. ICP-MS analysis was not done in time for the last experiment.

He was leasing the manor of Hedgecourt from the Gage family of Firle at the time. In 1567 John Thorpe took out a 21 year lease on the mill, the mills being described as [...] "newly erected" [...] and having an overshot waterwheel. In 1594, the mill was in the tenancy of Thomas Thorpe, son of John Thorpe. In 1652, the mill was in the tenance of Robert Filkes of Godstone. In 1663, John Finch took out an eleven-year lease on Hedgecourt Mill. A toll chest is mentioned in the lease, indicating that the mill was a corn mill, at least in part. He was still there in 1669, paying a half-yearly rent of Â£14 and tax of 2/-. By March 1670 Joseph Marchant had joined him, but he died in 1674. His widow Sarah took out a lease on the mill in October of that year. The mill passed to her son John in 1688. In 1701, Joseph Marchant (son of John) was at the mill. He built or extended a house in 1701, possibly an extension to the mill. In 1723, Joseph Marchant renewed his lease on the mill and in 1739 James Marchant (son of Joseph) took a sixty-year lease with William Clayton of Marden on 6 acre of Hedgecourt Heath in Horne, on which to erect a windmill. The mill was an open trestle post mill. Joseph Marchant seems to have retired by 1742. An unexecuted lease of 1743 mentions that the miller has permission to take timber for the purpose of making charcoal (used in the smelting of iron). The site remained in the ownership of the Gage family until 1745, when Colonel Edward Evelyn bought it. It was a furnace mill at that time. Edward Evelyn commissioned a map of his new estate.

40|$|It would, of course, be {{incorrect}} {{to attempt}} to draw conclusions as to the dangers and the chances of success of suture of cardiac wounds in man from the results obtained by animal experimentation. Animals are placed in very unfavorable conditions after the operation. They are very restless and cannot be kept quiet. Ideal cleanliness is impossible and the animals may infect their wound by rubbing the external wound against the dirt {{on the floor of}} their cage. From the animal mortality in these investigations no rigid inferences applicable to human beings can therefore be made. Some conclusions of importance can, however, be drawn. Above all, my experiments seem to show that the mammalian heart will bear a much greater amount of manipulation than has hitherto been suspected. Very large wounds of the heart can heal and the healing process occurs in a manner entirely analogous to that in other muscular tissues. Even an extensive suture of the heart-wall of rabbits and dogs, although we know that thereby a large number of muscle fibres are destroyed and replaced by connective tissue, does not interfere with the function of the cardiac muscle as a whole. Can some of the results in the above recorded experiments be, with some restrictions of course, applied to the human heart? I think that this question must be answered in the affirmative. If we compare the knowledge we possess of wounds of the heart in man, with that obtained from animal experiments, and find that they agree in all essential particulars, then we are justified in reasoning by analogy that suture of wounds of the heart in man will give results similar to those obtained in the animal. In the last few decades, the advances made in all the branches of medicineâ€”especially in pathology, bacteriology and surgeryâ€”have been due to a great extent to the generalization of the results of animal experimentation. To the careful and critical investigator, the results obtained in the animal experiment have always been of the greatest value in indicating to him the possibility of results to be obtained by similar procedures in the human body. From the study of wounds of the heart in man, and from the results obtained in my experiments, this conclusion seems therefore justified: wounds of the heart in man, when all other means have been tried and found wanting, can and ought to be closed by suture. The application itself of the suture is devoid of the one great danger that was feared in the past, i. e. of sudden arrest of the heart during the manipulations incident upon the application of the sutures. The number of sutures should be as small as possible so as to limit the amount of connective tissue which will be formed; for all the muscle fibres that are compressed by the sutures eventually atrophy and are replaced by new-formed connective tissue. It is probable that this connective tissue will not lead to degenerative changes in the heart-muscle. On the post-mortem table, fibrous plaques are often found in the otherwise normal human heart. In a number of the muscles of the body fibrous bandsâ€”tendinous intersections as they are calledâ€”are normally found. In the large number of microscopic sections of the heart-muscle that I have examined, I could find no evidence of pathological changes in the muscle fibres some distance from the scar. For similar reasons the suture should always be an interrupted one. We have shown that there are dangers and disadvantages in the continuous suture both on theoretical grounds and in practical use. The sutures should be passed through as little of the heart substance as possible; if they penetrate the epicardium and {{a small part of the}} thickness of the heart-muscle it will generally be sufficient. When the heart's action is not too rapid, each suture should be tied during a diastolic relaxation of the part under treatment. On this point we have not yet any experience in man. Cappelen, in his patient, tied the sutures during systole. Rehn tied them in his case during diastole. Only time and further experience will show how much importance is to be attached to this point. All that can be said, in the present state of our knowledge, is, that on theoretical grounds and from animal experimentation, it must be considered safest to tie the sutures during diastole. On first sight, it might appear difficult to apply sutures to an organ in such constant motion as is the heart. In practice, however, the difficulties have been proven not to be so great as might appear. The heart may be grasped with a forceps and the needle and suture easily passed. It is no more difficult to pass and tie a suture in a large dog than in a small rabbit. Hence we should infer that the difficulties of this procedure in the human heart, are not so great, a fact that has been borne out by the experience of those surgeons who have reported cases of heart-suture in man. The cases will always be few in which this extreme method of treatmentâ€”for so we must style itâ€”is necessary. Indeed, of the patients that come under the care of the surgeon, there are some who will recover from even large heart wounds without any local treatment at all. Cases have been recently reported by Conner, Brugnoli, Hamilton and others, where after wounds as large as three centimetres, the hÃ¦morrhage ceased spontaneously and the patients recovered. One cannot say, therefore, that wounds larger than a certain size must always be sutured. Each case must be carefully considered by itself. When we examine the nine cases of suture of the human heart in man (see pages 487 to 490) we cannot but hope for considerable success from this new method of surgical procedure. Of the nine cases, four recovered entirely, and four died of complications referable to other organsâ€”quite an encouraging record in a few cases. Finally, I may be permitted to summarize these conclusions as follows: 1. Suture of a wound of the heart as a final resort is an operation worthy of consideration in some cases and often justifiable. 2. Suture of wounds of the heart in animals, and also in man, is devoid of the danger of sudden arrest of the heart, due to the manipulation of the heart incident to the procedure, unless Kronecker's coÃ¶rdination centre be injured. 3. The suture should be an interrupted one of silk, applied in most cases so that the epicardium and superficial layers of the myocardium should be the only ones penetrated, and tied, when possible, during diastole. 4. No stated indications can be given as to the cases that are <b>operable</b> or the <b>time</b> when the operation should be done. Each case must be considered by itself for symptoms which would justify operative interference...|$|R
