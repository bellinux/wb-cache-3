5|$|Hurricane Humberto was a {{moderately}} powerful hurricane that briefly affected Bermuda in September 2001. It was the eighth named storm of the season, {{as well as}} the fourth hurricane. It formed on September 21 between Puerto Rico and Bermuda, partially related to previous Hurricane Gabrielle. Humberto passed about 140 miles (225km) west of Bermuda, which spared the island with its strongest winds. After weakening and believed {{to be on the verge}} of dissipating, Humberto unexpectedly restrengthened to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. The intensification was short-lived and the storm dissipated on September 27. There were a series of significant observational flights into the hurricane that produced a wealth <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> the structure of hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990 {{the total}} number of hours flown {{annually}} by the GA sector has remained in the range 1.25–1.35million, the dominant sector being traditional GA flying, which accounts for 0.6million per year. An overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought the annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002. The decline in asset utilisation has led to speculation that the economic health of the GA industry is weakening, though the lack <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> profitability makes this difficult to confirm.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} was controlled with three hydrazine thrusters. The satellite transmitted data {{back to the}} ground with S-Band and Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters, at a rate of 15 Mbit/s and 6 bit quantization. The satellite had three-axis fine attitude control with four wheels, which gave it +/- 0.7 degrees of control. The attitude control system also used horizon scanners, sun sensors, and a command antenna. A freon gas propulsion system allowed the satellite to make fine attitude adjustments. Landsat 2 could store 30 minutes worth <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> two wide-band video tape recorders.|$|E

5|$|The fourth {{tropical}} storm {{of the season}} was first detected by a ship on October 17 southwest of Bermuda; in the HURDAT database, this date {{was considered to be}} the formation date, although the entire lifespan of the storm is unknown due to a lack <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> the system itself. It initially moved east-northeastward, though later began to turn northeastward on October 18. The storm curved slightly towards the east-northeast on October 19, and became extratropical later that day before its dissipation on October 20. The storm maintained its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) for most of its lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1980s crimes {{involving}} {{computers were}} dealt with using existing laws. The first computer crimes were {{recognized in the}} 1978 Florida Computer Crimes Act, which included legislation against the unauthorized modification or deletion <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> a computer system. Over {{the next few years}} the range of computer crimes being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of copyright, privacy/harassment (e.g., cyber bullying, cyber stalking, and online predators) and child pornography. It was not until the 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences. Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983. This was followed by the US Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989 and the British Computer Misuse Act in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Scuba diving {{fatalities}} have a {{major financial}} impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba, and when {{the cause of death}} is recorded as drowning, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.|$|E
