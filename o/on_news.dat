40|$|Different "paradigmatic" {{approaches}} to explain <b>news</b> effects <b>on</b> voting may supplement each other, because their starting points are based <b>on</b> different <b>news</b> types in political campaign news: <b>news</b> <b>on</b> issue positions of parties, <b>news</b> <b>on</b> real-world developments, <b>news</b> <b>on</b> support or criticism for parties, and <b>news</b> <b>on</b> {{success and failure}} of parties. Daily content analysis data and a weekly multiwave panel survey from the 2003 election campaign in the Netherlands are used for a simultaneous test. A logistic regression analysis demonstrates that the paradigmatic approaches supplement each other. The data reveal a huge impact of the news from a campaigner's {{point of view in}} spite of a huge variety in responses to the news at the level of individual respondents. © 2007 International Communication Association...|$|R
