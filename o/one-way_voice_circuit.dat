5000|$|<b>One-way</b> <b>voice</b> link is {{typically}} a radio based communication method used by spy networks {{to communicate with}} agents in the field typically (but not exclusively) using shortwave radio frequencies. Shortwave frequencies were and are generally highly preferred for their long range, as a communications link of 1200 km is easily possible. VHF and UHF frequencies {{can be used for}} <b>one-way</b> <b>voice</b> <b>circuits,</b> but are generally not preferred as their range is at best 300 km (on flat terrain). Since the 1970s infrared point to point communication systems have been used that offer one way voice links, but the number of users was always limited. A Numbers Station {{is an example of a}} <b>one-way</b> <b>voice</b> link, often broadcasting to a field agent who may already know the intended meaning of the code, or use a one-time pad to decode. The Ionosphere can affect certain transmissions in such a way that these signals can be received great distances from their origin, making it an ideal communication method to instruct field agents embedded in a target country as only a relatively simple receiver is needed. There is no need to broadcast covertly, as the message is generally useless to anybody other than the intended target. These numbers stations will continue to broadcast gibberish or random messages according to their usual schedule; this is done to expend the resources of one's adversaries as they try in vain to make sense of the data, and to avoid revealing the purpose of the station or activity of agents by broadcasting solely when needed.|$|R

5000|$|Each Combat Crew has a <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> {{called the}} Hardened Voice Channel which links the five Combat Crews (LCCs) that {{comprise}} the squadron. There is also a <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> called the EWO (Emergency War Order) which links the squadron command posts (one {{of which is the}} wing CP). These two <b>voice</b> <b>circuits</b> work like a party line with all LCCs connected simultaneously. Thus, it is not possible for any of the Combat Crews to have private conversations. The term [...] "EWO" [...] used here is {{not to be confused with}} an actual Emergency War Order message from the National Command Authority. The same term is used to denote both this circuit and the message transmitted over the Primary Alert System.|$|R

50|$|The Pacrim West and Eastern cables {{were part}} of the South Pacific Network of Cables. The South Pacific Network linked Australia and New Zealand with Hawaii and Guam and {{connected}} with networks in the United States, Europe, Japan and South East Asia. It meant a great leap in Australia's international links, being able to handle around 80,000 <b>voice</b> <b>circuits</b> (phone calls), a great increase on the 1984 built Anzcan cable it superseded which could handle only 1,380 <b>voice</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|R
50|$|The word phone {{has a long}} {{precedent}} {{beginning with}} early US wireless voice systems. The term means voice as opposed to telegraph or Morse code. This would include systems fitting {{into the category of}} two-way radio or <b>one-way</b> <b>voice</b> broadcasts such as coastal maritime weather. The term is still popular in the amateur radio community and in US Federal Communications Commission regulations.|$|R

50|$|The Service Evaluation System (SES) was an {{operations}} support system developed by Bell Laboratories and used by telephone companies {{beginning in the late}} 1960s. Many local, long distance, and operator circuit-switching systems provided special dedicated circuits to the SES to monitor the quality of customer connections during the call setup process. Calls were selected at random by switching systems and <b>one-way</b> <b>voice</b> connections were established to the SES monitoring center.|$|R
50|$|For <b>voice</b> <b>circuits</b> (telephone) the {{frequency}} response distortion is usually {{more important than}} dispersion whereas digital signals are highly susceptible to dispersion distortion. For any kind of analogue image transmission such as video or facsimile both kinds of distortion need to be eliminated.|$|R

Using pre-established shortwave frequencies and Maxim's distinctive call sign (W1AW), this station transmits <b>one-way</b> <b>voice</b> and digital bulletins {{in addition to}} morse code training practice. The transmissions are broadcast Monday through Friday with the first broadcast at 9AM ET daily and the last at 11PM ET. During communication emergencies bulletins are broadcast utilizing SSB and FM voice every hour, RTTY at 15 minutes past the hour, and CW at 30 minutes past the hour.|$|R

Only {{a limited number of}} <b>voice</b> <b>circuits</b> were available, and overseas toll calls were expensive.|$|R
5000|$|Call centers don't measure this [...] "virtual queue" [...] time as [...] "queue time" [...] {{because the}} caller is free to pursue other {{activities}} instead of listening to hold music and announcements. The <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> is released between the ACD and the telecommunications network, so the call does not accrue any queue time or telecommunications charges.|$|R
50|$|Q {{signals are}} no longer {{substantially}} used in the maritime service. Morse code is now very rarely used for maritime communications, but in isolated maritime regions like Antarctica and the South Pacific the use of Q Codes continues. Q Codes still work when HF <b>voice</b> <b>circuits</b> are not possible due to atmospherics and the nearest vessel is one ionospheric hop away.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>one-way</b> <b>voice</b> link (OWVL) {{described}} a covert communications system that transmitted messages to an agent's unmodified shortwave radio using the high-frequency shortwave bands between [...] at a predetermined time, date, and frequency contained in their communications plan. The transmissions were {{contained in a}} series of repeated random number sequences and could only be deciphered using the agent's one-time pad. If proper tradecraft was practiced and instructions were precisely followed, an OWVL transmission was considered unbreakable. ... As long as the agent's cover could justify possessing a shortwave radio and he was not under technical surveillance, high-frequency OWVL was a secure and preferred system for the CIA during the Cold War.|$|R

5000|$|Once her <b>voice</b> <b>circuits</b> are activated, The Machine {{provides}} spoken {{feedback to}} the player {{on his or her}} shots. The Machines voice is provided by Chicago-based singer Stephanie Rogers.

50|$|Manned missions, {{beginning}} with Project Mercury in 1958, demanded a real-time <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> {{in addition to}} data circuits, and improved reliability. Specifications for the Mercury Network were issued on May 21, 1959, establishing a baseline with a mission control center in Cape Canaveral (later Houston), data convergence at Goddard, and switching stations overseas to provide redundancy and trunking over expensive transoceanic cables. These decisions would shape NASCOM for years to follow.|$|R
50|$|This {{has led to}} the use of Voice Coders (vocoders) {{to achieve}} tight {{bandwidth}} compression of the speech signals. NSA's STU-III, KY-57 and SCIP are examples of systems that operate over existing <b>voice</b> <b>circuits.</b> The STE system, by contrast, requires wide bandwidth ISDN lines for its normal mode of operation. For encrypting GSM and VoIP, which are digital anyway, the standard protocol ZRTP could be used as an end-to-end encryption technology.|$|R

50|$|While circuit {{switching}} {{is commonly used}} for connecting <b>voice</b> <b>circuits,</b> {{the concept of a}} dedicated path persisting between two communicating parties or nodes can be extended to signal content other than voice. Its advantage is that it provides for continuous transfer without the overhead associated with packets making maximal use of available bandwidth for that communication. Its disadvantage is that it can be relatively inefficient because unused capacity guaranteed to a connection cannot be used by other connections on the same network.|$|R
