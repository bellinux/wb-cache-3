Hundreds more <b>online</b> <b>journals</b> are promised by publishers in 1996. Despite this {{it is clear that the}} new 'online' medium is not being exploited since many new <b>online</b> <b>journals</b> are simply electronic editions of paper journals. The survey highlights this dilemma. Aimed at publishers, content producers, editors, authors and archivists, the publication data presented are analysed to indicate the nature and form of these <b>online</b> <b>journals</b> as well as something of their history, to discover trends and to highlight features which may project the shape and publication processes of future <b>online</b> <b>journals</b> beyond the immediate prospect of paper-dominated electronic editions. The paper also surveys journal awareness lists, from which many of the journals included were discovered, comparing the numerous lists now available and briefly assessing their reliability for discovering <b>online</b> <b>journals...</b>|$|R

25|$|Since the 19th century, Cornwall, {{with its}} unspoilt {{maritime}} scenery and strong light, has sustained a vibrant visual art scene of international renown. Artistic activity within Cornwall was initially centred on the art-colony of Newlyn, most active {{at the turn}} of the 20th century. This Newlyn School is associated with the names of Stanhope Forbes, Elizabeth Forbes, Norman Garstin and Lamorna Birch. Modernist writers such as D. H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf lived in Cornwall between the wars, and Ben Nicholson, the painter, having visited in the 1920s came to live in St Ives with his then wife, the sculptor Barbara Hepworth, at the outbreak of the second world war. They were later joined by the Russian emigrant Naum Gabo, and other artists. These included Peter Lanyon, Terry Frost, Patrick Heron, Bryan Wynter and Roger Hilton. St Ives also houses the Leach Pottery, where Bernard Leach, and his followers championed Japanese inspired studio pottery. Much of this modernist work can be seen in Tate St Ives. The Newlyn Society and Penwith Society of Arts continue to be active, and contemporary visual art is documented in a dedicated <b>online</b> <b>journal.</b>|$|E

Like Agid, Todd Ramlow of PopMatters lamented the production's fixation on binary gender, but he found positive qualities in its presentation of some of the struggles and anxieties a transgender person might experience. [...] "It prods us to think seriously about transgender issues, and to… create more inclusive communities." [...] In his final analysis, he gave the series three stars out of ten.|$|E
