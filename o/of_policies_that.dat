25|$|The term White Australia policy {{comprises}} various historical {{policies that}} effectively barred people of non-European descent from immigrating to Australia. There {{was never any}} specific policy titled as such, but the term was invented later to encapsulate a collection <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> were designed to exclude people from Asia (particularly China) and the Pacific Islands (particularly Melanesia) from immigrating to Australia. These policies were progressively dismantled between 1949 and 1973.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, the {{government}} initiated economic reforms (Doi Moi) {{to the corporate}} sector to reinvigorate the ailing economy. These policies aimed to reverse most <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> led to economic crises in the 1970s and 1980s following the Vietnam War. Development {{of the private sector}} was encouraged and the economy was liberalized in hopes of increasing the potential for economic development. In 1987, the Law on Foreign Investment was passed, allowing foreign investors into the country.|$|E
25|$|The daily brownouts {{that plagued}} the economy were also {{addressed}} through the enactment <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> placed guaranteed rates. The economy {{during the first}} year of Ramos administration suffered from severe power shortage, with frequent brownouts, each lasting from 8 to 12 hours. To resolve this problem, the Electric Power Crisis Act was made into law together with the Build-Operate-Transfer Law. Twenty power plants were built because of these, and in effect, the administration was able to eliminate the power shortage problems in December 1993 and sustained economic growth for some time.|$|E

25|$|Numerous criticisms {{have been}} made {{regarding}} the use of impact factors. For one thing, the impact factor might not be consistently reproduced in an independent audit. There is also a more general debate on the validity of the impact factor as a measure of journal importance and the effect <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> editors may adopt to boost their impact factor (perhaps to the detriment of readers and writers). Other criticism focuses on the effect of the impact factor on behavior of scholars, editors and other stakeholders. Others have criticized the impact factor more generally on the institutional background of the neoliberal academia, claiming that what is needed is not just its replacement with more sophisticated metrics but a democratic discussion on the social value of research assessment and the growing precariousness of scientific careers.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1955 and 1956, Nasser {{pursued a}} number <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> would {{frustrate}} British aims throughout the Middle East, {{and result in}} increasing hostility between Britain and Egypt. Nasser saw Iraq's inclusion in the Baghdad Pact as indicating that the United States and Britain had sided with his much hated archenemy Nuri as-Said's efforts {{to be the leader}} of the Arab world, and much of the motivation for Nasser's turn to an active anti-Western policy starting in 1955 was due to his displeasure with the Baghdad Pact. For Nasser, attendance at such events as the Bandung conference in April 1955 served as both the means of striking a posture as a global leader, and of playing hard to get in his talks with the Americans, especially his demand that the United States sell him vast quantities of arms.|$|E
25|$|The INPFC treaty {{worked in}} concert with {{multiple}} bi-lateral treaties between Canada, Japan, the USSR, and the USA to create a tapestry <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> formed a North Pacific fisheries management regime. The first significant change to the INPFC treaty came in 1978 {{after a year of}} negotiations between members about access to salmon outside of a country's potential Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)—a concept developed at the third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) in 1973. Most provisions of the original treaty remained in place and a new abstention line at 175° east longitude was developed for Japanese salmon fisherman. The conclusion of UNCLOS III in 1982 and ongoing discussions of a moratorium on pelagic salmon fishing in the North Pacific prompted calls for a re-negotiation of an international salmon treaty by Canada, the USA, and the USSR. Japan at first objected to these calls, believing the INPFC framework currently in place to be sufficient, but agreed to re-negotiate a treaty in fear of being excluded from international salmon talks.|$|E

500|$|Per the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, {{reconciliation}} {{cannot be}} subject to a filibuster. But reconciliation is limited to budget changes, which is why the procedure was not used to pass ACA in the first place; the bill had inherently non-budgetary regulations. Although the already-passed Senate bill could not have been passed by reconciliation, most of House Democrats' demands were budgetary: [...] "these changes—higher subsidy levels, different kinds of taxes to pay for them, nixing the Nebraska Medicaid deal—mainly involve taxes and spending. In other words, they're exactly the kinds <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> are well-suited for reconciliation." ...|$|E

500|$|United States – Amnesty International {{writes that}} [...] "The United States signed the Covenant in 1979 under the Carter {{administration}} {{but is not}} fully bound by it until it is ratified. For political reasons, the Carter administration did not push for the necessary review of the Covenant by the Senate, which must give its 'advice and consent' before the US can ratify a treaty. The Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations took the view that economic, social, and cultural rights were not really rights but merely desirable social goals and therefore {{should not be the}} object of binding treaties. The Clinton Administration did not deny the nature of these rights but did not find it politically expedient to engage in a battle with Congress over the Covenant. The George W. Bush administration followed in line with the view of the previous Bush administration." [...] The Obama Administration stated [...] "The Administration does not seek action at this time" [...] on the Covenant. The Heritage Foundation, a critical conservative think tank, argues that signing it would obligate the introduction <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> it opposes such as universal health care.|$|E
500|$|The Leopold Report was {{the first}} {{concrete}} plan for managing park visitors and ecosystems under unified principles. With an infusion of scientists and resource programs, it set into motion a series of ecologically positive legislative actions in the 1960s and into the 1970s. While direct management of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park continues to spark debate amongst scientists, the report nonetheless successfully influenced multiple areas of park management. Prior to the report's publication, California's Sequoia National Park was beset by a thick underbrush, which the report directly {{referred to as a}} [...] "dog-hair thicket... a direct function of overprotection from natural ground fires". This underbrush would have been naturally eradicated by lightning storms, but because <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> <b>that</b> supported wildfire suppression, the growth threatened the park's Giant Sequoia trees. As {{a direct result of the}} report's advice regarding the usefulness of controlled burning, in 1964 the park began performing trial controlled burns, which led to a 1968 policy championing the continuation of burns for the betterment of the park's forest ecosystems. Fire ecologist Bruce Kilgore credited the Leopold Report as being a true catalyst for change, stating that it was the [...] "document of greatest significance to National Park Service [...] policy".|$|E
