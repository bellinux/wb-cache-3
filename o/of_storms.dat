5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of {{thunderstorm}} development. Mature thunderstorms are found near the center of the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. Multicell storms form as clusters <b>of</b> <b>storms</b> but may then evolve into one or more squall lines. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These type <b>of</b> <b>storms</b> are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.|$|E

In 2001 {{glaciologist}} Charles R.

5|$|Pre-season {{forecasts}} by Colorado State University {{called for}} 14named storms and 7hurricanes, of which three {{were expected to}} attain major hurricane status. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) later issued its initial forecast, which predicted 13 to 17named storms, 7 to 10hurricanes and three to fivemajor hurricanes. After several revisions in the projected number <b>of</b> <b>storms,</b> NOAA and CSU lowered their forecasts {{by the middle of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|The 1868 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was among the}} quietest on record, with only four tropical cyclones recorded. Only three seasons had fewer storms than in 1868, and seven had the same number <b>of</b> <b>storms.</b> Initially, there were no known storms during the season, although a re-analysis confirmed the activity. All tropical activity occurred within a 45‑day span. There may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E
5|$|The 1900 Galveston hurricane, {{the deadliest}} natural {{disaster}} {{to hit the}} United States, peaked at an intensity that corresponds to a modern-day Category4 storm.

40|$|Knowing the {{long-term}} frequency <b>of</b> high magnitude <b>storm</b> events that cause coastal inundation {{is critical for}} present coastal management, especially {{in the context of}} rising sea levels and potentially increasing frequency and severity <b>of</b> <b>storm</b> events. Coastal sand dunes may provide a sedimentary archive <b>of</b> past <b>storm</b> events from which long-term frequencies <b>of</b> large <b>storms</b> can be reconstructed. This study uses novel portable optically stimulated luminescence (POSL) profiles from coastal dunes to reconstruct the sedimentary archive <b>of</b> <b>storm</b> and surge activity for Norfolk, UK. Application of POSL profiling with supporting luminescence ages and particle size analysis to coastal dunes provides not only information of dunefield evolution but also on past coastal storms. In this study, seven storm events, two major, were identified from the dune archive spanning the last 140 years. These appear to correspond to historical reports <b>of</b> major <b>storm</b> surges. Dunes appear to be only recording (at least at the sampling resolution used here) the highest storm levels that were associated with significant flooding. As such the approach seems to hold promise to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} frequency <b>of</b> large <b>storms</b> by extending the dune archive records further back to times when documentation <b>of</b> <b>storm</b> surges was sparse...|$|R
5|$|The 2007 Midwest flooding, which {{affected}} the hilly Driftless area of southeast Minnesota {{was the result}} of a training pattern <b>of</b> <b>storms</b> mixing warm moist air from Tropical Storm Erin with cooler Canadian air, resulting in record 24-hour rainfall totals of up to , with a similar flooding event in 2010 as a result of the remnants of tropical storm Georgette in the eastern Pacific and Hurricane Karl in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Northeastern Pacific is {{the second}} most active basin and has the highest number <b>of</b> <b>storms</b> per unit area. The {{hurricane}} season runs between May 15 and November 30 each year, and encompasses the vast majority of tropical cyclone activity in the region. In the 1971–2005 period, there were an average of 15–16 tropical storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4–5 major hurricanes (storms of Category 3 intensity or greater) annually in the basin.|$|E
5|$|Activity in {{the central}} Pacific was also above average. Two {{tropical}} storms formed, as did several tropical depressions. A number <b>of</b> <b>storms</b> moved in from the east. With a total of nine tropical cyclones entering or forming there, this was the fourth highest number since satellite observations began. The first storm formed on June 1. The last storm dissipated December 21, which gives this season the latest known end. However, if December 6, the date the last storm crossed the dateline is taken to be the end, this season has the second latest end, behind the 1983 season and tied with the 1957 season.|$|E

5|$|After {{the season}} began, Dr. Gray {{announced}} he had revised his predictions slightly downwards on August6, citing mild El Niño conditions. His new forecast was thirteen named storms, seven hurricanes, and three reaching major hurricane intensity. On August10, NOAA released an updated prediction as well, with a 90% probability of above-to-near normal activity, {{but the same}} number <b>of</b> <b>storms</b> forecast. CSU issued another forecast on September3, indicating sixteen tropical storms, eight hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. The season ended up with sixteen tropical depressions, fifteen named storms, nine hurricanes, and six major hurricanes, which matched CSU's final prediction on October1.|$|E
5|$|In Vietnam, {{heavy rains}} {{produced}} by the typhoon caused widespread flooding in northern provinces. Early assessments from the Vietnamese flood control committee indicated that 60,000hectares (148,000acres) of rice fields were submerged and 6,700metric tons (7,400short tons) of grain were soaked. High winds also caused extensive damage. At least 29,000homes collapsed and 119,000others were left roofless. Additionally, 572 hospitals or clinics were damaged. Several fatalities were reported in the region; however, they {{had yet to be}} verified by October12. Within two weeks of Brian's passage, Typhoons Angela and Dan struck the country, causing further damage and loss of life. Due to the rapid succession <b>of</b> <b>storms,</b> losses resulting from the three typhoons are difficult to differentiate. Because of the widespread damage caused by the storms, the Vietnamese Government appealed for international assistance.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) {{increased}} {{its efforts to}} train storm spotters to spot key features <b>of</b> <b>storms</b> which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.|$|E
