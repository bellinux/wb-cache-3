5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, {{it was not possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. Following that date, changes to Order 53 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Court permitted an application for a declaration to be made together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E
40|$|After decades <b>of</b> neglect, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is much on <b>the</b> minds <b>of</b> legal {{scholars}} today. In the United States, the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Bush v.

Transition and developing economies have increasingly come to recognize <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in establishing a framework for economic growth and individual liberty. This essay {{provides an overview of}} these debates over the concept and consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. Although American scholars have criticized the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore as violative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, this criticism rests on an erroneous understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. <b>The</b> tradition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, as expressed by Dicey, Oakeshott, Hayek, and others, is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v.

40|$|Formal conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law {{are popular}} among {{contemporary}} legal philosophers. Nonetheless, <b>the</b> coherence <b>of</b> accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law committed to these conceptions is sometimes fractured by elements harkening back to substantive conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. I {{suggest that this}} may be because at its origins <b>the</b> ideal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law was substantive through and through. I also argue that those origins are older than is generally supposed. Most authors tend to trace <b>the</b> ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and natural law back to classical Greece, but I show that they are already recognisable and intertwined as far back as Homer. Because <b>the</b> founding moment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tradition <b>of</b> western intellectual reflection on <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law placed concerns about substantive justice at <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law ideal, it may be hard for this ideal to entirely shrug off its substantive content. It may be undesirable, too, given <b>the</b> rhetorical power <b>of</b> appeals to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law means something quite radical in Homer; this meaning may provide a source of normative inspiration for contemporary reflections about <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law...|$|R

5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences.

5|$|Deceptive {{markings}} on helicopters further complicated matters for NATO pilots. Many of the combatants painted their helicopters {{to look like}} those of organizations that the UN's Zagreb Flight Coordination Center had authorized to fly in restricted space. For example, {{the army of the}} Republika Srpska often painted a Red Cross logo on their helicopters, and Croatian helicopters were given markings similar to those of UN humanitarian aid helicopters. The questionable identity of these helicopters became particularly problematic after the Black Hawk Incident in Iraq, because NATO pilots became more reluctant to engage potential belligerents without clear identification. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> engagement and difficulties in aircraft identification, NATO forces proved unable to stop most unauthorized helicopter flights, resulting in a documented total of 5711 unauthorized flights during the conflict.|$|E

It investigates how {{the court has}} defined and interpreted <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in its jurisprudence. It places this analysis {{against a background of}} more theoretical accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, drawing in ideas of political philosophy. It also provides a comparative assessment, demonstrating how <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law has evolved in the UK, France, and Germany. The book argues that at <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law are <b>the</b> notions <b>of</b> legality and judicial safeguards. It states that the Court has developed <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> legality, which <b>the</b> work analyses in detail, based on that concept. It assesses <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judiciary as an aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Convention on Human Rights, and <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>the</b> substantive contents <b>of</b> law. <b>The</b> book posits that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law as seen at the Court is not mainly utilised with regard to ‘freedom’ rights, but is more concerned with procedural rights. It discusses <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Convention as a constitutional instrument <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European public order, and shows that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and democracy are inextricably linked in <b>the</b> case law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court.

In the retreat through the Omar Pass of the Murov mountain range, many Azeri refugees froze to death. With the last helicopters leaving on April 1, they were forced to walk through the heavy snow at freezing temperatures. Nearly 39,000 civilians were processed into the camps at Yevlakh and Dashkesen with as many as 15,000 unaccounted for.

5|$|Before May 2011, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that a declaration might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Court. The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987), held that it had no power to grant a declaration under Order 53 because a declaration is not a form of prerogative order. If a declaration was sought, it had to be applied for by way of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the parties, or, if not, by originating summons. In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for prerogative orders and declarations, it was not an abuse of process for an applicant to seek redress for a public law right by way of a declaration instead of applying for a prerogative order.|$|E

5|$|Bolívar, {{learning}} about {{the collapse of the}} Cádiz expedition, spent the year 1820 preparing a liberating campaign in Venezuela. Bolívar was aided by Spain's new policy of seeking engagement with the insurgents, which Morillo implemented, renouncing to the command in chief, and returning to Spain. Although Bolívar rejected the Spanish proposal that the patriots rejoin Spain under the Spanish Constitution, the two sides established a six-month truce and the regularization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> engagement under the law of nations on November 25 and 26. The truce did not last six months. It was apparent to all that the royalist cause had been greatly weakened by the lack of reinforcements. Royalist soldiers and whole units began to desert or defect to the patriots in large numbers. On January 28, 1821, the ayuntamiento of Maracaibo declared the province an independent republic that chose to join the new nation-state of Gran Colombia. Miguel de la Torre, who had replaced Morillo as head of the army, took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed when Bolívar returned there in April leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the Battle of Carabobo on June 24, the Gran Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela save for Puerto Cabello and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Bolívar could now concentrate on Gran Colombia's claims to southern New Granada and Quito.|$|E
