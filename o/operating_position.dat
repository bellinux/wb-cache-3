5000|$|A bearing must (1) {{support a}} loading force (for example, {{the weight of}} a rotor) and (2) provide a force {{gradient}} (a restoring force) to hold the rotor in position. Permanent magnets can support weight (in a conventional way, without eddy currents), and without creating destabilizing force gradients, but the Earnshaw theorem precludes achieving stability by this means. Eddy currents can provide a stabilizing force gradient without applying a force at the <b>operating</b> <b>position</b> (for example, when a shaft is centered). Creating this force [...] gradient does not require eddy currents (which are induced in proportion to shaft offset). In practice, eddy currents, and hence resistive losses, can be reduced to small values in normal operation. Dynamic bearings of this class, using permanent magnets and ordinary, resistive conductors, can support load and apply restoring force while dissipating little power (and in principle, none).|$|E
5000|$|The Masters power {{their city}} with a form of atomic energy that {{appeared}} to uneducated and casual observers as a [...] "pool of fire." [...] This description lent itself to {{the title of the}} third novel. It is loosely inferred by the character Jean Paul (Beanpole) to be nuclear fusion. A concentric series of chambers located {{near the center of the}} city and below ground level housed this apparatus; the various doors did not align, so that it was necessary to travel around the perimeter of each chamber to the next entrance. Within the innermost chamber was a single lever that functioned as a main breaker. Moving it from the <b>operating</b> <b>position</b> to the off position deactivated the mechanism, while moving it in the other direction reactivated it. Contact with this lever while the mechanism operated proved instantly fatal to humans.|$|E
5000|$|Ford {{issued a}} nonstandard starter, a {{direct-drive}} [...] "movable pole shoe" [...] design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits. This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay. This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the starter switch. A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated starter relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal <b>operating</b> <b>position,</b> is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the starter drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} starter motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with the ring gear.|$|E

50|$|Another {{latching}} type has a remanent core that {{retains the}} {{contacts in the}} <b>operated</b> <b>position</b> by the remanent magnetism in the core. This type requires a current pulse of opposite polarity to release the contacts. A variation uses a permanent magnet that produces part of the force required to close the contact; the coil supplies sufficient force to move the contact open or closed by aiding or opposing the field of the permanent magnet. A polarity controlled relay needs changeover switches or an H bridge drive circuit to control it. The relay may be less expensive than other types, but this is partly offset by the increased costs in the external circuit.|$|R
5000|$|The CLRVs and ALRVs retain many {{features}} of traditional streetcar design: they collect their electric power by trolley pole {{rather than the}} pantograph more common on modern vehicles, and are unidirectional, with an <b>operating</b> <b>position</b> at only one end and doors on only one side, requiring track loops in order to turn around. Even the ALRVs, which have two body sections connected by an articulation, are shorter than some other modern vehicles, which may {{have as many as}} four articulations. This is because the TTC network is largely a [...] "traditional" [...] streetcar network dating to the 19th century, and not a recent light rail system built to modern standards. The infrastructure already in place and the need for compatibility with a large fleet of existing vehicles meant the CLRVs and ALRVs were built to fit the existing system. The TTC has not had strong reason to upgrade the infrastructure, but the option to buy bidirectional and pantograph trains has been included {{for the next generation of}} European-style vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|By design, it is {{physically}} impossible to mount EF-S lenses on EF-only cameras. This {{is because the}} increased proximity of the lens to the sensor means that on full-frame sensor or 35mm film EF cameras the lens itself would obstruct the mirror's movement and cause damage to the lens and/or camera. While {{it is possible to}} modify the lens such that the physical obstruction is removed, allowing for mounting to EF mount cameras, the rear of the lens would still obstruct the mirror. An additional reason is that the lenses produce a smaller image circle of even illumination (circle of no vignetting). An EF-S lens alignment mark is indicated by a small white rectangle, whereas the EF employs a small red dot. The lens will insert into the body when the alignment marks on each are matched, and the lens can then be rotated and locked into the <b>operating</b> <b>position.</b> EF-S camera bodies have both EF-S and EF alignment marks, while EF bodies have only EF marks. Some have reported success attaching EF-S lenses to full-frame bodies with the use of an extension tube; however, this does not eliminate the vignetting problem, and also removes the lens's ability to achieve infinity focus. Also, attachment of EF-S lenses on EF bodies can often be accomplished by removing the small plastic ring seen in the photo above. Although vignetting is still an issue, photos can be taken, and infinity focus achieved. This modification comes with caveats, one being that on some lenses, like the EF-S 10-22mm, at the 10mm setting, the element protrudes too far back toward EF mount camera bodies.|$|E
50|$|At the 2008 Frankfurt Music Fair, Steingraeber & Söhne {{introduced}} a new grand piano that measures 232 cm in length, {{as well as a}} grand piano with a Carbon carbon fibre soundboard. This type of construction enhances stability when tuning instruments that are subject to extreme climatic fluctuations. If grand pianos are to be housed in the Tropics or played at outdoor concerts, for example, then carbon fibre soundboards make good sense. The left pedal mechanism has been enhanced: when a pianist depresses the left pedal, this causes the mechanism to shift in the usual way. If he/she continues to depress the pedal, the hammers move closer to the strings, which is similar to what happens in uprights. This facilitates playing at extremely soft, pianissimo dynamic levels. Steingraeber has developed an alternative means of guiding the strings over the bridge; it is based upon earlier ideas that were implemented in trials. Normally, the strings go over two bridge pins in a zigzag pattern. In the case of the Steingraeber alternative, bridge agraffes guide the string through a metal roller and press it down onto the bridge from above. In addition, height-adjustable hitch pins allow the string tension to be adjusted. The thinking behind this design feature is twofold: uniform string tension over the bridge improves energy transmission, and when significant string friction at the bridge pins no longer exists, the ability to tune and to hold a tuning is optimized. At the moment, these are not standard features in the production of grand pianos; clients may order them for an additional fee, however. At Steingraeber, a ball bearing mechanism is available {{as an alternative to the}} standard, leather-covered knuckle roller mechanism. Thus, a lower-friction release of the jack makes improved repetition possible. In upright pianos, Steingraeber incorporates a magnet, rather than a spring, into the tip of the jack and the hammer-butt. The magnet brings the jack back into <b>operating</b> <b>position</b> after the it releases. This system is maintenance free and results in faster, more precise repetition.|$|E
