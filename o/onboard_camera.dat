5|$|As {{he began}} the third orbit, Schirra {{disconnected}} the spacecraft's gyroscopes, turned off part of the electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the <b>onboard</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|E
500|$|Following the court's decision, {{an appeal}} was lodged {{by the state}} {{prosecutor}} against Patrick Head and Adrian Newey. On 22 November 1999, the appeal absolved Head and Newey of all charges, stating that no new evidence had come to light (there was missing data from the black box recorder on Senna's car due to damage, and 1.6 seconds of video from the <b>onboard</b> <b>camera</b> of Senna's car was unavailable because the broadcaster switched to another car's camera just before the accident), and so under Article 530 of the Italian Penal Code, the accusation had to be declared as [...] "non-existent or the fact doesn't subsist". This appeal result was annulled in January 2003, as the Court of Cassation believed that Article 530 was misinterpreted, and a retrial was ordered. On 27 May 2005, Newey was acquitted of all charges while Head's case was [...] "timed out" [...] under a statute of limitations. The Italian Court of Appeal, on 13 April 2007, stated the following in the verdict numbered 15050: [...] "It has been determined that the accident {{was caused by a}} steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control". Even being found responsible for Senna's accident, Patrick Head was not arrested, as the verdict was delivered past the Italian statute of limitation for manslaughter.|$|E

Up to five <b>onboard</b> <b>cameras</b> include Wide-View Front and Rear-View backup cameras. These cameras allow the driver to see around corners. The LED detector Driver Monitoring System warns if the driver is not paying attention and obstacles are detected in the vehicle's path, preventing accidents due to drowsiness or distraction.

30|$|The {{main goal}} of the Venus orbiter mission Akatsuki is to {{understand}} the mechanisms driving the atmospheric circulation and maintaining the cloud layer (Nakamura et al. 2011). For this purpose, five <b>cameras</b> <b>onboard,</b> having bandpass filters, take images of Venus at different wavelengths to observe the horizontal distributions of clouds and minor constituents at different heights. Radio occultation measurement in Akatsuki, termed RS (Radio Science), aims at exploration of the vertical structure of the atmosphere (Imamura et al. 2011), being complementary to the imaging observations by <b>onboard</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|R
