25|$|The {{area was}} {{designated}} as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state</b> in the 1947 UN Partition Plan. The abandoned British police post of Umm Al-Rashrash was taken {{without a fight}} on March 10, 1949, as part of Operation Uvda.|$|E
25|$|However, {{according}} to Gelber, Plan Dalet instructions were: In case of resistance, {{the population of}} conquered villages was to be expelled outside the borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state.</b> If no resistance was met, the residents could stay put, under military rule.|$|E
25|$|Upon <b>the</b> {{implementation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> truce, the IDF {{had control}} over nine Arab {{cities and towns}} or mixed cities and towns: New Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Acre, Safed, Tiberias, Baysan (Beit She'an), Samakh and Yibna (Yavne). Another city, Jenin, was not occupied but its residents fled. The combined Arab forces captured 14 Jewish settlement points, but only one of them, Mishmar HaYarden, was in <b>the</b> territory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> according to Resolution 181. Within <b>the</b> boundaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>state,</b> there were twelve Arab villages which opposed Jewish control or were captured by the invading Arab armies, {{and in addition to}} them, the Lod Airport and pumping station near Antipatris, which were within <b>the</b> boundaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>state,</b> were under <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabs. The IDF captured about 50 large Arab villages outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> and a larger number of hamlets and Bedouin encampments. 350 square kilometers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> were under <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arab forces, while 700 square kilometers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed Arab State were under <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IDF. This figure ignors the Negev desert which wasn't under any absolute control of either side.|$|R

50|$|Many {{members of}} Mahal were World War II {{veterans}} from United States and British Armed Forces. Allied armies were reduced considerably after <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war and many soldiers were demobilised; moreover, the service experience became mundane {{and did not}} suit some servicemen, particularly pilots. In various circumstances they were invited, or heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state's</b> struggle for independence and volunteered. In some cases those who enlisted had no prior military experience. There were Jews and Christians, both ideological supporters of Zionism and mercenaries.|$|R
25|$|When Israel {{became a}} state in 1948, it {{transferred}} all of the property {{under the control of}} the ROCOR within its borders to the Soviet-dominated ROC in appreciation for Moscow's support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state</b> (this support was short-lived). The ROCOR maintained control over churches and properties in the Jordanian-occupied West Bank until the late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Turkey was {{the first}} Muslim-majority nation to {{formally}} recognize the State of Israel, only {{one year after the}} Declaration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> (28 March 1949). Israel was a major supplier of arms to Turkey. Military, strategic, and diplomatic cooperation between Turkey and Israel were given high priority by the governments of both countries, which shared concerns with respect to regional instabilities in the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|While Fackenheim's sentiments {{about the}} need for Jewish {{self-reliance}} {{in the form of a}} Jewish state are immensely popular, Fackenheim fails to locate a religious or divine source for his moral imperative. For Fackenheim, self-defense, and its manifestation in Zionism, are not religious values but rather things that precede religious value or stand outside of it. Thus Fackenheim locates the significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>State</b> in the Holocaust rather than in traditional Judaism...|$|E

25|$|Buber's evocative, {{sometimes}} poetic, writing style {{marked the}} major themes in his work: the retelling of Hasidic and Chinese tales, Biblical commentary, and metaphysical dialogue. A cultural Zionist, Buber {{was active in}} the Jewish and educational communities of Germany and Israel. He was also a staunch supporter of a binational solution in Palestine, and, after the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state</b> of Israel, of a regional federation of Israel and Arab states. His influence extends across the humanities, particularly in the fields of social psychology, social philosophy, and religious existentialism.|$|E
25|$|On 5 March, Operation Uvda was {{launched}} following {{nearly a month}} of reconnaissance, {{with the goal of}} securing the Southern Negev from Jordan. The IDF entered and secured the territory, but did not meet significant resistance along the way, as the area was already designated to be part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state</b> in the UN Partition Plan, and the operation meant to establish Israeli sovereignty over the territory rather than actually conquer it. The Golani, Negev, and Alexandroni brigades participated in the operation, together with some smaller units and with naval support.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Rav Lau had {{an hour-long}} meeting with John Paul II at the Pope's summer {{residence}} of Castel Gandolfo near Rome sought {{to offer the}} Vatican's moral support to the latest peace moves in the Middle East.

25|$|Ahad Ha'am's {{ideas were}} popular {{at a very}} {{difficult}} time for Zionism, beginning after the failures of the first Aliya. His unique contribution was to emphasise the importance of reviving Hebrew and Jewish culture both in Palestine and throughout the Diaspora, something that was recognised only belatedly, when it became part of the Zionist program after 1898. Herzl did not have much use for Hebrew, and many wanted German to be the language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state.</b> Ahad Ha'am {{played an important role in}} the revival of the Hebrew language and Jewish culture, and in cementing a link between the proposed Jewish state and Hebrew culture.|$|E

25|$|By 1948, in {{the wake}} of the Holocaust, Jewish support for {{partition}} and a Jewish state had become overwhelming. Nevertheless, some Jewish voices still argued for unification. The International Jewish Labor Bund was against the UN vote on the partition of Palestine and reaffirmed its support for a single binational state that would guarantee equal national rights for Jews and Arabs and would be under the control of superpowers and the UN. The 1948 New York Second world conference of the International Jewish Labor Bund condemned the proclamation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state,</b> because the decision exposed the Jews in Palestine to danger. The conference was in favour of a binational state built on the base of national equality and democratic federalism.|$|E
25|$|During {{his short}} reign, Emperor Julian (361–363) {{abolished}} the special taxes {{paid by the}} Jews to the Roman government and also sought to ease the burden of mandatory Jewish financial support of the Jewish patriarchate. He also gave permission for the Jews to rebuild and populate Jerusalem. In {{one of his most}} remarkable endeavours, he initiated the restoration of the Jewish Temple which had been demolished in 70 CE. A contingent of thousands of Jews from Persian districts hoping to assist in the construction effort were killed en route by Persian soldiers. The great earthquake together with Julian's death put an end to Jewish hopes of rebuilding the Third Temple. Had the attempt been successful, {{it is likely that the}} re-establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state</b> with its sacrifices, priests and Sanhedrin or Senate would have occurred.|$|E
25|$|Ron Prosor, Israel's {{representative}} to the United Nations, claimed in General Assembly debate on the Question of Palestine, November 2014, that the UN is illogical and tends to lack of sense of justice {{when it comes to}} the case of Israel. He claimed that the UN's focus was solely on Israel, ignoring the thousands murdered and expelled in the Middle East under the tyranny of Radical Islam, and that the Arab–Israeli conflict was never was about the establishment of a Palestinian state but the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state.</b> He also claimed that the UN is not for peace or the Palestinian people but simply against Israel, and pointed out that if the UN really cared about the situation of the Palestinians, they would have taken at least one decision regarding the situation of the Palestinians in Syria and Lebanon, where Palestinians are being persecuted and systematically discriminated against.|$|E

25|$|Khalidi {{based his}} thesis on Plan Dalet, a plan devised by the Haganah high command in March 1948, which stipulated, {{among other things}} that if Palestinians in villages {{controlled}} by the Jewish troops resist, they should be expelled (Khalidi, 1961). Plan Dalet was aimed to establish Jewish sovereignty over the land allocated to the Jews by the United Nations (Resolution 181), and to prepare the ground toward the expected invasion of Palestine by Arab states after the imminent establishment {{of the state of}} Israel. In addition, it was introduced while Jewish–Palestinian fighting was already underway and while thousands of Palestinians had already fled. Nevertheless, Khalidi argued that the plan was a master-plan for the expulsion of the Palestinians from the territories controlled by the Jews. He argued that there was an omnipresent understanding during the war that as many Palestinian Arabs as possible had to be transferred out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state,</b> and that this understanding stood behind many of the expulsions that the commanders in the field carried out.|$|E
25|$|From the Israeli perspective, a key {{concern is}} security, {{and whether the}} major Palestinian figures and {{institutions}} are in fact trying to fight terrorism and promote tolerance and co-existence with Israel. Israeli concerns are based on abundant documentary and empirical evidence of many Palestinian leaders having in fact promoted and supported terrorist groups and activities. Furthermore, there is much concrete evidence of Palestinians having supported and expressed incitment against Israel, its motives, actions, and basic rights as a state. The election of Hamas has provided evidence for this view, with the Hamas charter stating unequivocally {{that it does not}} recognize Israel's right to exist. However, there remain some activists on the Palestinian side who claim that there are still some positive signs on the Palestinian side, and that Israel should use these to cultivate some positive interactions with the Palestinians, even in spite of Hamas's basic opposition to the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>State.</b> Since mid-June 2007, Israel has cooperated with Palestinian security forces in the West Bank at unprecedented levels, thanks in part to United States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian National Security Forces and Presidential Guard.|$|E
25|$|Ben-Gurion {{invested}} Yigael Yadin {{with the}} responsibility {{to come up with}} a plan of offense whose timing was related to the foreseeable evacuation of British forces. This strategy, called Plan Dalet, was readied by March and implemented towards the end of April. A separate plan, Operation Nachshon, was devised to lift the siege of Jerusalem. 1500 men from Haganah's Givati brigade and Palmach's Harel brigade conducted sorties to free up the route to the city between 5 and 20 April. Both sides acted offensively in defiance of the Partition Plan, which foresaw Jerusalem as a corpus separatum, under neither Jewish nor Arab jurisdiction. The Arabs did not accept the Plan, while the Jews were determined to oppose the internationalization of the city, and secure it as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>state.</b> The operation was successful, and enough foodstuffs to last two months were trucked into to Jerusalem for distribution to the Jewish population. The success of the operation was assisted by the death of al-Husayni in combat. During this time, and independently of Haganah or the framework of Plan Dalet, irregular fighters from Irgun and Lehi formations massacred a substantial number of Arabs at Deir Yassin, an event that, though publicly deplored and criticized by the principal Jewish authorities, had a deep impact on the morale of the Arab population and contributed to generate the exode of the Arab population.|$|E
