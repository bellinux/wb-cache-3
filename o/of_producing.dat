5|$|New methods <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> it by {{carburizing}} bars of iron in the {{cementation process}} were devised in the 17th century. In the Industrial Revolution, new methods <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> bar iron without charcoal were devised {{and these were}} later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This made steel much more economical, thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities.|$|E

30|$|The most {{important}} issue {{in the production of}} energy from aquifers is the necessity <b>of</b> reinjection <b>of</b> <b>produced</b> brine into the same aquifer, which provides pressure maintenance that leads to much higher energy recovery and resolves the issue <b>of</b> disposing <b>of</b> <b>produced</b> brine. The disadvantage of reinjection is the amount of required energy for pumping the reinjected brine in comparison with the amount <b>of</b> <b>produced</b> energy. Two important questions about the reinjection strategy are the rate and start time of injection.|$|R

5|$|The production-possibility {{frontier}} can {{be constructed}} from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) {{is the most common}} form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun industry will move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> successive units of butter will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry.|$|E
