5|$|Zardari's initial {{political}} career was unsuccessful. In 1983, he lost an election for a district council seat in Nawabshah, {{a city of}} Sindh, where his family owned thousands <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> farmland. He then went into real estate.|$|E
5|$|Mary's death {{complicated}} Tucker's facile life, as her considerable {{estate was}} fraught with legal problems. It included a sugar plantation, thousands <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> land, and {{a share in}} the Dismal Swamp Company. After a prolonged trip to the sugar plantation in Antigua, and on to Martinique and Bermuda, he returned to Williamsburg and then determined his future was in the nearby state capital of Richmond, Virginia as a practicing attorney. Tucker ultimately succeeded in salvaging only part of his late wife's fortune.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its lack}} of industry, the company still found itself with {{thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> land that could be developed. William M. Ladd, who had succeeded Reed as President of Oregon Iron and Steel and his father as President of Ladd & Tilton Bank, formed the Ladd Estate Company to manage these real estate assets. The newly formed Ladd Estate Company converted the depressed company town into a prestigious suburb complete with country club, golf course, polo field, and even worked to rename the harsh-sounding Sucker Lake to Oswego Lake. The company existed as a shell until 1960, when in its final act, it deeded its powerhouse and dams to lake shareholders.|$|E
5|$|From 1760 to 1761, Hancock {{lived in}} England while {{building}} relationships with customers and suppliers. Upon returning to Boston, Hancock gradually {{took over the}} House of Hancock as his uncle's health failed, becoming a full partner in January 1763. He {{became a member of}} the Masonic Lodge of St. Andrew in October 1762, which connected him with many of Boston's most influential citizens. When Thomas Hancock died in August 1764, John inherited the business, Hancock Manor, two or three household slaves, and thousands <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> land, becoming one of the wealthiest men in the colonies. The household slaves continued to work for John and his aunt, but were eventually freed through the terms of Thomas Hancock's will; there is no evidence that John Hancock ever bought or sold slaves.|$|E
5|$|Neither Burch nor Smith {{had owned}} the cave or {{the land around}} it, which belonged to the public. Beginning in the 1890s, the Federal {{government}} began regulating {{the use of public}} lands like these. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated millions <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> forest lands for protection, including what became Siskiyou National Forest, which surrounds the cave. The USFS was created in 1905 to manage these reserves. Three years later, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which allowed the President to designate protected areas called National Monuments on public lands. In 1909, President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the USFS. A year later the USFS employed men to guard the cave and to serve as tour guides.|$|E

5|$|Palatial squares were {{developed}} for the prosperous middle classes. Italianate and Grecian villas, made with Bath Stone and sitting in their own gardens, were built {{in areas such as}} Clifton Down. At the same time, hundreds <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> working class and artisan homes were built, especially in the south and east of the city. To support the growing population, public service buildings such as the Beaufort Hospital (now Glenside), schools such as Clifton College and public houses such as the Mauretania Public House were constructed.|$|E

5|$|Carol {{maintained}} its intensity {{as it moved}} inland, and its winds were strong enough to knock down trees and power lines in New Hampshire. One tree fell onto a car, killing a person, and there were three deaths overall in the state, along with $3million in damage. There was also a death in neighboring Vermont. Carol produced winds of up to 80mph (130km/h) in Augusta, Maine. Throughout the state, the winds downed hundreds of trees, some of which damaged houses, wrecked cars, destroyed one building, or fell onto power lines. Fallen trees blocked highways, and one person was injured by a falling tree limb. Downed power lines left several counties without power or telephone services. The winds flattened hundreds <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> corn in North Livermore, and throughout the state, there was heavy damage to the apple crop. Damage to the apple crop amounted to $1.7million. While moving west of Maine, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, including a report of 2.15inches (63mm) in 12hours. Along the coast, high waves damaged boats. In Maine, the hurricane killed three people, injured at least eight, and caused $10million in damage, the costliest natural disaster in the state's history. Carol lost this distinction 10days later when Hurricane Edna caused $15million in damage in the state.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{proposed}} measure—particularly its {{denial of the}} right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, IMF, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. Responding to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.|$|E
5|$|In late 1818, Jennings was {{appointed}} {{as a federal}} commissioner, along with Lewis Cass and Benjamin Parke, to negotiate a treaty with the Native Americans (Potawatomi, Wea, Miami, and Delaware), {{who lived in the}} northern and central parts of Indiana. The Treaty of St. Mary's allowed the State of Indiana to purchase millions <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> land north of an 1809 treaty line and extending west to the Wabash River and two more parcels of land, which opened most of central Indiana to American settlement. The appointment created a crisis in Jennings's political career. Because the state constitution prohibited a person from holding a federal government position while exercising duties as the state's governor, Jennings's political enemies seized the opportunity to force him from office by arguing that he had vacated the governor's office when he accepted the federal appointment.|$|E

5|$|Kanaʻina {{acted as}} {{trustee of the}} royal lands that had been {{inherited}} by his wife while his son was a minor, and after his son's death. When Kanaina died, the court appointed nine trustees, six of which would {{take part in the}} militia that overthrew the monarchy and also take part in the new provisional government. Dole himself had been on the record as supporting the break up of crown lands to promote American style farming in his newspaper in 1872. Various lawsuits ensued over the property including a suit questioning the validity of the will due to Lunalilo being under the guardianship of his father when he made it out. Lunalilo had requested in his will to use the estate to fund a charity. The trustees favored splitting up the estate by selling it off, while others claimed the value of land was underestimated, and an endowment to run the charity could have been funded by lease income. For example, Kanaʻina leased (and later his heirs would sell) thousands <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> land on the island of Hawaii to businessman (and son of missionaries) William Herbert Shipman.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{adhered to}} the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary {{responsibility}} for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support {{for the construction of}} the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|South of Chennai, {{heavy rains}} and {{flooding}} persisted {{into the second}} week of December. In Kancheepuram district, Chengalpattu, Nandivaram- Guduvanchery, Perungalathur, Tambaram, Mudichur and Anakaputhur were inundated in floodwaters up to 7 meters deep by 5 December, which washed away roads and severed rail links; 98 people from the district were reported to have died. During 4–5 December, parts of Villupuram and Tiruvarur districts received up to 10 centimeters of rain, while some towns in Cuddalore district saw up to nine centimeters. Flood alerts were broadcast to 12 villages in the neighbourhood of the Tirumurthy dam in Tirupur district on 7 December, as the dam was likely to reach capacity within two days; the residents of those villages were urged to evacuate. Due to rainfall in Tirunelveli district, all of its dams had reached or were approaching full capacity by 7 December, forcing local authorities to discharge thousands of cusecs of water from reservoirs and causing the Thamirabarani River to reach flood stage. Torrential rains inundated hundreds <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> paddy fields in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts, and caused residential areas to flood by 8 December. Large parts of Thanjavur city were marooned by rising waters, while several houses collapsed under the brunt of rainfall in Kumbakonam and Veppathoor.|$|E

5|$|While it {{was long}} thought that the Chinese had {{developed}} the blast furnace and cast iron as their first method of iron production, Donald Wagner (the author of the above referenced study) has published a more recent paper that supersedes some of the statements in the earlier work; the newer paper still places {{the date of the}} first cast-iron artifacts at the 5th and 4th centuries BC, but also provides evidence of earlier bloomery furnace use, which migrated from China to Western parts and Central Asia during the beginning of the Chinese Bronze Age of the late Longshan culture (2000BC). He suggests that early blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt bronze. Certainly, though, iron was essential to military success by the time the State of Qin had unified China (221BC). Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang Dynasties. By the 11th century AD, the Song Dynasty Chinese iron industry made a remarkable switch of resources from charcoal to bituminous coal in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> woodland from felling. This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding the {{increased}} prosperity in the 1860s, this decade {{was also the}} scene of a series of natural disasters. In the Great Flood of 1862, heavy rains dropped by a series of winter storms caused the Santa Ana to burst its banks, flooding thousands <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> land and killing 20 to 40 people in the greatest flood it had experienced in recorded history. The levees along the river burst in many places, flooding part of the Inland Empire into a continuous body of water several miles wide stretching from the mouth of Santa Ana Canyon to where the river cuts through the Santa Ana Mountains. Downstream in Orange County, the river overwhelmed nearly all the existing floodworks and transformed the coastal plain into a transient inland sea. The flow, now calculated as a 1,000-year flood, peaked at roughly , over half the average flow of the Mississippi River. Even after the flood, detrimental conditions continued in the region. For the two years following the flood, an intense drought caused the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} head of livestock. Despite all of the hardships experienced in the three years, after conditions finally returned to normal, the Santa Ana River watershed again became a prospering agricultural region. The cities of Santa Ana and Riverside were established in 1869 and 1870, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The largest fire in {{the park}} was the North Fork fire, {{both in terms of}} damage to {{structures}} and of area burned. The fire started on July 22 when a man cutting timber dropped his cigarette in Caribou-Targhee National Forest just outside the park's western border. The North Fork fire was the only major fire that was fought from the beginning since it started after the prescribed fire policy was halted on July 15. The fire spread towards the northeast {{and by the end of}} the first week of August was threatening Madison Junction and nearby campground facilities. The fire then raced towards Norris Junction on August 20. Firefighters there used water and foam to keep the structures from being consumed by the blaze. The fire continued its eastward advance along the Yellowstone Plateau and on August 25 reached visitor facilities at Canyon, where land management agencies and the U.S. military put forth enormous efforts to protect structures. The eastern flank of the fire calmed down for several days, then down-sloping winds off the Yellowstone Plateau forced flames along the west side of the fire towards the town of West Yellowstone, Montana. There, private citizens assisted assigned personnel in soaking hundreds <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> <b>of</b> forestland to protect both the town and an electrical power substation. The fire burned a substantial section of forest along the Madison River valley.|$|E
