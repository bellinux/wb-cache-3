5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

She first earned a teaching diploma and became a school teacher, then graduated in medicine in 1911. After completing her residency, she applied to teach at the university level, but instead was offered a teaching post at the School of Midwifery. Outraged, she fought for 13 years against the prejudices which prevented her advancing in her career. In 1927, Ferrari won her fight and was granted a professorship as an alternate. Finally in 1939, she was awarded a full professorship.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{if such a}} {{strategy}} of financing development from <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> country is undertaken, it creates a number of problems. For example, the foreign investors may carelessly misuse {{the resources of the}} underdeveloped country. This would in turn limit that economy's ability to diversify, especially if natural resources were plundered. This may also create a distorted social structure. Apart from this, there is also a risk that the foreign investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption. People would try to imitate Western consumption habits and thus a balance of payments crisis may develop, along with economic inequality within the population.|$|E

40|$|The null {{hypothesis}} {{for this study}} was there were no differences in caloric intake, cholesterol, and sodium intakes of food prepared at home as contrasted with food prepared <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> when consumed by men 45 - 54 years old. The three dietary intakes have been associated with medical conditions that cause death in humans. This study provided information which could enable nutrition educators, foodservice managers, and men aged 45 - 54 who are employed at a factory to understand how consumption of these three intakes differs when foods were prepared at home as contrasted with <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> Therefore, this study provided information to help lower the risk factors of heart diseases, hypertension, and obesity which are associated with caloric intake, cholesterol and sodium consumption. Participants completed three days of food frequencies and dietary records. The Sign Test was used to analyze the differences between food prepared at homeand <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> for caloric, cholesterol, and sodium intakes. Statistical analysis of the data revealed:(1) A significant difference in caloric intake of food prepared at home as contrasted with food prepared <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> when consumed by men 45 - 54 years old (p 0. 05). (3) No significant difference in sodium intake of food prepared at home as contrasted with food prepared <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> when consumed by men 45 - 54 years old (p > 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the prevalence and identify correlates of second-hand tobacco smoke (SHS) among 6, 412 current non-smoking school-going adolescents (aged 11 to 18 years) in South Africa. A cross-sectional study was carried out in 2008 in South Africa within the framework of the Global Youth Tobacco Survey. Overall, 25. 7 % of students were exposed to SHS at home, 34. 2 % <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> and 18. 3 % were exposed to SHS at <b>home</b> and <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> Parental and close friends smoking status, allowing someone to smoke around you and perception that passive smoking was harmful were significant determinants of adolescent’s exposure to both SHS at <b>home</b> and <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> Identified factors can inform the implementation of public health interventions in order to reduce passive smoking among adolescents...|$|R
5|$|The {{economic}} policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua's labor force. While men's employment rate between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women's employment <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> in Nicaragua steadily increased {{during the same}} time frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women's participation in the labor market increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest participation rates in Central America. Though Chamorro's policies changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing more women, the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.|$|E
5|$|World War II had a {{significant}} impact on changing family roles. Because of the draft, workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women, mainly in nontraditional positions. This increase in working women became one of the few times in history where women were praised for work <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period. Not only had many women found a new sense of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of birth control. Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages.|$|E
