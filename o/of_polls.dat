5|$|HMV's Poll <b>of</b> <b>Polls</b> was {{an annual}} list of albums {{compiled}} by British music retailer HMV from 1998 to 2012. The listing was created each December by collating year-end polls from approximately 30music magazines, newspapers and guides {{to determine the}} most critically acclaimed albums of the year. An album's placing in the list {{was determined by the}} number of different polls in which it was included. In the event of two records featuring in the same number <b>of</b> <b>polls,</b> the album with the highest combined placings was given the higher position on the Poll <b>of</b> <b>Polls.</b> In 2011, Let England Shake by PJ Harvey was named the best album of the year after receiving 21nominations– the following year, Channel Orange by Frank Ocean topped the poll with 22nominations.|$|E
5|$|In {{surveys of}} U.S. {{scholars}} ranking presidents conducted since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently {{ranked in the}} top three, often as number one. A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington. In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority <b>of</b> <b>polls.</b> Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. Lincoln; 2. George Washington; and 3. Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, are occasionally reversed.|$|E
25|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>polls</b> {{were held}} during the intense {{publicity}} surrounding Dirty Politics {{and showed the}} National Party losing support. Towards the end of August 2014, {{two weeks after the}} release of the book, National was still way ahead at 50.8%, but down 4.3% on previous figures. John Key also lost ground as preferred prime minister.

25|$|The electoral {{campaign}} ran between 3 October and 1 November and was overshadowed by several corruption scandals (Microsoftgate, EADS, illegal retrocessions) involving key figures of PSD, {{but also the}} candidate Elena Udrea. Outgoing President Traian Băsescu accused Victor Ponta of being an undercover spy, incompatible under the Romanian legislation with a public position, while Klaus Iohannis faced accusations of incompatibility filed by the National Integrity Agency after September 2013. Following very long voting times and {{large numbers of people}} who couldn't vote before the closing <b>of</b> <b>polls</b> in diaspora, large protests were staged in multiple cities across Romania and at Romanian embassies before the second round. This was regarded as both incapacity and unwillingness of Ponta's government to organize fair elections, and led to a surprisingly large turnout of over 64% (largest since 1996), and a surprise win for Iohannis in the second round.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Ocean {{released}} his debut studio album Channel Orange to universal acclaim from critics, who later named {{it the best}} {{album of the year}} in the HMV's Poll <b>of</b> <b>Polls.</b> It also earned Ocean six Grammy Award nominations and was credited by some writers for moving the R genre in a different, more challenging direction. Considered as Ocean's first commercial release on a traditional record label, Channel Orange featured unconventional songs that were noted for their storytelling and social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew on hip hop, soul, and R. The songs about unrequited love in particular received the most attention, partly because of Ocean's announcement prior to the album's release, when he revealed that his first love was a man. The announcement made global headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when David Bowie revealed that he was bisexual in 1972.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the national polls, Lord Ashcroft funded from May 2014 a series <b>of</b> <b>polls</b> in marginal constituencies, and constituencies where minor parties {{were expected to be}} significant challengers. Among other results, Lord Ashcroft's polls suggested that the growth in SNP support would translate into more than 50 seats; that there was little overall pattern in Labour and Conservative Party marginals; that the Green Party MP Caroline Lucas would retain her seat; that both Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and UKIP leader Nigel Farage would face very close races to be elected in their own constituencies; and that Liberal Democrat MPs would enjoy an incumbency effect that would lose fewer MPs than their national polling implied. As with other smaller parties, their proportion of MPs remained likely to be considerably lower than that of total, national votes cast. Several polling companies included Ashcroft's polls in their election predictions, though several of the political parties disputed his findings.|$|E

25|$|The BCS {{relied on}} a {{combination}} <b>of</b> <b>polls</b> and computer selection methods to determine relative team rankings, and to narrow the field to two teams {{to play in the}} BCS National Championship Game held after the other college bowl games (the game rotated among four existing bowl games from the 1998 to 2005 season, and was a separate game from the 2006 to 2013 seasons). The American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) was contractually bound to vote the winner of this game as the BCS National Champion and the contract signed by each conference required them to recognize the winner of the BCS National Championship game as the official and only champion. The BCS was created to end split championships and for the champion to win the title on the field between the two teams selected by the BCS. Despite this objective, it failed to produce a consensus champion on one occasion, as the 2003 NCAA Division I-A football season ended with a split title, with the Associated Press (AP) Poll selecting the USC Trojans and the Coaches' Poll being contractually committed to select the LSU Tigers.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, after {{a period}} in which his own equivocal stance on the matter had drawn controversy, Constantinescu's {{successor}} Ion Iliescu established the Wiesel Commission, an international group of expert historians whose mission was the study of the Holocaust in Romania, later succeeded by the Elie Wiesel National Institute. The Final Report compiled by the Commission brought the official recognition of Ion Antonescu's participation in the Holocaust. After that moment, public displays of support for Antonescu became illegal. Antonescu's SMERSH interrogations were recovered from the Russian archives and published in 2006. Despite the renewed condemnation and exposure, Antonescu remained a popular figure: {{as a result of the}} 2006 Mari Români series <b>of</b> <b>polls</b> conducted by the national station TVR 1, viewers nominated Antonescu as the 6th greatest Romanian ever. The vote's knockout phase included televised profiles of the ten most popular figures, and saw historian Adrian Cioroianu using the portion dedicated to Antonescu to expose and condemn him, giving voters reasons not to see the dictator as a great Romanian. The approach resulted in notable controversy after Ziua newspaper criticized Cioroianu, who defended himself by stating he had an obligation to tell the truth.|$|E

500|$|After the Mint {{conducted}} a series <b>of</b> <b>polls</b> and focus groups, three obverse and four reverse designs were selected as finalists. The Mint received approximately 90,000e-mails {{in reference to}} the design selection process. In response to the large amount of feedback generated, Diehl stated that the internet has [...] "allowed us to conduct a public outreach program of unprecedented scope to measure opinions of the designs." [...] All seven of the selected designs were forwarded to the United States Commission of Fine Arts; the Commission chose an obverse design depicting Sacagawea with her infant son, Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, as designed by sculptor Glenna Goodacre. Goodacre chose Randy'L He-dow Teton to model for Sacagawea, of whom there are no known contemporary portraits, to help the artist capture the features of a young Native American woman. The chosen reverse, designed by Mint sculptor-engraver Thomas D. Rogers, depicted a soaring eagle.|$|E

A few days prior to the release, the advance booking was described as [...] "phenomenal," [...] with an overall advance booking rate of 20–25% across the country. A number of advantages of the film's release were pointed out, such as the festive season and higher 3D ticket prices, though there had been doubt regarding the timely release of the 3D version.|$|E
