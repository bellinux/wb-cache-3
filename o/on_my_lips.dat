500|$|After Nero leaves, Ottone {{steps forward}} and after failing to persuade Poppea to {{reinstate}} him in her affections, privately resolves to kill her. He is then comforted by a noblewoman, Drusilla; realising that he can never regain Poppea he offers to marry Drusilla, who joyfully accepts him. But Ottone admits to himself: [...] "Drusilla is <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> Poppea is in my heart." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Drunk on Love" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "trancey" [...] and Europop-influenced power ballad. The song last for a duration of three minutes and 32 seconds. Instrumentation consists of [...] "a storm of drums" [...] and [...] "clattering synths." [...] Katherine St. Asaph for Popdust described the song's percussion as [...] "huge." [...] The song samples the melody of The xx's song [...] "Intro", which was included on their debut album xx. Robert Copsey for Digital Spy noted that Rihanna describes herself as someone who wants to be loved in the lyric [...] "I just wanna be in love" [...] as she sings about being a [...] "hopeless romantic". He also described the lyric [...] "I wear my heart on my sleeve/ Always let love take the lead" [...] as Talk That Talks [...] "most thoughtful" [...] line. St. Asaph described the lyric [...] "I love the way you taste <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> when we kiss" [...] as [...] "PG-13 at best," [...] and wrote that {{it is not possible to}} be [...] "lovelorn" [...] as well as filthy at the same time.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1980, Julia Cave and a {{team from}} the BBC arrived in Abydos to film the {{documentary}} Omm Sety and Her Egypt. Featuring interviews with Egyptologists T. G. H. James and Rosalie David, it described Abydos and the excavations that had been undertaken. It had extensive input from Omm Sety, who used crutches due to her deteriorating health. The documentary was broadcast on BBC 2 in May 1981. The Times wrote of the documentary: [...] "An incredulous smile froze <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> as I watched the Chronicle film Omm Sety and Her Egypt. Could I be absolutely positive {{it was all a}} lot of eyewash? Of course I couldn't. And neither will you be able to. In any case, it makes marvellous television." [...] At the time the BBC were recording their documentary, the American producer Miriam Birch asked Omm Sety to appear, along with Egyptologists Kent Weeks and Lanny Bell, in a documentary that National Geographic Channel was filming, Egypt: Quest for Eternity. It concentrated on Rameses II, the son of Seti I. Shooting took place in March 1981, coinciding with Omm Sety's seventy-seventh birthday party at Chicago House, which was filmed. She was {{in a lot of pain}} but full of good cheer, and the film crew carried her up to the Temple of Seti for filming. This was to be her last visit to the shrine in which she believed she had served as a priestess 3,000 years before.|$|E

60|$|The tears flowed fast {{down her}} cheeks. She rested one {{trembling}} {{hand on the}} table to steady herself while she gave me the other. I took it in mine--I held it fast.

6000|$|I looked round, and {{saw that}} we had been joined by a young cavalier,- -a Spanish nobleman, as I saw at once; a man with jet black hair, and a {{straight}} nose, and a black moustache, and patent leather boots, very slim and very tall, and--though I would not confess it then-- uncommonly handsome.

Still, I was a sturdy young fellow enough, in spite of my consumptive tendencies, and not given to groundless fears in a general way; but I must allow that I was decidedly frightened by my adventure in the Richmond Hotel on the Christmas Eve of that aforesaid year of grace. It may be a foolish reminiscence, yet I dare say you won't mind listening to it.|$|R
5000|$|Broaddrick {{says the}} two spoke briefly in her room, with Clinton {{describing}} plans to renovate a prison visible from her window if he became governor. Then, according to Broaddrick, Clinton suddenly kissed her. Broaddrick says she pushed Clinton away {{and told him}} she was married and not interested, but he persisted. As recounted in the NBC interview: Then he tries to kiss me again. And the second time he tries to kiss me he starts biting <b>my</b> <b>lip</b> … He starts to, um, bite <b>on</b> <b>my</b> top <b>lip</b> and I tried to pull away from him. And then he forces me down on the bed. And I just was very frightened, and I tried to get away from him and I told him ‘No,’ that I didn’t want this to happen but he wouldn’t listen to me. … It was a real panicky, panicky situation. I was even to the point where I was getting very noisy, you know, yelling to ‘Please stop.’ And that’s when he pressed down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> right shoulder and he would bite <b>my</b> <b>lip.</b> … When everything was over with, he got up and straightened himself, and I was crying at the moment and he walks to the door, and calmly puts on his sunglasses. And before he goes out the door he says ‘You better get some ice on that.’ And he turned and went out the door.” [...] When asked if there was any way Clinton could have thought it was consensual, Broaddrick said “No, not with what I told him and with how I tried to push him away. It was not consensual.” ...|$|R
