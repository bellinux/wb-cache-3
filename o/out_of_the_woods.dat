5|$|As Pettigrew's North Carolina Brigade came on line, they flanked the 19th Indiana {{and drove}} the Iron Brigade back. The 26th North Carolina (the largest {{regiment}} in the army with 839 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 men. By {{the end of the}} three-day battle, they had about 152 men standing, the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment, North or South. Slowly the Iron Brigade was pushed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> toward Seminary Ridge. Hill added Maj. Gen. William Dorsey Pender's division to the assault, and the I Corps was driven back through the grounds of the Lutheran Seminary and Gettysburg streets.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, on the Roman left wing, Severus {{must have}} {{suspected}} the prepared ambush, and held back from advancing into the woods, according to Ammianus. Libanius contradicts this, {{claiming that the}} Romans charged the enemy and flushed {{them out of their}} hiding places. But Ammianus' version is more likely, as the Romans would hardly have benefited from advancing straight into a prepared trap. Ammianus does not report further action in this sector. But {{it is likely that the}} hidden Germans eventually lost patience, advanced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and charged at Severus' division, only to be routed by Severus' crack troops.|$|E
5|$|Scott's {{influence}} is felt throughout the novel. Lengthy {{descriptions of the}} countryside are interrupted constantly by tangents explaining the history of Brittany and its people. The pastoral setting is integrated into the plot, particularly the guerrilla combat of the Chouans. In complementing individual with environs Balzac also shows the influence of James Fenimore Cooper, whose The Last of the Mohicans had impressed the French author. Like the Mahicans of Cooper's novel, the Chouan insurgents are skilled at using their surroundings, coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> {{in more ways than}} one.|$|E

5|$|Pettigrew's Brigade was {{deployed}} {{in a line}} that extended south beyond the ground defended by the Iron Brigade. Enveloping the left flank of the 19th Indiana, Pettigrew's North Carolinians, the largest brigade in the army, drove back the Iron Brigade {{in some of the}} fiercest fighting of the war. The Iron Brigade was pushed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> made three temporary stands in the open ground to the east, but then had to fall back toward the Lutheran Theological Seminary. Gen. Meredith was downed with a head wound, made all the worse when his horse fell on him. To the left of the Iron Brigade was the brigade of Col. Chapman Biddle, defending open ground on McPherson Ridge, but they were outflanked and decimated. To the right, Stone's Bucktails, facing both west and north along the Chambersburg Pike, were attacked by both Brockenbrough and Daniel.|$|E
5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{became a}} full-scale battle by 4:00p.m. After the Americans drove Captain Pipe's Delawares <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and onto to prairie, the Delawares were reinforced by Dunquat's Wyandots. Elliott also {{arrived on the}} scene and coordinated the actions of the Delawares and the Wyandots. Pipe's Delawares skillfully outflanked the American position and then attacked their rear. A few Indians crept close to the American lines in the tall prairie grass. The Americans responded by climbing trees to get a better shot at them. Gunsmoke filled the air, making it difficult to see. After {{three and a half hours}} of incessant firing, the Indians gradually broke off the attack with the approach of nightfall. Both sides slept with arms at the ready, and surrounded their positions with large fires to prevent surprise night attacks.|$|E
5|$|With his two {{parachute}} brigades and the commando brigade heavily engaged Major General Richard Gale contacted I Corps for armour support. He {{had decided}} to clear the woods at Le Mariquet of Germans. The objective {{was given to the}} 7th Parachute Battalion and 'B' Squadron 13th/18th Royal Hussars. The tanks would advance over the open ground, their only cover being crashed gliders. Meanwhile, 'A' and 'B' Company's would clear the woods. In the fighting the only British casualties were ten wounded in the parachute battalion, but eight men from the Hussars were killed and four Sherman and two Stuart tanks were destroyed. The Germans from the 857th Grenadier Regiment, had twenty killed and 100 men surrendered, and were driven <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b>|$|E

25|$|Lusignan, Saint-Julien, and Alois Liechtenstein {{called for}} another effort. One of Vukassovich's hussar regiments swept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> {{heading for the}} 57th Line's flank. The left {{battalion}} of the 57th formed square and drove off the horsemen. With their generals displaying front-line leadership, the Austrian attack roared <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and fell on the French troops lining the first ridge. The push collapsed {{in the face of}} converging musketry from the defenders' concave line and a thrust against its left flank by the 3rd Line.|$|E
25|$|She ends up {{lost and}} unintentionally {{walks into the}} empty den of a lioness. When the lioness returns, Polyxena begs the animal not to eat her before she is baptized. So the lioness leads her east <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> to a road and then goes back to her den. The apostle Andrew coincidentally walks past and Polyxena asks for baptism. So they find a well and rescue Rebecca, a Jewish slave held captive there. Then both are baptized when the lioness returns and asks Andrew to perform the task.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} the {{advantage}} that the French had enjoyed in the action was suddenly reversed. Le Marchant led his dragoon guards <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and they formed their ranks whilst accelerating into the charge. The 5th Dragoon Guards attacked with their squadrons in echelon, their left refused, and struck the deep and exposed left flank of the French formation to considerable effect. Simultaneously with Le Marchant's charge the 16th Light Dragoons, led by Cotton, appeared to Ponsonby's right-rear; they jumped a stone wall in line, and also charged. The French cavalry were thrown into instant confusion and were swiftly broken.|$|E

25|$|The {{receivers}} {{took control}} on 8 July 1923 and discontinued freight service north of Perham Junction {{on the former}} P from 24 November 1923 until 1 June 1924, but passenger train service was continued over the entire system through that winter. For the next five years, winter freight and passenger service on the former P north of Phillips was discontinued from December through May. The former F remained in service for receiver Wing's mill in Kingfield, and for a Carrabasset wood veneer mill built by the Lawrence Plywood Company in 1924. The veneer mill used surplus World War I tanks to haul logs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b>|$|E
25|$|Napoleon {{reformed}} the II Cavalry Corps for the Waterloo Campaign {{and appointed}} Exelmans to command it. The corps comprised the 9th Cavalry Division led by General of Division Jean Baptiste Alexandre Strolz, the 10th Cavalry Division under General of Division Louis Pierre Aimé Chastel, and two horse artillery batteries. Each division {{was made up}} of two brigades and each brigade consisted of two dragoon regiments. The corps included the 4th, 5th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 17th, and 20th Dragoon Regiments. Altogether, the corps counted 2,817 horsemen, 246 artillerymen, and 12 artillery pieces. On the afternoon of 15 June 1815, Exelmans led his cavalry in a vigorous pursuit of the Prussian rear guard. His dragoons defeated the 6th Uhlan Regiment and chased an infantry battalion <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> near Gilly, Belgium.|$|E
25|$|The {{perpetrator}} {{then moved}} to Raudeliūnas' home, which was closest to his own house. The next victims were Vanda Raudeliūnienė and her visiting daughter Dalia Kalibatienė, who was a senior lieutenant with the Ministry of National Defence. The Kalibaitis family lived in Salininkai near Vilnius and were visiting the family. Zavistonovičius also killed a dog which attempted to defend the women. He fetched a mattress from his own house so {{he would not have}} to lay down on cold winter ground and took cover to ambush Antanas Raudeliūnas, his son-in-law Mindaugas Kalibatas, and his grandsons Vilius and Tadas. The men were gathering wood in a nearby forest. They heard the shots but were not immediately concerned as they thought it was hunters who frequented the forests. When the four men came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> Zavistonovičius first shot Mindaugas Kalibatas in the chest, but the bullet grazed, ripping a piece of flesh but not causing more serious internal damage. The perpetrator then shot Vilius as he ran to help his father. When the gunman approached them, Kalibatas and his other son Tadas attacked him, grabbed his rifles and beat him until he collapsed.|$|E

25|$|Jourdan, Carnot and Representative Ernest Dominique François Joseph Duquesnoy {{accompanied}} Balland's {{division in}} the center. The army commander planned {{to wait for the}} attacks of his two wings to make significant progress before launching the attack of Balland's division. In mid-morning, the division filed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> in front of Dourlers and opened fire with its artillery. Seeing the initial success of the two wings, Carnot wanted the attack to be started at once. Jourdan wanted more ground to be gained on the flanks but the politician would not be denied. Finally, Jourdan put himself at the head of Balland's division and ordered the assault. As the French soldiers came over the crest of the ridge in front on the sunken road, they came under murderous fire from the crack Austrian grenadiers. Despite heroic attempts to get light artillery forward, cannons were dismounted and gunners and horses were shot down. In the thick of the bullets, Jourdan bravely urged his troops on but an Austrian force appeared from the direction of Saint-Aubin, threatening the French left flank. At nightfall the representatives authorized a retreat after Balland's division had lost between 1,200 and 1,500 casualties.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May 1799, several {{thousand}} insurgents, reinforced with French deserters, recruits {{from some of}} the minor cantons, some Austrian battalions, and emboldened with the news of approaching Russian forces, emerged from the wood at Finge and attacked a French encampment. The French, under command of Charles Antoine Xaintrailles, beat them off and they withdrew to their own entrenchments. Before daybreak on the following morning (25 May), Xaintrailles attacked in two columns. The first, Column Barbier (three battalions and one squadron), drove the insurgents <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and chased them to the Leuk. The second, the left column, including two battalions of the 89th and 110th {{as well as some of}} the grenadiers of those two demi-brigades, were under the personal command of Xaintrailles, and attacked the insurgent position at Leuk, defended by seven guns so carefully placed as to deliver enfilade fire on the passage of the valley; furthermore, the insurgents had placed sharpshooters on the approaches to the gorge. Xaintrailles sent two flanking detachments to the crest of the mountains, well out of artillery range, while the main body in the valley attacked the position in front of them. It received such a storm of musketry and canister fire at the foot of the entrenchments that it began to waver; at this point, a well-sustained fusilade from the crest of the mountains showered the insurgents' flanks. The men in the gorge redoubled their efforts and entered the Valais entrenchments, slaying some of the gunners at their positions. The survivors fled to Raron, abandoning their guns and magazines.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's meticulous {{planning}} {{may also}} have extended to the timing of his operation, and even his choice of attire, according to Kaye's research team. [...] "The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend," [...] Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator may have returned to his normal occupation. [...] "If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then you would need {{as much time as}} possible to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> find transportation and get home.

500|$|The first skirmishing of the Crawford {{expedition}} {{began at}} about 2 p.m. on June 4, 1782. The scout party led by John Rose encountered Captain Pipe's Delawares on the Sandusky Plains and conducted a fighting retreat to {{a grove of}} trees where they had stored their supplies. The scouts {{were in danger of}} being overrun, but were soon reinforced by the main body of Crawford's army. Crawford ordered the men to dismount and drive the Indians <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> After intense fighting, the Americans gained possession of the grove, later known as [...] "Battle Island".|$|E
500|$|Certain {{pieces were}} found which, though not conclusive, did suggest that L'Oiseau Blanc {{had made it}} to the continent. Little of the {{aircraft}} would have remained, since it was created primarily from plywood and canvas. The parts most likely to endure would have been the engine and the aluminum fuel tanks. In Maine, bits and pieces of struts were found, and wood similar to the kind used to build the biplane. Engine metal was also found near the town of Machias, that was not typical to the United States or Canada.
