500|$|After the British Army {{failed to}} capture Westende, the {{mounting}} was optimised {{for use on}} a monitor. It was very simple, consisting of two large girders connected together at each end with the gun and its carriage between them. The mount could only traverse 10° inside its fixed, ½-inch (12.7mm) gun shield and was aimed over the starboard side of the monitor. It was loaded at a fixed angle of 10°, but it could only fire between 22° and 45° to equalize the stresses on the carriage and the ship. It was provided with hydraulically powered cranes, loading tray, rammer and breech mechanism to minimize the crew's workload, but the ammunition parties had to use muscle power. The shells were stowed below deck {{and had to be}} moved by <b>overhead</b> <b>rail</b> to the hatch in the deck behind the gun to be lifted up and loaded. The cordite propellant charges were kept in eighteen steam-heated storage tanks mounted on the forecastle deck abaft the funnel and moved to the gun on a bogie mounted on rails, two one-sixth charges at a time, which reduced the rate of fire to about one round about every 3–4 minutes. The monitors had to be extensively modified to handle the gun. Numerous additional structural supports had to be added underneath the gun to support its weight of the sides had to be plated in to accommodate the additional crewmen and the interior rearranged for the 18–inch shells and the loading arrangements.|$|E

50|$|In addition, a new railway {{electrification}} system was installed using <b>overhead</b> electric <b>rail</b> {{instead of the}} tensioned cable normally used for overhead electrification so that the required 4.90-metre height clearance could be achieved. In the late 1980s, a one kilometre (1 km) long <b>overhead</b> electric <b>rail</b> had been tested at 160 km/h. Before this experiment, trains running under <b>overhead</b> electric <b>rails</b> in Switzerland had been limited to 110 km/h and internationally to 80 km/h.|$|R

Please note that this was years before Google cars started to be developed.|$|R
2500|$|On August 1, 2011, the CN Tower {{opened the}} EdgeWalk, an {{amusement}} in which thrill-seekers can walk on {{and around the}} roof of the main pod of the tower at , which is directly above the 360 Restaurant. It is the world's highest full-circle, hands-free walk. Visitors are tethered to an <b>overhead</b> <b>rail</b> system and walk {{around the edge of the}} CN Tower's main pod above the 360 Restaurant on a [...] metal floor. The attraction is closed throughout the winter season and during periods of electrical storms and high winds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biggest change}} was the {{addition}} of a [...] BL Mk I gun in an enormous gun shield mounted abaft the engine room, fixed over the starboard side. The gun itself could traverse 20°, but the gun shield was fixed. The entire mount weighed , but the total weight of the ammunition, equipment and supports nearly doubled this again. This weight so far aft promised to increase the draft at the stern enough that the after inboard compartments of the torpedo bulge, which were normally free-flooding, were closed up, but the ship's draft increased to [...] forward and [...] aft. This corresponded to a displacement of , even after removal of the armored conning tower in compensation. The gun was hydraulically worked, but the ammunition parties had to use muscle power. The shells were stowed below deck and had to be moved by <b>overhead</b> <b>rail</b> to the hatch in the deck behind the gun to be lifted up and loaded. The cordite propellant charges were kept in eighteen steam-heated storage tanks mounted on the forecastle deck abaft the funnel and moved to the gun on a bogie mounted on rails, two one-sixth charges at a time, reducing the rate of fire to about one round every 3–4 minutes. The interior of the ship was extensively modified to accommodate the larger crew of 278 officers and men, storage and handling gear for the 60 18-inch shells, and to support the weight of the gun mount. Other changes included the transfer of the radio room down into the hold, addition of a new gyrocompass, enlarging the bridge and rearranging the existing magazines and storage spaces. A pair of two pounder anti-aircraft guns were also mounted on top of the gun shield. The guns had a muzzle velocity of [...] with a [...] 8 crh armour-piercing, capped shell and had a range of [...] at an angle of 45° with a normal charge of [...] Using the [...] supercharge increased muzzle velocity to [...] and range to [...]|$|E

6000|$|Who takes {{count of}} the prejudices which we absorb through the skin by way of our surroundings? It was not the {{spectacle}} that impressed me. The first thought that almost spoke itself aloud was: [...] "They are killing kine;" [...] {{and it was a}} shock. The pigs were nobody's concern, but cattle--the brothers of the Cow, the Sacred Cow--were quite otherwise. The next time an M.P. tells me that India either Sultanises or Brahminises a man, I shall believe about half what he says. It is unpleasant to watch the slaughter of cattle when one has laughed at the notion for a few years. I could not see actually what was done in the first instance, because the row of stalls in which they lay was separated from me by fifty impassable feet of butchers and slung carcasses. All I know is that men swung open the doors of a stall as occasion required, and there lay two steers already stunned, and breathing heavily. These two they pole-axed, and half raising them by tackle they cut their throats. Two men skinned each carcase, somebody cut off the head, and in half a minute more the <b>overhead</b> <b>rail</b> carried two sides of beef to their appointed place. There was clamour enough in the operating room, but from the waiting cattle, invisible {{on the other side of}} the line of pens, never a sound. They went to their death, trusting Judas, without a word. They were slain at the rate of five a minute, and if the pig men were spattered with blood, the cow butchers were bathed in it. The blood ran in muttering gutters. There was no place for hand or foot that was not coated with thicknesses of dried blood, and the stench of it in the nostrils bred fear.|$|E

In 1894, his machine was tested with <b>overhead</b> <b>rails</b> {{to prevent it}} from rising. The test showed that it had enough lift to take off. The craft was uncontrollable, which Maxim, it is presumed, realized, because he subsequently abandoned work on it.|$|R

50|$|Where {{there is}} limited {{clearance}} such as in tunnels, the overhead wire may be replaced by rigid <b>overhead</b> <b>rail.</b> An early example was in the tunnels of the Baltimore Belt Line, where a ∏ section bar (fabricated from three strips of iron and mounted on wood) was used, with the brass contact running inside the groove. When the overhead line {{was raised in the}} Simplon Tunnel to accommodate taller rolling stock a rail was used. A rigid <b>overhead</b> <b>rail</b> may also be used in places where tensioning the wires is impractical, for example on moveable bridges. Short overhead conductor rails are also installed at tram stops as for the Combino Supra.|$|E

50|$|Ammunition {{was moved}} {{by means of an}} <b>overhead</b> <b>rail</b> from which a shell trolley carried {{individual}} shells to be placed in the loading tray fixed to the breech. An extensible rail could raised and braced in place to allow the shell trolley to reach shells placed on the ground or in an ammunition car behind the mount. This ammunition car sometimes had its own <b>overhead</b> <b>rail</b> to move the shells forward to where the trolley in the mount could reach it through a hatch in the roof. The shell and powder were manually rammed into the gun. The gun had to be loaded at zero elevation and thus needed to be re-aimed between each shot. It used the German naval system of ammunition where the base charge was held in a metallic cartridge case and supplemented by another charge in a silk bag which was rammed first.|$|E
