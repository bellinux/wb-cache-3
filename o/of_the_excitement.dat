The erection may be partially lost and regained repeatedly during an extended excitement phase. Both testicles become drawn upward toward the perineum, notably in circumcised males where less skin is available to accommodate the erection. Also, the scrotum can tense and thicken during the erection process.|$|E

500|$|Charles Rosen, who unraveled {{this unique}} {{borrowing}} of a Beethovenian structure in Schubert's A major Sonata, has {{also referred to}} Schubert's departure from the former's style in this instance: [...] "Schubert moves with great ease within the form which Beethoven created. He has, however, considerably loosened what held it together, and stretched its ligaments unmercifully... the correspondence of part to whole has been considerably altered by Schubert, and explains why his large movements often seem so long, since they are being produced with forms originally intended for shorter pieces. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> naturally goes out of these forms when they are so extended, but this is even a condition of the unforced melodic flow of Schubert's music". Rosen adds, however, that [...] "with the finale of the A major Sonata Schubert produced a work that is unquestionably greater than its model".|$|E

40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitements</b> {{generated}} by <b>the</b> cold atom systems {{is the possibility}} to realize, and explore, varied topological phases stemming from multi-component nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condensate. Popular examples are the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and the ferromagnetic (FM) phases in the three-component atomic condensate with effective spin- 1, to which different topological manifolds can be assigned. It follows, from consideration of homotopy, that different sorts of topological defects will be stable in each manifold. For instance, Skyrmionic texture {{is believed to be}} a stable topological object in two-dimensional AFM spin- 1 condensate. Countering such common perceptions, here we show on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> a new wave function decomposition scheme that there is no physical parameter regime wherein <b>the</b> temporal dynamics <b>of</b> spin- 1 condensate can be described solely within AFM or FM manifold. Initial state of definite topological number prepared entirely within one particular phase must immediately evolve into a mixed state. Accordingly, <b>the</b> very notion <b>of</b> topology and topological stability within <b>the</b> sub-manifold <b>of</b> AFM or FM become invalid. Numerical simulation reveals the linear Zeeman effect to be an efficient catalyst to extract the alternate component from an initial topological object prepared entirely within one particular sub-manifold, serving as a potential new tool for "topology engineering" in multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates...|$|R
