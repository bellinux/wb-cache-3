5|$|Minnie Island State Park offers {{opportunities}} for picnicking and fishing to visitors who reach it by boat. Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity, which is redundant because {{the island is}} accessible by boat. The Oh Ranger website advises visitors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> island to use a kayak to access the island because the island is heavily wooded {{and it is difficult}} to find a spot to dock.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of birds}} contain {{millions}} of tiny parallel passages called parabronchi. Small sacs called atria radiate {{from the walls}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> passages; these, like the alveoli in other lungs, are the site of gas exchange by simple diffusion. The blood flow around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of gas exchange (see diagram on the right).|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{restored}} Lafayette's citizenship on 1 March 1800, and he {{was able}} to recover some of his properties. The ruler offered to make Lafayette minister to the United States, but was met with a firm refusal, as Lafayette would not have anything to do with Napoleon's government. In 1802, Lafayette was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> minority that voted no in the referendum that made Bonaparte consul for life. Bonaparte offered to appoint Lafayette to the Senate and to bestow the Legion of Honor upon him, but Lafayette declined, though he stated he would gladly have taken the honors from a democratic government.|$|E

5|$|Samus {{intercepts}} a {{distress signal}} from the Space Pirate frigate Orpheon, whose crew have been slaughtered by the Pirates' own genetically modified, experimental subjects. At the ship's core, she battles with the Parasite Queena giant version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> parasites aboard the ship. The Parasite Queen is defeated and falls into the ship's reactor core, initiating {{the destruction of the}} ship. While Samus is escaping from the doomed frigate, she encounters a cybernetic version of Ridley called Meta-Ridley. During her escape, an electrical surge and explosion damages her power suit, which revert to her original Power Suit. Samus escapes the frigate and chases her nemesis in her gunship towards the nearby planet Tallon IV.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Monks line-up performed {{together for}} the last time at the Rockaround event in Las Vegas, in 2004. Later in the year, Johnston died in November after a lengthy battle with lung cancer. A further set of reunions took place in England and Germany in 2006 and 2007 before the Monks officially disbanded. On January 10, 2008, Day died from a massive heart attack at the age of 66. Burger began a solo career thereafter, performing mostly with the Monks' repertoire until 2009. In 2014, Burger, who was mayor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> town of Turtle River, Minnesota since 2006, died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 72.|$|E
5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> cabin of Sputnik 2, they {{were kept in}} progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and {{the researchers found that}} only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov noted Lyadov's talent, as did Mussorgsky, who {{described}} Lyadov to Stasov in 1873 as [...] "a new, unmistakable, original and Russian young talent". Tchaikovsky, however, had been unimpressed. In 1882, the publisher Besel asked Tchaikovsky's opinion about an Arabesque for solo piano that Lyadov had written. Tchaikovsky replied, [...] "It {{is impossible to}} envisage any thing more vapid in content than this composer's music. He has many interesting chords and harmonic sequences, but not a single idea, even <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiniest</b> sort." ...|$|R

5|$|Many {{contemporary}} uses {{of uranium}} exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 {{is the only}} naturally occurring fissile isotope, which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. However, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 {{and to a lesser}} degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating. Uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass, producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early photography.|$|E
