Such variables arise frequently in the analysis of algorithms, for which a stream of random bits influences either the input or the execution of the algorithm. To give a more specific example, we consider <b>occupancy</b> <b>problems,</b> where m balls are randomly allocated into n bins. Typical random variables [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{extensions}} to the Gaussian Processes (GPs) continuous <b>occupancy</b> mapping <b>problem.</b> There are {{two classes of}} <b>occupancy</b> mapping <b>problems</b> that we particularly investigate. The first problem is related to mapping under pose uncertainty and how to propagate pose estimation uncertainty into the map inference. We develop expected kernel and expected sub-map notions to deal with uncertain inputs. In the second problem, we account for the complication of the robot's perception noise using Warped Gaussian Processes (WGPs). This approach allows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the possible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs. The developed techniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP <b>occupancy</b> mapping <b>problem.</b> According to our experimental results, although taking into account pose uncertainty leads, as expected, to more uncertain maps, by modeling the nonlinearities present in the observation space WGPs improve the map quality.

40|$|A Large Deviations Principle (LDP), {{demonstrated}} for <b>occupancy</b> <b>problems</b> with indistinguishable balls, is {{generalized to}} the case in which balls may be distinguished by {{a finite number of}} colors. The col-ors of the balls are chosen independently from the occupancy process itself. There are r balls thrown into n urns with the probability of a ball entering a given urn being 1 /n (Maxwell-Boltzman statistics). The LDP applies with the scale parameter n going to infinity and the number of balls increasing proportionally. It holds under mild restric-tions, the key one being that the coloring process by itself satisfies a LDP. Hence the results include the important special cases of deter-ministic coloring patterns and of colors chosen with fixed probabilities independently for each ball. ...|$|R

40|$|To exploit large {{deviation}} approximations for allocation and <b>occupancy</b> <b>problems</b> {{one must}} solve a deterministic optimal control problem (or equiv-alently, a {{calculus of variations}} problem). As this paper demonstrates, and {{in sharp contrast to}} the great majority of large deviation problems for processes with state dependence, for allocation problems one can construct more-or-less explicit solutions. Two classes of allocation problems are studied. The first class considers objects of a single type with a parameterized family of placement probabilities. The second class considers only equally likely placement proba-bilities, but allows for more than one type of object. In both cases, we identify the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation whose solution characterizes the mini-mal cost, explicitly construct solutions, and identify the minimizing trajectories. The explicit construction is possible because of the very tractable properties of the relative entropy function with respect to optimization. ...|$|R
