During his set, backed up by The Guts, he was joined on stage by Dan Vapid for several Screeching Weasel and Riverdales songs. Ben Weasel and Dan Vapid also played two shows in August 2008 at Reggie's Rock Club in Chicago, playing the entirety <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Brain</b> Hurts {{as well as other}} songs by Screeching Weasel, The Riverdales, and from Ben Weasel's solo albums.|$|E
500|$|Ricketts {{was killed}} in 1948 when a train {{collided}} with his car while he was crossing the rail tracks. Ricketts' death severely hurt Steinbeck: [...] "he was part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> for 18 years". Although Steinbeck had moved to New York City shortly after the journey {{and the two men}} had not seen as much of each other in the following years, they had corresponded by mail and had been planning a further expedition, this time northwards to the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
500|$|In May 1832, Balzac {{suffered}} {{a head injury}} when his tilbury carriage crashed in a Parisian street. Although he was not hurt badly, he wrote to a friend about his worry that [...] "some of the cogs in the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> may have got out of adjustment". His doctor ordered him to rest and refrain from writing and other mental activity. When he had recuperated, he spent the summer at the Château de Saché, just outside the city of Tours, with a family friend, Jean de Margonne.|$|E

500|$|Rollins {{began his}} film career {{appearing}} in several independent films featuring the band Black Flag. His film debut was in 1982's The Slog Movie, about the West Coast punk scene. An appearance in 1985's Black Flag Live followed. Rollins' first film appearance without Black Flag was the short film The Right Side <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Brain</b> with Lydia Lunch in 1985. Following the band's breakup, Rollins {{did not appear}} in any films until 1994's The Chase. Rollins appeared in the 2007 direct-to-DVD sequel to Wrong Turn (2003), [...] as a retired Marine Corps officer who hosts his own show which tests the contestants' will to survive. Rollins has also appeared in Punk: Attitude, a documentary on the punk scene, and in American Hardcore (2006). [...] In 2012, Henry Rollins appeared in a short documentary entitled [...] "Who Shot Rock and Roll" [...] discussing the early punk scene in Los Angeles as well as photographs of himself in Black Flag taken by esteemed photographer Edward Colver.|$|E
500|$|The voice cast {{was signed}} on to do the film in 2001, and work then began on the script. The {{producers}} were initially worried that creating a film would {{have a negative effect}} on the series, as they did not have enough crew to focus their attention on both projects. As the series progressed, additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time. Groening and James L. Brooks invited back Mike Scully and Al Jean (who continued to work as showrunner on the television series) to produce the film with them. They then signed David Silverman (who, in anticipation of the project, had quit his job at Pixar) to direct the film. The [...] "strongest possible" [...] writing team was assembled, with many of the writers from the show's early seasons being chosen. David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, and Jon Vitti were selected. Ian Maxtone-Graham and Matt Selman joined later, and Brooks, Groening, Scully, and Jean also wrote parts of the script. Sam Simon did not return having left the show over creative differences in 1993. Former writer Conan O'Brien expressed interest in working with the Simpsons staff again, although he later joked that [...] "I worry that the Simpsons-writing portion <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> has been destroyed after 14 years of talking to Lindsay Lohan and that guy from One Tree Hill, so maybe it's all for the best." [...] The same went for director Brad Bird who said he had [...] "entertained fantasies of asking if [...] could work on the movie", but did not have enough time due to work on Ratatouille. The producers arranged a deal with Fox that would allow them to abandon production of the film at any point if they felt the script was unsatisfactory.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2017 {{interview}} Pattinson confirmed about {{contributing to}} the music of his upcoming film Damsel. Talking about it, he said that [...] "I don’t play that much any more, though I am doing music for [...] I used to differentiate between music and acting but the more I don’t play music, the more I push that area <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> into acting. I improvise like I would when I play music." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] remarked the Scarecrow, [...] "what unhappy {{thoughts}} you have, to be sure. This {{is proof}} that born brains cannot equal manufactured <b>brains,</b> for <b>my</b> <b>brains</b> dwell only on facts and never borrow trouble. When there is occasion for <b>my</b> <b>brains</b> to think, they think, but I would be ashamed <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brains</b> if they kept shooting out thoughts that were merely fears and imaginings, such as do no good, but are likely to do harm." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have just}} now looked over what I have written, {{and it is}} such a chaos of {{nonsense}} that I daresay you will throw it into the fire and call me an idle, stupid fellow; but, whatever you may think <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brains,</b> believe me to be, with the most sacred respect and heart-felt esteem, my dear Madam, your humble Servant, ROBT.

6000|$|I {{turned it}} over in front and {{examined}} the palm. At sight <b>of</b> it <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> reeled. This was surely magic! Minnie Moore's hand, too, was scarred over with cuts, exactly like Aunt Emma's!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Carlill is {{inspired}} by James Joyce, Captain Beefheart, Max Ernst, the DaDaists, Kurt Schwitters, Alfred Jarry, and Georges Perec. Concerning his writing lyrics, he has stated in an interview, [...] "...it's {{a connection to the}} sub-conscious a side-stepping of the rational brain to let what's in you spiritually manifest itself in your creative medium. I mess with words as they come flying out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> uninvited. I think it's more like prose-poetry sometimes, hypertext, concentrated meaning in a seemingly abstract construction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Besant {{opined that}} for centuries {{the leaders of}} Christian thought spoke of women as a {{necessary}} evil, and that the greatest saints of the Church were those who despised women the most, [...] "Against the teachings of eternal torture, of the vicarious atonement, of the infallibility of the Bible, I leveled all the strength <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> and tongue, and I exposed {{the history of the}} Christian Church with unsparing hand, its persecutions, its religious wars, its cruelties, its oppressions. (Annie Besant, An Autobiography Chapter VII)." [...] In the section named [...] "Its Evidences Unreliable" [...] of her work [...] "Christianity", Besant presents the case of why the Gospels are not authentic.|$|E
2500|$|On July 4, 2011, Madonna's manager Guy Oseary {{announced}} that the singer had begun recording the album. Sessions took place at Sarm West Studios and Guerrilla Strip in London, Studio at the Palms in Las Vegas, MSR Studios in New York, 3:20 Studios in Los Angeles, and Free School in California. Madonna was happy {{to be back in}} the enclosed space of a recording studio, after always being outside while filming W.E. According to her, she uses a [...] "different part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> when I work on music versus when I'm directing a film". The simplicity of songwriting is what appealed to her when she started recording the album, her first in three years since working on W.E.|$|E

6000|$|Deane {{smiled at}} her. [...] "I {{am afraid that}} {{sometimes}} when I come away from a maze <b>of</b> figures, <b>my</b> <b>brain,</b> or at any rate my tongue, is not so nimble as it should be. I'll keep pace with you all presently." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I," [...] he answered. [...] "I shall {{work with}} my hands if men will have none <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brains.</b> Indeed," [...] he continued, turning towards her with a swift, transfiguring smile, [...] "I am not a village prodigy going to London with a pocketful of manuscripts. Don't think that of me. I am going to London because I have been stifled and choked--I want room to breathe, to see {{men and women who}} live. Oh, you don't know the sort of place I have come from--the brain poison of it, the hideous sameness and narrowness of it all." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Get on {{with your}} pot-boiler, and leave me alone, Allan," [...] I said. [...] "You do not {{understand}} my difficulties in the least.

5000|$|If {{my mental}} {{processes}} are determined wholly by the motions <b>of</b> atoms in <b>my</b> <b>brain,</b> I {{have no reason}} to suppose that my beliefs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> to be composed of atoms. J. B. S. Haldane ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How?

60|$|That was all we {{said then}} about the matter. Subsequent events engrained the very words of that short {{conversation}} into the inmost substance <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> with indelible fidelity. I shall never forget {{them to my}} dying moment.|$|E

6000|$|Something I {{had been}} dimly {{conscious}} {{of at the}} back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> came forward and stood before me: the flabby figure of Miss Rosina Sellars. What was she doing here? What right had she to step {{between me and my}} regeneration? ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} bewilderment <b>of</b> <b>my</b> heated <b>brain</b> I {{tried to think}} what slanderer could have traced my family to the ignoble animal {{mentioned}} above.

6000|$|... "I am {{inclined}} to think, holy sir," [...] said Gambouge, {{after he had}} concluded his history, and shown how, in some miraculous way, all his desires were accomplished, [...] "that, after all, this demon was no other than the creation <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>brain,</b> heated by the effects of that bottle of wine, the cause <b>of</b> <b>my</b> crime and my prosperity." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the height}} of the gusts, in my high position, where the seas did not break, I found myself {{compelled}} to cling tightly to the rail to escape being blown away.

6000|$|... "Yes, a rheumatic {{headache}} in my poll, a sick headache over my eyes, and a misery headache in {{the middle}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain.</b> However, I came out, for I {{thought you might be}} waiting and grumbling like anything if I was not there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One word on {{business}} first," [...] said I, speaking from the lips outward, and meanwhile (in the private apartments <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain)</b> trying for the thousandth {{time to find}} some plausible arrangement of my story.

6000|$|A mankind {{which has}} invented the proverb, [...] "Time is money," [...] will {{understand}} my vexation.

60|$|Now {{that this}} {{much has been}} {{explained}} by another, I am still {{at a loss to}} know how this poor story should be begun, and after much cudgeling <b>of</b> <b>my</b> weak <b>brain</b> have decided to jump into the matter after the same fashion that the events come into my memory after these many years of peace and idleness.|$|R
50|$|After {{a ten-year}} hiatus the band reunited in 2009.
