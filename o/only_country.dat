Construction was carried out from December 2004 through February 2005. To ease logistics, Norway took the initiative to establish Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a cooperation between the countries with bases in Queen Maud Land to streamline transport costs.

5|$|One {{major issue}} is the West Lothian question, in which MPs from Scotland and Wales are able to vote on {{legislation}} affecting only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters. This when placed {{in the context of}} England being the <b>only</b> <b>country</b> of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for the elderly and free top-up university fees, has led to a steady rise in English nationalism. Some have suggested the creation of a devolved English parliament, while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects England to English MPs.|$|E

Germany is also the only team to win either the men's or women's World Cup without conceding a goal and the <b>only</b> <b>country</b> to win both World Cups. With 14 goals, Prinz became the overall top goalscorer at the Women's World Cup in 2007, and she and Brazilian Marta are the only women to have received the FIFA World Player of the Year award at least three times.|$|E
5|$|As a {{workaround}} many {{policy makers}} try to restore competitiveness through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims {{to reduce its}} unit labour costs. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the <b>only</b> <b>country</b> that had implemented relative wage moderation {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more to the level of 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy have hit a 25-year low and consumption has fallen to the level of 1950.|$|E
5|$|Cuba and Venezuela {{were the}} {{founding}} {{members of the}} Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). ALBA sought to redistribute wealth evenly throughout member countries, to protect the region's agriculture, and to oppose economic liberalization and privatization. ALBA's origins lay in a December 2004 agreement signed between the two countries, and was formalized through a People's Trade Agreement also signed by Evo Morales' Bolivia in April 2006. Castro had also been calling for greater Caribbean integration since the late 1990s, saying that only strengthened cooperation between Caribbean countries would prevent their domination by rich nations in a global economy. Cuba has opened four additional embassies in the Caribbean Community including: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Suriname, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. This development makes Cuba the <b>only</b> <b>country</b> to have embassies in all independent countries of the Caribbean Community.|$|E
