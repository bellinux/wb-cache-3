Leontiev specifically his concept of Objective(ized) Activity which means that, in order to change the mind-set of individuals, we need to start with changes to their activity - and/or to the object that [...] "suggests" [...] their activity. Objective(ized) Activity is at the core of what Labra has referred to as [...] "another" [...] tradition of Social Psychology, namely the Cultural-historical Activity Theory-based branch of Social Psychology, which sets it apart from mainstream (behaviorist/lewinian Social Psychology of small groups. The 'locus' of activity-based LGC is the Organization Workshop(OW), a learning event where participants, applying social division of labor principles, master new organizational knowledge and skills through a learning-by-doing approach. In OW-learning, the trainer's role is merely subsidiary (known as [...] "scaffolding" [...] in Activity Theory). In other words, it is not the trainer/instructor who teaches, but [...] "the object that teaches". Moraisean capacitation, then..."involves several elements: mastery <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> <b>experience,</b> perhaps with some theoretical guidance but at least with some theoretical insight; an element in which the object itself guides or influences the subject's understanding in the course of the activity; a process of critical reflection on action and on motives of action.

The instructional design is the principal factor that influences the quality of learning objects. The success in use of learning modules depends on the capability in involving learners in e-learning: the utility of electronic didactic materials depends on the capability to provide effective learning environments; learning utility depends on the possibility of applying theories and explanations to the real problems of everyday life. This paper, by considering constructivism a useful model to provide learning by doing, presents the results <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> to develop new learning solutions to make available better e-learning teaching courses to university students.

In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> <b>experience</b> on the {{evaluation}} of two message-passing middleware platforms for developing distributed applications, i. e. the ACE/TAO Real Time Event Channel (RTEC) and the Maestro/Ensemble group communication toolkit (M/E). In particular, we compare their functionalities and their performances in a simple yet meaningful deployment configuration. The functional comparison points out the different characteristics of the two systems. In particular, M/E simplifies the coding of applications with strong requirements in terms of group membership tracking and ordered message delivery guarantees, while RTEC provides users with unreliable message delivery between loosely coupled processes. The performance comparison shows that, under stressing conditions, M/E sacrifices throughput stability for enforcing reliable and ordered message delivery, while RTEC offers a more stable throughput of unordered messages sacrificing message delivery reliability under heavy load. In normal operating conditions, the two systems perform almost similarly. ...|$|E

40|$|Sport Education (SE) (Siedentop, Hastie, & van der Mars, 2011) is a {{curriculum}} and instructional model {{for physical education}} that has received <b>a</b> wealth <b>of</b> research attention (Hastie, de Ojeda, & Luquin, 2011; Kinchin, 2006; Wallhead & O 2 ̆ 7 Sullivan, 2005).

The purpose of this project was to address this gap in the literature by examining <b>a</b> method <b>of</b> including SE in a PETE programme and investigate how pre-service teachers (PSTs) interpret and deliver SE as a result. To achieve these aims the research was conducted in four sequenced phases. Firstly, the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> SE <b>experience</b> in PETE to prepare PSTs to teach SE was investigated. Secondly, one PST who completed this module had his delivery of SE observed on his teaching placement. Thirdly, the effectiveness of assessments within the <b>practical</b> SE <b>experience</b> in PETE were examined. Finally, a comprehensive analysis was conducted of seven PSTs’ interpretations and delivery of SE. Multiple methods of data collection were employed across all phases of the research including interviews, focus groups, observations and document analysis and investigated perceptions of the lecturer, PSTs and the researcher. Data were analysed using triangulation thematic coding and constant comparison. Results from all phases of the research highlighted the effectiveness of the <b>practical</b> SE <b>experience</b> in preparing PSTs to deliver SE effectively. Findings highlighted the shortcomings in the assessment methods used during the experience.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years the {{teaching}} profession has embraced {{the notion of the}} teacher as ‘reflective practitioner'. This has led to an increased emphasis on teacher action research and teachers reflecting-in-action with resultant increased respect for ‘teaching craft knowledge', and more recently incentives by research funding bodies to enhance researcher/classroom teacher partnerships. In pre-service teacher education programs students are encouraged to reflect on their teaching experiences and to consider what they can do to improve their performance. However in practice many of these metacognitive rambles are token observations focused on minor technical aspects of their teaching. At the University of Newcastle in Australia convenors of three program have worked together to continually update the reflective practices of the students involved in <b>practical</b> teaching <b>experiences.</b> This article presents developing strategies to assist student teachers better manage their role as reflective practitioners.

40|$|Abstract. Regular model {{checking}} {{is being}} developed for algorithmic verification of several classes of infinite-state systems whose configurations can be modeled as words over a finite alphabet. Examples include parameterized systems consisting <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary number <b>of</b> homogeneous finite-state processes connected in a linear or ring-formed topology, and systems that operate on queues, stacks, integers, and other linear data structures. The main idea is to use regular languages as the representation of sets of configurations, and finite-state transducers to describe transition relations. In general, the verification problems considered are undecidable, so the work has consisted in developing semi-algorithms, and decidability results for restricted cases. In previous work, algorithms {{have been developed for}} computing the set of reachable states or the transitive closure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transducer. <b>Practical</b> <b>experience</b> with these algorithms is that they often work well for simple transducers satisfying certain structural conditions. If the system under verification is modeled in terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> small actions (program statements), then the transitive closure of each can be computed and used in a standard reachability analysis or fixpoint computation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transitive closure. However, for arbitrary transducers, some divide-and-conquer strategy is needed to split a transducer into subparts whose transitive closure can be computed efficiently. In this paper, we present a systematic method for extracting subparts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transition relation, each of whose transitive closure can be computed efficiently. This method works also in the case where the system model is not structured as <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> small actions, which, e. g., is the case when the model {{is the result of the}} transformation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> temporal logic specification, for which manual extraction is difficult. We have implemented the approach, and evaluated its performance on both safety and liveness properties of some parameterized synchronization protocols from the literature. In particular, we are able to obtain better results for proving liveness (non-starvation) properties of these protocols. ...|$|R
40|$|WCET analyzers {{commonly}} rely on user-provided annotations such as loop bounds, recursion depths, region- {{and program}} constants. This reliance on user-provided annotations {{has an important}} drawback. It introduces a Trusted Annotation Basis into WCET analysis without any guarantee that the user-provided annotations are safe, let alone sharp. Hence, safety and accuracy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> WCET analysis cannot be formally established. In this {{paper we propose a}} uniform approach, which reduces the trusted annotation base to a minimum, while simultaneously yielding sharper (tighter) time bounds. Fundamental to our approach is to apply model checking in concert with other more inexpensive program analysis techniques, and the coordinated application of two algorithms for Binary Tightening and Binary Widening, which control the application of the model checker and hence the computational costs of the approach. Though in this paper we focus on the control of model checking by Binary Tightening and Widening, this is embedded into a more general approach in which we apply <b>an</b> array <b>of</b> analysis methods of increasing power and computational complexity for proving or disproving relevant time bounds <b>of</b> <b>a</b> program. First <b>practical</b> <b>experiences</b> using the sample programs of the Mälardalen benchmark suite demonstrate the usefulness of the overall approach. In fact, for most of these benchmarks we were able to empty the trusted annotation base completely, and to tighten the computed WCET considerably. 1...|$|R
40|$|Chemistry at the Higher School Certificate {{level has}} changed {{dramatically}} in the last twenty years. This thesis is concerned with those changes, {{the reasons for the}} changes and the way they have been brought about. The changing pattern of student intake is studied first on a world-wide basis and then from the particular, view of the Tasmanian scene. Then follows <b>an</b> account <b>of</b> the many and varied changes to the curriculum, examinations, and assessment techniques. The effect of these-changes on student numbers is also correlated. The period 1966 - 1988 has seen a progressive change from a stereo-typed traditional chemistry course to the more conceptual CHEM Study Course and finally a truly Australian developed course. These changes are studied in depth. During the same period the student population has changed tremendously. In the 1960 's students were faced with <b>a</b> massive load <b>of</b> rote-learning and <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> <b>experience</b> that was very limited in scope. Today's students are allowed to take the text book into the examination and carry out many diverse experiments in the laboratory. These facets are considered and from questionnaire material the reactions of both students and teachers are given. Changes from a complete external assessment to the present half external and half internal have taken place progressively over this period. This has affected the teaching methods particularly regarding methods of assessment. The changing nature of the student population in the Years Eleven and Twelve has caused much thought and debate. Changes to Chemistry curricula have attempted to cope for the varying student intake. These changes are documented and discussed. The roles of both the University of Tasmania and the Schools Board of Tasmania have played a very important part over the period and help from both parties has been readily forthcoming and is well documented. In conclusion the thesis, is in effect the "Tasmanian Chemistry Story".

In the kitchen, we have complete authority to be the designer, the craftsman and the client, all at once: we need neither degree, nor license, nor money to exercise and hone our taste – as opposed to the architectural industry. As designers, we take stock of the tools and ingredients available, and find creative ways to accommodate both personal preference and nutrition. Interactions with suppliers aid our search for sustainable resources, and the insights they offer help us compose recipes and meals sympathetic to my environment. As a craftsman, we draw on self-taught skills and expert advice to create dishes. More importantly, we can dwell on each ingredient, and contemplate the potential contained within, for in the words of Richard Sennet, in his book The Craftsman, all of our “efforts to do good quality work depend on curiosity about the material at hand. ” As the client, we eat what we make, and evaluate whether the recipe fulfilled the basic criteria set out {{at the beginning of the}} process.
