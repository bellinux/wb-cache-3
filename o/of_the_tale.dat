50|$|A {{good example}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> popular Arabic prose fiction is that <b>the</b> stories <b>of</b> Aladdin and Ali Baba, usually {{regarded}} as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tales</b> from One Thousand and One Nights, were not actually part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tales.</b> They were first included in French translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tales</b> by Antoine Galland who heard them {{being told by}} a traditional storyteller and only existed in incomplete Arabic manuscripts before that.

5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies.

Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E
5|$|No {{definite}} conclusion as to {{the date}} of Nikephoros' death can be reached today, but most modern scholars, such as Jean-Claude Cheynet, are doubtful of the version of Theophanes Continuatus.

5|$|A version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale</b> was {{composed}} by Potter in 1903, but {{set aside to}} develop other projects. In 1904, she failed to complete a book of nursery rhymes for Warnes, and the 1903 tale was accepted in its stead. Potter elaborated its setting and storyline, and developed the tale more fully before publication. The illustrations depict the cottages and gardens of Sawrey, a village in the Lake District near Potter's Hill Top farm, and {{have been described as}} some of the most exquisite Potter ever produced. Ribby was modelled on a cat living in Sawrey, Duchess on two Pomeranians belonging to Potter's neighbour Mrs Rogerson, Tabitha Twitchit on Potter's cat at Hill Top, and Dr Maggoty on the magpies in the London Zoological Gardens.|$|E
5|$|An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is {{mentioned}} in the Meigetsuki ("Record of the clean moon"), the diary of the poet and scholar Fujiwara no Teika. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to cloistered Emperor Go-Horikawa planned {{to create a new}} emaki <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tale</b> of Genji (after the 12th century Genji Monogatari Emaki, the best known of these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's diary. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though the consistency of manufacturing dates suggests that this is the case. The paintings of the emaki have been attributed to the painter Fujiwara Nobuzane and the captions to the excellent calligrapher Gokyōgoku (後京極良経, 1169–1206), despite definitive evidence.|$|E

5|$|Another {{literary}} genre called setsuwa ("informative narration") {{goes back}} to orally transmitted myths, legends, folktales, and anecdotes. Setsuwa comprise the oldest Japanese tales, were originally Buddhist influenced, and {{were meant to be}} educational. The oldest setsuwa collection is the Nihon Ryōiki (early 9th century). With a widening religious and social interest of the aristocracy, setsuwa collections were compiled again in the late 11th century starting with the Konjaku Monogatarishū The high quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tale</b> of Genji influenced the literature into the 11th and 12th centuries. A large number of monogatari and some of the best poetic treatises were written in the early Kamakura period (around 1200).|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Thompson wrote The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit as an {{addition}} to the Peter Rabbit series by Beatrix Potter to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tale</b> of Peter Rabbit. She was approached by the publishers to write it, the first authorised Peter story since 1930 {{and the only one}} not written by Potter. The book falls {{in the middle of the}} earlier series, rather than at the end, and takes Peter Rabbit outside of Mr. McGregor's garden and into Scotland. It was a New York Times Best Seller. In 2013, Thompson wrote a second book in the series titled The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit.|$|E
5|$|In all {{versions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale,</b> after marrying Gautama, Ahalya {{settles into}} his ashram (hermitage), which generally becomes {{the site of}} her epic curse.

In other scriptures, the ashram is usually near the river bank. The Brahma Purana {{says that it is}} near the river Godavari and the Skanda Purana (701–1200 CE) places it near the river Narmada. The Padma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (801–1100 CE) describe the ashram as near the holy city of Pushkar.|$|E
