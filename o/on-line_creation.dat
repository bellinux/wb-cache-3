50|$|Either {{of these}} {{treatments}} {{can be given}} in outpatient dialysis units, three or more times a week, usually 3-5 hours per treatment. IHDF is used almost exclusively, {{with only a few}} centers using IHF. With both IHF or IHDF, the substitution fluid is prepared on-line from dialysis solution by running dialysis solution through a set of two membranes to purify it before infusing it directly into the blood line. In the United States, regulatory agencies have not yet approved <b>on-line</b> <b>creation</b> of substitution fluid because of concerns about its purity. For this reason, hemodiafiltration, had historically never been used in an outpatient setting in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Continuous {{hemofiltration}} {{was first}} {{described in a}} 1977 paper by Kramer et al. {{as a treatment for}} fluid overload. Hemofiltration is most commonly used in an intensive care unit setting, where it is either given as 8- to 12-hour treatments, so called SLEF (slow extended hemofiltration), or as CHF (continuous hemofiltration), also sometimes called continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Hemodiafiltration (SLED-F or CHDF or CVVHDF) also is widely used in this fashion. In the United States, the substitution fluid used in CHF or CHDF is commercially prepared, prepackaged, and sterile (or sometimes is prepared in the local hospital pharmacy), avoiding regulatory issues of <b>on-line</b> <b>creation</b> of replacement fluid from dialysis solution.|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{revolution}} {{took place}} at the beginning of XXI century resulting from which the mass media (MM) as mass communication means has first acquired an addition in the form of mobile Internet and then transformed into a new branch – mobile media. All that has changed the whole face of journalism. Classic forms of the profession have also actively transformed. A mobile journalism got born that made it possible for any person to participate <b>on-line</b> in <b>creation</b> of socially relevant information. Using the mobile technology, ordinary citizens have created an alternative to usual MM sample of the XX century, some new media empire. Usual MM (press, radio, television) where active interaction between information manufacturers and the audience is excluded were forced to change under pressure of new technologies and demands of the audience. Following the demand trends, Internet, initially stationary and then mobile, has emerged as global infrastructure of interactive communication. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{benefits}} of negative detection for obscuring information are explored {{in the context}} of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS). AIS based on string matching have the potential for an extra security feature in which the “normal ” profile of a system is hidden from its possible hijackers. Even if the model of normal behavior falls into the wrong hands, reconstructing the set of valid or “normal ” strings is an NP-hard problem. The data-hiding aspects of negative detection are explored {{in the context of}} an application to negative databases. Previous work is reviewed describing possible representations and reversibility properties for privacy-enhancing negative databases. New algorithms are described, which allow <b>on-line</b> <b>creation</b> and updates of negative databases, and future challenges are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Factors that {{increase}} the likelihood of sustainable on-line learning community success fall into four general categories: the selection of an ease of learning and ease of use application permits an adequate default setting to begin operation yet permits users and managers to customize their <b>on-line</b> environment; <b>creation</b> and support of users, moderators, and administrators by providing training and supporting excellent experiences that evolve into an on-line learning culture; both users and managers must believe that content of an on-line group is an added value; and the effort required to participate in an on-line professional group are worth the added effort. Educators more commonly subscribe to the popular idea that face-to-face interactions in a traditional room are the ideal. The majority of teacher education faculty still fails to infuse educational technology procedures into their educational curriculum at substantial levels.

40|$|The present paper {{analyzes}} the 48 contiguous {{states of the}} Union {{in terms of their}} level of social capital and their ability to create and maintain on-line communities (Yahoo! groups). Drawing on Putnam’s social capital theory it proposes that social capital {{is one of the most}} fundamental ingredients of social aggregates, be they off or on-line based. Geographic units will emanate a number of on-line formations and an overall amount of on-line activity commensurate with their social capital endowment. Multiple regression analysis indicates that state-level social capital linearly increases with increase in number of clubs per 100, 000 state residents. Yet, the relationship between social capital and average weighted club activity, measured at state-level, is conditional and curvilinear. Social capital makes a difference, and a positive one, only for states under the mean in terms of social capital. States with a social capital endowment above the mean go in the opposite direction; they decline in terms of average club activity. The tentative explanation for these findings is that while high capital states facilitate <b>on-line</b> group <b>creation,</b> time and personal costs constrain the residents to focus more on their off-line lives and activities.

40|$|The {{production}} process of documents was deeply transformed {{according to the}} information technology influence on the document writing activities. The wide use of personal computer produced a transformation in the document creation process. It is becoming deeply a process of transformation and aggregation of documents. The different phases of this process are becoming more rapid than in the past, due to the re-usability of the available documents {{by means of the}} cut and paste functionalities. The documents creation process is losing its characteristic of linear process, and it is assuming its characterisation of co-operative process, which involves different users devoted to compose shapes and information of the existing documents, and/or transformation of part of them. The Internet diffusion is improving transformation of the document {{production process}} according to a co-operative approach. Indeed Internet makes it available a large and growing amount of information, and focuses its attention on global information starting from local information. Locally and globally available information may be used to form a new document according to the copyright problems. It is not however easy to retrieve and organise the very large amount of information potentially available in Internet according to the author’s information goals. In this context the need grew up of tools for editing and searching documents, that enable to automatically create personalised working document starting from documents. The aim of the present paper is to define an approach for the documents <b>on-line</b> driven <b>creation,</b> starting from the definition of their structures using shapes and semantics of their information. Key-words: Web documents, adaptive editor. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{adaptive}} and intelligent webbased educational system that uses AI techniques for personalized {{assessment of the}} learners. More specifically, we focus on a mechanism for <b>on-line</b> <b>creation</b> of a useradapted test, {{which can be used}} alongside the predetermined test. The user can ask for such a test any time he/she is willing to do so, even if he/she has not studied all predetermined concepts of a learning goal. A small rule base is used by an expert system inference engine for making decisions on the difficulty level of the exercises {{to be included in the}} test. This is based on the evaluation of the learner during concept studying. Adaptive assessment of the learner can be repeatedly used until there is no further need. Another small rule-base is used for deciding on whether a new test is suggested or not. This is based on the learner’s previous test assessment results. Preliminary experimental results show that the users need less time to study a learning goal when using the adaptive assessment capability of the system...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} SRAM-based FPGAs is {{constantly}} growing in aerospace industry {{despite the fact}} that their volatile configuration memory is highly susceptible to radiation effects. Therefore, strong fault-handling mechanisms have to be developed {{in order to protect the}} design and make it capable of fighting against both soft and permanent errors. In this paper, a fully reconfigurable medium-grained triple modular redundancy (TMR) architecture which forms part of a runtime adaptive on-board processor (OBP) is presented. Fault mitigation is extended to the voting mechanism by applying our reconfiguration methodology not only to domain replicas but also to the voter itself. The proposed approach takes advantage of adaptive configuration placement and modular property of the OBP, thus allowing <b>on-line</b> <b>creation</b> of different medium-grained TMRs and selection of their granularity level. Consequently, we are able to narrow down the fault-affected area thus making the error recovery process faster and less power consuming. The conventional hardware based voting is supported by the ICAP-based one in order to additionally strengthen the reconfigurable intermediate voting. In addition, the implementation methodology ensures using only one memory footprint for all voters and their voting adaptations thus saving storing resources in expensive rad-hard memories...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} among editors of journals publishing {{in the field of}} chemistry, chemical technology and related topics in Serbia, aiming to collect information on their experience, problems and difficulties during peer-review process. Editors from 22 journals out of 27 which regularly published during 2015 replied. General data on journals were collected from responses obtained from editors-in-chief, whereas all editors (including sub-editors and section editors) participated in a questionnaire concerning peer-review procedure. Additionally, they were asked to evaluate quality of reports and attitude of reviewers, discuss present situation and suggest measures to improve peer-review process. Greatest problems encountered by editors in peer-review process can be summarized as follows: low rate of acceptance to review, low quality of reports, sometimes due to reviewer’s bias or his/her inability to properly understand review process. A method used to search for reviewers does not substantially influence quality of reports. Editors agree that introduction of <b>On-Line</b> process and <b>creation</b> of precise instructions for reviewers, education of potential reviewers, as well as social, public and professional recognition and appreciation of reviewers’ work, are the most important measures to improve quality of peer-review process and, consecutively, quality of published articles and journals...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new type}} of fuzzy inference systems, denoted as DENFIS (dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system), for adaptive on-line and off-line learning, and their application for dynamic time series prediction. DENFIS evolve through incremental, hybrid (supervised/unsupervised), learning and accommodate new input data, including new features, new classes, etc. through local element tuning. New fuzzy rules are created and updated during the operation of the system. At each time moment the output of DENFIS is calculated through a fuzzy inference system based on m-most activated fuzzy rules which are dynamically chosen from a fuzzy rule set. Two approaches are proposed: (1) dynamic creation of a first-order TakagiSugeno type fuzzy rule set for a DENFIS <b>on-line</b> model; (2) <b>creation</b> of a first-order TakagiSugeno type fuzzy rule set, or an expanded high-order one, for a DENFIS off-line model. A set of fuzzy rules can be inserted into DENFIS before, or during its learning process. Fuzzy rules can also be extracted during the learning process or after it. An evolving clustering method (ECM), which is employed in both on-line and off-line DENFIS models, is also introduced. It is demonstrated that DENFIS can effectively learn complex temporal sequences in an adaptive way and outperform some well known, existing models...|$|R
