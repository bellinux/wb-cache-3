5|$|Lafayette College {{guarantees}} campus {{housing to}} all enrolled students. The school {{requires students to}} live in campus housing unless approved for residing in private off-campus housing or home as a commuter. The College offers on-campus housing options including traditional halls, Greek chapter houses, suite-style halls, and group living units; where some halls are single gender while <b>others</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> co-ed by floor, wing, room, or suite. In addition, Lafayette College provides specialty housings that ties to specific academic departments, student organizations, or religious affiliations. Other residences include the McKelvy House, the Arts Houses, the French/German House, Hispanic Society of Lafayette, and the Hillel House.|$|E

5|$|There {{are about}} fifty blue {{point-like}} {{objects in the}} HDF. Many seem {{to be associated with}} nearby galaxies, which together form chains and arcs: these are likely to be regions of intense star formation. <b>Others</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> distant quasars. Astronomers initially ruled out the possibility that some of the point-like objects are white dwarfs, because they are too blue to be consistent with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at the time. However, more recent work has found that many white dwarfs become bluer as they age, lending support to the idea that the HDF might contain white dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; <b>others</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E
5|$|During the day, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are almost}} {{never seen in}} the open, instead resting motionless on the sea floor buried under {{a thin layer of}} sediment that disguises their outlines. At night some individuals remain motionless, waiting for prey, while <b>others</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> encountered on the bottom unburied or actively swimming. Large sharks, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) are known to consume Pacific angelsharks. Known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, which infests the skin, the myxosporidian Chloromyxum levigatum, which infests the gall bladder, and the tapeworm Paraberrapex manifestus, which infests the spiral valve intestine. The leech Branchellion lobata may be attached around this shark's cloaca, inside the intestine, and even inside the uterus and on developing embryos.|$|E

5|$|Sam & Max Save the World is a 3D graphic {{adventure}} game {{in which}} the player controls the character of Sam. The player has Sam explore the environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Depending on the type of in-game entity a player selects using the cursor, the player can have Sam walk around an area, look at and comment on objects, pick up certain items or otherwise try to use them. Sam may also engage in conversation with non-player characters; when this occurs, the game presents a dialog tree with several subjects to pick from. Topics of conversation may directly involve the story or provide assistance with the game's puzzles, while <b>others</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> entirely unconnected. In some cases, the player may be able to choose dialog for Max to speak as well.|$|E
5|$|The 26 rongorongo texts with letter {{codes are}} inscribed on wooden objects, each with between 2 and 2320 simple glyphs and {{components}} of compound glyphs, for over 15,000 in all. The objects are mostly oblong wooden tablets, with the exceptions of I, a possibly sacred chieftain's staff {{known as the}} Santiago Staff; J and L, inscribed on reimiro pectoral ornaments worn by the elite; X, inscribed on various parts of a tangata manu ("birdman") statuette; and Y, a European snuff box assembled from sections cut from a rongorongo tablet. The tablets, like the pectorals, statuettes, and staves, were works of art and valued possessions, and were apparently given individual proper names {{in the same manner}} as jade ornaments in New Zealand. Two of the tablets, C and S, have a documented pre-missionary provenance, though <b>others</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> as old or older. There are in addition a few isolated glyphs or short sequences which might prove to be rongorongo.|$|E

Allowable costs are those the federal government determines permissible for federal assistance. Unallowable costs are those the government prohibits incurring for federal assistance. Certain cost items are considered universally unallowable, such as cost related to illegal activities and lobbying costs, but <b>others</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> considered unallowable for a type of recipient while being allowable for another type of recipient. As a general rule, any assistance used inappropriately, such as incurring unallowable costs, requires reimbursement to the federal government.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{scientists}} discovered several {{different forms of}} meats ants, forming the Iridomyrmex purpureus species group; three forms were identified (the regular I. purpureus {{and the other two}} forms I. sanguineus and I. viridiaeneus), differing in colour and nest structure. However, as there were no clear morphological differences among these variations, the taxonomic status and evolutionary relationship of these ants remained uncertain. Colouration varies from ants with a red head and thorax and a blue metallic sheen, to those with a yellowish body and a bluish-purple gaster. <b>Others</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> darker, appearing metallic-bluish to purplish-black. Owing to their different geographical ranges, the behaviour and ecology of these forms differentiated, based on examinations where multiple forms were sympatric. Each form had its own geographical limit, although the regular I. purpureus form is very common, inhabiting at least one-third of the Australian continent. Some forms may be dominant in certain habitats; for example, one form may be widespread throughout moist environments in dry areas, and others in cool and dry areas.|$|E
