25|$|The most {{important}} criticism of empirical views of mathematics is {{approximately the same}} as that raised against Mill. If mathematics is just as empirical as the other sciences, then this suggests that its results are just as fallible as theirs, and just as contingent. In Mill's case the empirical justification comes directly, while in Quine's case it comes indirectly, through the coherence of our scientific theory as a whole, i.e. consilience after E.O. Wilson. Quine suggests that mathematics seems completely certain because the role it plays in <b>our</b> <b>web</b> of belief is incredibly central, {{and that it would be}} extremely difficult for us to revise it, though not impossible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Web {{applications}} built using Java technologies usually access relational databases via JDBC API. This {{requires a}} database system specific JDBC driver {{to be installed}} on the application side. On the other hand, a paradigm shift {{is taking place in}} web application architectures. Future web applications will be built around Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) where applications will be assembled using remote “web services ” components. These newly assembled applications will provide functionalities using remote web services components over Internet via XML messages. Same paradigm shift will eventually apply to the data communication between applications and databases. Future applications will utilize standard “database web services ” for data storage and querying requirements. Here we propose a new architectural model and present a prototype “database web service ” for relational database systems. In <b>our</b> model, <b>web</b> applications do not need to deal with database drivers but leave the driver-oriented communication to a database <b>web</b> service. <b>Our</b> database <b>web</b> service eliminates the need for installation, maintenance, and other issues involved in maintaining JDBC drivers in distributed web application development...|$|R
