5|$|Premastication is {{complementary}} to breastfeeding in {{the health}} practices <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> and young children, providing large amounts of carbohydrate and protein nutrients not always available through breast milk, and micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12 which are essential nutrients present mainly in meat. Compounds in the saliva, such as haptocorrin also help increase B12 availability by protecting the vitamin against stomach acid.|$|E
5|$|Schaffer in Social Development (1996) {{suggests}} that the father–child relationship is primarily a cultural construction shaped by the requirements of each society.

Other studies, however, point in the opposite direction.|$|E

There are also the indicators <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> mortality compared and position of the Czech Republic among select countries was determined. In conclusion, the development and intensity <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> mortality <b>of</b> the Czech Republic is compared with the development and intensity <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> mortality <b>of</b> Slovakia.

50|$|Causes <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> {{mortality}} directly {{lead to the}} death. Environmental {{and social}} barriers prevent access to basic medical resources and thus contribute to an increasing infant mortality rate; 99% <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> deaths occur in developing countries, and 86% of these deaths are due to infections, premature births, complications during delivery, and perinatal asphyxia and birth injuries. Greatest percentage reduction <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> mortality occurs in countries that already have low rates <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> mortality.Common causes are preventable with low-cost measures. In the United States, a primary determinant <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> mortality risk is infant birth weight with lower birth weights increasing the risk <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> mortality. The determinants of low birth weight include socio-economic, psychological, behavioral and environmental factors.|$|R

5|$|Tuberculosis {{prevention}} and control efforts rely {{primarily on the}} vaccination <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases. The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.

5|$|However, stool {{cultures}} {{should be}} performed in those with blood in the stool, those {{who might have been}} exposed to food poisoning, and those who have recently traveled to the developing world. It may also be appropriate in children young than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.|$|E
5|$|Several {{developments}} in the 1900s improved the outcome for those with pneumonia. With the advent of penicillin and other antibiotics, modern surgical techniques, and intensive care in the 20th century, mortality from pneumonia, which had approached 30%, dropped precipitously in the developed world. Vaccination <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> against Haemophilus influenzae type B began in 1988 {{and led to a}} dramatic decline in cases shortly thereafter. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults began in 1977, and in children in 2000, resulting in a similar decline.|$|E

40|$|The {{factors that}} {{contribute}} to individual differences in the reward value <b>of</b> cute <b>infant</b> facial characteristics are poorly understood. Here we show that the effect of cuteness on a behavioral measure of the reward value <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> faces is greater among women reporting strong maternal tendencies. By contrast, maternal tendencies did not predict women’s subjective ratings of the cuteness <b>of</b> these <b>infant</b> faces. These results show, for the first time, that the reward value <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> facial cuteness is greater among women who report being more interested in interacting with infants, implicating maternal tendencies in individual differences in the reward value <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> cuteness. Moreover, our results indicate that the relationship between maternal tendencies and the reward value <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> facial cuteness is not due to individual differences in women’s ability to detect infant cuteness. This latter result suggests that individual differences in the reward value <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> cuteness are not simply a byproduct of low cost, functionless biases in the visual system...|$|R

5|$|Composer Engelbert Humperdinck, after {{attending}} {{the debut of}} his opera Königskinder at the Metropolitan Opera, sailed on George Washington in early January 1911 in order to attend the opera's Berlin premiere. American sculptor George Grey Barnard returned to New York in April amidst controversy over some of his works. An organization called the National Society for Protection of Morals was protesting the presence of nude figures in sculptures he executed for the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg. July saw George Washington transporting a menagerie of sorts. The liner was carrying a shipment from India of 6 white peacocks, 2 lions, 2 elephants, 150 monkeys, and some 2,000 canaries destined for the recently organized Saint Louis Zoological Park. In August, two men of note—both headed for Berlin—sailed on George Washington. Nathan Straus, co-owner with his brother Isidor of R.H. Macy & Company, sailed as the U.S. delegate {{to the third world}} congress for the protection <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> held in Berlin. Congressman Richard Bartholdt, charged by President Taft to deliver a statue of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben to the German government, sailed with the statue, which was a gift from the American people.|$|E
5|$|First-wave {{feminism}} was {{a period}} of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK Custody <b>of</b> <b>Infants</b> Act 1839 which introduced the Tender years doctrine for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time. Other legislation such as the Married Women's Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act, these became models for similar legislation in other British territories. For example, Victoria passed legislation in 1884, New South Wales in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights as well.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} in southern Poland that clouds and hail were produced by creatures named płanetnik, chmurnik, or obłocznik: they compressed fog into clouds, and fragmented ice with iron flails into hailstones. They {{were considered to}} be the spirits <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> who had died without baptism, or the spirits of drowned and hanged people. Such spirits were seen in Serbia as bringers of hail clouds; they were addressed in folk spells, with which they were made to lead the clouds away from the village. According to other notions, płanetniks were persons who flew into the sky during storms. They could fly in spirit, while they were in deep sleep, or they could fly in body and soul. The płanetniks were friendly toward humans, often warning them about the approach of a storm or hail. They could direct the movement of clouds.|$|E

5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent <b>of</b> <b>infants.</b> Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E
5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

40|$|Background: Cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging, the General Movement Assessment, and the Test <b>of</b> <b>Infant</b> Motor Performance are all {{tools that}} can predict neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants. However, how these tests {{relate to each}} other is unclear. Aims: To examine the {{relationship}} between cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging measured at term age, and the General Movement Assessment and Test <b>of</b> <b>Infant</b> Motor Performance measured at 10 - 15 weeks post-term age. Study design: Prospectively collected data in a sample <b>of</b> very preterm <b>infants.</b> Subjects: Fifty-three infants (23 female, 30 male) with a median gestational age of 28 weeks (range: 23 - 30 weeks) and a median birth weight of 1000 g (range: 515 - 1465 g). Outcome measures: Test <b>of</b> <b>Infant</b> Motor Performance, General Movement Assessment. Results: Infants with abnormal white matter {{were significantly more likely to}} have both abnormal general movements (p = 0. 01) and abnormal Test <b>of</b> <b>Infant</b> Motor Performance scores (p = 0. 001). Infants with abnormal general movements were significantly more likely to have lower Test <b>of</b> <b>Infant</b> Motor Performance Scores (p = 0. 01). Conclusions: Abnormal white matter is related to motor deviations as measured by the General Movement Assessment and the Test <b>of</b> <b>Infant</b> Motor Performance as early as 3 months post-term age in a cohort <b>of</b> preterm <b>infants.</b> (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the medical causes and social determinants <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> deaths occurring in Kayseri. Material and Method: Parents of 343 babies who died in 1997 were visited by qualified midwives and a questionnaire about risk factors and causes <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> deaths was performed. Results : One hundred and ninety six of the 343 deaths (57. 1 %) occurred during the neonatal period. Postneonatal mortality was higher in infants living in rural areas and in those who had less educated parents. The leading causes of deaths were pneumonia, prematurity and congenital abnormalities. Prematurity and congenital abnormalities were higher in urban areas but pneumonia and gastroenteritis were the leading causes <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> deaths in rural areas. It was found out that 58. 3 % <b>of</b> all <b>infant</b> deaths occurred at home and half of them had not been examined by a doctor before death. Conclusion: Although 57. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> deaths occurred in the neonatal period, preventable diseases such as pneumonia and gastro-enteritis were the leading causes <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> deaths particularly in rural areas...|$|R
5|$|Shtriga is a vampiric witch in {{traditional}} Albanian folklore that sucks the blood <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> at night while they sleep, {{and then turns}} into a flying insect (traditionally a moth, fly or bee). Only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained. The shtriga is often pictured as {{a woman with a}} hateful stare (sometimes wearing a cape) and a horribly disfigured face. The male noun for shtriga is shtrigu or shtrigan. Edith Durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga. A cross made of pig bone could be placed at the entrance of a church on Easter Sunday, rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave. They could then be captured and killed at the threshold as they vainly attempted to pass. She further recorded the story that after draining blood from a victim, the shtriga would generally go off into the woods and regurgitate it. If a silver coin were to be soaked in that blood and wrapped in cloth, it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} {{provided by}} Blake to Humphrey {{explains that the}} work depicts the resurrection. The top of the work depicts Christ on the Throne of Judgement with Heaven opened up across the painting. Behind Christ are the heads <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> which represent creation coming from Jesus. Christ is surrounded by the four Zoas and seven angels that have vials filled with God's wrath. An image of a tabernacle with a cross inside is depicted above Christ. An image of baptism is to Christ's right and the Last Supper is to Christ's left with both representing eternal life. Further to Christ's right is {{the resurrection of the}} just and to the left is the resurrection and subsequent fall of the wicked. Adam and Eve are below Christ, and Abraham and Moses are nearby. Below Moses is Satan wrapped by the Serpent and in the centre is the book of death. At the top is the book of life, and the Christian Church is the figure of a woman on top of the moon.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} and empirically {{supported}} method for assessing attachment in infants (11 months–17 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth {{as a result of}} her careful in-depth observations <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> with their mothers in Baltimore, USA (see below). The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis 'Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)'. The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and attachment disorder are not synonymous.|$|E
