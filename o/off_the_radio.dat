25|$|In 1970, the FCC forced Triangle to {{sell off}} its {{broadcasting}} properties due to protests from then-Pennsylvania Governor Milton Shapp. Shapp complained that Triangle had used its three Pennsylvania television stations—WFIL-TV, WLYH-TV in Lebanon and WFBG-TV (now WTAJ-TV) in Altoona—in a smear campaign against him. The WFIL stations, along with radio-television combinations in New Haven, Connecticut and Fresno, California, were sold to Capital Cities Communications. As a condition of the sale, Capital Cities had to spin <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> stations to other entities – in Philadelphia, WFIL-FM (now WIOQ) was sold to its general manager John Richer, and WFIL radio went to LIN Broadcasting. On April 27, 1971, shortly after the sale was approved and Capital Cities took control of channel 6, the station changed its call letters to the current WPVI-TV.|$|E
25|$|Magee fled to England, {{where he}} was part of an IRA active service unit. On 7 June 1992 Magee and another IRA member, Michael O'Brien, were {{travelling}} in a car on the A64 road between York and Tadcaster, when they were stopped by the police. Magee and O'Brien were questioned by the unarmed police officers, who became suspicious and called for back-up. Magee shot Special Constable Glenn Goodman - who died later in hospital - and then shot the other officer, PC Kelly, four times. PC Kelly escaped death when a fifth bullet ricocheted <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> he was holding to his ear, and the IRA members drove away. Another police car began to follow the pair, and came under fire near Burton Salmon. The lives of the officers in the car were in danger, but Magee and O'Brien fled the scene after a member of the public arrived. A manhunt was launched, and hundreds of police officers, many of them armed, searched woods and farmland. Magee and O'Brien evaded capture for four days by hiding in a culvert, before they were both arrested in separate police operations in the town of Pontefract.|$|E

500|$|Rakim is {{credited}} with influencing rappers including the Wu-Tang Clan, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, and Nas, who cited Paid in Full {{as one of his}} favorite albums. 50 Cent told NME that Paid in Full was the first album he bought: [...] "I used to get my grandmother's tape recorder – the one she used to tape church services – and record hip-hop <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio.</b> And, with Eric B. & Rakim, I think that was the first moment where I felt like, 'I've got to own this.

500|$|The Beatles asked {{producer}} Martin {{to come to}} the rescue, so {{he borrowed}} two four-track recorders from EMI, and long-time Beatles' engineer Geoff Emerick was given the task of building and setting up a studio with portable equipment. After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles' manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics and Mardas left the company. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least £300,000 (£4.5 million in 2015 pounds). Starr once approved of one of Mardas’ ideas: [...] "He [...] had an idea to stop people taping our records <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> – you’d have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then we thought we could sell the time and put commercials on instead. We brought EMI and Capitol in from America to look at it, but they weren’t interested at all".|$|E

500|$|Mac {{experiences}} {{his spiritual}} resurrection {{even as he}} wrestles with death, in both the past—Sonny's father in the Vietnam War—and present—his own daughter in a car accident. The latter threatens to derail Mac's new life, captured in {{the moment when he}} learns of it and [...] turns <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> that is playing his new song. Leonard writes of this resurrection, [...] "Depression hangs like a pall over Tender Mercies [...] what makes this film inspiring is that it is also about the joy of being found.... Mac finds the way, the truth, and the life he wants." [...] In a climactic scene, Mac tells Rosa Lee that he was once nearly killed in a car crash himself, which forces him to address the question of why he was allowed to live while others have died. Jewett writes of this scene, [...] "Mac Sledge can't trust happiness because it remains inexplicable. But he does trust the tender mercies that mysteriously led him from death to life." ...|$|E
