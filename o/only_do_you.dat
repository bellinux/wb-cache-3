5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
500|$|On 15 March 1944, Operation Save was {{launched}} {{with the objective}} of clearing Partisans from the Semberija region. Sauberzweig wrote an open letter to the division: [...] "We have now reached the Bosnian frontier and will (soon) begin the march into the homeland.... The Führer has provided you with his best weapons. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> (have these) in your hands, but above all you have an idea in your hearts – to liberate the homeland.... Before long, each of you shall be standing in the place that you call home, as a soldier and a gentleman; standing firm as a defender of the idea of saving the culture of Europe – the idea of Adolf Hitler." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its initial release, Don't Look Now was {{generally}} well received by critics, although some criticised it for being [...] "arty and mechanical". Jay Cocks for Time, wrote that [...] "Don't Look Now is such a rich, complex and subtle experience that it demands more than one viewing", while Variety commented that the film's visual flourishes made it [...] "much more than merely a well-made psycho-horror thriller". Pauline Kael writing for The New Yorker was more reserved in her praise, considering the film to be [...] "the fanciest, most carefully assembled enigma yet put on the screen" [...] but that there was a [...] "distasteful clamminess about the picture", while Gordon Gow of Films and Filming felt that it fell short of the aspirations of Nicolas Roeg's previous two films, Performance and Walkabout, but it was nevertheless a thriller of some depth. Vincent Canby, reviewer for The New York Times, on the other hand, criticised the film for a lack of suspense which he put down to a twist that comes halfway through rather than at the end, and at which point it [...] "stops being suspenseful and becomes an elegant travelogue that treats us to second-sightseeing in Venice". Canby also suggested that second sight was not convincing on screen, since it appeared simply like flash-forward which is a standard story-telling device in films, and concluded that [...] "Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> probably have better things to do, but so, I'm sure, do most of the people connected with the film." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{feel myself}} bound in honour, believing, as I do, that he [...] is quite {{resolved}} in his purpose, to release {{you from your}} [...] promise.

"Nevertheless, sir, {{you know}} the gentleman himself, having met him, as he tells me, {{frequently}} {{at the house of}} Mr. Wallace, who was minister of the chapel at which he worshipped, and who came up to London to minister to those sorely afflicted and needing comfort. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> meet with Mr. Harvey and his wife, but you rendered to them very material service." ...|$|R
2500|$|Davis then {{defended his}} World Allround Championships title in Calgary in March 2006 {{with a world}} record {{allround}} score of 145.742. [...] At the competition, Davis was paired with teammate Chad Hedrick in the 1500 meter race, and dramatically broke Hedrick's own world record {{with a time of}} 1:42.68, which Davis would later rebreak that year with a time of 1:42.32. Regarding his world allround title, Davis said, [...] "To me, this is bigger than the Olympics. [...] This medal is prestigious. [...] Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> have to skate 500 meters, but you have to skate 10000, you have to skate a 1500 and a 5000 and you only have two days to do it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} from Marian," [...] she went on, [...] "that I have only to claim my release from our {{engagement}} to obtain that release from you. It was forbearing and generous on your part, Sir Percival, to send me such a message. It is <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> <b>you</b> justice to say that I am grateful for the offer, and I hope and {{believe that it is}} <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> myself justice to tell you that I decline to accept it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} would in the least. If I were to make a noise about it, it would <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> harm. You wouldn't wish {{all the world to}} know that he had--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ha! Well, you {{certainly}} are a pretty creature, Edda,' he said graciously. 'You'll pass muster! You want nothing but style. And, hang it! you'll do {{just as well}} without it, if the Canoness will <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> justice. Faces like that weren't given for nothing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is a pity,' {{said the}} Chevalier, looking {{thoroughly}} vexed, 'that {{you should have}} brought fresh difficulties on yourself for a mere piece of waste paper {{to be affected by}} the validity of your marriage. Dear cousin,'--he glanced at the officer and lowered his voice,--'let me tear this paper; it would <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> harm, and the Papal decree annuls it.|$|E
6000|$|Emily {{broke out}} with an angry {{disappointed}} exclamation. Clarence's face was scarlet, and he said low and hoarsely, 'That's Lester. He was in the Argus at Portsmouth two years ago;'--and then, as our little sister continued her indignant exclamations, he added, 'Hush! [...] Don't on any account {{say a word about}} it. I had better get back to my work. I am <b>only</b> <b>doing</b> <b>you</b> harm by staying here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a heroine, that's {{what you}} are, Frona," [...] he began again, with exuberance. [...] "And not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> save the mail-man, {{but by the}} delay you wrought in the trial you saved me. If one more witness had gone on the stand that first day, I should have been duly hanged before Gow put in an appearance. Fine chap, Gow. Too bad he's going to die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're <b>only</b> forty-eight. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{realize that}} my grandfather, sir, your father, old Isaac Bellew, {{killed a man}} with his fist when he was sixty-nine years old?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Always, but {{it never}} won. You see, even you {{did not know of}} it. You thought I did not even like you! That was why you wanted to prevent Corp's telling me about the glove, was it not? You thought it would pain me <b>only!</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{remember}} what you said: 'It is to save you acute pain that I want to see Corp first'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear, {{these things}} are trifles. The things that count lie between us two <b>only.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{know that you have}} been in my blood like a fever all day? You were there in the House this afternoon, you walked the streets with me, you drew me here.--Jane, I haven't felt like this since I was a boy. You have brought me back my youth. I adore you!" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{proceeded}} to talk--and as is inevitable, the war. Ah, the war--it {{was a terrible}} thing. He had become ill--very ill. Because, you see, not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> go without proper food, without proper rest and warmth, but, you see, you are in an agony of fear for your life all the time. An agony of fear for your life. And that's what does it. Six months in hospital--! The q-b, of course, was sympathetic.|$|E
6000|$|... "But we," [...] she answered, [...] "should only die to live, {{and that}} is why I try not to be afraid. I daresay, however, I mean the same as they <b>did,</b> <b>only</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not seem to have put their thought quite clearly." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Only</b> now <b>do</b> <b>you</b> look at {{the moves}} you wish to {{calculate}} (called candidate moves). The candidate moves are all the moves that lead to our dream position.|$|R

6000|$|... 'It's very good, Ernest dear,' she said, with wifely admiration, {{as soon as}} he had finished. 'Just like a real leader exactly; <b>only,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know, there aren't any anecdotes in it. I think {{a social}} leader of that sort ought always {{to have a lot of}} anecdotes. Couldn't you manage to bring in {{something}} about Fox and Sheridan, or about George IV. and Beau Brummel? They always do, you know, in most of the papers.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{is there}} for me to do, Rodney?" [...] he cried. [...] "I forge a shoe, and I fuller it, and I clip it, and I caulken it, and I knock five holes in it, {{and there it is}} finished. Then I do it again and again, and blow up the bellows and feed the forge, and rasp a hoof or two, and there is a day's work done, and every day the same as the other. Was it for this <b>only,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think, that I was born into the world?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We cannot come," [...] Selingman declared, without hesitation. [...] "I take {{my friend}} Maraton somewhere. As we sit here, Mr. Foley, we have spoken of politics. You {{are a great}} man. If any one can lift your country from the rut along which she is travelling, you will do it. A Unionist Prime Minister and you hold out the hand to Maraton! But what foresight! What acumen! You see beyond the thunder-clouds {{the things that we}} have seen. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> see them, but you have the courage to follow your convictions. What a mess you are making of Parties!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{said that}} and more, great jeddak," [...] {{answered}} the major-domo. [...] "They said that not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> fear {{to enter the}} chambers of O-Mai, but that you feared the slave Turan, and they blame you for your treatment of A-Kor, whom they all believe to have been murdered at your command. They were fond of A-Kor {{and there are many}} now who say aloud that A-Kor would have made a wondrous jeddak." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY UTTERWORD [not in {{the least}} put out, and rather pleased by his violence]. My dear Hector, I have <b>only</b> <b>done</b> what <b>you</b> asked me to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "What are you {{thinking}} of?" [...] cried the girl. [...] "I am the oldest of all, and I am <b>only</b> thirteen. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> wish to be turned into crawling babies? Run! run! run!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ned," [...] he said, [...] "I {{think that}} you and Charlie had better come to school again on Monday. The sooner you fall into your regular groove the better. It would <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> both harm to mope about the house here; and {{although}} the laughter and noise of your schoolfellows will jar upon you for awhile, {{it is better to}} overcome the feeling at once; and I am sure that you will best carry out what would have been his wishes by setting to your work again instead of wasting your time in listless grieving." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Hartley," [...] said Miss Gray. [...] "It may, it must be, {{friendly}} in you thus {{to advise}} me; {{but it would}} be most base in me to advance my own affairs at the expense of your prospects. Besides, what would this be but taking the chance of contingencies, with the view of sharing poor Middlemas's fortunes, should they prove prosperous, and casting him off, should they be otherwise? Tell me <b>only,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you,</b> of your own positive knowledge, aver that you consider this woman as an unworthy and unfit protectress for so young a person as I am?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There, you {{can know}} no more than that. But if I was you, I would believe that.

6000|$|... "That is good news, indeed," [...] the boy said. [...] "I {{was just}} going to ask, master, what he had <b>done</b> for <b>you,</b> because, though I went with you, it was you who planned the business, and I <b>only</b> <b>did</b> as <b>you</b> told me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Deane smoked {{steadily}} {{for several}} minutes. Finally, [...] "This {{is a little}} hard on me, isn't it, sir? I have <b>only</b> <b>done</b> what <b>you</b> yourself would have done--refused to have underhand dealings with men who made dishonorable propositions to me." ...|$|R
