2500|$|Beliefs {{that gay}} and lesbian adults are not fit parents, or that the psychosocial {{development}} {{of the children of}} {{gay and lesbian}} parents is compromised, have no basis in science. <b>Our</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> based on a review representing approximately 50 empirical studies and at least another 50 articles and book chapters and does not rest on the results of any one study. A review of the psychological research into the well-being of children raised by same-sex and opposite-sex parents continues to indicate that there are no reliable differences in their mental health or social adjustment and that lesbian mothers and gay fathers are not less fit as parents than are their heterosexual counterparts.

2500|$|In Raleigh, {{the lawyer}} for North Carolina's Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) issued a {{preliminary}} opinion that said [...] "that state law allows people to be sworn in using a Quran rather than a Bible". This was refuted by Guilford County's Senior Resident Superior Court Judge W. Douglas Albright who sets policy for the county's nine Superior Court courtrooms. Judge Albright stated flatly [...] "An oath on the Quran is not a lawful oath under our law." [...] He maintained that the statute means the Bible and that if {{that is to be}} changed {{it is up to the}} North Carolina Legislature, [...] "It's gotten way out there: They've got everything from the Book of Mormon to the Book of Wicca on the list. <b>Our</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> that the statute governs not only the type of oath, but the manner and administration of the oath, and that it's now a legislative matter to straighten out." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a sudden}} {{realization}} had come upon me that <b>our</b> <b>positions</b> <b>were</b> now reversed. It seemed strange that I should be interpreting {{the world to}} this man of power.|$|R
60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>position</b> <b>was</b> utterly reversed. A moment {{since we}} were firing, under cover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay {{uncovered}} and could not return a blow.|$|R

2500|$|In {{his later}} years, Hoyle became a staunch critic of {{theories}} of abiogenesis {{to explain the}} origin of life on Earth. With Chandra Wickramasinghe, Hoyle promoted the hypothesis that the first life on Earth began in space, spreading through the universe via panspermia, and that evolution on Earth is influenced by a steady influx of viruses arriving via comets. His belief that comets had a significant percentage of organic compounds was well ahead of his time, as the dominant views in the 1970s and 1980s were that comets largely consisted of water-ice, and the presence of organic compounds [...] was then highly controversial. Wickramasinghe wrote in 2003: [...] "In the highly polarized polemic between Darwinism and creationism, <b>our</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> unique. Although we do not align ourselves with either side, both sides treat us as opponents. Thus we are outsiders with an unusual perspective—and our suggestion for {{a way out of the}} crisis has not yet been considered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, on 27 July, Austria-Hungary {{started to}} {{complete}} the preparations for war. That same day, Jagow informed Szögyény {{that he was only}} pretending to take up the British offers of mediation in order to ensure British neutrality but had no intention of stopping the war. Szögyény reported [...] "in order to avoid a misunderstanding" [...] that Jagow had promised him that [...] "the German government assured Austria in the most binding fashion that it in no way identifies itself with the proposal , which may very shortly be brought to Your Excellency 's notice by the German government: it is, on the contrary decidedly opposed to consideration of them and is only passing them on out of deference to the British request" [...] (emphasis in the original). Jagow went on to state he was [...] "absolutely against taking account of the British wish, because [...] "the German government point of view was that it was at the moment of the highest importance to prevent Britain from making common cause with Russia and France. We must therefore avoid any action [...] might cut the line, which has so far worked so well, between Germany and Britain". Szögyény ended his telegram that [...] "If Germany candidly told Grey that it refused to communicate England’s peace plan, that objective [...] might not be achieved." [...] Bethmann Hollweg, in a message to Prince Tschirschky, wrote on 27 July: [...] "As we have already rejected one British proposal for a conference, it is not possible for us to refuse this suggestion also a limine. If we rejected every attempt at mediation, the whole world would hold us responsible for the conflagration and represent us as the real war-mongers. That would also make our position impossible here in Germany, where we have got to appear as though the war had been forced on us. <b>Our</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> the more difficult because Serbia seems to have given way very extensively. We cannot therefore reject the role of mediator; we have to pass on the British proposal to Vienna for consideration, especially since London and Paris are continuously using their influence on St. Petersburg." [...] In passing on Grey's message, Bethmann Hollweg deleted the last line, which read: [...] "Also, the whole world here is convinced, and I hear from my colleagues that the key to the situation lies in Berlin, and that if Berlin seriously wants peace, it will prevent Vienna from following a foolhardy policy." [...] In his reply to London, Bethmann Hollweg pretended that: [...] "We have immediately initiated mediation in Vienna in the sense desired by Sir Edward Grey." [...] Jagow sent Grey’s offer to Tschirschky, his ambassador in Vienna, but ordered him to not show it to any Austrian official in case they might accept it. At the same time, Bethmann Hollweg sent a distorted account of Grey’s offer to Wilhelm.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] she replied, stiffly; [...] "but <b>our</b> <b>positions</b> <b>are</b> quite different, Miss Carew. The {{fact is that}} I cannot afford to live an idle life. We are very poor, and my mother is partly {{dependent}} on my exertions." ...|$|R

60|$|There was {{a certain}} crisp definiteness about those two words which carried {{conviction}} with them.

50|$|Let <b>our</b> <b>position</b> <b>be</b> {{absolutely}} clear: An {{attempt by}} any outside force {{to gain control}} of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.|$|R
6000|$|The lad {{felt the}} hint, and blushed quite red. [...] "The cases are not similar, Smirke," [...] he said, [...] "and the allusion {{might have been}} spared.

60|$|However, {{while holding}} death at bay {{for a few}} hours more or less we might as well have our faces turned in the right direction, and I was ready to do {{whatsoever}} the scout suggested, for, as I have said, fear had fled from me now that <b>our</b> <b>position</b> <b>was</b> so desperate.|$|R
60|$|The attack began. By {{this time}} fifteen {{hundred or so}} of the Imperial troops had collected, and against them stood, perhaps, four hundred men in all, so that the odds were great.

6000|$|... "Aye," [...] grumbled Marius, [...] "you can {{contemplate}} that, {{and it is}} all you do contemplate.

6000|$|P.S.--The more I {{think the}} more desperate does our {{position}} seem. I see no possible hope of our return. If there were a high tree {{near the edge of}} the plateau we might drop a return bridge across, but there is none within fifty yards. Our united strength could not carry a trunk which would serve our purpose. The rope, of course, is far too short that we could descend by it.

6000|$|She turned pale, nevertheless, {{when she}} replied in those terms. I {{could see that}} I was {{disturbing}} her, when I asked if she remembered what the Cur had written.

As for me, I own that I feel better pleased now that the wind is blowing, and the silence is broken, than at the dead stillness which prevailed this morning. After all, methinks that a snowstorm cannot be more dreaded than a sandstorm, and we have faced those before now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have got}} a plan of some sort," [...] Malcolm said; [...] "what it is I have no idea, but they {{certainly}} seem confident about it.
