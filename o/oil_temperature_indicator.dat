40|$|The power {{transformer}} {{is one of}} the most expensive components in an electrical transmission and distribution network. The temperature inside a {{power transformer}} varies with the load. The higher the operating temperature the faster the degradation of paperpress board insulation, consequently the remaining life of the transformer decreases. In order to keep the temperature under a safe limit, thermal models for predicting the hottest spot temperature in a transformer based on the load, cooling factors and ambient conditions have been developed and currently used in practice. In this project, a thermal model stipulated by the IEC standard is evaluated. The evaluation is carried out using the experimental results obtained at varying load current on a 40 MVAOFAF-cooled transformer equipped with both fibre-optic sensors and <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>indicator,</b> and a 63 MVA-ONAF-cooled transformer equipped with <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>indicator.</b> The model parameters are obtained from a normal heat-run test performed by the transformers manufacture. It can be shown that the response of the Difference equations method to the load variations is better than the Exponential method. A model Using Difference equations method and based on the internal cooling variations is proposed in this thesis. However, the calculated hot-spot temperature is not in a good agreement with the measured hot-spot temperature during rapid load increase. A proper result for the hot-spot temperature calculation using Difference equations method with ONAN cooling mode is obtained, although the cooling class of the transformer is OFAF. The calculated hot-spot temperature is compared to the measured hot-spot temperature to evaluate the model. The Difference equations method with ONAN cooling mode never underestimates the hot-spot temperature more than 3 ℃under a normal loading period. For the particular overloading situation the underestimation is 9. 9 % of the time period that is less accurate comparing to the normal loading period. The rate of occurrence of the underestimation is 7. 7 % for the Difference equations method with OFAF cooling mode during the normal loading situation and 13. 8 % during the overloading situation. However, the Difference equations method with OFAF cooling mode never underestimates the hotspot temperature more than 10 ℃ during the normal loading and overloading situations. Improvements are still required in order to predict the hot-spot temperature accurately using the Difference equations method under various dynamic loading conditions. Results indicate that the calculated top-oil temperatures are either underestimated or overestimated. For accurate hot-spot temperature calculations, it is hence recommended to use the measured top oil temperature...|$|E

The model is verified according to data collected from the transformer of SSZ 11 - 50 kV/ 220.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{relationship}} between temperature and mortality has been explored {{for decades and}} many <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> have been applied separately. However, few data are available {{to show how the}} effects of different <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> on different mortality categories, particularly in a typical subtropical climate. OBJECTIVE: To assess the associations between various <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> and different mortality categories in Brisbane, Australia during 1996 - 2004. METHODS: We applied two methods to assess the threshold and <b>temperature</b> <b>indicator</b> for each age and death groups: mean temperature and the threshold assessed from all cause mortality was used for all mortality categories; the specific <b>temperature</b> <b>indicator</b> and the threshold for each mortality category were identified separately according to the minimisation of AIC. We conducted polynomial distributed lag non-linear model to identify effect estimates in mortality with one degree of temperature increase (or decrease) above (or below) the threshold on current days and lagged effects using both methods. RESULTS: Akaike's Information Criterion was minimized when mean temperature was used for all non-external deaths and deaths from 75 to 84 years; when minimum temperature was used for deaths from 0 to 64 years, 65 - 74 years, ≥ 85 years, and from the respiratory diseases; when maximum temperature was used for deaths from cardiovascular diseases. The effect estimates using certain <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> were similar as mean temperature both for current day and lag effects. CONCLUSION: Different age groups and death categories were sensitive to different <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators.</b> However, the effect estimates from certain <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> did not significantly differ from those of mean temperature...|$|R

Also, {{it is possible to}} use the carbon foam to heat the engine oil during startup to reduce emissions and possibly engine wear. The mesophase pitch derived carbon foam, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is a material that offers excellent thermal management capability. The foam has an open cell structure (0. 98 fraction open porosity) with graphitic ligaments aligned parallel to the cell walls. The alignment of the graphitic ligaments in a three dimensional array gives the foam homogeneous thermal properties, unlike graphite fibers. The bulk thermal conductivity of the foam has been measured to be 175 W/m{center_dot}K, placing it on the level of 6061 aluminum, which has a bulk thermal conductivity of 180 W/m{center_dot}K. Copper has a bulk thermal conductivity over two times higher, at 400 W/m{center_dot}K. The proposed research will entail using the carbon foam, with its excellent thermal management capabilities, as a cooling and heating medium for engine oil, or in other words an <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> regulator. The foam will aid in maintaining a specific <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> during steady state operation and in heating of the engine oil at startup.
