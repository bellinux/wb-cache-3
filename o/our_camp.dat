25|$|Late one {{afternoon}} when returning from town we {{were met by}} a few {{women and children who}} told us that Mexican troops from some other town had attacked <b>our</b> <b>camp,</b> killed all the warriors of the guard, captured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, and killed many of our women and children. Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves as best we could until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous— a thicket by the river. Silently we stole in one by one, sentinels were placed, and when all were counted, I found that my aged mother, my young wife, and my three small children were among the slain.|$|E
500|$|Washington, {{frustrated}} at {{not being able}} to confront Howe in a more decisive action, wrote in his report to Henry Laurens, president of Congress, [...] "I sincerely wish, that they had made an Attack; the Issue in all probability, from the disposition of our Troops and the strong situation of <b>our</b> <b>Camp,</b> would have been fortunate and happy. At the same time I must add that reason, prudence, and every principle of policy, forbade us quitting our post to attack them. Nothing but Success would have justified the measure, and this could not be expected from their position." ...|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Davis {{recounted the}} {{circumstances}} of her husband's capture as described below: [...] "Just before day the enemy charged <b>our</b> <b>camp</b> yelling like demons... I pleaded with him to let me throw over him a large waterproof wrap which had often served him in sickness during the summer season for a dressing gown and which I hoped might so cover his person that in the grey of the morning {{he would not be}} recognized. As he strode off I threw over his head a little black shawl which was around my own shoulders, saying that he could not find his hat and after he started sent my colored woman after him with a bucket for water hoping that he would pass unobserved." ...|$|E

Evening drew on; stars peeped through maple-boughs, Which o'erhung, like a cloud, <b>our</b> <b>camping</b> fire.

6000|$|... "Looks {{as if it}} was you he wanted," [...] one replied. [...] "Well, I {{guess we}} have no use for being left without a boss, and since we don't like <b>our</b> <b>camping</b> ground, you have got to come with us. We'll draw cuts for who's to watch." ...|$|R

2500|$|PLAN combatants at Cassinga {{were aware}} of the overflights, and in a letter dated 10 April 1978, the camp's {{commander}} Hamaambo expressed concerns to his superiors about an [...] "imminent invasion intention of our enemy of <b>our</b> <b>camp</b> in Southern Angola". [...] In response to the reconnaissance flights, defenses were improved through the creation of a secondary camp north of the main camp, the addition of more trenches and the digging of holes for the protection of food provisions.|$|E
2500|$|As soon as {{the troops}} had all concentrated, with General Washington at their head, we left Williamsburg and {{proceeded}} on our route for Yorktown, where the British troops had fortified themselves, {{under the command of}} Lord Cornwallis. The whole army arrived in the evening and took possession of the ground around the town, driving in their outpost, which we affected without much loss or inconvenience on our part; accomplished the end we had in view, that was to form <b>our</b> <b>camp</b> so as to encircle the whole outworks.” ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{helped me}} along by asking questions. Then I {{began to tell}} him how the negroes had flocked into <b>our</b> <b>camps,</b> and how simply and plainly the General had talked to them, advising them against {{violence}} of any kind, and explaining to them that [...] "Freedom" [...] meant only the liberty to earn their own living in their own way, and not freedom from work.|$|R

2500|$|Dian Wei {{was known}} for being a loyal, prudent and {{responsible}} man. He often stood guard outside Cao Cao's tent from morning until dusk, and even at night he would sleep beside Cao's tent, and he rarely returned to his own quarters. He was also a heavy eater and drinker, eating in huge mouthfuls and drinking in long gulps. Because of his enormous appetite, several men were required to serve him whenever he sat down for meals. Cao Cao was very impressed with him. Dian Wei's weapons of choice were dual jis or long swords. There was a saying in Cao Cao's army about Dian Wei: [...] "There is a certain warrior Dian in <b>our</b> <b>camp</b> who wields a pair of jis weighing 80 jin in total." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 7 September, Walsh was {{permitted}} by the Japanese {{to fly to}} {{the headquarters of the}} 9th Division on Labuan island, to collect surgical and medical supplies for the camp. He returned with two Australian medical officers, Major A. W. M. Hutson and Lt.-Col. N. H. Morgan. Pepler recorded how [...] "Dr Yamamoto came in for one hell of a time from these two Medical Officers when they saw the state of the majority of <b>our</b> <b>camp.</b> Up-to-date medical care and drugs soon began to show effect upon our sick and many lives were saved by these two officers. Out of the two thousand of us who entered that camp, only seven hundred and fifty survived and of these well over six hundred were chronic sick".|$|E
2500|$|On August 5, 1926, while {{traveling}} in the Humboldt Mountains of Tibet's Kokonor region, Russian explorer Nicholas Roerich reported, members of his expedition saw [...] "something big and shiny reflecting the sun, like a huge oval moving at great speed. Crossing <b>our</b> <b>camp</b> the thing changed in its direction from south to southwest. And we saw how it disappeared in the intense blue sky. We even had time to take our field glasses and saw quite distinctly an oval form with shiny surface, one side of which was brilliant from the sun." [...] Another description by Roerich was of a [...] "shiny body flying from north to south. Field glasses are at hand. It is a huge body. One side glows in the sun. It is oval in shape. Then it somehow turns in another direction and disappears in the southwest." ...|$|E

It {{is a terrible thing}} which filled the hearts of our {{soldiers}} with terror, for it flew over <b>our</b> <b>camps</b> at night and dropped bombs upon us. It is well that you captured this white man, Numabo, for with his great bird he would have flown over your village tonight and killed all your people. These Englishman are very wicked white men." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} days, {{communal}} meetings {{were limited to}} practical matters, but in the 1920s and 1930s, they became more informal. Instead of meeting in the dining room, the group would sit around a campfire. Rather than reading minutes, the session would begin with a group dance. Remembering her youth on a kibbutz {{on the shores of}} the Kinneret, one woman said: [...] "Oh, how beautiful it was when we all took part in the discussions, [...] nights of searching for one another—that is what I call those hallowed nights. During the moments of silence, {{it seemed to me that}} from each heart a spark would burst forth, and the sparks would unite in one great flame penetrating the heavens.... At the center of <b>our</b> <b>camp</b> a fire burns, and under the weight of the hora the earth groans a rhythmic groan, accompanied by wild songs".|$|E
2500|$|The {{mortality}} rate amongst the British soldiers was extremely high: ⅔ {{of the population}} of POWs died in the camp. It was suggested that this high rate was because most had come direct from Europe and were not acclimatised and had no idea about the importance of tropical hygiene. Tropical ulcers—which are often diphtheria appearing as a secondary infection of a skin disease—were a common medical complaint, along with dysentery, malaria, beri-beri, dengue, scabies, and septic bites and sores. 600 men out of 1000 were unfit for work in January 1943 owing to beri beri and skin conditions. Deaths from dysentery increased {{towards the end of the}} period of captivity. A British NCO, E. R. Pepler, commented that [...] "en wasted away from their normal weight of over ten stone [...] to three or four stones ... As the time passed on to 1945, the deaths in <b>our</b> <b>camp</b> [...] were taking place at two or three every day".|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Roaring Reggie" [...] {{came from}} the way he would shout at the Japanese guards. This {{subjected}} him to many beatings. Standing up for his men was his main focus. He would do whatever was necessary to protect them and keep them alive. He found that feigning displays of respect for Warrant Officer Aitaro [...] "Tiger" [...] Hiramatusu, the Japanese camp commander, brought more benefits than acts of defiance. [...] But it was a fine line to walk. In an interview with Pattie Wright for her book [...] "The Men of the Line," [...] Len, a 2/19th member recalled how Captain Newton got on the [...] "Tiger's" [...] better side. [...] "The 'Tiger' was a bad one but Reggie got around him. [...] We saw comfort women come into <b>our</b> <b>camp.</b> [...] They were in the last carriage of one of the trains going through. [...] In fact [...] "The Tiger" [...] asked Reggie if he wanted women to come into the camp. [...] I wasn't around for this exchange, but I heard Reggie said he'd prefer a few more bags of rice instead of women." ...|$|E

2500|$|Grand Duke George {{wrote to}} his wife in England, “We were each given a cell, and later on were joined by Dmitry. I saw him {{arriving}} through the iron bars of my window, and was struck by his sad expression. The first twenty-four hours were hard, but after that, they luckily allowed us to have <b>our</b> <b>camp</b> beds and also our clothes. There is {{no one in the}} prison but we three”. He informed that they were guarded, by soldiers from the Baltic provinces. [...] “They treat us like comrades, and have not locked our cells after the second day, while they allow us to walk in the small garden in the courtyard. Our food is brought from outside. ” [...] While imprisoned, rumors of the tsar's assassination reached them; this seemed to indicate the worst and Grand Duke George was, of the three Grand Dukes, the more pessimistic. On 21 July, all of the exiled Grand Dukes in Vologda were again transferred back to Petrograd. In the former Imperial capital, the men were quickly imprisoned with six other detainees in a cell at Cheka Headquarters.|$|E
2500|$|The 33rd Alabama dug in on {{the west}} end of Missionary Ridge on November 22, behind a {{vineyard}} at its base. Rifle pits were built, and guards rotated there every 24hours; those not on guard duty set to work clearing all the vegetation from the west slope of the ridge, chopping the trees so that the tops fell toward Chattanooga, creating a natural barrier of tangled tree limbs. Matthews reports that the removal of these trees allowed the cold autumn breezes to chill the troops on the ridge, since the Southerners had nothing but small tents to break the wind. He reports gazing in wonder at the valley below him, where the campfires of thousands of Federal soldiers [...] " [...] picturesquely at night." [...] A large siege gun was hauled up Lookout Mountain to shell the Union camps and Chattanooga; Matthews recalled that [...] "...at the flash of the gun at night, some soldiers attracted out attention by yelling and watching the long flight and bursting of the shells, [...] were especially attractive to us while standing, squatting or sitting around <b>our</b> <b>camp</b> fires." [...] He says that rations, which had heretofore been plentiful, were [...] "short" [...] during this time.|$|E
2500|$|The maquis {{bands that}} emerged in the {{countryside}} soon formed a sub-culture with its own slang, way of dressing and rules. The most important maquis rule was the so-called [...] "24 hour rule", under which a captured maquisard had to hold out under torture for 24 hours before giving up information to his captors in order to give time for his comrades to escape. An underground pamphlet written for young men considering joining the maquis advised: [...] "Men who come to the Maquis to fight live badly, in precarious fashion, with food hard to find. They will be absolutely cut off from their families for the duration; the enemy does not apply the rules of war to them; they cannot be assured any pay; every effort will be made to help their families, but it is impossible to give any guarantee in this manner; all correspondence is forbidden.Bring two shirts, two pairs of underpants, two pairs of woollen socks; a light sweater, a scarf, a heavy sweater, a woollen blanket, an extra a pair of shoes, shoelaces, needles, thread, buttons, safety pins, soap, a canteen, a knife and fork, a torch, a compass, a weapon if possible, and also a sleeping bag if possible. Wear a warm suit, a beret, a raincoat, a good pair of hobnailed boots". Another pamphlet written for the maquis advised: [...] "A maquisard should stay only where he can see without being seen. He should never live, eat, sleep except surrounded by look-outs. It should never be possible to take him by surprise.A maquisard should be mobile. When a census or enlistment [...] brings new elements he has no means of knowing into his group, he should get out. When one of the members deserts, he should get out immediately. The man could be a traitor.Réfractaires, it is not your duty to die uselessly". One maquisard recalled his first night out in the wildness: [...] "Darkness falls in the forest. On one path, some distance from the <b>our</b> <b>camp,</b> two boys stand guard over the safety of their comrades. One has a pistol, the other a service rifle, with a few spare cartridges in a box. Their watch lasts for two hours. How amazing those hours on duty in the forest at night are! Noises come from everywhere and the pale light of the moon gives everything a queer aspect. The boy looks at a small tree and think he see it move. A lorry passes on a distant road; could it be the Germans? [...] [...] [...] Are they going to stop?" [...] Oubsy stated that the [...] "breathless prose" [...] in which this maqusiard remembered his first night out in the forest was very typical of the maqusiards whose main traits were their innocence and naivety as many seemed not to understand just precisely who they were taking on or what they were getting themselves into by fleeing to the countryside.|$|E

60|$|As {{the orders}} of the Amawombe were {{to keep out of}} the fray if that were possible, we had taken up a {{position}} about a mile to the right of what proved to be the actual battlefield, choosing as <b>our</b> <b>camping</b> ground a rising knoll that looked like a huge tumulus, and was fronted at a distance of about five hundred yards by another smaller knoll. Behind us stretched bushland, or rather broken land, where mimosa thorns grew in scattered groups, sloping down to the banks of the Tugela about four miles away.|$|R
60|$|No {{change of}} any {{importance}} {{had taken place}} at Gibraltar, during {{the absence of the}} Brilliant; except that the governor had determined to retaliate for the nightly annoyance of the gunboats and, accordingly, six guns were fixed at a very considerable elevation behind the Old Mole, and shells fired from them. These reached the enemy's camp; and caused, as could be seen from the heights, great alarm and confusion. It was determined that in future, when the enemy's gunboats bombarded <b>our</b> <b>camps</b> and huts, we should retaliate by throwing shells into their camp.|$|R
60|$|Near <b>our</b> <b>camp</b> (of {{which the}} {{elevation}} was 13,500 feet), radishes, barley, wheat, potatos, and turnips, were cultivated as summer crops, and we even saw {{some on the}} top of the terrace, 400 feet above <b>our</b> <b>camp,</b> or nearly 14,000 feet above the sea; these were grown in small fields cleared of stones, and protected by dykes.|$|E

"I have often," [...] says Captain Bonneville, [...] "seen trees {{measuring}} eighteen {{inches in}} diameter, at {{the places where}} they had been cut through by the beaver, but they lay in all directions, and often very inconveniently for the after purposes of the animal. In fact, so little ingenuity do they at times display in this particular, that at one of <b>our</b> <b>camps</b> on Snake River, a beaver was found with his head wedged into the cut which he had made, the tree having fallen upon him and held him prisoner until he died." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] replied Flett. [...] "They {{certainly}} need it. Last winter we struck one {{crowd in}} a lonely shack up north--man, woman, and several children huddled on the floor, {{with nothing to}} eat, and the stove out--at forty degrees below. There was a bluff a few miles off, but they hadn't a tool of any kind to cut cordwood with.
