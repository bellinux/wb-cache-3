5|$|Cocker Spaniels and <b>other</b> <b>dogs</b> {{that have}} long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Scottish Terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around <b>other</b> <b>dogs</b> unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally bred to hunt and fight badgers. Therefore, the Scottie is prone to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, rats, and mice.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Springer is {{generally}} a healthy breed, but some can suffer conditions common to many breeds such as hip dysplasia, Canine glaucoma and like <b>other</b> <b>dogs</b> with pendulous ears, they {{are prone to}} ear infections such as otitis externa. In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E

Overt aggression towards another dog is not accepted and is a criterion for disqualification in the show ring.|$|E
5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark {{in alarm}} or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with <b>other</b> <b>dogs.</b>|$|E

5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with <b>other</b> <b>dogs</b> to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel {{can be a}} {{good family}} dog while it has a job to do. They are {{suitable}} for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like to stay close to their family. When socialised, they are good with <b>other</b> <b>dogs.</b> They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E

5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their <b>other</b> <b>dogs.</b> At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E
5|$|Sheik Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa, King of Bahrain {{during the}} 1930s, {{was known for}} a pack of Salukis that {{accompanied}} him throughout the Arab world on hunting trips. Following his death, his son Salman ibn Hamad Al Khalifa attempted to keep the lines pure-bred but they became interbred with other breeds. However, the pure-bred lines of the royal kennel were saved by the efforts of Dana Al Khalifa who was given two pure-bred puppies by the King, and about a decade later had pure-bred Salukis registered with the Kennel Club of Bahrain. Today, the breed is still held in high regard throughout the Middle East and were hunting dogs for nobles and rulers around the region. They are considered clean by the Bedouins, and are allowed to be in women's quarters, while <b>other</b> <b>dogs</b> must be kept outside.|$|E

40|$|Dogs’ {{lives are}} shaped by their owners’ lives, they go where the owners {{want to go and}} they live where the owners want to live. The day to day {{interactions}} between owner and dog, such as during walks, can affect both their relationship and the welfare of the dog. According to Swedish legislation dogs have to be walked and exercised regularly, however, the owners are also demanded to keep their dogs under control. The most common way to control dogs during walks outside is to keep them on a leash. Dog to dog encounters during walks can be problematic. When dogs meet on leash they display more threatening signals towards each <b>other</b> than do <b>dogs</b> off leash. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate two management techniques for dog to dog encounters when walking on a leash. This was done by comparing dog behavior between two management techniques/treatments and from those results discuss whether one of the techniques might make the encounter easier to handle for the dog. One treatment was called “secure” (S), where the <b>dogs</b> encountered the <b>other</b> <b>dog</b> with a person characterized as secure, were walked in a curve away from, and placed on the opposite side of the person as the <b>other</b> <b>dog.</b> The <b>other</b> treatment was called “unpredictable/disorganized” (O/D), where the <b>dogs</b> encountered the <b>other</b> <b>dog</b> with a person characterized as unpredictable and disorganized, and were walked straight towards and on the same side of the person as the <b>other</b> <b>dog.</b> This study found two significant differences in behavior between the treatments. The dogs wagged their tail more before and during the encounter in treatment O/D. In treatment S, they held their head higher at the very end of the behavior registrations, after the encounter. In addition to these differences a few tendencies were found. Before and during the meeting in treatment O/D, dogs pulled more in direction towards the <b>other</b> <b>dog,</b> while dogs in treatment S pulled more in the forward direction. The last statement was true also for dogs in treatment S over the entire sampling distance. From these results it was concluded that there were differences in dogs’ behavior between the two management techniques. Dogs seemed to focus more on the <b>other</b> <b>dog</b> in treatment O/D. For dogs that have problems dealing with dog to dog encounters it is probably easier to train these encounters if the person walking the dog is secure, walks in a curve and places the dog on the opposite side of themselves as the <b>other</b> <b>dog.</b> This might be helpful because the dog does not focus as much on the challenging encounter, which might lower stress levels and thus make the dog more susceptible to training...|$|R

When Lad was fifteen, he lost his hearing, after which the <b>other</b> <b>dogs</b> in residence began ignoring him and vice versa. Lad died on September 3, 1918, having had a tumor in his heart for five years before his death. Lad's obituary was carried on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine. He was buried near the driveway of Sunnybank, with the Honorary Crosses he was awarded. He was mourned by thousands of fans who had read Terhune's stories, with dozens of readers, primarily children, visiting Sunnybank to see Lad's grave. In one season, over 1,700 visitors came to see Lad's grave, prompting Terhune to close the place to visitors for the day.|$|E
