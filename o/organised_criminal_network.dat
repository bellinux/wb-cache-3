40|$|Certain {{crimes are}} hardly {{committed}} by individuals but carefully organised by group of associates and affiliates loosely connected {{to each other}} with a single or small group of individuals coordinating the overall actions. A common starting point in understanding the structural organisation of criminal groups is to identify the criminals and their associates. Situations arise in many criminal datasets where there is no direct connection among the criminals. In this paper, we investigate ties and community structure in crime data {{in order to understand the}} operations of both traditional and cyber criminals, as well as to predict the existence of <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks.</b> Our contributions are twofold: we propose a bipartite network model for inferring hidden ties between actors who initiated an illegal interaction and objects affected by the interaction, we then validate the method in two case studies on pharmaceutical crime and underground forum data using standard network algorithms for structural and community analysis. The vertex level metrics and community analysis results obtained indicate the significance of our work in understanding the operations and structure of <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> which were not immediately obvious in the data. Identifying these groups and mapping their relationship to one another is essential in making more effective disruption strategies in the future. Comment: 8 page...|$|R

40|$|The {{irregular}} migrant {{and refugee}} crisis poses serious challenges for Europe. The unprecedented migration pressure presents {{an opportunity for}} the generation of substantial profits by <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks.</b> The large influx of irregular migrants looking for facilitation has {{led to the development of}} human smuggling as a substantial criminal market in Europe. On the other hand, some countries have experienced a concurrent rise in human trafficking cases. The current publication presents an analysis of recent developments in transnational organised crime in Norway and Bulgaria in the context of the migrant crisis. The study presents the first in-depth examination of human smuggling networks and operations in Bulgaria, as well as the synergies and differences between this illicit activity and other <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> enterprises, particularly human trafficking. The publication also reviews trends in Norway related to both human trafficking and smuggling, two crimes which have rarely been examined together, with the latter being the focus of little overall research...|$|R

40|$|Transnational {{environmental}} crime must become a government priority, as <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> continue {{to exploit the}} environment with unprecedented profits. Such earnings come at a substantial social, economic and environmental expense for communities and their livelihoods. Indeed, organised {{environmental crime}} is identified by the United Nations as {{a key factor in}} the impoverishment, displacement and violent conflicts affecting millions of people — notably in developing societies. 2 It is widely recognised that organised environmental crime syndicates, motivated by substantial financial rewards, continue to flourish and expand in disadvantaged societies with porous borders, where corruption is widespread and regulation is poor. The theft of biodiversity and the demise of animal species and habitats have resulted not only in financial loss, but also in an increase in “environmental refugees” — people dislocated and forced to migrate due to loss of livelihoods...|$|R
40|$|Several West African {{states are}} {{threatened}} by increasingly powerful transnational <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks.</b> Yet, scholarly work on the nature, characteristics and strength of these groups and how their activities threaten states remains sparse, leading to misunderstandings and inadequate appreciation of the precise nature of the threats they pose to West Africa. This paper seeks to fill these lacunae in our knowledge. It focuses on the nexus between drugs, crime and terrorism. It argues that, the financial spin-offs from criminal activities {{contribute to the development}} of opportunistic relationships between criminals and extremist groups that threatens West Africa’s fragile states. The analyses are based on evidence from several West African states, but employ the ongoing crisis in the Sahel, particularly Mali, as an empirical case, to demonstrate how ‘profitable collusion’ among different actors permits hollow states to become edifices that allows corruption, criminality and impunity to flourish...|$|R

Before she joined there were widespread concerns about rampant corruption {{and the power of}} <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks.</b> The transition from communism to capitalism and democracy has proved problematic with many examples of corrupt behaviour both in the privatisation process and in other areas of economic life and society. Bulgaria has received a massive amount of financial aid, yet in some ways she was ill-prepared for membership and the management of such large sums of money. There have been delays in the establishment of the AFCOS (Anti-Fraud Coordinating Service 3) structure that all candidate states have to have in place before accession and the position of AFCOS has been affected by in-fighting over is position in the bureaucracy. Serious reservations were expressed by the European Commission in 2008 regarding the management of EU funds and the level of fraud and corruption. Yet there are examples of good co-operation between AFCOS and OLAF and Bulgaria is trying to put her house in some kind of order. Whether she will be successful, remains to be seen...|$|R
40|$|Today {{more people}} are {{deprived}} of their freedom through enslavement {{than at any other}} time in human history. Human trafficking is a significant contributor to this statistic. 27 million people are thought to currently be victims of human trafficking. The two main purposes for human trafficking are sexual exploitation and forced labour. Sexual exploitation accounts for 79 % of detected instances of trafficking, while forced labour makes up 18 %. Human trafficking makes an estimated $ 150. 2 billion USD for <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> each year. This highly profitable enterprise holds little risk for its participants. Conviction rates remain low with less than 0. 5 % of all victims able to participate in any kind of judicial process. Human trafficking is a global problem. Almost every country is connected to the practice either as a place of origin, transit or destination. Despite the scale of the problem, human trafficking was not prioritised by the global community for many years. However, increased reporting in the 1990 s saw attentions shift and the profile of human trafficking rose significantly. Human trafficking became a hot-button issue for both governments and civil society. Laws were promulgated, institutions developed and organisations formed. A global solution to the global problem was sought. There stands today a wide range of actors engaged in the task of ending the practice of human trafficking...|$|R
40|$|Vietnam is a {{significant}} consumer of wildlife, particularly wild meat, in urban restaurant settings. To meet this demand, poaching of wildlife is widespread, threatening regional and international biodiversity. Previous interventions to tackle illegal and potentially unsustainable consumption of wild meat in Vietnam have generally focused on limiting supply. While critical, they have been impeded {{by a lack of}} resources, the presence of increasingly <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> and corruption. Attention is, therefore, turning to the consumer, but a paucity of research investigating consumer demand for wild meat will impede the creation of effective consumer-centred interventions. Here we used a mixed-methods research approach comprising a hypothetical choice modelling survey and qualitative interviews to explore the drivers of wild meat consumption and consumer preferences among residents of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Our findings indicate that demand for wild meat is heterogeneous and highly context specific. Wild-sourced, rare, and expensive wild meat-types are eaten by those situated towards the top of the societal hierarchy to convey wealth and status and are commonly consumed in lucrative business contexts. Cheaper, legal and farmed substitutes for wild-sourced meats are also consumed, but typically in more casual consumption or social drinking settings. We explore the implications of our results for current conservation interventions in Vietnam that attempt to tackle illegal and potentially unsustainable trade in and consumption of wild meat and detail how our research informs future consumer-centric conservation actions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Plant and {{equipment}} theft (PET) is inherent throughout the construction sector. Its effect places direct financial burden {{on those who}} have invested in such assets, but additionally, induces “indirect” costs for many other stakeholders including project owners, plant hirers and construction managers. The paper's objective is to take and discuss a snapshot of PET, the overriding aim being to aid greater understanding of it and in particular, the application of (post-theft) recovery technologies. Design/methodology/approach – Descriptive case study data are considered along with informal, anecdotal evidence provided by practitioners. These data are qualitatively considered; observations are discussed; a model representation of PET and recovery is developed; and conclusions are drawn. Findings – Plant {{and equipment}} thieves are shown to be audacious and determined, but it is identified that in addressing these characteristics, recent advances in plant security and recovery technologies (PSRT) have been significant. Arguably, PSRT are not being adopted as broadly {{as they should be}} to offset the PET problem. Research limitations/implications – The formal model of PET might help inform future academic endeavour in the subject of plant and equipment management generally and PET specifically. Practical implications – The model suggests that more widespread use of PSRT may not only help defeat plant thieves, but additionally help recover stolen assets and identify <b>organised</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks.</b> Originality/value – The work is novel in setting and will be of interest to both academics and practitioners in the field...|$|R

In the end disruption strategies force <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> to become more exposed, which causes successful network disruption to become a long-term effort...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study the {{structure}} of <b>criminal</b> <b>networks,</b> groups of related malicious infrastructures that work in concert to provide hosting for criminal activities. We develop a method to construct a graph of relationships between malicious hosts and identify the underlying <b>criminal</b> <b>networks,</b> using historic assignments in the DNS. We also develop methods to analyze these networks to identify general structural trends and devise strategies for effective remediation through takedowns. We then apply these graph construction and analysis algorithms to study the general threat landscape, as well as four cases of sophisticated <b>criminal</b> <b>networks.</b> Our results indicate that in many cases, <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> can be taken down by de-registering as few as five domain names, removing critical communication links. In cases of sophisticated <b>criminal</b> <b>networks,</b> we show that our analysis techniques can identify hosts that are critical to the network’s functionality and estimate the impact of performing network takedowns in remediating the threats. In one case, disabling 20 % of a <b>criminal</b> <b>network’s</b> hosts would reduce the overall volume of successful DNS lookups to the <b>criminal</b> <b>network</b> {{by as much as}} 70 %. This measure can be interpreted as an estimate of the {{decrease in the number of}} potential victims reaching the <b>criminal</b> <b>network</b> that would be caused by such a takedown strategy. ...|$|R
