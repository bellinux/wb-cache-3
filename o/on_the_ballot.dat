5|$|Preckwinkle was re-elected as 4th Ward Democratic committeeman on March 19, 1996, running unopposed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> {{after her}} {{successful}} {{challenges to the}} nominating petitions of Charles S.

5|$|Early in {{the recall}} process, Republican George Rivera {{announced}} his candidacy for Giron's senate seat. Rivera {{was planning to}} run against Giron in the 2014 elections but stated he would put his name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> during the recall process. Rivera had to turn in a petition with 1,000 signatures {{in order to qualify}} to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> and turned in 1,500 signatures on July 26.

5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which {{all members of}} the legislature (but not the governor) were up for election, the shutdown was a major campaign issue. The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature, giving the DFL full control of the state government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably was one reason for their electoral defeat. However, other national and state issues may have had more of an influence on the result. The presidential race was also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot,</b> as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment, which had been put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E
