5|$|After {{a pair of}} Tiger {{possessions}} {{that ended}} with punts and an Alabama possession that ended with a lost fumble by McCarron, the Crimson Tide started their fourth scoring drive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> The drive began with a 22-yard McCarron pass to Christion Jones and finished with a 15-yard Yeldon touchdown run. Immediately after Yeldon scored, the referees stopped the game temporarily and cleared the field due to lightning strikes {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the stadium. After a 40-minute stoppage, the game resumed with a Jeremy Shelley extra point and a Crimson Tide lead of 28–0. Missouri responded on the kickoff that ensued with their only touchdown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> on a 98-yard Marcus Murphy return that made the halftime score 28–7.|$|E
5|$|After the Crimson Tide defense {{held the}} Aggies to a punt, McCarron threw his second {{touchdown}} pass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{on the drive}} that ensued {{early in the second}} quarter on a 44-yard flea flicker pass to DeAndrew White that tied the game 14–14. On the next drive, Cyrus Jones intercepted a Manziel pass in the end zone for a touchback and an Alabama possession. McCarron then threw his third touchdown pass on the game from 51yards to Kenny Bell and gave the Crimson Tide their first lead of the game, 21–14. Alabama then closed the first half with an 11-play, 93-yard drive capped with a four-yard T. J. Yeldon touchdown run for a 28–14 halftime lead.|$|E

5|$|By the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> nearly 300armed men had {{converged on}} the lawn of the State Capitol. Brooks' men seized the state arsenal and began turning the Statehouse into an armed camp. Telegrams covered in {{signatures}} were sent to President Ulysses S. Grant supporting Brooks as the legal governor. Three out of the five Supreme Court justices also telegraphed the President in support of Brooks. Brooks telegraphed the President himself asking for access to weapons housed at the federal arsenal. He also issued {{a statement to the}} press proclaiming himself governor. The senators from the state, Clayton and Steven Dorsey, met with President Grant, and they sent a message to Brooks giving their support.|$|E
5|$|During the protest, {{the crowd}} {{assaulted}} a JNA armoured personnel carrier {{and managed to}} remove a machine gun mounted on the vehicle, while one of the protesters, Ivica Balić, hoisted a Croatian flag at the building to singing of the Croatian anthem by the crowd.

5|$|In the 2012 {{edition of}} the Iron Bowl, Alabama shut out the Auburn Tigers 49–0 at Tuscaloosa. The Crimson Tide opened {{the game with a}} 10-play, 75-yard drive that culminated in a two-yard Eddie Lacy {{touchdown}} run and a 7–0 lead. After the Alabama defense held Auburn to a three-and-out on their first possession, their offense responded with their second touchdown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> on a two-yard T. J. Yeldon touchdown run for a 14–0 lead. The Crimson Tide then forced a Tigers' punt on their second possession, and then scored their third touchdown in as many possessions when AJ McCarron threw a 37-yard pass to Amari Cooper for a 21–0 lead early in the second quarter.|$|E

5|$|Only {{two days}} later, on Sunday 18 June, the Duke of Wellington {{positioned}} his Anglo-allied army along a ridge {{near the village}} of Waterloo, in order to block Napoleon's advance along the road to Brussels. The Brunswick Corps formed part of Wellington's reserve corps, under his personal command. In that capacity, they were kept well behind the crest of the ridge and avoided casualties during the opening French bombardment. In the early part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the British Foot Guards moved down the slope to reinforce the Château d'Hougoumont, which was under fierce French attack; the Brunswick Corps was brought forward to take their place.|$|E
5|$|Storms began causing damage {{early in}} the morning on July 10, 1989. A tornado briefly touched down in Ogdensburg, New York at 5AM, {{injuring}} one person. Hail up to 1 in (25mm) wide, wind gusts over 50mph (60km/h), and many reports of wind damage were reported in New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts before noon. Severe weather is an unusual occurrence in the morning, and the activity only increased in severity towards the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tornado watches {{were also}} issued for the Lower Great Lakes in the {{afternoon}} hours, and supercells began to track across southern Michigan in the early evening. Two tornadoes touched down in Michigan and caused damage to farm structures. Further east, severe thunderstorms caused scattered wind damage and large hail across Pennsylvania and New York. Two-inch-diameter hail was reported in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. An isolated supercell moved across Central New York throughout much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> producing golf ball-sized hail in Syracuse, and spawned a very brief EF1 tornado in Verona Mills, causing primarily tree damage. Another tornado in Gilbertsville caused significant damage to an athletic field at a school.|$|E

5|$|After holding Arkansas {{scoreless}} {{on their}} first possession of the third quarter, Alabama's Marquis Maze returned a Dylan Breeding punt 83-yards for a touchdown and a 24–7 Crimson Tide lead. On Alabama's next possession, Trent Richardson caught a screen pass from McCarron and ran it 61-yards for a touchdown and extended the Alabama lead to 31–7. The Razorbacks scored on the following possession when Wilson threw his second touchdown pass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> after he connected on a 19-yard pass to Cobi Hamilton. Eddie Lacy then scored the final points of the game late in the third on a four-yard touchdown run to give the Crimson Tide the 38–14 victory. The Alabama defense only allowed 17 rushing and 226 of total offense to the Razorbacks in the victory. For his 235 all-purpose yards and touchdown reception, Trent Richardson was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Razorbacks to 12–8 (15–7 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|At Minqar Qaim, the {{division}} was {{to hold and}} delay the advance of the Panzer Army Africa {{for as long as}} it could while remaining intact. By the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of 27 June, {{the division}} had been encircled by the 21st Panzer Division. Panzer units approached a number of the 2nd New Zealand Division's positions, including the 20th Battalion's sector on the northern side of the Minqar Qaim escarpment, and were successfully beaten off. The New Zealanders broke out that evening with the 4th Brigade breaching the German lines and the 20th Battalion on the northern flank of the chosen withdrawal route. During the action at Minqar Qaim and the subsequent breakout, the battalion's casualties were light, with thirteen men killed and it reached the El Alamein line by 28 June.|$|E

5|$|De Launay {{had limited}} options: if he allowed the Revolutionaries to destroy his main gate, {{he would have}} to turn the cannon {{directly}} inside the Bastille's courtyard on the crowds, causing great loss of life and preventing any peaceful resolution of the episode. De Launay could not withstand a long siege, and he was dissuaded by his officers from committing mass suicide by detonating his supplies of powder. Instead, de Launay attempted to negotiate a surrender, threatening to blow up the Bastille if his demands were not met. In the midst of this attempt, the Bastille's drawbridge suddenly came down and the revolutionary crowd stormed in. De Launay was dragged outside into the streets and killed by the crowd, and three officers and three soldiers were killed during the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> by the crowd. The soldiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment, however, were not wearing their uniform coats and were mistaken for Bastille prisoners; they were left unharmed by the crowds until they were escorted away by French Guards and other regular soldiers among the attackers. The valuable powder and guns were seized and a search begun for the other prisoners in the Bastille.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{an injury}} to pace {{spearhead}} Ray Lindwall, Bradman's fast bowlers reduced England in their first innings to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165. Bradman dropped two catches in this innings. English gloveman Godfrey Evans came to the crease with the score at 6/60, and hit Johnston hard to cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second chance went through Bradman's hand and struck him in the abdomen. However, these missed catches did not cost Australia much, as Evans was soon caught at short leg by Morris close in, leaving England at 7/74. England managed to recover somewhat after Laker and Bedser added 89 runs in only 73 minutes for the ninth wicket. At first, Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership, and it was surmised {{that he may have}} been happy for England to continue batting so that his top order would not have to bat in fading light towards the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable.|$|E
5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can take the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over {{on the side of the}} road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license plate number and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to shake his pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1952, General Tire {{purchased}} the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations {{and the rights}} to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post). Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of Mutual. That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined. Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.|$|E
5|$|Franchitti led {{the field}} to the restart on lap eight, ahead of Tagliani, Hunter-Reay (up from fourth), Kanaan (up from sixth), and Matos, who {{advanced}} seven positions while avoiding the mêlée at turn one. Franchitti became only the third driver in series history to lead the final lap of one season and the first lap of the next, having won the championship by winning the 2009 Firestone Indy 300 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. The top five remained the same until lap 15 when Dan Wheldon passed the De Ferran Luczo Dragon Racing car of Matos for fifth place. Hunter-Reay took second place from Tagliani into the final hairpin on lap 19, before Milka Duno brought out the second caution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> on lap 22 by nudging her Dale Coyne Racing car into the wall at turn four. The entire field except for Simona de Silvestro headed to pit road {{for the first of}} two scheduled pit stops. De Silvestro became the first rookie driver since Graham Rahal in 2008 to lead at least one lap on début.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{batted in}} a {{restrained}} manner, while Bradman attacked. The Australian captain was 31 and his deputy 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 1/63. Bradman did {{the majority of}} the scoring during the closing stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> adding 31 in a partnership of 50. On the third morning, play resumed in hot and humid conditions. In the second over delivered by Dick Pollard, the bowler made the second ball lift unexpectedly. Hassett was unable {{to get out of the}} way and edged the ball to Jack Crapp for 13. Bradman was out in the same over and Australia were in trouble at 3/68, but they recovered after a middle-order counterattack took them to 458 early on the fourth day. Hassett then caught Bedser during England's second innings.|$|E
