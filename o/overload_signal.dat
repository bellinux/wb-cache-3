In this paper, the dynamic model is divided into the equivalent pitching equations and the equivalent yawing equations as the roll-channel control system of missile works ideally. Then open-loop stability of both the equivalent pitching equations and the equivalent yawing equations are analyzed respectively. After that, the variable structure control theory is employed to design both the overload direction control loop and overload magnitude control loop for a deflectable nose missile.

30|$|In this study, a joint ML {{detection}} {{scheme for}} the demodulation of <b>overloaded</b> <b>signals</b> {{has been applied}} to the heterogeneous NOMA network. The joint ML detection effectively alleviates the effect of the interference between the signals from the MBS and PBS. The numerical results obtained through system-level simulation have shown that joint ML detection in the NOMA downlink effectively offloads mobile traffic from the MBS to the PBS. As a result, user fairness improves, and the system throughput increases about twofold. The maximum system throughput is achieved when the PBS is at a distance of two thirds of the cell radius from the base station if joint ML detection is applied.|$|R

30|$|As {{one of the}} key {{technologies}} in the fifth-generation mobile communication system, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been investigated. In NOMA, multiple terminals are assigned the same frequency resources by a scheduler {{on the basis of the}} difference in propagation losses between a base station and user terminals. Each terminal cancels the signals for the other terminals and extracts its desired signal. On the other hand, the application of joint maximum likelihood (ML) detection to <b>overloaded</b> <b>signals</b> has also been investigated, and joint ML detection can be applied to a NOMA downlink. In this paper, the effect of joint ML detection in a heterogeneous NOMA network is presented. The numerical results obtained through system-level simulation show that joint ML detection in a heterogeneous NOMA downlink can effectively offload mobile traffic from a macro base station to a pico base station. It is shown that a heterogeneous NOMA network with joint ML detection improves the throughput performance by 0.2 bit/user/subcarrier as compared to that without joint ML detection at a cumulative probability of 0.5. The system throughput is also increased about twofold with joint ML detection.|$|R

40|$|In {{this project}} {{we have been}} working with two {{different}} instruments home-made AMA 254 and Hydride Generator. Home-made AMA 254 was coupled to a fluorescence detector. The Hydride Generator was coupled to atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), by an optical path. Calibration of mass-flow controller by applying a suitable gas in the inlet and a bubbles calibration unit at the outlet. All date was saved by labview program was used The first configurations, carrier gas was fed {{into the middle of the}} catalyzer tube and the gold-trap by a T-shape connector to carry mercury to the detector. Condensation of mercury vapour when the gas-stream collided to the silicon walls, at the T-shape connection leads to failing. Second configuration, two positioned-switching valve was introduced between the oxygen and argon tanks, allowing only one gas to reach MFC depending on the switching position. There are four different parameters memory effects, repeatability, accuracy and sensitivity, have to investigated to know that the machine gives reliable result when running real samples. Memory effects: Memory effect is one reason for deviation of the analysis. It is obvious that some mercury still remains within the tube after running. Memory effect is not significant at high concentration of the analyte, but could be troublesome at lower concentration. Repeatability: Repeatability was tested by running 3 replicates with the same concentration of the analyte. This is important for knowing the precision of the analysis. Accuracy: The Reference material MESS- 92 (92 ppb) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the analysis. Triplicate was running and the mean value was calculated to 98. 3 ppb, the deviation was 6. 86 %. Sensitivity: By comparing the mercury fluorescence detector and atomic absorption (AAS) it become evident that the fluorescence detector is much more suitable for analysis with AMA 254 as it gave an <b>overloaded</b> <b>signal</b> whereas the atomic absorption only appeared as noise. Minor Field Study in Chemistry – Autumn 2010 Page 4 The comparison between the mercury fluorescence detector and atomic absorption (AAS) was done with 0. 05 gram(g) tuna fish samples. Mercury fluorescence detector gave an <b>overloaded</b> <b>signal,</b> whereas the AAS signal appeared as noise. It is evident that the fluorescence detector is much more sensitive than the AAS detector. Hydride generation is one common method for determining mercury in water. Three different channels are used for pumping the solutions and forming hydride, they are Hydrochloric acid, NaBH 4 and sample (blank, standards). The hydride form of mercury was flushed and collected into the gold trap by nitrogen gas. After that the gold-trap is heated up to release mercury optical cell where the absorption as a peak was measured in the same manner as normal flame AAS without using of flame.

40|$|Digital pulse {{processing}} is {{a signal}} processing technique in which detector (preamplifier output) signals are directly digitized and processed to extract quantities of interest. This approach has several significant advantages compared to tra-ditional analog signal shaping. First, analyses {{can be developed}} which take pulse-by-pulse differences into account, as in making ballistic deficit compensations. Second, transient induced charge signals which deposit no net charge on an electrode can be analyzed to give, for example, information on the position of interaction within the detector. Third, deadtimes from transient <b>overload</b> <b>signals</b> are greatly reduced, from 10 's of ms to 100 's of ns. Fourth, signals are easily captured, so that more complex analyses can be postponed until the source event has been deemed "interesting". Fifth, signal capture and processing may easily be based on coincidence criteria between different detectors or {{different parts of the}} same detector. XIA's recently introduced CAMAC module, the DGF- 4 C, provides many of these features for four input channels, includ-ing two levels of digital processing and a FIFO for signal capture for each signal channel. The first level of digital processing is "immediate", taking place in a gate array at the 40 MHz digitization rate, and implements pulse detection, pileup inspection, trapezoidal energy filtering, and control of an external 25. 6 ms long FIFO. The second level of digital processing is provided by a digital signal processor (DSP), where more complex algorithms can be implemented. To illustrate digital pulse processing's possibilities, we describe the application of the DGF- 4 C to a series of experiments...|$|R
50|$|It is very {{important}} to avoid input <b>signal</b> <b>overload</b> when using an anti-aliasing filter. If the signal is strong enough, it can cause clipping at the analog-to-digital converter, even after filtering. When distortion due to clipping occurs after the anti-aliasing filter, it can create components outside the passband of the anti-aliasing filter; these components can then alias, causing the reproduction of other non-harmonically-related frequencies.|$|R

Such circuits compare the input {{signal to the}} output signal to detect the presence of extra power caused by distortion. The simplest circuits act like a fast limiter, which engages after about one decibel of clipping is detected. A more complex circuit, called [...] "soft-clip", was used from the 1980s onward to limit the signal at the input stage. The soft-clip feature begins to engage prior to clipping, for instance starting at 10 dB below maximum output power.

Chapter II introduces Delta Modulation, a pulse code modulation, giving an extensive review of much of the more prominent literature on the subject. Aspects such as channel capacity, power, spectral densities, <b>overloading,</b> <b>signal</b> - to - noise ratio and bandwidth, are discussed. In Chapter III an experimental Delta-Sigma Modulation System is described in detail, from design to performance. Observations are made which correspond to some made in theory. The system transmits static signals and AC signals up to 20 HZ. The accuracy is good and the circuits simple. In Chapter IV suggestions are made to improve the systemis performance by simple means. Also mentioned are more elaborate means (Continuous Delta Modulation) which enhance the performance considerably but detract from the simplicity. Much of the literature quoted in the bibliography shows and discusses how delta modulation is simple in circuitry yet has all the advantages of PCM. It is upon this theme that the prototype Delta-Sigma Modulator is designed and built. All the circuits are kept as simple as possible. With integrated circuits, delta modulation is fast becoming an economical proposition. Delta modulation, though simple to implement, requires greater bandwidth than the conventional carrier modulations and PCM (for the same performance). At times this would make Delta Modulation uneconomical. However, there is a place for Delta Modulation alongside FM and PCM for some particular applications...|$|R

Different algorithms (e. g.

For general complex–valued modulation, most known procedures are not applicable, as for a single antenna receiver the system gets <b>overloaded</b> and <b>signals</b> are not separable by e. g. linear operations. In this paper, cochannel interference mitigation with a reduced–complexity equalizer for intersymbol interference (ISI) channels in combination with an appropriate prefilter is considered [5], [6].

Shoulders, neck, arms and hands are especially affected, and thereby the computer work becomes slower and less efficient; productivity decreases up to 25 % have been noticed. In the long run prolonged pain can arise. eLearning is a new effective way of presenting ergonomic information at computer work places. The goal is to prevent computer related problems by improving motivation and understanding of how an optimal workplace should be designed and used, i. e. how an active relaxed working technique could be applied. Objectives Ergonomhuset AB in Göteborg, Sweden has developed a 40 minutes eLearning Computer Ergonomics® programme. It consists of interactive sequences, short films, and practical exercises, and provides advice for computer work preventing RSI. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of the program among computer workers. The aim was to understand if the information resulted in increased awareness of body <b>overload</b> <b>signals</b> and increased motivation for a change. Further interest was to see what changes the participants have done at their computer work places. Method The eLearning program was given to 18 people at a company in Göteborg during 5 weeks. The program contains of 8 short parts (3 - 7 minutes each) and deals with how the body works, discomfort, stress, risks, prevention and advise. The separate parts can be viewed whenever the individual wants, as many times as required. A background questionnaire was given before the programme was introduced about working situation, equipment and physical problems. Each week a questionnaire was filled regarding how many times and which parts of the programme they had seen, workplace changes made and physical problems. In the end, a final larger questionnaire and interviews were performed. Results and conclusion Most participants had seen all parts of the programme, some of them several times. The awareness of body signals related to discomfort, fatigue and pain increased for all participants. They had also changed their overall working situation. The changes made were more frequent breaks, adjustments of chairs, desks and computer equipment, as well as reorganisation of work tasks.
