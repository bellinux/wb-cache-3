50|$|An <b>outwash</b> <b>fan</b> is a fan-shaped body of sediments {{deposited}} by braided streams from {{a melting}} glacier. Sediment locked within the ice of the glacier, gets transported by the streams of meltwater, and deposits on the outwash plain, at the terminus of the glacier. The outwash, the sediment transported and deposited by the meltwater {{and that makes}} up the fan, is usually poorly sorted due to the short distance traveled before being deposited.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{estimates}} of erosion of between 2 - 4 mm per year, the deep basin was created {{over a period}} of 67,000 - 150,000 years of glacial action, which occurred intermittently during the last million years of the Quaternary glaciation. An <b>outwash</b> <b>fan</b> made up of sand and gravels at the western end of the loch marks the limit of the re-advance in the Morar valley. Subsequently colonised by vegetation and known as Mointeach Mhòr (the mossy plain), these deposits blocked the outflow of the loch to the south, so that it drained from the north-west corner instead.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the modern Delamere Forest falls within the Mouldsworth Gap, {{a break in the}} Mid Cheshire Ridge which runs north-south through the centre of Cheshire. This region originated {{at the end of the}} last ice age, when glacial meltwaters formed a vast lake in the West Cheshire basin which burst through the sandstone ridge, and deposited large amounts of sand and gravel across an extensive <b>outwash</b> <b>fan</b> on the eastern side of the ridge. The soils are very varied, including brown earths, podsols, peats and gleys. One valley adjacent to the railway line has eight different soil types within a small area, and hosts a soil trail.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a glacial geomorphological map of glacial lineations, ribbed terrain, moraines, meltwater channels (subglacial and ice-marginal/proglacial), eskers, glaciofluvial deposits, ice-contact <b>outwash</b> <b>fans</b> and deltas and abandoned shorelines {{on the bed}} of the former Laurentide Ice Sheet in northern Canada. Mapping was compiled from satellite imagery and digital elevation data and landforms were digitised directly into a Geographical Information System. The map reveals a complex glacial history characterised by multiple ice-flow events, including fast-flowing ice streams. Moraines record a series of pauses or re-advances during overall SE retreat towards the Keewatin Ice Divide. The distribution of subglacial meltwater landforms indicates that several distinctive scales and modes of drainage system operated beneath the retreating ice sheet. This includes a large (> 100  km) integrated network of meltwater channels, eskers, ice-contact <b>outwash</b> <b>fans</b> and deltas and glaciofluvial deposits that originates at the northern edge of Aberdeen Lake. The map comprises zone 66 of the Canadian National Topographic System, which encompasses an area of 160, 000  km 2. It is presented at a scale of 1 : 500, 000 and is designed to be printed at A 0 size...|$|R
50|$|Cedar Creek Canyon, {{also called}} simply Cedar Canyon, is a {{topographical}} feature located in Allen County, Indiana. It {{is a very}} straight, narrow gorge about 50 to 100 ft deep that contains part of the lower segment of Cedar Creek, the largest tributary of the St. Joseph River. The canyon originated {{at the end of}} the last ice age as a tunnel valley, a channel under the Erie Lobe of the Wisconsin Glacier that discharged meltwalter under considerable pressure into the ancestral Eel River, a tributary of the Wabash River. Cutting through the north limb of the Wabash Moraine, a debris deposit left by the retreating ice, the discharge left a large <b>outwash</b> <b>fan</b> that blocked the Eel, diverting its upper portion into the canyon in a classic example of stream piracy that formed today's Cedar Creek. This was part of a general drainage reversal that occurred in northeastern Indiana as the Maumee River opened and captured drainage that was previously part of the watershed of the Wabash. While the lower Eel remained a tributary of the Wabash, 175000 acre that it formerly drained became part of the Maumee watershed.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{microclimate}} and hydrology of debris-laden ice surfaces in the Taylor Valley, Antarctica, in early summer, {{focusing on the}} onset of melt. Measurements of energy and mass fluxes were made on an <b>outwash</b> <b>fan</b> and in moraines near the terminus of Taylor Glacier. The surface microclimate was strongly controlled by absorbed solar radiation, with a low albedo of 0. 17. Seasonal warming of the substrate led to an abrupt shift in thermal and hydrological patterns as temperatures exceeded freezing point. Within a week the Bowen ratio switched from 2. 05 to 0. 48 and mass losses to the atmosphere increased four-fold from 0. 39 to 1. 6 mm d- 1. Melt onset also produced complex ground temperature patterns with strong diurnal damping below the freezing front. These patterns were caused by phase changes in the freezing front, coupled with an abundant water supply from local runoff. Of secondary importance to the surface energy balance and mass fluxes was the effect of local winds on boundary layer characteristics. This resulted in larger mass losses during the more turbulent, warmer and drier down-valley flows...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1967 An 8 -square mile <b>outwash</b> <b>fan,</b> {{composed}} of gravelly sediment, {{extends from the}} terminus of Norris Glacier to the waters of upper Taku Inlet, Southeastern Alaska. Thirty-seven surface sediment samples from the tidal portion of the fan form the bulk of this study. The tidal flat is largely {{composed of}} very poorly sorted muddy sediment and relatively well sorted sand which, for the most part, overlie outwash gravel. Mixing of various modal size classes has produced a complex sediment distribution pattern {{as well as a}} complicated size-sorting relationship. The sand-size fraction of the sediments consists of feldspar, quartz, rock fragments, amphiboles, pyroxenes, micas and opaques; the clay-size fraction consists of micas, chlorite, montmorillonite, feldspar and amphibole. The sediments are the product of glacial abrasion in the Juneau Ice Field area. The sand and mud are derived largely from Norris and Taku Glacier detritus; their nature indicates valley glacier detritus may be fairly rapidly sorted when subjected to hydraulic action. Absence of quartz and presence of feldspar in the clay-size fraction may indicate the physical properties of these minerals control the size to which they can be reduced by valley-glacier abrasion...|$|E

40|$|Rotherslade on the Gower Peninsula {{in south}} Wales {{has been viewed}} as a key site for the {{reconstruction}} of Quaternary depositional environments in the British Isles. Since the early 20 th century, and certainly since the 1980 s, the accepted view has been that Rotherslade is the most westerly location on the south Gower coast where there is in situ basal till exposed and that, logically, this location marks {{the position of the}} LGM ice limit. However, reinvestigation of the sediments and their architecture, and analysis of clast fabrics and thin sections of critical sedimentary units, show that none of the exposed sediments has properties diagnostic of subglacial deposition or deformation. We postulate here that LGM ice terminated at the western side of Swansea Bay, a few kilometres to the north-east of Rotherslade, and propose that the sedimentary sequence comprises Early to Middle Devensian periglacial sediments, overlain by a complex of Late Devensian, ice-proximal <b>outwash</b> <b>fan</b> deposits, an assemblage of paraglacial debris and, finally, periglacial mass movement deposits. The proposed repositioning of the Late Devensian ice limit and the associated new subaerial interpretation of the sediments suggest that a reassessment of sedimentary sequences (Hunts Bay, Western Slade) and landforms (Paviland Moraine) farther west on Gower, which have attained similar stratigraphical status, is now warranted...|$|E

40|$|The complex glacial {{geomorphology}} and stratigraphy of the Solway Lowlands (Cumbria, UK) reflects dynamic ice flow {{during the}} Main Late Devensian Glaciation, with numerous ice-flow shifts, and re-advances now recognised. The final incursion of Scottish ice {{into the region}} (Scottish Re-advance) during a late stage of deglaciation has provoked widespread debate and even scepticism arising from ill-defined marginal limits, and a paucity of landforms, sediments and dates. In an attempt to resolve {{some of these issues}} this paper has applied both geomorphological and stratigraphic techniques to critically review evidence pertaining to the Scottish Re-advance. A major deltaic landform-sediment assemblage at Holme St. Cuthbert; a thin, patchy till sheet; and eskers at Thursby and Sowerby Wood verify that Scottish ice re-advanced into the Solway Lowlands at a late stage of deglaciation. The thin, patchy till sheet associated with the re-advance is indicative of a short-lived pulse, with ice thought to have flowed rapidly across water-saturated sediment and into proglacial lakes dammed up against higher ground to the east. The Holme St. Cuthbert delta, which evolved from a subaqueous <b>outwash</b> <b>fan</b> marks a major still-stand and development of a large ice-contact lake in the vicinity of Wigton. The extent of the glaciation is difficult to elucidate, with the till sheet disparately exposed as far east as Lannercost although identification of the Blackhall Wood Re-advance Till member probably limits its SE extent to just south of Carlisle. Coeval re-advance of Lake District ice is possible given that a final stage lobate movement of ice out of the Vale of Eden and into the Solway Lowlands is now recognised, however there is no direct stratigraphic correlation or dating control. ...|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. Louis Agassiz first {{raised the}} concept of a global ice age {{followed}} by an intriguing history of both proponents and opponents of the idea simultaneously contributing towards the evolution of geological notions up to the present-day ‘Snowball Earth’ model. The causes of glaciation and the sedimentary, geochemical and stratigraphic feedbacks subsequently received renewed interest. Different deposits of possible Neoproterozoic glacial successions were thus selected for detailed provenance analyses in this study. The successions selected are the Puncoviscana Formation on the Pampia Terrane (Northwestern Argentina), the Sierra del Volcán diamictite of the Tandilia System on the Río de la Plata craton (Eastern Argentina), the Kaigas and Numees Formations of the Richtersveld and Gariep areas on the Kalahari craton (Northwest South Africa and Southern Namibia) and the Karoetjes Kop Formation and Swartleikrans Bed of the Bloupoort Formation of the Vanrhynsdorp region on the Kalahari craton (Western South Africa). Diagnostic physicochemical aspects are utilized to ascertain whether the deposits studied are firstly of glacial derivation and, secondly, to constrain the provenance of every deposit. The latter culminate with identification of a regionally or globally significant event. The Sierra del Volcán diamictite is a glacial diamictite with a depositional age younger than 485 ± 2 Ma and is correlatable with the Upper Ordovician Pakhuis Formation (Table Mountain Group) in South Africa. The recognition of a glacial deposit of Upper Ordovician age in eastern Argentina suggests that the Hirnantian ice sheet cover extended from southwest South Africa to eastern Argentina, stretching from the central Paraná basin across into central and northwest Argentina and southern Bolivia. A proximal glacial marine depositional environment is inferred within a subaqueous <b>outwash</b> <b>fan</b> deposited by sediment gravity flow.

Based {{on the results of}} the additional work, the following conclusions were obtained regarding the lahar event generated by a future collapse of the Crater Lake outlet barrier: Peak discharge from the Crater Lake (assuming outlet barrier collapse occurs when the lake is full up to the top level of the barrier) is likely to be in the range 480 - 850 Bulking of the water flow (due to sediment entrainment) released by the outlet barrier collapse is likely to increase the peak discharge {{at the end of the}} Whangaehu Gorge to about 1540 - 2340 Overflows of the order of 50 - 290 and 20 - 160 into the southern "chute ' channel and into the Waikato Stream system respectively are likely to occur. Attenuation of the lahar event due to sediment detrainment and channel friction effects will occur down the <b>outwash</b> <b>fan</b> and the Whangaehu River parallel to the Desert Road. Peak discharge at Tangiwai Bridge (38 km from the Crater Lake outlet) is estimated to be 910 1 05 giving an upper-bound credible discharge of about 1015 Peak discharge at Tangiwai Bridge will be up to 54 - 72 % larger in magnitude than that for the historic 1953 event.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{water supply}} {{vulnerability}} study for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), several hundred groundwater samples have been tested for tritium activity, and the resulting distribution of tritium suggests complex patterns of groundwater age. To interpret the distribution of ages, a GIS tool was developed by linking the sampling locations with lithologic logs and hydrogeologic settings maps. Then, groundwater age was estimated from the tritium data using a geographically representative recharge input function and a mixing model. Separate input functions were developed for recharge in Northern, Central, and Southern Indiana. Groundwater age was estimated using the input functions with a mixing model that approximates advective dispersion and by comparing model-calculated tritium activities with groundwater tritium data. Next a preliminary analysis suggested that the hydrogeologic setting where a well is located, such as an <b>outwash</b> <b>fan</b> or a till plain, {{seems to be a}} good overall predictor for the tritium level; therefore, the statistical relationship between geologic setting and tritium levels was explored in greater detail. ^ A statistical test of the median tritium levels suggests that the geologic setting in which a well is located does influence the observed tritium activity. Median activities for outwash and river valleys setting groups were found to be significantly greater than the median for all of the data, while medians for settings groups consisting of till plains and moraines were found to be significantly less than the global median. These results support the hypothesis that hydrogeologic setting is a good predictor of groundwater age. However, numerous wells produced anomalously young or old groundwater compared with other wells in similar hydrogeologic settings. Those anomalies were investigated using the GIS, and some wells were also re-sampled and re-analyzed for tritium. In most cases the follow-up sampling results confirm the original “anomalous” results, and furthermore, all of the wells deemed to be tritium dead with the original data, were verified to be tritium dead with the re-sampling data. ...|$|E
50|$|Tunnel valleys {{associated}} with the Late Ordovician glaciation have been observed in north African countries, including Libya. These large-scale channel-fill sandstone bodies (tunnel valleys) are a striking sedimentological feature of the glacially related deposits on the old North Gondwanaland margin. They range from 10 - 200 m in depth, and 500 - 3000 m wide. The tunnel valleys are incised into the bedrock and can be traced for 2 - 30 km in length. In one example, in Mauritania, in the western Sahara, Late Ordovician siliciclastic glacial features and deposits on the North Gondwana continental shelf include incised channels identified as tunnel valleys. The filled tunnel valley are several kilometers long and several hundred meters wide. Reconstructions conclude that these structures were located in glacier ice-margin regions; the cross-sections of the valleys are comparable to those confirmed to have formed glacially, the valleys end in <b>outwash</b> <b>fans</b> similar to tunnel valleys, and the infill is post-glacial typical of that observed for tunnel valleys.|$|R

The map covers c. 60 km(2) and {{is based}} on {{high-resolution}} aerial photographs recorded in August 2008 as well as field checking. Landforms are manually registered in a geographical information system (ArcGIS) based on inspection of orthorectified imagery and digital elevation models of the area. We mapped subglacially streamlined landforms such as flutes and drumlins on the till plain, supraglacial landforms such as ice-cored moraine, pitted outwash, and concertina eskers, and ice-marginal landforms such as the large, multi-crested 1890 surge end moraine and smaller single-crested end moraines. The glaciofluvial landforms are represented by outwash plains, minor <b>outwash</b> <b>fans,</b> and sinuous eskers. Extramarginal sediments were also registered and consist mainly of old sediments in wetlands or locally weathered bedrock. Eyjabakkajokull has behaved as a surge-type glacier for 2200 years; hence, the mapped landforms originate from multiple surges. Landforms such as large glaciotectonic end moraines, hummocky moraine, long flutes, crevasse-fill ridges, and concertina eskers are characteristic for surge-type glaciers. The surging glacier landsystem of Eyjabakkajokull serves as a modern analog to the landsystems of terrestrial paleo-ice streams. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

This chapter takes an {{overview}} of the general environmental conditions that affect the nature of glaciation in New Zealand, with a particular focus on the Southern Alps. It includes a brief review of the history of glacial investigations in New Zealand and the evolution of ideas about glacial timing and causes. A major focus of the chapter is on understanding the context for glaciation in New Zealand. The importance of the very large, tectonically controlled, sediment supply and mild perhumid climatic conditions that allow year round water flow around the glaciers are highlighted. The glaciers are characterised by water derived features with kame terraces and <b>outwash</b> <b>fans</b> widespread through the lower courses of the glacial valleys. Modern glacier behaviour is related to both the resultant morphology and climate forcing.

Beach deposits of last interglacial age are overlain locally by aeolian sands, providing a maximum age for the deposition of the Bannow Till. Three sedimentary units at Bannow comprise a vertical continuum of sheared bedrock (glacitectonite) grading upwards into a subglacial till of mostly local derivation. Shearing and clast macrofabric data indicate that ice flow was from the north to northeast, indicative of glacier movement from an inland source. At Wood Village, glacier advance from the northeast is recorded by the glacitectonization of bedrock, interglacial marine sands, aeolian sands and periglacial slope deposits. This glacitectonized sequence of sediments is overlain unconformably by an extensive tabular unit of interbedded diamictons and stratified sediments typical of deposition in proximal proglacial <b>outwash</b> <b>fans.</b> The Bannow Till is classified as a glacitectonite–subglacial traction till continuum, having been derived from the shearing and fragmentation of shale bedrock from which blocks and slabs have been displaced along fault planes by brittle deformation and then edge-rounded and pulverized.

40|$|New {{high-resolution}} seismic reflection {{data from}} northern Lake Baikal and detailed land-based morphological and sedimentological data reveal {{a variety of}} coarse-grained deposits in the northern Baikal Rift. Each depositional facies is assigned to a specific structural domain. Alluvial fans (onshore) and small fan deltas (offshore) dominate the western border-fault flank. Glacial deposits (onshore) and large glacio-lacustrine fans (offshore) characterize the eastern flexural margin. In the north, the axial rift termination comprises a large fluvial delta. This distinct pattern of depositional environments reflects the pronounced asymmetry of the rift and emphasizes the role of rift structure in controlling drainage and the location and type of rift-basin fill. Climate, however, exerts a profound influence on the generation and availability of coarse-grained material. This is best documented along the eastern rift margin where Pleistocene valley glaciers advanced at > 50, 40 - 35, and 26 - 13 ka from the high rift shoulders down to, and beyond, the present shore into the Baikal Basin. During these phases, large volumes of glacial sediment were introduced into the basin, accumulating in extensive glacio-lacustrine <b>outwash</b> <b>fans.</b> About one-third of the seismically penetrated rift fill is glacial-outwash material derived from the eastern shoulder. Under present-day nonglacial conditions, however, the fans are inactive because of insufficient sediment supply; this documents the importance of major climatic fluctuations {{with respect to the}} magnitude of sediment discharge and accumulation. The sedimentary history also underscores the modifying effects of climate-driven processes on the typical structure-dominated aspects of rift sedimentation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Dunes are {{generally}} found in Poland either along the seacoast or inland, mainly in river valleys and on glaciofluvial <b>outwash</b> <b>fans.</b> The {{position of the}} dune fields of the Toruń Basin is unique also {{due to the fact}} that it is dominated by large dune forms, while the western part of the European sand belt is dominated by aeolian coversands. Dunes in the Toruń Basin are found on all terraces and make up vast clusters (complexes). W. Mrózek (1958) delimited there six dune fields. The dunes located in the Toruń Basin take the shape of crescent (parabolic) forms, simple ramparts (longitudinal and transversal) and irregular hilly forms. Additionally, there are numerous vast and plain areas covered with aeolian sand up to 4 – 5 m deep, which contain scattered irregular low dunes. The dunes of the Toruń Basin are mainly built of fine-grained and medium-grained sands which come from the local substratum of fluvioglacial and river deposits. The results of the studies on aeolian deposits carried out in the in Europe indicate that the earliest aeolian series (Older Coversand I, van der Hammen 1971) were deposited as early as Late Pleniglacial. In Poland this series has not been recog-nized, although the river deposits of that age have a larger content of quartz grain abraded in aeolian environment (Kozarski 1990; Manikowska 1991; Goździk 1991). New research claims in the Toruń Basin that the dunes formed chifly in the Younger Dryas, but probably also in the Older Dryas and even in the Preboreal.

40|$|Tunnel valleys {{have been}} widely {{reported}} on the bed of former ice sheets and are considered an important expression of subglacial meltwater drainage. Although {{known to have been}} cut by erosive meltwater flow, the water source and development of channels has been widely debated; ranging between outburst flood events through to gradually occurring channel propagation. We have mapped and analysed the spatial pattern and morphometry of tunnel valleys and associated glacial landforms along the southern sector of the former Laurentide Ice Sheet from high-resolution digital elevation models. Around 2000 tunnel valleys have been mapped, revealing an organised pattern of sub-parallel, semi-regularly spaced valleys that form in distinctive clusters. The tunnel valleys are typically [*]<  20  km long, and 0. 5 – 3  km wide, although their width varies considerably down-valley. They preferentially terminate at moraines, which suggests that formation is time dependent; while we also observe some tunnel valleys that have grown headwards out of hill-hole pairs. Analysis of cross-cutting relationships between tunnel valleys, moraines and <b>outwash</b> <b>fans</b> permits reconstruction of channel development in relation to the retreating ice margin. This palaeo-drainage reconstruction demonstrates incremental growth of most valleys, with some used repeatedly or for long periods, during deglaciation, while others were abandoned shortly after their formation. Our data and interpretation support gradual (rather than a single-event) formation of most tunnel valleys with secondary contributions from flood drainage of subglacial and or supraglacially stored water down individual tunnel valleys.

40|$|We reconstructed the {{geological}} evolution {{and the history}} of the fluvial network in {{the central part of the}} Po Plain in Lombardy, northern Italy, since the Middle Würm. We focused on evidences of dissection and incision of former rivers into the large <b>outwash</b> <b>fans</b> originating from piedmont glaciers of the southern Alps in the Last Glacial Maximum. The studied area is located between the Po River and the Alps north of the Adda/Serio river confluence, around the town of Crema. Morphometric analysis and stratigraphic investigation were carried out, supported by palaeobotany, sand petrography and radiometric dating. The obtained stratigraphic framework is presented by cross sections and by a geological map. During the Middle Würm, an alluvial fan of the Adda River oriented NWN-SSE occupied the area, feeding south and west the Romanengo hill. A substantial reorganisation of the fluvial network occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum. Since 32 - 30 cal ka BP, the area was fed by two outwash rivers, originated from the Adda and the Oglio piedmont glaciers, both characterised by a prevalent southward drainage, 160 °- 170 ° S in the LGM. After the LGM the fan-head was dissected by trunk channels and, at the downslope fan limit, the southward flow shifted to a southeastern direction. Thereafter, major dissection and downcutting occurred in the Lateglacial, confining the major rivers into large alluvial corridors, further shaped by lateral erosion during the Holocene. The Late Holocene history of the Serio River is marked by fluvial floods during the Late Roman Age, and by a capture of the lower reach by the Adda River. The geomorphological evidence supports the historically inferred age assignment of the diversion to 12 th- 14 th centuries AD...|$|R
40|$|Glacier {{recession}} and landform {{development in a}} debris-charged glacial landsystem characterized by an overdeepening is quantified using digital photogrammetry, digital elevation model (DEM) construction and mapping of the Icelandic glacier Kvíárjökull for the period 1945 – 2003. Melting of ice-cores is recorded by surface lowering rates of 0 · 8 m yr– 1 (1945 – 1964), 0 · 3 m yr– 1 (1964 – 1980), 0 · 015 m yr– 1 (1980 – 1998) and 0 · 044 m yr– 1 (1998 – 2003). The distribution/preservation of pushed and stacked ice-cored moraine complexes {{are determined by the}} location of the long-term glacial drainage network in combination with retreat from the overdeepening, into which glacifluvial sediment is being directed and where debris-rich ice masses are being reworked and replaced by esker networks produced in englacial meltwater pathways that bypassed the overdeepening and connected to <b>outwash</b> <b>fans</b> prograding over the snout. Recent accelerated retreat of Kvíárjökull, potentially due to increased mass balance sensitivity, has made the snout highly unstable, especially now that the overdeepening is being uncovered and the snout flooded by an expanding pro-glacial, and partially supraglacial, lake. This case study indicates that thick sequences of debris-charged basal ice/controlled moraine have a very low preservation potential but ice-cored moraine complexes can develop into hummocky moraine belts in de-glaciated terrains because they are related to the process of incremental stagnation, which at Kvíárjökull has involved periodic switches from transport-dominant to ablation-dominant conditions. Glacier recession is therefore recorded temporally and spatially by two suites of landforms relating to two phases of landform production which are likely typical for glaciers occupying overdeepenings: an early phase of active, temperate recession recorded by push moraines and lateral moraines and unconfined pro-glacial meltwater drainage; and a later phase of incremental stagnation and pitted outwash head development initiated by the increasing topographic constraints of the latero-frontal moraine arc and the increasing importance of the overdeepening as a depo-centre.

40|$|In this study, we {{introduce}} the architecture {{and style of}} sedimentation of two <b>outwash</b> <b>fans</b> {{in front of the}} Myrdalsjokull ice cap, central south Iceland, that broaden different types of ice-marginal sedimentation. At Kotlujokull, a southeastern outlet of the ice cap, fan formation was monitored from the late 1970 s to 2002; thus, the style of sedimentation is well understood and the relationship to the depositional architecture easily established. In front of Slettjokull, a northern lobate extension of the ice cap, a fan from the 10 th century AD is capped by neoglacial till sheets. At both sites, the fan surfaces were reconstructed in three dimensions. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) provided the thickness and internal structure of sediment bodies. Geological exposures and excavations were used for detailed sedimentological documentation of the outwash deposits in proximal-to-distal transects. The outwash deposits at both Kotlujokull and Slettjokull are considered to be alluvial fans of the hochsander type, i. e., supraglacially fed, as they show all the architectural characteristics of alluvial fans with a semiconical shape, a restricted radial length of ca. 0. 5 - 1. 5 km, a plano-convex cross-profile and a slope gradient ranging between 1 and 5. Fan deposits are dominated by planar or low-angle cross-bedded sand facies interbedded with thin laminae of fine gravel occasionally draped by mud. Sedimentation occurs during upper flow regime sheetflows associated with antidune migration within an aggrading, shallow braided-stream network. Hochsanders are intimately linked to advancing or stationary glaciers with steep ice-cored frontal slopes that favor supraglacial over subglacial drainage. Most important, hochsander fans lack any proximal-to-distal transition in the grain-size distribution, sediment facies or facies associations. Because much classification of glacial outwash sediments is based on proximal-to-distal distinctions, it is crucial to consider the depositional model for hochsanders. This study also indicates a strong dependence between the altitudes of the buried fan surface and the present-day terrain in the forefield of Slettjokull, illustrating that subsequent to fan formation, subglacial landforms merely mask many of the pre-existing morphological features...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to (1) summarize the natural and human history of Indiana 2 ̆ 7 s peatlands, (2) compare peatland frequency and distribution to surface physiography, (3) investigate effects of basin morphometry on peatland formation, (4) reconstruct the development of Indiana 2 ̆ 7 s peatlands using subfossils, and (5) characterize the vegetation of Indiana 2 ̆ 7 s peatlands along environmental and temporal gradients. Historic accounts of nearly 100 peatlands indicate that the previous abundance of bogs and fens in Indiana had a significant effect on agriculture and industry. Characteristic soils show over 62, 000 ha of peatland in Indiana. The highest concentrations are within the former boundaries of the stagnant Saginaw Lobe of Wisconsin glaciation (ca. 15, 000 yrs. BP). Within this area, peatlands were significantly more frequent in mixed drift resulting from collapse of sub-ice tunnels and open ice-walled channels. Peatlands were significantly less frequent in morainal topography and loam till of Trafalfgar formation, sand and gravel deposits in <b>outwash</b> <b>fans,</b> and ice-contact sand and gravel ridges. The most significant morphometric qualities of individual basins favoring peat formation were small surface area and protection from wave erosion. The mean surface area of non-peat-forming basins was significantly larger. Maximum, mean, and relative depth, volume, and shoreline development were variable among peatland basins. Acid-forming, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands had smaller watersheds and deeper clay and silt hardpans than strongly minerotrophic fens. Coring and macrofossil analysis of ten non-riparian peatlands showed that all began as mesotrophic or eutrophic lakes, developed into marshes characterized by emergent vegetation (Nuphar, Nymphaea, and Brasenia), and the moss Drepanocladus aduncus (submergent form). Ninety percent of the basins developed a fen mat characterized by the mosses Calliergon trifarium and Meesia triquetra. While some basins became forested immediately after the fen stage, many became Sphagnum-dominated leatherleaf bogs and produced up to 4. 5 m of Sphagnum peat. The flora of leatherleaf bogs exhibits a mixed geographic affinity characteristic to the southern Great Lakes region. Peatland plant assemblages in southern Michigan and Indiana are different from those in northern Michigan, Ohio, and the northeast. Regardless of their trophic origins, all Indiana peatlands senesce into lowland forests dominated by Acer rubrum. ...|$|R
40|$|The 2015 NSF-ICDP Junín {{drilling}} project recovered multiple long sediment cores (~ 100 m depth) from Lake Junín, Peru (~ 300 km 2; 4085 m. a. s. l.; 11. 0 °S, 76. 1 °W; zmax~ 12 m). These cores span multiple glacial-interglacial {{cycles and}} are anticipated {{to provide the}} longest independently-dated record of hydroclimate, glacier variability, and paleomagnetic variation for the tropical Andes. To aid in accurate interpretation of the drill core stratigraphy, we investigated spatial variations in sediment composition by collecting 9 cores (1 - 9 m length) from Lake Junín across a paleoglacier proximal-distal (NE-SW) transect. Each core extends into glacigenic sediments, indicating recovery of the complete postglacial sequence (past ~ 22. 5 ka). Most cores exhibit a four-component stratigraphy: a lower unit of gray glacial flour and minerogenic material sourced from glacial <b>outwash</b> <b>fans</b> to the NE, a lower-middle unit of organic-rich sediments with abundant grass, an upper-middle unit of transitional organic to carbonate sediments, and an upper unit of non-glacial sediments composed primarily of beige marl. We interpret these facies changes to reflect major changes in depositional environment and hydrologic conditions. Spatial variations in the age, thickness, and transition character among these units reflect the complex stratigraphy of a lake with such shallow water depth and high sensitivity to regional changes in hydrologic balance. Additionally, we identified at least four erosional unconformities in the shallow-water cores to the NE, indicating substantial changes in lake level. These unconformities were radiocarbon dated to provide “benchmarks” constraining past lake level. We combined our reconstructed lake level history based on sedimentary changes in composite core C- 15 /D- 15 with the benchmarks of past lake level from erosional unconformities identified and dated from the transect cores to create a comprehensive model for lake level over the past 25, 000 years called Junín Lake Level Index (LLI). We compare our interpretation of past lake level with local, regional, and interhemispheric records of past hydroclimatic variability. The trends observed in LLI over the past 25, 000 years are largely dependent on the mean annual latitudinal location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone {{and its impact on}} the strength of the South American Summer Monsoon...|$|R
