5|$|Sightseers {{gathered}} on the bridge in the morning. George Henry Farnum, the owner of Okemah's only photography studio, took photographs, which were distributed as postcards, a common practice at the time. The district judge convened a grand jury, but the killers were never identified. Four of Farnum's photographs {{are known to have}} survived—two spectator scenes and one close-up view each <b>of</b> <b>Laura</b> and L.D. Three of the images were re-published in 2000 and exhibited at the Roth Horowitz Gallery in New York by James Allen, an antique collector.

5|$|On September26, a {{very large}} extratropical area of low {{pressure}} developed along a quasi-stationary frontal system a few hundred miles west of the Azores. The low intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80mph (130km/h) at 12:00UTC on September27. Over the following days, the low began to lose its frontal features and began to transition into a subtropical cyclone as it traveled in a general westward direction. By September29, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura. Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center <b>of</b> <b>Laura</b> and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying. A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60mph (95km/h). The overall structure <b>of</b> <b>Laura</b> remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, the Secords unsuccessfully {{petitioned the}} {{government}} {{for some kind of}} acknowledgement. In 1860, when Secord was 85, the Prince of Wales heard of her story while travelling in Canada. At Chippawa, near Niagara Falls, he learned <b>of</b> <b>Laura</b> Secord's plight as an aging widow and sent an award of £100. It was the only official recognition that she received during her lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, {{convection}} {{associated with}} Laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics, but still retained its status. Early on October1, the extratropical transition was fully apparent. Laura remained tropical but the cloud pattern was becoming frontal {{and there was}} little convection around {{the center of the}} system. With minimal shower and thunderstorm activity remaining around the center <b>of</b> <b>Laura,</b> the storm degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area on October1 while still producing tropical storm-force winds. The next day, the remnant system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and began to re-intensify as it rapidly tracked towards the north. Early on October3, the system slowed down as it turned towards the east and strengthened into a hurricane-force cyclone with winds of 75mph (120km/h). After accelerating towards the east, another large extratropical cyclone absorbed the remnants <b>of</b> <b>Laura</b> while located several hundred miles west of the British Isles on October4.|$|E

5|$|Bayona {{cut parts}} of the script, {{including}} {{the outcome of the}} other orphanage children, because he wanted to focus on the character <b>of</b> <b>Laura</b> and what happens to her. To create the film as he wanted, Bayona had to double both the film's budget and the amount of filming time. To accomplish this, Bayona received help from fellow film director Guillermo del Toro, whom he had met at Festival de Cine de Sitges when del Toro was presenting his film Cronos (1993). Del Toro offered to co-produce the film as soon as he learned about it. For the rest of his crew, Bayona worked with his regular team that he worked with on commercials and music videos.|$|E
5|$|On October8, the {{remnants}} <b>of</b> <b>Laura</b> reached the Netherlands. At the time, its rain bands began interacting {{with a cold}} front associated with a well-developed low west of Norway, dropping up to 113mm (4.4in) of precipitation in the northwestern Netherlands. Consequently, streets and homes {{in the village of}} Hippolytushoef were reportedly inundated. The large amounts of precipitation broke the daily and monthly rainfall records for October, which were previously set in 2006. Gradually passing through Norway, {{the remnants}} of the storm caused significant damage to electric utilities. As a result, more than 10,000 people lost power in southern parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|Whitaker {{was born}} in Longview, Texas, the son <b>of</b> <b>Laura</b> Francis (née Smith), a special {{education}} teacher who put herself through college and earned two master's degrees while raising her children, and Forest Steven Jr., an insurance salesman.

Whitaker has two younger brothers, Kenn Whitaker, an actor, and Damon, and an older sister, Deborah. Whitaker's first role as an actor was the lead in Dylan Thomas' play Under Milk Wood.|$|E

James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to pick his nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The Roadhouse, the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes a telephone call from his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who {{is on his way to}} aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money they owe to Leo. The $10,000 they were meant to pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which they can now no longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Laura {{was a large}} but {{short-lived}} {{tropical cyclone}} that developed over the north-central Atlantic Ocean in late September during the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. The 12th named storm of the season, Laura formed out of a large extratropical {{area of low pressure}} located about 1015miles (1635km) west of the Azores on September29. Laura slowly developed tropical characteristics throughout the day as it moved over warmer waters. On the afternoon of September30, Laura had acquired enough tropical characteristics to be designated a Tropical Storm. Shortly after being declared tropical, Laura began to undergo an extratropical transition, which did not fully take place until the morning of October1. Laura degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone later that morning, and the final advisory by the National Hurricane Center was issued. The remnants <b>of</b> <b>Laura</b> contributed to heavy rainfall and power outages in the British Isles, the Netherlands, and Norway on October5 to 8.|$|E
