40|$|The {{existing}} buildings stock in European countries accounts for over 40 % of {{final energy consumption}} in the European Union (EU) member states, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>residential</b> use represents 63 % of total energy consumption in the buildings sector. Consequently, an increase of building energy performance can constitute an important instrument in the efforts to alleviate the EU energy import dependency and comply with the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This is also in accordance to the European Directive on the energy performance of buildings (EPBD), which is currently under consideration in all EU member states. The Energy Performance Assessment for Existing Dwellings (EPA-ED) and for Non-Residential Buildings (EPA-NR) are two new methodologies supported by software, developed {{in the framework of}} two European projects that focus on energy related issues and are suitable for audits, labeling and issuing an Energy Performance Certificate for {{existing buildings}}, in accordance to the EPBD. This paper presents an overview of the two EPA methods and software {{that can be used to}} perform building energy audits and assess buildings in a uniform way, perform demand and savings calculations, provide owners with specific advice for measures that can improve energy performance, issue an Energy Performance Certificate for existing buildings, and include some representative results from the pilot studies performed in several European countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{building}} sector consumes {{about 40}} % of primary energy in Europe, <b>of</b> <b>which,</b> <b>residential</b> building accounts for 26 % - {{as the largest}} single energy consumption. As a result, the building sector plays a decisive role to reduce Europe's energy consumption. This led {{to the release of}} European Energy Performance Building Directive in 2010 known as EPBD recast 2010 which introduced the objective that all new buildings - and existing large buildings, by retrofitting – be Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) from 2020 onwards. As a result, this PhD thesis intends to contribute to the design of better policies that foster the implementation of NZEB concept or Net Zero Energy House (NZEH), as a subset, with a particular emphasis on residential building in Europe. In this context, Portugal and Finland are chosen as the cases of the two climatically distinct European countries (Mediterranean vs. Boreal/Sub-Arctic) that also possess a large socio-economic gap. The thesis proposes that in order to develop policies that lead to the successful NZEH implementation in Europe, a clearly defined energy-service framework with numerical reference values for the residential energy services demand is required. As a result, the thesis proposes an energy service modeling framework for residential energy services: space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, cooking, kitchen appliances and other media appliances. Additionally, a multi-objective optimization method that uses genetic algorithms is carried out, which can help to determine the optimal choice of energy systems to supply the demand energy services. The optimization objectives combine: minimize the energy system cost and minimize the energy demand. Furthermore, implications for future technology development and policy recommendations are defined with the emphasis on the end-use and demand side of residential energy services. With respect to Portugal, the results are water heat pump is best suited for water heating, whereas biomass boiler is preferable for both water and space heating. Moreover, PV is found to be the best option for the electricity demand of media, cooking, and lighting. Of all the investigated options, geothermal remains the least cost-effective, whilst energy storage deployment needs more effective incentive mechanism to ensure cost feasibility. For Finland, it is found that a water heat pump is the most suitable means for water heating in detached houses, whereas district heat systems based on renewable energy resources offer the best option for water and space heating in an apartment building scenario. In contrast to Portugal, geothermal heat pumps offer a cost-effective alternative for space heating in the Finland's climate...|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this research is}} the urgent need for reducing the current energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, that is vital to mitigate climate change and the limitation of energy sources. This target can be achieved by creating more sustainable cities, since nowadays, the built environment, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>residential</b> buildings occupy the largest part, consumes huge amounts of energy worldwide, and {{have a major impact on}} CO 2 emissions. Based on the vision of City-Zen project of creating fully sustainable and energy (carbon) neutral smart cities, and the European commission’s goal of reducing carbon emissions by 80 - 95 % by 2050, the need for innovative solutions regarding energy efficient residential retrofitting is growing. At the same time, different and complex methods to define sustainable measures, actions and interventions are used. The current research, aims to contribute at the City-Zen project for creating a structured energy urban planning approach, by answering the following question: Which is the methodology leading to the design of a roadmap that helps to define which energy systems and retrofit measures should be applied where and when, on residential neighbourhoods of Amsterdam Nieuw West until 2050, for achieving their energy transition and CO 2 emissions reduction? The answer to the research question is given by developing an energy urban planning 4 -step methodology, and by formulating a catalogue of energy and retrofit measures for the building, neighbourhood and district scale. The four steps are defined as the 1) mapping the present, 2) the definition of the future energy targets, 3) the development of the strategy for selecting the suitable energy systems, and eventually 4) the design of the energy transition roadmap for selected neighbourhoods inside Amsterdam Nieuw West district. This methodology is required to be followed step by step, applying the first three steps initially on the city scale for the sake of creating a smooth transition of the steps implementation process from city scale to neighbourhood scale. Furthermore, the same steps are applied on neighbourhood scale with minor changes, to get to the final step which is the roadmap design, comprised of 3 sub-steps. First of all, the roadmap suggests the selection of suitable energy systems for 2050 for each one of the selected neighbourhoods. The selections are based on several variables retrieved by literature review. These variables lead to solutions for smaller clusters of dwellings consisting the neighbourhoods, formulated by similar construction characteristics and ownership status. Secondly, description templates are provided, one for each energy system, listing the used energy retrofit measures in steps, and quantifying the changes in heat demand and in CO 2 emissions according to each step. Finally, the collected retrofit solutions from the first two sub-steps are used in the final sub-step of defining the interventions on timeline. The changes in heat demand are visualised on 3 -dimensional heat maps, showing the results of 5 -year periods of retrofit actions, starting from today until reaching the final energy goal in 2050...|$|E
