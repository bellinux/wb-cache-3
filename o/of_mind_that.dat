5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E

25|$|According to dualism, {{the mind}} is non-physical (or, at the very least, has non-physical properties) and, therefore, cannot be {{explained}} in purely physical terms.

25|$|Mind–body dualism, or mind–body duality, {{is a view}} in the {{philosophy}} <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical, or that the mind and body are distinct and separable. Thus, it encompasses a set of views {{about the relationship between}} mind and matter, and between subject and object, and is contrasted with other positions, such as physicalism and enactivism, in the mind–body problem.|$|E

25|$|Computationalism is the {{position}} in the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking {{is a form of}} computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind-body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.|$|E
25|$|Epiphenomenalism is {{the theory}} in {{philosophy}} <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> mental phenomena {{are caused by}} physical processes in the brain or that both are effects of a common cause, as opposed to mental phenomena driving the physical mechanics of the brain. The impression that thoughts, feelings, or sensations cause physical effects, is therefore {{to be understood as}} illusory to some extent. For example, it is not the feeling of fear that produces an increase in heart beat, both are symptomatic of a common physiological origin, possibly in response to a legitimate external threat.|$|E

I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E

These allegedly irreducible subjects, which contain irreducible predicates, differ from hard sciences {{in that they are}} interest-relative. Here, interest-relative fields depend on the existence <b>of</b> <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> can have interested perspectives. Psychology is one such science; it completely depends on and presupposes the existence <b>of</b> the <b>mind.</b>|$|R

25|$|Considered {{the most}} {{powerful}} wizard in the world, Dumbledore is benevolent and wise, a good wizard {{in the style of}} Merlin. He almost constantly gives off an aura of serenity and composure, rarely displaying intense emotions of anger or fear. Yet despite his benign nature, it is said that Dumbledore was the only wizard Lord Voldemort ever truly feared. Dumbledore is very eccentric and even slightly effeminate; he is very fond of knitting patterns and frequently wears flamboyant clothing (at one point, he is seen wearing a flowered bonnet). He is also known for his odd displays of whimsicality; he often uses humour to make people feel comfortable in his presence. As a supremely talented wizard, Dumbledore displays numerous examples of extraordinary powers. His abilities as a wizard are combined with a kind of cunning and subtlety <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> allowed him to comprehend human nature and turn the better aspects of humanity (trust, love, and friendship) to Voldemort's disadvantage in particular.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle was}} the end of any {{noteworthy}} Spanish naval presence in the New World. It forced Spain to re-assess its strategy in Cuba and resulted in an ever-tightening blockade of the island. While fighting continued until August, when the Treaty of Paris was signed, all surviving Spanish capital ships were now husbanded to defend their homeland leaving only isolated units of auxiliary vessels to defend the coast. Uncontested U.S. control of the seas around Cuba made resupply of the Spanish garrison impossible and its surrender inevitable. Admiral Cervera received different treatment than the sailors taken to Portsmouth. For a time, he was held at Annapolis, Maryland, where he was received with great enthusiasm by the people of that city. The Battle of Santiago de Cuba brought Cervera peace <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he had fulfilled an officer’s duties and that his fleet had upheld Spanish honor. His bravery {{in the face of the}} enemy’s superiority garnered respect from Spanish and American sailors and officers alike. The Spanish prisoners of war were released upon the signing of the 1898 Treaty of Paris and the remaining Spanish forces left Cuba, leaving civil order to the military government that the United States established. The U.S. Army under the overall administration of General Leonard Wood governed the island for some time afterwards and, with help, removed many of the mines laid in the bay.The immediate effect of the Battle of Santiago and the larger Spanish-American War, then, {{was the end}} of any noteworthy Spanish naval presence in the New World. In the imperial vacuum left by Spain’s New World empire, the United States now exerted considerable influence both in annexing formal territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines and in subsequent American military interventions throughout the Caribbean over the next half century.|$|E
25|$|It was in {{this state}} <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Peckinpah agreed to make Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Based on the {{screenplay}} by Rudolph Wurlitzer, who had previously penned Two-Lane Blacktop, a film admired by Peckinpah, the director was convinced {{that he was about}} to make his definitive statement on the Western genre. The script offered Peckinpah the opportunity to explore themes that appealed to him: two former partners forced by changing times onto opposite sides of the law, manipulated by corrupt economic interests. Peckinpah rewrote the screenplay, establishing Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid as friends, and attempted to weave an epic tragedy from the historical legend. Filmed on location in the Mexican state of Durango, the film starred James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson in the title roles, with a huge supporting cast including Bob Dylan, who composed the film's music, Jason Robards, R. G. Armstrong, Richard Jaeckel, Jack Elam, Chill Wills, Katy Jurado, Matt Clark, L. Q. Jones, Rutanya Alda, Slim Pickens, and Harry Dean Stanton. From the beginning, Peckinpah began to have clashes with MGM and its president James Aubrey, known for his stifling of creative interests and eventual dismantling of the historic movie company. Numerous production difficulties, including an outbreak of influenza and malfunctioning cameras, combined with Peckinpah's growing problems with alcohol, resulted in one of the most troubled productions of his career. Principal photography finished 21 days behind schedule and $1.6 million over budget. Enraged, Aubrey severely cut Peckinpah's film from 124 to 106 minutes, resulting in Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid being released in a truncated version largely disowned by cast and crew members. Critics complained that the film was incoherent, and the experience soured Peckinpah forever on Hollywood. In 1988, however, Peckinpah's director's cut was released on video and led to a reevaluation, with many critics hailing it as a mistreated classic and one of the era's best films. Filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese, have praised the film as one of the greatest modern Westerns.|$|E

500|$|A {{philosophy}} <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> {{regards the}} {{degrees of freedom}} between mental and physical well-being as not necessarily synonymous and thus implying an experiential dualism between body and mind. [...] As example of these disparate degrees of freedom is given by Allan Wallace who notes that it is, [...] "experientially apparent that one may be physically uncomfortable—for instance, while engaging in a strenuous physical workout—while mentally cheerful; conversely, one may be mentally distraught while experiencing physical comfort." [...] Experiential dualism notes that our subjective experience of merely seeing something {{in the physical world}} seems qualitatively different than mental processes like grief that comes from losing a loved one for instance. [...] This philosophy also is a proponent of causal dualism which is defined as the dual ability for mental states and physical states to affect one another. [...] Mental states can cause changes in physical states and vice versa.|$|E
500|$|Alien was {{released}} on March 22, 2005, selling 3,697 copies in its first week. It reached No.32 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, and No.35 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Critics praised Townsend's inventiveness and the dynamism of the songs in which [...] "melody and discord meet midway"; Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote that [...] "Strapping Young Lad have raised the bar yet again", while Blabbermouth.net's Krista G. called {{it one of the}} best albums of the year. Townsend and Hoglan were the primary writers of the album, since Simon and Stroud were busy with other commitments. To prepare for the recording of Alien, Townsend had stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder; he explained the experimental noise track [...] "Info Dump" [...] is a reflection on the panicked state <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> ensued after he stopped taking his medication. The making of Alien was documented and made viewable online on Century Media's official site in February 2005. It was also available as a bonus DVD of the limited first edition of the album.|$|E
500|$|Shiller {{moved to}} Chicago's Uptown {{neighborhood}} in 1972 {{with her husband}} Marc Zalkin and her infant son, Brendan, and lived on N Malden Street in Uptown. Shiller drove a cab, worked as a waitress and free lance photographer, and got involved in radical politics. With one of Chicago's most controversial political organizers, Walter [...] "Slim" [...] Coleman, Shiller helped organize the Intercommunal Survival Committee, a sort of white support arm of the Black Panther Party. The committee evolved into the Heart of Uptown Coalition, a political and social service organization steeped in the rhetoric of Marxism; [...] "comrades" [...] were expected to organize [...] "cadres." [...] "We must have the frame <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> as revolutionaries we have (to) {{be able to solve}} any problem that comes our way..." [...] Shiller said. The Coalition provided an array of programs geared toward providing essential services for the poor, including medical clinics for pregnant women, mothers and young children; a legal aid clinic, food pantries and distributing clothes and meals to the poor. For decades Shiller and her allies worked to preserve Uptown as the last North Side lakefront neighborhood south of Rogers Park that is home to a significant population of low income households.|$|E
