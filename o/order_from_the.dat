5|$|Although {{by the end}} of 1837 the Arms Company {{had made}} over 1,000 weapons, there were no sales. Following the Panic of 1837, the company's {{underwriters}} were reluctant to fund the new machinery that Colt needed to make interchangeable parts, so he went on the road to raise money. Demonstrating his gun to people in general stores did not generate the sales volume he needed, so with another loan from his cousin, Selden, he went to Washington, D.C., and demonstrated it to President Andrew Jackson. Jackson approved of the gun and wrote Colt a note saying so. Presidential approval in hand, Colt pushed a bill through Congress endorsing a demonstration for the military, but failed to obtain an appropriation for military purchase of the weapon. A promising <b>order</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> state of South Carolina for fifty to seventy-five pistols was canceled when the company did not produce them quickly enough.|$|E

5|$|On 8 November, Davorin Rudolf {{representing}} Croatian authorities, and Lieutenant Colonel General Marijan ČadJNA {{commanding officer}} of the 13th (Rijeka) Corpsagreed to evacuate the corps personnel and equipment from Croatia. The agreement, made after negotiations supervised {{and supported by the}} European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) would later {{serve as a model for}} similar agreements elsewhere in Croatia. Čad made the agreement at his own initiative, with the support of the JNA Fifth Military District, after receiving an <b>order</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> JNA Chief of Staff Colonel General Blagoje Adžić to destroy the JNA facilities in Rijeka and to attack industrial plants and infrastructure in or near the city. The agreement was not affected by the HV capture of the Draga barracks and weapons stored there on 9 November.

He married Anne Sitwell, daughter of Sir Sitwell Sitwell, 1st Baronet, on 4 October that year; the two would remain married for forty years, until Anne's death in 1856, but had no children. Unusually, Anne was a relative of his by marriage; Stovin's sister Sarah Caroline had married Sir Sitwell after his first wife's death, making Stovin's new wife his step-niece.|$|E
5|$|The Roman army battled first {{against its}} tribal {{neighbours}} and Etruscan towns within Italy, and later came {{to dominate the}} Mediterranean and at its height the provinces of Britannia and Asia Minor. As with most ancient civilizations, Rome's military served the triple purpose of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal <b>order.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> outset, Rome's military typified this pattern, {{and the majority of}} Rome's campaigns were characterised by one of two types. The first is the territorial expansionist campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive, in which each victory brought subjugation of large areas of territory and allowed Rome to grow from a small town to a population of 55 million in the early empire when expansion was halted. The second is the civil war, which plagued Rome from its foundation to its eventual demise.|$|E
5|$|The Sovereign has {{historically}} {{had the power}} to choose Knights of the <b>Order.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century onwards, the Sovereign made his or her choices upon the advice of the Government. George VI felt that the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle had been used only for political patronage, rather than to reward actual merit. Therefore, with the agreement of the Prime Minister (Clement Attlee) and the Leader of the Opposition (Winston Churchill) in 1946, both Orders returned to the personal gift of the Sovereign.|$|E

5|$|The name Machetero was symbolically {{adopted from}} an impromptu band of Puerto Ricans who {{assembled}} {{to defend the}} island of Puerto Rico from the invading forces of the United States Army during the Spanish–American War, between July 26 and August 12, 1898. Macheteros de Puerto Rico were dispatched throughout the island, working in cooperation with other voluntary groups including the Guardias de la Paz in Yauco and Tiradores de Altura in San Juan. These voluntary units were involved {{in most of the}} battles in the Puerto Rican Campaign. Their last involvement was in the Battle of Asomante, where along with units led by Captain Hernaíz, defended Aibonito Pass from invading units. The allied offensive was effective, prompting a retreat <b>order</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> American side. However, the following morning the signing of the Treaty of Paris was made public. Subsequently, both Spanish and Puerto Rican soldiers and volunteers disengaged and Puerto Rico was annexed by the United States.|$|E
