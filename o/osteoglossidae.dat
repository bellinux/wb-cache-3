DNA based markers especially neutral mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) {{have been used}} widely in recent times to provide better resolution of systematic relationships among vertebrate taxa. The Asian Arowana (Scleropages formosus) is a high value ornamental fish belonging to the family <b>Osteoglossidae</b> {{with a number of}} different colour variants distributed geographically across different locations around Southeast Asia. Systematic relationships among colour variants still remain unresolved. Partial sequences of the Cytochrome B (Cyt B) and DNA barcoding gene, Cytochrome C Oxidase I (COI) were used here to assess genetic relationships among colour variants and as a tool for molecular identification for differentiating among colour variants in this species. Results of the study show that in general, colour pattern shows no relationship with extent of COI or Cyt B mtDNA differentiation and so cannot be used to identify taxa.

40|$|The author {{describes}} the snout osteology of the fossil <b>Osteoglossidae</b> Phareodus and Brychaetus. He {{shows that the}} two genera considerably differ in their naso-ethmoid region. Indeed, Phareodus encaustus and P. queenslandicus possess a large dermethmoid contacting the frontals and separating the two nasals from each other, which is the primitive condition within teleosts. P. testis {{is a little more}} specialized. Its dermethmoid still separates partially the two nasals but it begins to lose its contact with the frontals. On the contrary, Brychaetus muelleri exhibits a specialized snout pattern. The two nasals, articulated with the frontals, are joined together on almost their entire length, except at their anterior edge where a small dermethmoid, largely separated from the frontals, is inserted between them, as in Osteoglossum and Scleropages. Thus, Brychaetus is a valid genus and not a synonym of Phareodus.

Fish and water {{samples were collected}} bimonthly (March 2003 to February 2004) in the morning. Fish samples were caught with gill nets set at the surface and bottom habitats. There were 11 fish families and 21 species. <b>Osteoglossidae,</b> Anabantidae, Channidae, Schilbedae and Cyprinidae were rare and occurred seasonally in fishermen catches, while Mormyridae, Cichlidae, Mochokidae, Characidae, Bagridae and Clariidae showed less variation and were more common. Characidae and Cichlidae were the most abundant (23. 0 and 18. 6 % respectively) while <b>Osteoglossidae,</b> Channidae and Anabantidae were the least (1. 7, 2. 1 and 2. 3 % respectively). Clariidae and Mormyridae had the highest weight with 16. 0 % and 12. 3 % respectively, while Anabantidae had the lowest (3. 4 %). Surface water temperatures were generally higher than air temperatures during the afternoon, except from January to March when air temperatures were high (28. 1 to 28. 7 oC) due to low relative humidity (39 to 70 %). In the morning, surface water temperatures (25. 5 to 26. 3 oC) became higher than air temperatures (25. 2 to 26. 0 oC) from May to December, when relative humidity values were also high (50 to 88 %). The dif- ferences between surface and bottom water temperatures was generally higher (0. 7 to 3. 1 oC; P < 0. 05) in the afternoon (0. 2 to 0. 8 oC) due to sunlight. Temperature differences in the surface and bottom waters were usually higher {{during the dry season}} (P < 0. 05), for similar reasons. Captures were higher in the dry season when the fish concentrated in the warmer, steadier and scarcer water. Minimal and maximal temperatures were different for surface and bottom waters (P < 0. 05).

40|$|An ancient genome {{duplication}} (TGD or 3 R) {{occurred in}} teleost fish after divergence from the lineage leading to gar. This genome duplication {{is shared by}} the three extant teleost lineages: Osteoglossomorpha (bony-tongues), Elopomorpha (eels and tarpons) and Clupeocephala (a large clade including salmon, carp, medaka, zebrafish, cichlids, pufferfish, stickleback and ~ 26, 000 other species). After TGD, different clupeocephalan species retained different gene duplicates; this is seen clearly in Hox gene clusters but extends to all genes. Since divergent resolution of TGD paralogs is a potential driving force for speciation, it is possible this contributed to diversification of this clade. The extent to which divergent resolution of TGD paralogs occurred within Osteoglossomorpha has not been investigated in detail, and Hox cluster organisation has been reported for just two species: Pantodon buchholzi (Pantodontidae) and Scleropages formosus (<b>Osteoglossidae).</b> We applied surveyscale genome sequencing and de novo assembly to three further osteoglossomorph taxa: Osteoglossum bicirrhosum (<b>Osteoglossidae),</b> Chitala ornata (Notopteridae), and Gnathonemus petersii (Mormyridae).

Several Hox genes are missing in all teleosts, including duplicates of two Hox genes present in the slow evolving pre-TGD genome of the spotted gar.

Pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) is a native Amazonian fish species from the <b>Osteoglossidae</b> family and an obligated air breather.

Fish feeding was observed 36 h after transport for all fish, and normal feeding consumption was observed at 72 h. In both groups physiological responses were similar. Cortisol did not show any significant alteration during the sampled period. Unlike most fish species, cortisol values were unaltered in both groups during sampling, while glucose presented a significant change up to 12 h after transport.

40|$|One of {{the more}} unusual visual systems of the Actinopterygii is that of Pantodon buchholzi (Osteoglossomorpha: <b>Osteoglossidae).</b> Its adaptations {{associate}} neuroanatomy {{at different levels of}} the visual system with ecological and behavioural correlates and demonstrate that the visual system of this fish has adapted for simultaneous vision in air and water. The visual field is divided into three distinct areas: for viewing into the water column, into air, and for viewing the aquatic reflection from the underside of the water surface. Cone diameters in different retinal areas correlate with the differing physical constraints in the respective visual field. Retinal differentiation between the aquatic and aerial views is paralleled at different levels of the central nervous system. A diencephalic nucleus receives both direct and indirect (tectal) afferent input from only the aerial visual system and a specific type of cell in the optic tectum is preferentially distributed in the tectum processing aerial inputs. Distinctions within a single sensory system suggest that some behaviours may be organized according to visual field.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between genotypic and phenotypic divergence over evolutionary time varies widely, and cases of rapid phenotypic differentiation despite genetic similarity have attracted much attention. Here, we report an extreme {{case of the}} reverse pattern—morphological stasis in a tropical fish despite massive genetic divergence. We studied the enigmatic African freshwater butterfly fish (Pantodon buchholzi), whose distinctive morphology earns it recognition as a monotypic family. We sequenced the mitochondrial genome of Pantodon from the Congo basin and nine other osteoglossomorph taxa for comparison with previous mitogenomic profiles of Pantodon from the Niger basin and other related taxa. Pantodon populations form a monophyletic group, yet their mitochondrial coding sequences differ by 15. 2 per cent between the Niger and Congo basins. The mitogenomic divergence time between these populations {{is estimated to be}} greater than 50 Myr, and deep genetic divergence was confirmed by nuclear sequence data. Among six sister-group comparisons of osteoglossomorphs, Pantodon exhibits the slowest rate of morphological divergence despite a level of genetic differentiation comparable to both species-rich (e. g.
