5|$|In the 1995 {{compilation}} Children and the Politics of Culture, anthropologist Vivienne Wee {{analyzed the}} perception of children by adults and how it supported the concept of children's rights. Wee wrote that in this model (which she called the European pattern), children were seen as defenseless, unadulterated, {{and in need of}} protection by authoritative adults. According to Wee, this European pattern led to the idea that children required the sanctuary of the United Nations Charter and the Convention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child.|$|E
5|$|The {{database}} {{would hold}} information on about 11 million children in England. Records {{would be kept}} until six years after the child turns 18, or if they leave England and Wales with no intention of returning. The database could also apply to 18- to 25-year-olds who were care leavers or had learning disabilities (although the United Nations Convention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child only applies to those under 18 in England and Wales), and their permission was needed.|$|E

5|$|The long {{sentences}} of the Gun Court and its restrictions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused have {{given rise to}} constitutional challenges, some of which have been appealed to the Privy Council in London. These cases have resulted in some modifications to the court, but have upheld it on the whole. The Gun Court system has also been the target of criticism because of its lengthy delay in hearing cases, and the continuing rise in gun violence since its adoption.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights in}} Madagascar are {{protected}} {{under the constitution}} and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child. Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law. Freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law, although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations. Torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military and police officers remain problems. Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.|$|E
5|$|Richard's time as {{archbishop}} {{was much}} less stormy than Becket's had been, {{and he seems to}} have had better relations with the king. Richard attended the royal councils, and more than once was with the king in Normandy. Richard was less dogmatic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clergy than his great predecessor had been; but his compromises were regarded by the monastic writers and the followers of Becket as a sign of weakness. Pope Alexander III took Richard to task when Richard acquiesced in the election of bishops taking place in the royal chapel. As part of his diplomatic efforts on the king's behalf, Richard escorted Henry's daughter Joan to Provence on her journey in 1176 to marry King William II of Sicily. Richard also spent part of 1177 in Flanders on diplomatic business for King Henry.|$|E

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), also founded in 1945, promotes agricultural development and food security. UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund) was created in 1946 to aid European children after the Second World War and expanded its mission to provide aid around the world and to uphold the Convention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child.|$|E
