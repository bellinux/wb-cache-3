5|$|It is {{probable}} that the planet is composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet orbits on the same plane as Kepler-9b, a second and larger gas giant located in the Kepler-9 system. While observing the planet, the Kepler team noticed that Kepler-9b and c orbited in a 1:2 ratio, where Kepler-9b orbits its star every 19 days and Kepler-9c orbits every 38 days. The gravitational pull that each planet has on the other, known as orbital resonance, keeps the planets in a stable orbit. This phenomenon {{is the first of}} its kind seen outside the Solar System. Every time Kepler-9c completed an orbit during the <b>observation</b> <b>period,</b> its orbital period decreased by about 39 minutes. At some point, however, this trend will reverse and its orbit will increase. The lengths of its orbit will oscillate slightly above and below the 2:1 ratio.|$|E

25|$|A 2005 {{mortality}} {{study of}} creosote workers {{found no evidence}} supporting {{an increased risk of}} cancer death, as a result of exposure to creosote. Based on the findings of the largest mortality study to date of workers employed in creosote wood treating plants, {{there is no evidence that}} employment at creosote wood-treating plants or exposure to creosote-based preservatives was associated with any significant mortality increase from either site-specific cancers or non-malignant diseases. The study consisted of 2,179 employees at eleven plants in the United States where wood was treated with creosote preservatives. Some workers began work in the 1940s to 1950s. The <b>observation</b> <b>period</b> of the study covered 1979- 2001. The average length of employment was 12.5 years. One third of the study subjects were employed for over 15 years.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to this main finding, our study differs in several respects to investigations that have demonstrated poor stability with long-term lithium treatment. Many of the previous prospective studies on lithium treatment have had relatively short <b>observation</b> <b>periods</b> (i.e., less than 2 years in duration). Indeed, only a few have had longer <b>observation</b> <b>periods,</b> i.e., extending up to 5 years (Maj et al. 1989 b; Maj et al. 1998; Maj 2003) or 7 years (Vestergaard and Schou 1988). In the present study, however, data were collected over a much longer period, covering up to 20 years.|$|R
40|$|In 1994 bovine {{tuberculosis}} (Mycobacterium bovis) {{was discovered in}} a single free ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in northeastern Michigan (Deer Management Unit 452 @MU 452)). By {{the end of the}} 2000 hunting season, 325 + deer within the DMU 452 had been detected with M. bovis and it was generally believed that the disease had radiated from a single focus of infection. However, the presence of three TB positive deer discovered in 1999 well outside of DMU 452 suggested that M. bovis may be endemic at extremely low levels in Michigan white-tailed deer. The primary mode of deer-to-deer transmission of M. bovis is likely from snout-to- snout (face-to-face) contact and aerosol exposure at feeding and baiting stations. Feeding behavior of white-tailed deer at fall bait and winter feeding stations was observed during 936 <b>observation</b> <b>periods.</b> Throughout two winters (1996 / 1997 and 1997 / 1998) of <b>observation</b> <b>periods</b> (355 hours) we recorded over 5, 900 face-to-face (F 2 F) contacts.

40|$|We analyse the {{relationships}} between return calculation methods, risk and <b>observation</b> <b>periods.</b> We show that the mean of a return set calculated using logarithmic returns {{is less than the}} mean calculated using simple returns by an amount related to the variance of the set. This implies {{that there is not a}} one-to-one relationship between mean logarithmic and mean simple returns and also that risk and return calculations are not independent as the measure of risk is part of the measure of return. Finally we draw on examples from the extant literature. to illustrate that these effects can be very important particularly when dealing with short <b>observation</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{distributions}} {{shown in}} Figure  5 are non-Gaussian {{in that they}} have asymmetric lobes. However, we found that they were well described using a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution (Jenkinson 1955), which is a statistical distribution of the maximum values of random samples from an arbitrary probability density function. The blue curves in Figure  5 represent GEV fits to the CCmax distributions using the L-moment method (Hosking 1990). The CCmax threshold can then be determined as the p-th percentile of the fitted GEV distribution, which represents the value of CCmax for which the cumulative frequency becomes p%. The p value can be chosen {{in accordance with the}} study objectives.The different <b>observation</b> <b>periods</b> (Figure  1 b) must also be taken into consideration. Site effects are thought to be different among <b>observation</b> <b>periods,</b> even if the locations are almost the same, because different conditions exist for the mechanical coupling between the OBS and the seafloor each time an OBS is deployed. To account for this, we determined the thresholds for all combinations of <b>observation</b> <b>periods</b> in the manner described above (Figures  4 d,h and 5 d,h).|$|R

Also known to produce false results due to residual alcohol in the mouth is passionate kissing with an intoxicated person. Recent use of mouthwash or breath fresheners can skew results upward as they can contain fairly high levels of alcohol.|$|E
2500|$|The {{elevated}} {{incidence of}} breast cancer in women {{has been associated with}} prolonged exposure to high levels of estrogens. [...] Xenoestrogens, such as BPA have the capacity to perturb normal hormonal actions. [...] This study provides evidence of the estrogenic effects of BPA. [...] In this study the human breast epithelial cells MCF-10F were treated with 10-3 M, 10-4 M, 10-5 M and 10-6 M BPA continuously for two weeks. [...] The cells treated with 10-3 M BPA died {{on the second day of}} treatment. [...] The concentration of 10-4 M BPA was also toxic for the breast epithelial cells, and they died on the fourth day of treatment. [...] This data indicated that these concentrations of BPA are toxic for MCF-10F cells. [...] After the two-week <b>observation</b> <b>period</b> it was seen that the cells formed a high percentage of duct like structures in collagen. [...] MCF-10F cells treated with 10-5 M and 10-6 M BPA formed a high percentage of solid masses, 27% and 20% respectively. [...] This data indicates that BPA is able to induce neoplastic transformation of human breast epithelial cells. [...] Epigenetic changes are involved in the early stages of cancer initiation by altering ductulogenesis. [...] BPA was able to induce transformation of human breast MCF-10F epithelial cells. [...] After treatment with BPA, the cells produced fewer collagen tubules and more solid masses.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} temporal {{aspects of}} binocular slant perception {{in the presence}} and absence of a visual reference. Subjects judge slant induced by large-field stereograms of which one half-image is either horizontally scaled or sheared relative to the other half-image. Each stimulus is presented for different <b>observation</b> <b>periods</b> ranging from 0. 1 to 19. 2 sec. We quantitatively corroborate earlier findings that perceived slant develops significantly faster and to higher levels with visual reference than without it. In daily life, when we are active, {{there will not be}} much time for slant to develop. We find that if <b>observation</b> <b>periods</b> are brief (a few seconds or less) slant is poorly perceived if there is no visual reference.

40|$|The studies descnbed in {{this thesis}} were aimed to extend our {{understanding}} of the mode of action of β-adrenoceptor blocking agents in essential hypertension. For this purpose the literature, concerning the acute and chronic effects of 10 different β- adrenoceptor blocking agents, on haemodynamics, plasma catecholamines, and active renin, was extensively reviewed.
