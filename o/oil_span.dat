40|$|The present {{investigation}} aims to evaluate an isotropic and thermodynamically stable nanoemulsion formulation for transdermal delivery of glycyrrhizin (GZ), with minimum surfactant and cosurfactant (Smix) concentrations that could improve its solubility, permeation enhancement, and stability. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were developed and various nanoemulsion formulations were prepared using soyabean oil as <b>oil,</b> <b>Span</b> 80, Brij 35 as a surfactant and isopropyl alcohol as a cosurfactant. Nanoemulsion formulations that passed the thermodynamic stability tests were characterized for pH, viscosity and droplet size using a transmission electron microscopy. The transdermal ability of glycyrrhizin through human cadaver skin was determined using Franz diffusion cells. The in vitro skin permeation {{profile of the}} optimized nanoemulsion formulation (NE 2) was {{compared to that of}} conventional gel. A significant increase in permeability parameters such as steady-state flux (Jss) and permeability coefficient (Kp) was observed in the optimized nanoemulsion formulation (NE 2), which consisted of 1 % wt/wt of mono ammonium glycyrrhizinate (MAG), 32. 4 % Span 80, 3. 7 % Brij 35, 10 % isopropyl alcohol, 46. 5 % soyabean oil and 6. 4 % distilled water. No obvious skin irritation was observed for the studied nanoemulsion formulation (NE 2) or the gel. The results indicated that nanoemulsions are promising vehicles for transdermal delivery of glycyrrhizin through human cadaver skin, without the use of additional permeation enhancers, because excipients of nanoemulsions act as permeation enhancers themselves...|$|E

The focus of these experiments was to analyze the accuracy of chord length distribution (CLD) measured by focus beam reflectance measurement (FBRM technology) {{in comparison with the}} droplet size distribution (DSD) measured by a particle video microscope (PVM technology). A beaker ? batch test and a flow loop test were employed for a variety of <b>oils</b> <b>spanning</b> over an order of magnitudes in viscosity.

In the beaker test, The Sauter mean diameter d 32 was found to be proportional to the maximum (99 th percentile) droplet size for both oil-water emulsions and water-oil emulsions. Since the CLD values were underestimating the size in comparison with DSD values, an empirical correlation was developed based on a log-normal distribution to improve the predictive power of the CLD. The dynamic properties of both FBRM and PVM probes were evaluated in beaker tests and flow loop tests. The beaker tests were found to be a reliable and reasonable alternative to flow loop tests. The simplicity of both testing and data collection, combined with the reduced effect of distance between the probes, allow the beaker tests to provide a good estimate of the uncertainty of the FBRM measurement for the water-oil flow in the pipe. </p...|$|R

40|$|Curling {{deformation}} of thin elastic sheets appears in numerous structures in nature, such as membranes of red blood cells, epithelial tissues or green algae colonies to cite {{just a few}} examples. However, despite its ubiquity, the dynamics of curling propagation in a naturally curved material remains still poorly investigated. Here, we present a coupled experimental and theoretical study of the dynamical curling {{deformation of}} naturally curved ribbons. Using thermoplastic and metallic ribbons molded on cylinders of different radii, we tune separately the natural curvature and the geometry to study curling dynamics in air, water and in viscous <b>oils,</b> thus <b>spanning</b> {{a wide range of}} Reynolds numbers. Our theoretical and experimental approaches separate the role of elasticity, gravity and hydrodynamic dissipation from inertia and emphasize the fundamental differences between the curling of a naturally curved ribbon and a rod described by the classical Elastica. Ribbons are indeed an intermediate class of objects between rods, which can be totally described by one-dimensional deformations, and sheets. Since Lord Rayleigh, it is known that a thin sheet can easily be bent but not stretched. As a result, large deformations in thin sheets usually lead to the localization of deformations into small peaks and ridges as observed by crumpling a simple piece of paper. These elastic defects induce critical buckling situations studied in detail statically in the literature, while experimental and theoretical studies on their dynamics are scarce. Our work shows evidence for the propagation of such a single instability front, selected by a local buckling mechanism. Finally, we show that depending on gravity, and both the Reynolds and the Cauchy numbers, the curling speed and shape are modified by the large scale drag and the local lubrication forces, shedding a new light on microscopic experiences where curling is observed...|$|R

Methods: SEDDSs based on soybean <b>oil,</b> Tween 80, <b>Span</b> 80 and ibuprofen were prepared and their equilibrium phase diagrams established. The emulsification behaviour in a range of media was studied using polarised light microscopy and particle sizing. The behaviour of the SEDDSs in the DGM and conventional testing equipment was assessed. Results: A range of liquid crystalline mesophases was observed, enhanced in the presence of the drug. Polarised light microscopy showed different emulsification processes in the presence and absence of the drug, which was also manifest in different droplet sizes. The droplet size distribution varied between the DGM and the USP II dissolution apparatus. Conclusions: The model SEDDS displays complex liquid crystalline behaviour which may be intimately involved in the emulsification process, which in turn may alter particle size on emulsification, although there remains a question as to the in vivo significance of this effect.

Signal analysis of the gamma densitometer data revealed the presence of quasi-periodic waveforms in the time-varying multiphase flow densities and discriminatory correlations between statistical features of the gamma count data and key multiphase flow parameters. The {{development of}} a mechanistic approach to infer the multiphase flow rates from the gamma attenuation information was investigated. A model for the determination of the individual phase flow rates was proposed based on the gamma attenuation levels; while quasi-periodic waveforms identified in the multiphase fluid density were observed to exhibit a strong correlation with the gas and liquid superficial phase velocity parameters at fixed water cuts. Analysis of the use of pattern recognition techniques to correlate the gamma densitometer data with the individual phase superficial velocities and the water cut was undertaken. Two neural network models were developed for comparison: a single multilayer-perceptron and a multilayer hierarchical flow regime dependent model. The pattern recognition systems were trained to map the temporal fluctuations in the multiphase mixture density with the individual phase flow rates using statistical features extracted from the gamma count signals as their inputs. Initial results yielded individual phase flow rate predictions to within ± 10 % based on flow regime specific correlations...|$|R

A wicked problem is difficult to resolve, complex, and solving one aspect of a problem may create other problems. Wicked problems are shaped by invisible forces and flows. Landscape architects are uniquely poised to address wicked problems with their skills and capacity to think across systems and scales in spatio-temporal, ecological, and cultural dimensions. Landscape architects also communicate through visually-accessible methods which tell a story. Storytelling in landscape architecture seeks to reveal, connect, and tie together relationships and processes of the past and present to inform future possibilities of a place. Methods of storytelling can be used to address wicked problems because of their utility in inquiry and ideation. Developed through an original methodology using maps, diagrams, photomontage, and photographs, this project creates a storytelling framework which iteratively uses inquiry and representation to identify dilemmas, pose questions, and address issues as a means to reveal the impacts of forces on a wicked problem. The site selected to test this proposed methodology is the Athabasca oil sands in northern Alberta, Canada. Visible from space, the potential minable area of the <b>oil</b> sands <b>spans</b> {{an area the size of}} New York State. The world’s quest for oil has placed this landscape and its people on center stage. Billions of dollars’ worth of industry investment has put the landscape and people under siege through ever-shifting visible and invisible forces and flows. Dilemmas created by the region’s mining industry not only directly impact local people and landscape, but the greater world as well. Hampered with environmental, social, political, and economic issues, the future of this region is largely unknown, as there are few formal plans and regulations to ensure landscape reclamation and guide urban development. To tell the story of the oil sands, four themes—oil, infrastructure, environment, and people were analyzed. These themes—referred to as "ghost ecologies" because of their inconspicuous nature—when considered together, reveal key regional dilemmas and highlight new opportunities for future directions. Analysis inspired thinking toward future scenarios that imagine a series of new, highly productive and programmatically-integrated futures for the oil sands and its people. The unique process of inquiry and discovery led to a final project framework that identified methods for landscape architects to use in addressing wicked problems. A variety of audiences can consume this work to address the challenges of the Athabasca oil sands and other wicked problems in the world. To the public, the work serves as an evocative display of critical dilemmas worthy of future consideration. For professional and student landscape architects, the work reveals methods of inquiry to address wicked problems through the discipline...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{coalescence}} or {{fusion of}} fat globules {{is a common}} form of destabilisation in food-related partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions that generally causes thickening of the emulsion, reduced functionality and phase separation. Partial coalescence is particularly exacerbated by shear, temperature fluctuations and air incorporation. Each of which the food product may be exposed to during manufacture, storage, transport or end use leading most often to deleterious effects. One notable example of partial coalescence being desirable is during the manufacture of ice cream. In order {{to better understand the}} factors affecting partial coalescence and their interactions, a systematic series of studies was undertaken on the shear stability of a model food-related partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsion. Shear-induced aggregation of 35 wt% partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions was studied under conditions causing jamming of partially coalesced fat globule aggregates formed under steady shear. Emulsions with different interfacial compositions and solid fat content (~ 25 – 90 %) were studied to probe their effect on the generation of a jamming transition over a range of shear rates (500 – 2000 s- 1). By displacing adsorbed sodium caseinate from the oil-water interface using Tween 20, partial coalescence sensitive emulsions were prepared with either mixed sodium caseinate-Tween 20 or Tween 20 dominated interfacial film compositions using 0. 5 or 1. 5 wt% Tween 20 respectively. Quiescently, the emulsions were stable with 0. 5 wt% Tween 20 regardless of solid fat content. At 1. 5 wt% or above, stability decreased with increasing solid fat content and Tween concentration. Under shear, partial displacement of adsorbed sodium caseinate by Tween 20 generally resulted in the formation of relatively stable aggregates whereas high displacement of protein {{led to the formation of}} less stable aggregates under shear. The aggregation time of emulsions with Tween 20 dominated interfaces decreased with increasing solid fat content whereas for mixed sodium caseinate-Tween 20 emulsions it increased with increasing solid fat content. The extent of fat globule aggregation at low solid fat content was relatively low irrespective of Tween concentration, whereas at high solid fat content, the extent of aggregation varied considerably when interfacial composition was altered. Cryo-TEM micrographs of the fat globules revealed a relatively smooth surface regardless of composition indicating that fat crystal protrusion was not a major factor affecting the stability. These findings showed that interfacial protein functions both to regulate the formation of partially crystalline aggregates as well as the aggregate stability under shear. Furthermore, high solid fat content emulsions although low in liquid oil content were shown to be highly susceptible to partial coalescence when the adsorbed protein load was low. The effect of polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters (Tween) alone or in combination with sorbitan fatty acid esters (SPAN) on the shear stability of partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions (35 wt% fat) was studied. Low molecular weight emulsifiers like Tweens and SPANS are often used to regulate the susceptibility of partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions to aggregation and partial coalescence. It was found that emulsion stability increased with increasing chain length of the saturated Tween emulsifiers, while unsaturated Tween 80 was comparatively much more unstable than the saturated types of Tween. The effect of 1 wt% SPAN (SPAN 20, 40, 60 and 80) in the dispersed phase of emulsions containing different concentrations of Tween 80 (0. 2 – 0. 6 wt%) was also investigated. The emulsions showed sharp stability transitions from stable to unstable over the range of Tween 80 concentrations tested. All SPAN containing emulsions with 0. 2 wt% Tween 80 were stable under shear however all emulsions with 0. 6 wt% Tween 80 immediately aggregated when shear was applied. At 0. 4 wt% Tween 80, the saturated long fatty acid chain length emulsifiers (SPAN 40 and 60) were in general much more stable compared to SPAN 20 and 80 containing emulsions. This study indicated that <b>oil</b> soluble <b>SPAN</b> emulsifiers with low and high melting points were similarly poor at preventing partial coalescence. Therefore, phase transitions were likely not a major contributing factor to emulsion stability. Finally, the effects of Tween 20, 40, 60 and 80 on the stability of partially crystalline oil-in-water emulsions prepared with and without 1 wt% sodium caseinate were studied. Generally, 1 wt% sodium caseinate emulsions with the unsaturated emulsifier Tween 80 were the most unstable followed by the saturated emulsifiers Tween 20, 40 and 60 in order of increasing fatty acid chain length. Long chain saturated Tween emulsifiers (Tween 40 and 60) improved emulsion stability regardless of whether sodium caseinate was present indicating that alone these emulsifiers form more robust interfacial films compared to the shorter chain length Tween 20 and the unsaturated Tween 80. The Tween type dependent effect on supercooling and fat crystallization caused by interfacial heterogeneous nucleation was also studied using pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance. With sodium caseinate, the degree of supercooling decreased and the crystallization rate diminished with increasing saturated fatty acid chain length but only negligible changes were found without sodium caseinate. These findings indicate that long chain saturated Tweens improve emulsion stability by forming robust interfaces but with sodium caseinate also improve stability through interfacial heterogeneous nucleation. These novel findings provide guidance on how combinations of proteins and emulsifiers can be used to modify and control the stability of partially crystalline oil-inwater emulsions through their combined effects on fat crystallization and interfacial film properties...|$|R
