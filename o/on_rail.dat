5|$|In the 2016 Honolulu mayoral {{elections}} {{the main}} three candidates again took opposing views <b>on</b> <b>rail.</b> Charles Djou, former mayor Peter Carlisle, and incumbent Kirk Caldwell all ran for mayor with the stated goal of finishing rail. However, Republican Djou ran on drastically cutting spending <b>on</b> <b>rail</b> by cutting funding on buying {{cars on the}} rail before its completion, and hiring mainland consultants. Kirk Caldwell also stated that spending <b>on</b> <b>rail</b> should be cut, but instead by shortening the rail to end at Middle Street. Carlisle was the only candidate in full support of funding the rail system and stated that rail {{has gone too far}} to be stopped. Kirk Caldwell won the election, and promptly went on to adopt Carlisle's position that rail should be completed.|$|E
5|$|An early plan {{conceived}} by British Rail {{in the early}} 1970s for a route passing through Tonbridge met considerable opposition on environmental and social grounds, especially from the Leigh Action Group and Surrey & Kent Action <b>on</b> <b>Rail</b> (SKAR). A committee {{was set up to}} examine the proposal under Sir Alexander Cairncross; but in due course environment minister Anthony Crosland announced that the project had been cancelled, together with the plan for the tunnel itself.|$|E
5|$|On 10October1945, {{the brigade}} {{arrived at the}} port of Haifa, and after {{disembarking}} moved to Gaza. After a short period of acclimatisation, the 6th Airlanding Brigade was deployed in the Samaria region, with the brigade headquarters at Lydda airfield. At the same time, the 6th Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, based at Tulkarm, came under the brigade's command. The first incident in the brigade area was on 31 October, when parties of armed Jews planted explosives <b>on</b> <b>rail</b> lines, which killed four and wounded eight when they exploded. Following attacks on coastguard stations, believed to be by members of the Palmach, over the night of 24/25November, the brigade carried out two operations to search settlements for those responsible. On 29March1946 the brigade was relocated to Jerusalem in preparation for leaving the division. On 3April the 1st Parachute Brigade, which had been assigned to the division, arrived in Palestine. Their arrival made the glider formation surplus to requirements, so on 15April the brigade was renumbered 31st Independent Infantry Brigade, and was no longer part of the British airborne forces.|$|E

5|$|The prime rail statute in Victoria is the Transport Integration Act. The Act {{establishes}} the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure as the integration agency for Victoria's transport system. The Act also establishes {{and sets the}} charters of the State agencies charged with providing public transport rail services and managing network access for freight services, namely the Director of Public Transport and V/Line. In addition, the Act creates VicTrack which owns the public rail network and associated infrastructure. Another important statute is the Rail Management Act 1996 which confers powers <b>on</b> <b>rail</b> operators and provides for a rail access scheme for the State's rail network. As a result of recent changes to the Transport Integration Act, {{the responsibilities of the}} Director of Public Transport are being progressively assumed by the new Public Transport Development Authority, a major initiative of the Bailieu Government.|$|E
5|$|The {{project is}} a {{continuation}} of the Norwegian National Rail Administration's plan to build four tracks along the three main corridors out of Oslo; the Gardermoen Line was completed in 1998, and the Asker Line has been completed in 2011. Between 1989 and 1996, the Østfold Line south of Ski to Moss was upgraded to double track and higher speeds. To take full advantage of this and allow the rest of the Østfold Line to be upgraded for high speeds, it is necessary to increase capacity through the bottleneck from Oslo to Ski. The first plans for the Follo Line were launched in 1995, and also included an intermediate station at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The new line is predicted to increase rush hour rail ridership 63%, and increased freight <b>on</b> <b>rail</b> would remove 750 trucks daily from European Route E18.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} {{sparked a}} major public discussion on station safety and security, mainly because the station was unstaffed when the suspects mugged Ali on the platform. The only security present was CCTV cameras, and the ticket barriers were left open allowing the suspects to enter the station freely. Many high-profile politicians spoke {{on the issue of}} station safety and called <b>on</b> <b>rail</b> companies to provide security or staff the station until the last train had left the station. The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone assailed Silverlink, the train company who managed the station, for not providing all-night staffing or security. The new provider of every franchise across the rail network will have to provide staff at all times the station is open.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} mobilization, the Life Guards arrived at their {{assigned}} position near the Belgian border. Strachwitz and his platoon volunteered for a mounted, long-distance reconnaissance patrol, which would penetrate far behind Belgian lines. His orders were to gather intelligence <b>on</b> <b>rail</b> and communications connections and potentially disturb them, {{as well as}} report on the war preparations being made by their opponents. If the situation allowed, he was to destroy railway and telephone connections and to derail trains, causing as much havoc as possible. His patrol ran into many obstacles and they were constantly {{on the verge of}} being detected by either British or French forces. Their objective was the Paris–Limoges–Bordeaux train track. Strachwitz dispatched a messenger, who broke through to the German lines and delivered the intelligence they had gathered. The patrol blew up the signal box at the Fontainebleau railway station, and tried to force their way through to presumed German troops at the Marne near Châlons. However, the French forces were too strong and they were unable to get through. After six weeks behind the lines their rations were depleted and they had to resort to stealing or begging. Strachwitz then decided to head for Switzerland, hoping that the French–Swiss border was not as heavily protected. After a brief skirmish with French forces, one of Strachwitz's men was seriously wounded, which forced them to seek medical attention. During many weeks of outdoor living their uniforms had deteriorated, so Strachwitz took that opportunity to buy new clothes for his men. Their progress was slowed by the wounded man, and the group was caught in civilian clothes by French forces.|$|E

Velika zajednica Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> programera te mnogo predočenih riješenih problema na internetu uvelike olakšavaju rješavanje bilo kakvih problema pri razvoju aplikacije.

The large programming community gathered around Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> has already dealt with numerous development issues, which greatly eases correcting any errors while developing the application. Using The Movie DB's database through their API is smooth and straightforward due to the examples found in the Git repository of The Movie DB’s gem package. The effectiveness of the Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> framework is illustrated by its utilization in this thesis. Due to the easier installation of the Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> framework, and the framework's initial predisposition towards Unix-based operating systems, this application has been developed using Ubuntu 17. 04., distribution of the Linux operating system...|$|R
