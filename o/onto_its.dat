5|$|NY86 was {{established}} in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, largely replacing a realigned NY3.

5|$|A {{second group}} of {{students}} headed for central London, waving effigies of the brown dog, joined by a police escort and, briefly, a busker with bagpipes. As the marchers reached Trafalgar Square, they were 1,000 strong, facing 400 police officers, 15 of them on horseback. The students gathered around Nelson's Column, where the ringleaders climbed <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> base to make speeches.|$|E
5|$|December 18, 1990: A Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago {{and became}} entrenched in a driving {{snowstorm}} on I-80. Just {{short of the}} Wyoming border, the bus {{was hit by a}} semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading the opposite direction. The force of the collision tipped the bus <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> right side and steered it down a steep embankment. The bus slid for 150 feet and came to rest against a fence, about 35 feet below the eastbound lanes of I-80. 7 passengers were killed and more than 40 injured.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 7 was legislated <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> current alignment, with the {{northern}} terminus moved to the Nutley/Clifton border. The route was also realigned to head south on Washington Avenue between the Newark border and Rutgers Street in Belleville on what was Route 11N, a remnant of Pre-1927 Route 11, making Route 7 discontinuous. County Route 506 used to follow the southern portion of Route 7 but has been truncated to the intersection with Routes 7 and 21 in Belleville.|$|E

5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> legs and feet.

Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E
5|$|NY12D was {{originally}} assigned {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to most of what is now NY12 between Boonville and Lowville. The alignments of both routes between the two locations were swapped , placing NY12D on its current alignment from Boonville to Potters Corners (in the Town of West Turin) and on NY26 between Potters Corners and Lowville. The overlap between NY12D and NY26 remained in place until the 1970s when NY12D was realigned <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> current routing between Potters Corners and Lyons Falls, replacing then-New York State Route337.|$|E
5|$|NY205 {{originally}} {{began at}} NY23 northwest of Oneonta {{when it was}} assigned {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The route originally followed local, substandard roads surrounding Otego Creek; however, it was gradually moved <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> modern alignment {{over the course of the}} 1930s. It was officially extended southward from West Oneonta to connect to I-88 in 1970; however, it was not extended southward in reality until the mid-1970s. The extension created a short overlap with NY23 west of the city.|$|E

5|$|One {{beneficial}} effect of Hurricane Dennis was the rolling {{of the former}} USS Spiegel Grove. Spiegel Grove was sunk in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary {{in an attempt to}} create an artificial reef. However, the ship turned over and landed on the bottom upside down. Efforts to roll the ship were partially successful, bringing it <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> starboard side, but Hurricane Dennis completed the roll, bringing Spiegel Grove into its intended upright position.|$|E
5|$|The {{legends of}} self-wounding and the {{provision}} of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> chest in order to fully empty the pouch. Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the Dalmatian pelican has a blood-red pouch in the early breeding season and this {{may have contributed to the}} myth.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} realignment that occurred {{at this time}} was in the North Country, where NY3 was shifted <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> current alignment between Watertown and Plattsburgh. From Tupper Lake east to Plattsburgh, most of what became NY3 was previously part of NY10. The NY10 designation remained in place from Tupper Lake east to Upper Saranac Lake, forming an overlap with NY3; however, it was completely replaced by NY3 from Saranac Lake east. Between Upper Saranac Lake and Saranac Lake, the routing of NY3 was previously unnumbered, as was the routing from Watertown to Tupper Lake.|$|E
5|$|The mythological kelpie {{is usually}} {{described}} as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools of rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters, One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the nykur of Iceland. An Aberdeenshire variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the River Spey was white and could entice victims <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> back by singing.|$|E
5|$|US-62 was realigned for a {{third time}} on September 4, 1961. This routing was only meant to be temporary, {{following}} Agnew, Exchange, and Reno Avenues to downtown. This change was followed up by the September 4, 1963 rerouting, which put US-62 <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> present-day routing (though I-240 did not exist yet, and I-44 still ended at I-35).|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's reddish color {{is thought to}} be due to deposits of tholins on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can condense <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{before the start of the}} {{services}} to Paddington the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B) had opened, on 14 June 1841, its trains reversing in and out of the GWR station. The third railway at Temple Meads was the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, which opened on 8 July 1844 and was taken over by the Midland Railway (MR) on 1 July 1845. This used the GWR platforms, diverging <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> own line on the far side of the bridge over the Floating Harbour. Both these new railways were engineered by Brunel and were initially broad gauge. Brunel also designed the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, but this was not opened until 25 August 1863, nearly four years after his death. It terminated at Temple Meads.|$|E
5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting {{its skin}} from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths {{to protect it}} from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust <b>onto</b> <b>its</b> body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E
