One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{he did to}} give a helping hand to his home town was to {{convince}} RCA to open a record-pressing plant there.

Sober again, they leave Pamplona; Bill returns to Paris, Mike stays in Bayonne, and Jake goes to San Sebastián on the northern coast of Spain. As Jake is about to return to Paris, he receives a telegram from Brett asking for help; she had gone to Madrid with Romero. He finds her there in a cheap hotel, without money, and without Romero. She announces she has decided to go back to Mike. The novel ends with Jake and Brett in a taxi speaking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that might have been.|$|E
5|$|Coker {{grew up in}} Linden, New Jersey {{and became}} an Eagle Scout in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth's Catholic Church in Linden on January 27, 1959.

50|$|He {{concludes that}} though people can {{contemplate}} <b>the</b> same <b>thing,</b> we cannot contemplate 'the intuitive apprehension' of another. This connotes <b>the</b> Sartrean idea <b>of</b> becoming apprehensive about the awareness {{that we are}} to be responsible for our own doings, and also that we can be conscious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> like another consciousness is conscious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> but we cannot reflect on their being conscious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> like we can reflect on our being conscious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> In this way we are still only condemned to making ourselves as we battle with our own consciousness, and so we don’t create the world, we are objects in the world.|$|R

5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} interests {{also included}} armour. In 1834 he published A Catalogue of the Collection of Ancient Arms and Armour, {{the property of}} Bernard Brocas, with a prefatory notice. In 1857 Planché was invited to arrange the collection of armour formerly belonging to his friend Sir Samuel Meyrick for the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, a task which he repeated in South Kensington in 1868. Concerned {{by the state of}} the armour in the Tower of London, Planché wrote several reports on the subject between 1855 and 1869. In that year, the War Office invited him to rearrange the collection in chronological order, which was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> for which he had been campaigning.|$|E
5|$|Nigel and Vanessa Lawson {{divorced}} in 1980, when Nigella was 20. They both remarried: her father that {{year to a}} House of Commons researcher, Therese Maclear (to whom he was married until 2008), and her mother, in the early 1980s, to philosopher A. J. Ayer (they remained married until her mother's death). As her father {{was at the time}} a prominent political figure, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> Nigella found frustrating were the judgements and pre-conceptions about her. In the mid 1990s, he decided to lose weight for medical reasons, and subsequently wrote the best-selling The Nigel Lawson Diet Book. Nigella has attributed her unhappiness as a child, in part, to the problematic relationship she had with her mother.|$|E

40|$|Text in AfrikaansTheft in South African law is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{well-known}} common law crimes. It {{is also one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crimes in respect of which opinions vary considerably. Furtum possessionis is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manifestations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime <b>of</b> theft at common law. <b>The</b> general requirements <b>of</b> furtum possessionis were already established in Roman law. Emphasis was not placed on <b>the</b> taker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> but on <b>the</b> particular position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person who was deprived <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property. This approach was also followed in Roman-Dutch law. Fur tum possessionis in South African law {{can be defined as}} follows: It is the unlawful and intentional appropriation by the owner or someone else of a movable corporeal thing in commercio, in circumstances in which <b>the</b> possessor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> has a valid right <b>of</b> retention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> with <b>the</b> intention <b>of</b> depriving <b>the</b> possessor permanently <b>of</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> Theft in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> furtum possessionis differs in an important respect from theft in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> a <b>thing.</b> In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> removal <b>the</b> complainant can also be a person acting as a holder, that is someone exercising control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owner. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> furtum possessionis <b>the</b> complainant is the person with <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> retention and from whose possession <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> is taken away. The accused either possesses <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> as an owner or as a holder before possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> was transferred to the complainant. Mere possession is not enough. <b>The</b> possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complainant has to be accompanied by a right to retention.

5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that Spector {{wanted to}} achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, {{in order to create}} a better {{immersion}} and gameplay experience. He did not want the character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor Jay Anthony Franke to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.|$|E
5|$|Stefani {{first came}} {{face to face}} with {{designing}} clothes when she and her mother would sew clothes for themselves when she was young. Stefani comes from a long line of seamstresses, as even her great-grandmother would sew clothes. Stefani made most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> she wore onstage during concerts. When she became successful and began to tour constantly, she felt she lost her way. Then she met the stylist Andrea Lieberman. Lieberman introduced her to ready-to-wear clothing. Later Lieberman became her creative consultant and Zaldy Goco took over as the head designer. Goco later parted ways with L.A.M.B.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{we know about}} Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano {{or some combination of}} courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to clarify a {{distinction}} between two kinds of belief in Plato’s Theaetetus and the Sophist. In the Sophist, Plato distinguishes between phantasia, which occurs “through sense perception,” and doxa, which occurs “according to thinking. ” What distinguishes these two kinds <b>of</b> belief is <b>the</b> believer’s understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> belief is about, as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way in which each kind of belief is formed. A doxa is formed through a particular kind <b>of</b> thinking, and <b>the</b> person having it grasps <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> A phantasia, by contrast, is formed through sense perception, and the person having it grasps <b>the</b> mere appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Carlsen {{was born}} in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990, to Sigrun Øen, a {{chemical}} engineer and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant. The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum. Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age: at two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14. His father taught him to play chess {{at the age of}} 5, although he initially showed little interest in the game. He has three sisters, and in 2010 he stated that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E

He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E

5|$|The {{justification}} for the closure of Loring was that the Air Force had six more strategic bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department's Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E
5|$|Human Revolution {{was planned}} for {{consoles}} and Microsoft Windows systems, and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> Dugas insisted upon {{was that the}} PC version {{would not be a}} port of the console versions. With this in mind, the two versions needed to be as close as possible in gameplay feel. The full motion cutscenes were created collaboratively by Eidos Montréal, Square Enix's CGI department Visual Works, and Vancouver-based company Goldtooth Creative. Goldtooth created initial concepts based on the game, then the animation proper was handled by Visual Works. It was later stated that, despite knowing the necessity of incorporating multiple story-telling methods into the game, the team felt that the cutscene creation process was turned into a multi-studio effort due to time constraints. Time limits also forced them to drop real-time cutscenes. For the engine, the team used the Crystal Engine, developed by Crystal Dynamics and previously used in Tomb Raider Legend. It was intended {{to be part of a}} technology sharing policy that would further improve the engine for distribution in an enhanced form. Despite the initial intentions and an early tech demo going smoothly, the engine quickly proved to be inadequate to the team's needs as Eidos Montréal and Crystal Dynamics were pulling the engine's design in different directions. Eidos Montréal were given permission to branch away from the core engine so they could make the game work, adding new production tools that made it work in the new environment.|$|E
