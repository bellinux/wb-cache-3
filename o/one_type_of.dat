5|$|There {{are three}} types of {{coloured}} insect, and {{three types of}} pesticide, which will either kill, stun, or {{have no effect on}} the insects. The player can only carry <b>one</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> pesticide at a time; during {{the early stages of the}} game the lethal pesticide can be carried at all times, but later stages have more than <b>one</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> insect on screen at once, making the choice of pesticide more tactical.|$|E
5|$|Although the edibility of S.amygdalinus is {{not known}} with certainty, {{authorities}} often recommend to avoid consuming blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are poisonous. The species was implicated in one group of poisonings in California in 1996–97, {{but because of the}} nature of the symptoms experienced, there was probably more than <b>one</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> mushroom consumed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example <b>one</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E

5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called class {{switching}} that changes the <b>one</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region. This allows a single antibody {{to be used by}} different types of Fc receptors, expressed on different parts of the immune system.|$|E

Weather depiction plots show ceiling height (level where {{at least half the}} sky is covered with clouds) in hundreds of feet, present weather, and cloud cover. Icing maps depict areas where icing can be a hazard for flying. Aviation-related maps also show areas of turbulence.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{thallium}} {{is produced}} not from potassium ores, {{but as a}} byproduct from refining of heavy metal sulfide ores. Approximately 60–70% of thallium production {{is used in the}} electronics industry, and the remainder is used in the pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing. It is also used in infrared detectors. The radioisotope thallium-201 (as the soluble chloride TlCl) is used in small, nontoxic amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan, during <b>one</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> nuclear cardiac stress test.|$|E

50|$|Louie is also {{involved}} {{in the study and}} research of diversifying organometallic catalysts.  Usually, an organometallic catalyst is only used for <b>one</b> specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> reaction, but Louie has been working on the development of these organometallic catalysts as to make them able to catalyze more than <b>one</b> specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> reaction. This may be done by using the same catalyst, or by using one catalyst that can be slightly altered into making a catalyst that is useful for another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> reaction.|$|R
5|$|Common {{starlings}} are hosts to a {{wide range}} of parasites. A survey of three hundred common starlings from six US states found that all had at least <b>one</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> parasite; 99% had external fleas, mites or ticks, and 95% carried internal parasites, mostly various types of worm. Blood-sucking species leave their host when it dies, but other external parasites stay on the corpse. A bird with a deformed bill was heavily infested with Mallophaga lice, presumably due to its inability to remove vermin.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{versatile}} hunting dog, used {{for its ability}} to locate and retrieve game in harsh and adverse terrain and conditions. It is not specialised to any <b>one</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> terrain, and tends to score well in field trials. The Blue Picardy {{is considered to be a}} quiet breed, but requires a great deal of exercise as it has a high level of stamina. It loves to play, and is a responsive and obedient breed which thrives on human companionship. It is especially good with children.|$|E

A {{specimen of}} this type (now lost) was found at Dorestad, which was during Beonna's time an important trading centre: these coins resemble Frankish or Frisian deniers that were issued from the Maastricht area during this period.|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> inter-cellular {{communication}} by {{a molecular}} signal is called quorum sensing, which serves {{the purpose of}} determining {{whether there is a}} local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting digestive enzymes or emitting light.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> {{piezoelectric}} transducer is the Langevin type, {{named after a}} transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research. This is good for longitudinal modes of vibration. It {{can also be used}} on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just <b>one</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E

5|$|The campaign's {{ultimate}} limitation was {{the poor}} formulation of military strategy. The types of targets selected from one operation {{to the next}} differed radically and no sustained pressure was put on any <b>one</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> British target. The Luftwaffes strategy became increasingly aimless. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had begun.|$|E
5|$|The {{output of}} a SGD may be {{digitized}} and/or synthesized: digitized systems play directly recorded words or phrases while synthesized speech uses text-to-speech software that can carry less emotional information but permits {{the user to}} speak novel messages by typing new words.
