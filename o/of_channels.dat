5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> H, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G.

40|$|Channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, is {{a popular}} sportfish in North America, and is the third most-sought fish species in Nebraska. Exploitation rates <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> catfish populations have been {{estimated}} to be substantial in states neighboring Nebraska. Despite the popularity <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> catfish, {{little is known about}} the exploitation <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> catfish populations in Nebraska. The objectives of this study were to estimate the exploitation rates <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> catfish populations, identify the length bias <b>of</b> angling for <b>channel</b> catfish, and identify the self-imposed length limits for channel catfish at flood-control reservoirs of Nebraska. The software package Program Mark was used to analyze mark-recapture data for channel catfish captured with tandem-set hoop nets to estimate channel catfish population sizes at ten reservoirs during 2011 - 2012. Angler catch and harvest <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> catfish was estimated at eight reservoirs during 2011 - 2012 using data collected from angler interviews. Exploitation rates were estimated by dividing the number <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> catfish harvested by the number <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> catfish available in the population. Estimates of exploitation rate ranged from 0 % at three reservoirs to 73 % at one reservoir. Given the imprecision associated with the estimates <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> catfish population size and angler harvest <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> catfish, we suggest the investigation of other approaches to estimate exploitation rates <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> catfish populations in the future. Recreational angling was length biased, with angling selecting intermediate lengths <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> catfish regardless <b>of</b> harvest regulations or sizes <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> catfish available in the population. I determined self-imposed length limits for channel catfish by modeling probability of harvest <b>of</b> captured <b>channel</b> catfish based on length using a generalized linear mixed model. I determined that an interaction between whether an angler was angling from a boat or the bank and angling during the night or during the day was the most appropriate model for explaining self-imposed length limits for channel catfish. Self-imposed length limits for channel catfish ranged from 63 cm total length for anglers angling during the day from the bank to 90 cm total length for anglers angling during the night from a boat.

Schumn (1954) proposed the use of the reciprocal of drainage density for calculating the constant <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> maintenance, and the same method has been adopted for the present study. Regions of resistant rock type or with the surface of high permeability or with good forests cover should have a high constant <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> maintenance and a low drainage density. Similarly, regions of weak rock types or region with little or no vegetation and low soil infiltration and permeability should have low constant <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> maintenance and high drainage density. The constant <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> maintenance varies from 0.16 (watershed 32) to 0.75 (watershed 9). Lower values (less than 0.3) are found for watershed 12, 15, 26 and 32 (Table  3).

On the other hand, the constant <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> maintenance values are found to be higher (>[*] 0.5) for watersheds 6, 9, 10 and 23 which reflect the higher infiltration and permeability of the materials, fairly good vegetal cover and relatively resistant rock type.

Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number <b>of</b> <b>channels</b> in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E
