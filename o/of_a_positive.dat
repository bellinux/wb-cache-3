5|$|Exponentiating a {{real number}} {{to a complex}} power is {{formally}} a different operation from that for the corresponding complex number. However, in the common case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> real number the principal value is the same.|$|E
5|$|Although an RST cannot {{distinguish}} GAS infection from asymptomatic carriage of the organism, most authorities recommend antibiotic {{treatment in}} the event <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> RST result from {{a person with a}} sore throat.

5|$|In 2009, 86% of cadmium {{was used}} in batteries, {{predominantly}} in rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Nickel-cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2V.

5|$|Powers <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>{{positive}}</b> {{real number}} are always positive real numbers. The solution of x2=4, however, {{can be either}} 2 or −2. The principal value of 41/2 is 2, but −2 is also a valid square root. If the definition of exponentiation of real numbers is extended to allow negative results then the result is no longer well-behaved.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to the {{character}} varied, with some, including Spider-Man's creator, Stan Lee, approving the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> role model for non-white children, to displeasure at the replacement of Peter Parker, with some decrying it as a publicity stunt motivated by political correctness, a charge Alonso denied. Alexandra Petri of The Washington Post called for {{the character}} to be judged {{on the quality of}} its stories, which have garnered positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Warhol began {{producing}} {{his first}} canvases, which he based on comic strip subjects. In late 1961, {{he learned the}} process of silkscreening from Floriano Vecchi, who had run the Tiber Press since 1953. Though the process generally begins with a stencil drawing, it often evolves from a blown up photograph which is then transferred with glue onto silk. In either case, one needs to produce a glue-based version <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> two-dimensional image (positive means that open spaces are left where the paint will appear). Usually, the ink is rolled across the medium so that it passes through the silk and not the glue. Campbell's Soup cans were among Warhol's first silkscreen productions; the first were U.S. dollar bills. The pieces were made from stencils; one for each color. Warhol did not begin to convert photographs to silkscreens until after the original series of Campbell's Soup cans had been produced.|$|E
