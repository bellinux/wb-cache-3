5|$|Crime in Washington, D.C., is {{concentrated}} in areas associated with poverty, drug abuse, and gangs. A 2010 study found that 5% of city blocks accounted for over <b>one-quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> District's total crime. The more affluent neighborhoods of Northwest Washington are typically safe, but reports of violent crime increase in poorer neighborhoods generally concentrated in the eastern portion of the city. Approximately 60,000 residents are ex-convicts.|$|E

The 25 {{factorial}} design is a {{factorial design}} that contains 5 factors where each factor has two levels that 32 treatment combinations and 32 unit of experiments will be needed. Frequently, the whole experiment units can’t be done, {{so that a}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole treatments combinations or a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole replications can be taken. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this study are to divide the treatments into four blocks for <b>one-quarter</b> fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 25 factorial design and to analyze the statistics. To solve <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>one-quarter</b> fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 25 factorial design, two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defining contrasts that are the high-ordered interaction effects which weren’t significant were determined. Then we do confounding and take one of four blocks randomly, do <b>the</b> test <b>of</b> hypothesis and take a conclusion. Based on the two defining contrasts selected i. e.

5|$|In the 1970s, the {{predominantly}} mining and agricultural-based economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy.

The economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis earlier than neighbouring countries did, and has since recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era with a GDP per capita of $14,800. Economic inequalities exist between different ethnic groups.

5|$|Hinduism was the {{predominant}} {{religion in the}} presidency and practised by around 88% of the population. The main Hindu denominations were Saivite, Vaishnavite and Lingayat. Among the Brahmins, the Smartha doctrine was quite popular. Worship of village gods was strong in the southern districts of the presidency while the mathas at Kanchi, Sringeri and Ahobilam were regarded as the centres of the Hindu faith. Of the Hindu temples, {{the largest and most}} important were the Venkateswara temple at Thirupathi, the Brihadeeswarar temple at Tanjore, the Meenakshi Amman temple at Madurai, the Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam, the Krishna temple at Udupi and the Padmanabhaswamy temple in the princely state of Travancore. Islam was brought to the southern part of India by Arab traders although most converts were made from the 14th century onwards, when Malik Kafur conquered Madurai. Nagore was the holiest city for the Muslims of the Madras Presidency. The presidency also had one of the oldest Christian populations in India. Branches of the Syrian church, contrary to historical evidence, are popularly believed to have been instituted by St. Thomas, an apostle of Jesus Christ who visited the Malabar coast in 52AD Christians were mainly concentrated in the Tinnevely and Malabar districts of Madras Presidency with native Christians forming over <b>one–quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total population of the princely state of Travancore.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, the modest-sized Austrian film {{industry}} {{came out with}} a talkie: G'schichten aus der Steiermark (Stories from Styria), an Eagle Film–Ottoton Film production. On September 30, the first entirely German-made feature-length dramatic talkie, Das Land ohne Frauen (Land Without Women), premiered. A Tobis Filmkunst production, about <b>one-quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie contained dialogue, which was strictly segregated from the special effects and music. The response was underwhelming. Sweden's first talkie, Konstgjorda Svensson (Artificial Svensson), premiered on October 14. Eight days later, Aubert Franco-Film came out with Le Collier de la reine (The Queen's Necklace), shot at the Épinay studio near Paris. Conceived as a silent film, it was given a Tobis-recorded score and a single talking sequence—the first dialogue scene in a French feature. On October 31, Les Trois masques debuted; a Pathé-Natan film, it is generally regarded as the initial French feature talkie, though it was shot, like Blackmail, at the Elstree studio, just outside London. The production company had contracted with RCA Photophone and Britain then had the nearest facility with the system. The Braunberger-Richebé talkie La Route est belle, also shot at Elstree, followed a few weeks later.|$|E
