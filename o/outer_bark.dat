5|$|Dying {{stands of}} B. coccinea were {{observed}} in 1989, and the fungus Cryptodiaporthe melanocraspedia isolated as the cause in 1995. The disease, a form of aerial canker, manifested initially as dead dry brown leaves and the tips of new growth. Plants would die from the top downwards, with larger branches affected over time. Under the <b>outer</b> <b>bark,</b> orange and brown patches of necrosis spread out from leaf nodes until they encircle the stem, which then dies. Flower spikes may be affected during flowering season. In humid spells during warm weather, white or pink spore tendrils are produced on dead wood. One affected stand monitored over three years from October 1989 to June 1992 showed a 97% mortality of plants (compared with a baseline 40%). Investigators Bryan Shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of Zythiostroma, however it appeared to invoke an immune response in the plant. This immune response, coupled {{with the fact that}} it had not been observed in the wild, led them to believe it was not a major pathogen of the species. This species has since been reclassified and named as Luteocirrhus shearii.|$|E
25|$|While {{there have}} been some minor innovations, amate paper is still made using the same basic process that was used in the pre Hispanic period. The process begins with obtaining the bark for its fiber. Traditionally, these are from trees of the fig (Ficus) family as this bark is the easiest to process. Some large Ficus trees are {{considered}} sacred and can be found surrounded with candles and offering of cut amate paper. Primary species used include F. cotinifolia, F. padifolia and F. petiolaris, the classic amate tree, along with several non-ficus species such as Morus celtidifolia, Citrus anurantifolia and Heliocarpos Donnell-Smithii Rose. However, the taxonomical identification of trees used for amate paper production is not exact, leading estimates of wild supplies inaccurate. The softer inner bark is preferred but other parts are used as well. <b>Outer</b> <b>bark</b> and bark from ficus trees tend to make darker paper and inner bark and mulberry bark tends to make lighter paper. Bark is best cut in the spring when it is new, which does less damage. It also is less damaging to take bark from older ficus trees as this bark tends to peel off more easily. The commercialization of the product has meant that a wider range of area needs to be searched for appropriate trees. This has specialized the harvesting of bark to mostly people from outside San Pablito, with only a few paper makers harvesting their own bark. These bark collectors generally come to the village {{at the end of the}} week, but numbers of harvesters and amount of bark can vary greatly, depending on the time of year and other factors. The paper makers generally buy the bark fresh then dry it for storage. After drying, the bark can be conserved for about a year.|$|E
500|$|Eggs are {{deposited}} between bark crevices, flakes, or {{cracks and}} hatch {{about two weeks}} later. Eggs are approximately [...] in diameter, and are initially white, but later turn reddish-brown if fertile. After hatching, larvae chew through the bark to the inner phloem, cambium, and outer xylem where they feed and develop. Emerald ash borer has four larval instars. By feeding, larvae create long serpentine galleries. Fully mature fourth-instar larvae are [...] long. In fall, mature fourth-instars excavate chambers about [...] into the sapwood or <b>outer</b> <b>bark</b> where they fold into a J-shape. These J-shaped larvae shorten into prepupae and develop into pupae and adults the following spring. To exit the tree, adults chew holes from their chamber through the bark, which leaves a characteristic D-shaped exit hole. Immature larvae can overwinter in their larval gallery, but can require an additional summer of feeding before overwintering again and emerging as adults the following spring. This two-year life cycle {{is more common in}} cool climates, such as European Russia.|$|E

The hexane extract of the inner bark was purified by column chromatography using silica gel (60  N, spherical 63 – 210  μm, neutral; Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan). The column was eluted with a gradient of hexane:ethyl acetate (100 : 0 to 10 : 90, v/v) to provide pure cubebol, phyllocladanol, 6, 7 -dehydroferruginol, ferruginol, and sugiol.|$|R
40|$|Physical {{properties}} of importance in drying processes have been compiled for bark, including spruce, pine, and birch in Sweden. Water vapor sorption isotherms were determined for {{the bark of}} these trees. At 95 % relative humidity and 25 degrees C, <b>outer</b> birch <b>bark</b> reached a moisture ratio (kg water/kg dry mass) of 5 %, whereas inner birch bark, spruce bark, and pine bark reached moisture ratios of 21, 28, and 25 %, respectively. The transverse water vapor diffusivity in samples of spruce bark, pine bark, inner birch <b>bark,</b> and <b>outer</b> birch <b>bark</b> were determined to be 1. 1 - 1. 710 (- 6), 2. 2 - 9. 210 (- 7), 1. 5 - 2. 610 (- 6), and 4. 3 - 1310 (- 8) m(2) /s, respectively. The in-plane diffusivity was of the same magnitude as the transverse diffusivity in inner birch <b>bark,</b> whereas in <b>outer</b> birch <b>bark</b> the in-plane diffusivity was several {{times higher than the}} transverse diffusivity. These data can be used to model the drying behavior and can thus aid in the design of efficient bark drying processes...|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} anchors for slacklines are trees. Trees {{should always be}} at least , healthy, and solidly rooted. To protect {{the life of the}} tree, {{protection}} should always be used to eliminate abrasion and redistribute the load over a wider area.; this protection can be any material which can absorb some pressure and protect the bark. Materials commonly used include towels, mats, cardboard, carpet and purpose-made tree protectors. These materials are adequate for occasional use, but with the high tension of longlines, more robust protection is needed. One of the most effective means is a wrap of vertical blocks ( [...] cut into [...] pieces) strung together by drilling a small-diameter hole through the center and running cord through them. Blocks are spaced evenly to prevent the anchor slings from contacting and abrading the tree's <b>outer</b> <b>bark,</b> and the length of the blocks distributes the load vertically as opposed to horizontally (which compressed a continuous line around the trunk). The addition of a carpet square between the block wrap and the <b>outer</b> <b>bark</b> is considered ideal among the founding community of slackliners.|$|E

30|$|In our ongoing {{efforts to}} develop new uses for wood-based waste streams, the growth {{inhibition}} activities of extracts obtained from Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) bark were examined against Heterosigma akashiwo, otherwise known as red tide plankton. The Sugi bark was separated into its <b>outer</b> and inner <b>barks</b> and then extracted sequentially with hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Strong inhibitory activities against H. akashiwo were observed in the tests involving the hexane extract from the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>barks,</b> {{as well as the}} ethyl acetate extract from the inner bark. Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) analysis revealed that cubebol, phyllocladanol, 6, 7 -dehydroferruginol, ferruginol, and sugiol were the main components in the active extracts. These components themselves were then tested for their growth inhibition activities against H. akashiwo. Cubebol and ferruginol showed potent inhibitory activities, whereas phyllocladanol, 6, 7 -dehydroferruginol, and sugiol were only weakly active. Taken together, these results suggested that the Sugi bark extracts could be used as inhibition reagents against red tide plankton.|$|R

30|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{activities of}} Sugi bark extracts against H. akashiwo were investigated. Hexane extracts {{from the inner}} and <b>outer</b> <b>barks</b> and the ethyl acetate extract from the inner bark exhibited strong inhibitory activities against H. akashiwo. Cubebol, phyllocladanol, 6, 7 -dehydroferruginol, ferruginol, and sugiol were detected by GC–MS analysis as the common major components of the active extracts. Although cubebol, phyllocladanol, and ferruginol showed growth inhibition activity against H. akashiwo, 6, 7 -dehydroferruginol and sugiol did not show any discernible activity. It was therefore suggested that the Sugi bark extracts containing the aforementioned active components could be utilized as inhibition reagents against red tide plankton. The active extracts and components, however, were non-polar compounds and therefore poorly soluble in water. The activities of the bark components against fishes and other aquatic organisms remain unknown. Thus, the actual utilization of these extracts or components should be considered on a filter material, which could not interfere directly with any fish.|$|R

60|$|In {{the first}} place there are a good many modern {{elements}} in the indigenous population of Australia; but then they are elements of the stray and casual sort one always finds even in remote oceanic islands. They are waifs wafted by accident from other places. For example, the flora {{is by no means}} exclusively an ancient flora, for a considerable number of seeds and fruits and spores of ferns always get blown by the wind, or washed by the sea, or carried on the feet or feathers of birds, from one part of the world to another. In all these various ways, no doubt, modern plants from the Asiatic region have invaded Australia at different times, and altered to some extent the character and aspect of its original native vegetation. Nevertheless, even in the matter of its plants and trees, Australia must still be considered a very old-fashioned and stick-in-the-mud continent. The strange puzzle-monkeys, the quaint-jointed casuarinas (like horsetails grown into big willows), and the park-like forests of blue gum-trees, with their smooth stems robbed of their <b>outer</b> <b>bark,</b> impart a marvellously antiquated and unfamiliar tone to the general appearance of Australian woodland. All these types belong by birth to classes long since extinct in the larger continents. The scrub shows no turfy greensward; grasses, which elsewhere carpet the ground, were almost unknown till introduced from Europe; in the wild lands, bushes, and undershrubs of ancient aspect cover the soil, remarkable for their stiff, dry, wiry foliage, their vertically instead of horizontally flattened leaves, and their general dead blue-green or glaucous colour. Altogether, the vegetation itself, though it contains a few more modern forms than the animal world, is still essentially antique in type, a strange survival from the forgotten flora of the chalk age, the oolite, and even the lias.|$|E
