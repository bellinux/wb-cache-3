5|$|Ambrose's bowling method relied <b>on</b> <b>accuracy</b> and conceding few runs; {{several of}} his best {{performances}} came when he took wickets in quick succession to devastate the opposition. He was particularly successful against leading batsmen. From 1995, Ambrose was increasingly affected by injury, and several times critics claimed {{that he was no}} longer effective. However, he continued to take wickets regularly up until his retirement, although he was sometimes less effective in the early matches of a series. In his final years, the West Indies team was in decline and often relied heavily on Ambrose and Walsh; both men often bowled with little support from the other bowlers. Following his retirement, Ambrose has pursued a career in music as the bass guitarist in a reggae band.|$|E
5|$|In April 1992, South Africa toured West Indies for {{the first}} time, and played their first Test match for 22 years. Ambrose played in all three ODIs, {{all of which were}} won by West Indies. The Test match was the first time West Indies bowled under a new playing {{regulation}} which permitted only one bouncer per over; this seemed to affect the home bowlers, but Ambrose took two for 47 from 36 overs. South Africa began {{the final day of the}} match requiring 79 runs to win with just two batsmen out, but Ambrose and Courtney Walsh took the last eight wickets for 26 runs to bowl West Indies to a 52-run win. On a difficult pitch for batting, the ball bounced unevenly, and both bowlers concentrated <b>on</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Ambrose took six for 34 in the second innings, and was named joint man of the match; in just over 60 overs, he took eight for 81 in the match.|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} biography, Johnson {{disagreed}} with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence <b>on</b> <b>accuracy</b> in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that {{could be viewed as}} tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Tolerance {{parameters}} {{have different}} effects <b>on</b> robot <b>accuracy.</b> Therefore, {{it is better}} to tighten the tolerances of the factors that have statistically significant effect <b>on</b> robot <b>accuracy</b> and widen the tolerances of insignificant ones. By doing so, one not only achieves the given robot accuracy but also reduces manufacturing costs. Objective {{of this paper is to}} present an approach used to determine statistical significance of each tolerance parameter of robot manipulator <b>on</b> robot <b>accuracy</b> which can assist robot designers in making decisions regarding tolerance design. In this paper, a comprehensive model of industrial robot manipulator capable of carrying out various applications is developed and computer simulated. Then Taguchi’s Tolerance Design Experiment is applied to determine the statistical significances of the tolerances <b>on</b> robot <b>accuracy.</b> The approach is illustrated by a case study dealing with 6 -DOF PUMA 560 robot manipulator...|$|R

If this voltage is significant it can be reduced (also reducing the inherent accuracy and precision of the measurement) by using a higher current range.|$|E
25|$|Part of Lee's {{difficulty}} at Test {{level is}} {{that the benefits of}} his high speed, which give the batsmen less reaction time, also results in more erratic bowling. In recent times he has tried to concentrate solely <b>on</b> <b>accuracy</b> by reducing speed. During the first Test against the West Indies in late 2005 at the Gabba, after declaring that he would sacrifice pace and focus on 'line and length', Lee reverted to his initial style of bowling, based on the advice of his captain Ricky Ponting after his new method of bowling failed in the first innings. This saw him take 5/30 his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests, his first in four years.|$|E
25|$|A lower-order {{right-handed}} batsman and a fast-medium right-handed bowler, Cowie played first-class cricket for Auckland {{from the}} 1932-33 season, appearing regularly in Plunket Shield matches from 1934-35. According to his obituary in Wisden in 1995, he {{started as a}} batsman but converted himself into a bowler because the Auckland side had too many batsmen {{for him to be}} guaranteed a place. As a bowler, he relied <b>on</b> <b>accuracy</b> and the ability to move the ball after it pitched, and Wisden likened him to a latter-day New Zealand bowler, Richard Hadlee. But his success in domestic cricket was limited until the 1936-37 season, when he took 21 wickets in four first-class matches, and in the match against Wellington at Auckland took five wickets in an innings for the first time, finishing with five for 81.|$|E

25|$|Illingworth played 787 {{first-class}} matches over nearly 33 years. As a bowler {{in county}} cricket, he took 2072 wickets. He sent down 408 balls without reward {{in the three}} Tests against New Zealand in 1973 but conceded only 1.91 runs an over in his Test career. He was not a sharp spinner of the ball, relying <b>on</b> <b>accuracy</b> and subtle variations of flight, but his arm ball was particularly effective with many of his victims being caught at slip, playing for spin that was not there. His middle-order batting was based around stern defence; a fifth of his innings, mostly from number 6 or 7 in the order, finished not out. He scored 24,134 first-class runs in all, with a best of 162, {{at an average of}} 28.06. Against the Rest of the World in 1970, Illingworth topped the England averages with 476 runs (52.89) and six half-centuries, a testament to his grit and determination against the best in the world.|$|E
500|$|Further devoting {{himself to}} greater accuracy, Hergé also made {{increasing}} use of photographs to draw from, such as of Chinese clothing, street scenes, and landscape. Hergé's newfound emphasis <b>on</b> <b>accuracy</b> and documentation imbued {{the rest of the}} Adventures. While Hergé relied on nonsensical Arabic for the backgrounds in Cigars, for The Blue Lotus Zhang drew the many ideograms that appeared as street signs and advertisements throughout the story. Among these ideograms were those of a political nature, proclaiming slogans such as [...] "Down with Imperialism", [...] "Abolish unfair treaties", and [...] "Down with Japanese merchandise". Zhang also sketched out a number of images for Hergé, such as the outline of Wang's house. Zhang's signature was also included twice throughout the comic, reflecting his artistic contribution; Hergé wanted to include Zhang's name as co-author. In gratitude, Hergé created the character of Chang in honour of his friend Zhang.|$|E
500|$|This focus <b>on</b> <b>accuracy</b> was a {{challenge}} for Staten, as he believes his audience is highly intelligent, willing, and able to report flaws; fellow Bungie employees cross-referenced his drafts with the [...] "Halo Story Bible" [...] to ensure canonical agreement. One example of fans taking Staten to task over the novel occurred soon after the novel's cover was revealed in July 2007. The cover depicts the protagonist, Sergeant Avery Johnson holding a weapon known as the Battle Rifle. As the weapon was first introduced in the video game Halo 2 and the events of Contact Harvest take place decades before the game, fans were quick to say that Staten had made a mistake. Staten later pointed out he had good reasons for including the offending weapon in the book, and justified the inclusion by stating that the weapon is a prototypical form of the version players use in the game.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper the impact of network {{properties}} <b>on</b> localization <b>accuracy</b> of Rank Based Fingerprinting algorithm will be investigated. Rank Based Fingerprinting (RBF) will be described in detail together with Nearest Neighbour fingerprinting algorithms. RBF algorithm is a new algorithm and was designed as improvement of standard fingerprinting algorithms. Therefore exhaustive testing needs to be performed. This testing is mainly focused on optimal distribution of APs and its impact <b>on</b> positioning <b>accuracy.</b> Simulations were performed in Matlab environment in three different scenarios. In the first scenario different numbers of APs were implemented {{in the area to}} estimate the impact of APs number <b>on</b> the localization <b>accuracy</b> of the Rank Based Fingerprinting algorithm. The second scenario was introduced to evaluate the impact of APs placement in the localization area <b>on</b> the <b>accuracy</b> of the positioning using fingerprinting algorithms. The last scenario was proposed to investigate an impact of the number of heard APs and distribution of the RSS values <b>on</b> the <b>accuracy</b> of the RBF algorithm. Results achieved by the RBF algorithm in the first and second scenarios were compared to commonly used NN and WKNN algorithms...|$|R

He was not a stylish batsman but his strokeplay was effective, with a sound defence and temperament. [...] He bowled leg spin with a gentle action and while not a big turner of the ball, he relied <b>on</b> <b>accuracy</b> to dismiss opponents. [...] He made his Test debut in 1902 against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and was {{selected}} to tour England later that year where he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.

500|$|In {{creating}} The Blue Lotus, Hergé {{exhibited a}} newfound emphasis <b>on</b> <b>accuracy</b> and documentation in {{his portrayal of}} foreign societies. He was heavily influenced by his close friend Zhang Chongren, a Chinese student studying in Belgium, and the work both satirises common European misconceptions about China as well as criticising {{the actions of the}} Japanese invaders. The Blue Lotus was a commercial success in Belgium and was soon serialised in France and Switzerland, while news of the book led to the Chinese political leader Chiang Kai-shek inviting Hergé to visit China itself. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Broken Ear, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, The Blue Lotus was partially re-drawn and coloured by the cartoonist and his team of assistants; during this process a number of minor plot elements were changed. The adventure introduces the recurring characters J.M. Dawson and Chang Chong-Chen. The story was adapted for a 1991 episode of the Ellipse/Nelvana animated series The Adventures of Tintin. [...] Critical analysis of the story has been positive, with various commentators considering it to be one of Hergé's finest works.|$|E
