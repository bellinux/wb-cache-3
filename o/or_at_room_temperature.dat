The second major transformation of chocolate {{at the hands of}} the Spanish was in the serving method: the cocoa was heated until it became a liquid. This was in contrast to the natives of the New World, who generally drank it cold <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature.</b> The third change was the addition of spices from the Old World like cinnamon, ground black pepper or aniseed.|$|E

25|$|Lontong, {{popular in}} Indonesia and {{also can be}} found in Malaysia, is made of {{compressed}} rice that is then cut into small cakes. It is traditionally made by boiling the rice until it is partially cooked and packing it tightly into a rolled-up banana leaf. The leaf is secured and cooked in boiling water for about 90minutes. Once the compacted rice has cooled, it can be cut up into bite-sized pieces. The dish is usually served cold <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> with sauce-based dishes such as gado-gado and salads, although it can be eaten as an accompaniment to other dishes such as Satay and curries.|$|E

Soft drinks are also widely available at fast food restaurants, movie theaters, convenience stores, casual dining restaurants, dedicated soda stores, and bars from soda fountain machines. Soda fountain drinks are typically served in paper or plastic disposable cups in the first three venues. In casual dining restaurants and bars, soft drinks are often served in glasses. Soft drinks may be drunk with straws or sipped directly from the cups.|$|E
