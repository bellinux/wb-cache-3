40|$|Using data on {{international}} banks’ ratings {{we find that}} banks with a greater capitalisation, larger assets, and a higher return on assets have higher bank ratings. Further, the more a bank’s liquidity increased {{in the past the}} greater is its rating, the larger is the ratio of its <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> to <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income</b> the lower is its rating and the more recent is the date that the rating is made the lower is the rating of the bank. There is also a strong country effect on bank ratings such that banks from certain countries have systematically higher ratings than others. The addition of this variable substantially raises the model’s accuracy at predicting a bank’s rating which is arguably the major challenge of modelling ratings. The inclusion and modelling of country-effects represents a notable innovation of this study...|$|R

40|$|India {{embarked}} on a strategy of economic reforms {{in the wake of}} a serious balance-ofpayments crisis in 1991. A central plank of the reforms was reform in the financial sector and, with banks being the mainstay of financial intermediation, the banking sector. The objective of the banking sector reforms was to promote a diversified, efficient and competitive financial system with the ultimate objective of improving the allocative efficiency of resources through operational flexibility, improved financial viability and institutional strengthening. Beginning from 1992, Indian banks were gradually exposed to greater domestic and international competition. India’s approach to banking reforms has been somewhat different from many other countries. Whereas there has not been privatisation of public sector banks, through a process of partial disinvestment a number of public sector banks have been listed in Stock Exchanges and have become subject to market discipline and greater transparency in this manner. Besides, newly opened banks from the private sector and entry and expansion of several foreign banks resulted in greater competition. Consequent to these developments, there has been a consistent decline in the share of public sector banks in total assets of commercial banks and a declining trend of Herfindahl’s concentration index. Improvements in efficiency of the banking system were reflected in a number of indicators, such as, a gradual reduction in cost of intermediation (defined as the ratio of <b>operating</b> <b>expense</b> to <b>total</b> assets) in the post reform period across various bank groups (barring foreign banks), and decline in the non-performing loans. As a result of these changes, there has been an all-around productivity improvement in the Indian banking sector. While the cost income-ratio (i. e., the ratio of <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> to <b>total</b> <b>income</b> less interest <b>expense)</b> as well as net interest margin (i. e., the excess of interest income over interest <b>expense,</b> scaled by <b>total</b> bank assets) of Indian banks showed a declining trend during the post-reform period, the business per employee of Indian banks increased over three-fold in real terms exhibiting an annual compound growth rate of nearly 9 percent. At the same time, the profit per employee increased more than five-fold, implying a compound growth of around 17 percent. Branch productivity also recorded concomitant improvements. Such productivity improvements in the banking sector could be driven by two factors: technological improvements, which expands the range of production possibilities and a catching up effect, as peer pressure amongst banks compels them to raise productivity levels. As far as the future of Indian banking is concerned, a number of issues, such as the credit to small and medium enterprises, customers’ interests and financial inclusion, reducing procedural formalities, listing of the public sector banks in the stock exchange and related market discipline are of paramount importance. ...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, an {{analytical}} framework is {{developed for the}} assessment of the financial condition of South African public universities. Foundational constructs of nonprofit economics are applied in the consideration of financial theories of nonprofit organisations in general, and public universities in particular. From this review, a number of hypotheses are developed. Each of these specifies a positive or negative association between a university's financial condition and a particular dimension of its assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and surplus. From the nonprofit financial analysis literature, ratios and indicators relevant to these hypotheses are selected. Audited data from the annual financial statements of the universities for the seven year period 2007 to 2013 are substantially transformed in mitigation of failures in accounting, auditing and accountability. The adjusted accounting numbers are used to calculate the financial indicators applicable to each university. Exploratory factor analysis is implemented to categorise and organise this large indicator set on the basis of identified associations with a smaller number of factors. It is found that the financial condition of South African public universities is defined by two broad financial characteristics, capital and revenue. Assessment of the capital dimension is informed by a focus on institutional equity, with particular emphasis on expendable equity and its proportionate relationships with surplus, total capital, and <b>total</b> <b>expenses.</b> The revenue dimension is appropriately evaluated {{in the context of a}} comparative and interactive consideration of the three main components of South African public university revenue, as well as the proportionate relationship between non-staff <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> and <b>total</b> <b>expenses.</b> The framework displays considerable levels of stability and consistency over the seven year review period, and its constructs are, in addition, robust to the application of multiple alternative confirmatory tests involving financial data that are independent of the factor solutions.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the Nigerian Banks’ Efficiency Performance. The period studied was 2005 - 2009. In addition to the above, {{the extent of the}} effect of the bank’s fixed assets, <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> and <b>total</b> deposit on their efficiency was investigated. The effect of the bank’s efficiency on their profitability was also examined. In recent years emphasis is now on using frontier analysis methods in measuring bank efficiency instead of using financial ratios. In frontier analysis, the institutions that perform better relative to a particular standard are separated from those that perform poorly. Such separation is done either by applying a parametric or non parametric frontier analysis to firms within the financial services industry. This study employed the Non parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) under the assumptions of Constant return to scale (CRS),Variable Return to Scale (VRS) and Scale Efficiency(SE) to estimate the efficiency scores of the banks. A bank with a score of 1 is efficient, while a score below 1 means the bank is inefficient. The tests of the four hypotheses were carried out using Vector autoregressive Analysis (VAR). The findings of the study revealed that GTB was the most efficient bank and it has the least reduction in inputs (4. 93 %) needed to produce the same amount of output. Moreover it remained efficient throughout the years 2006 - 2009. Overall, the worst performers are Unity bank, Afribank and UBA. Also the banks did not achieve full efficiency under the CRS, VRS and SE in any of the five years. The findings on the hypothesis tested revealed that fixed assets have a negative relationship with efficiency, <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> has no long run relationship with the efficiency variable and total deposit does not affect efficiency. Lastly, efficiency has a positive significant relationship with profitability. This study therefore recommend that the banks that are not efficient should study the operations of GTB the best performer to see if could be adopted to improve their efficiency and the banks should moderate their use of inputs as they could have used fewer amount of inputs to achieve the same level of output. Finally, the acquisition of fixed assets should be reasonable. This is to prevent it from reaching a point where it will impact negatively on the bank’s efficiency...|$|R
