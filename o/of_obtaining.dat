5|$|An example {{he gives}} of the {{difficulty}} <b>of</b> <b>obtaining</b> missing data from drug companies is that of oseltamivir (Tamiflu), manufactured by Roche to reduce the complications of bird flu.

5|$|Anatomy can {{be studied}} using both {{invasive}} and non-invasive methods with the goal <b>of</b> <b>obtaining</b> information about the structure and organization of organs and systems. Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{rough set}} literatures, methods for {{inducing}} minimal rules from a given decision table have been proposed. When the decision attribute is ordinal, inducing rules about upward and downward unions of decision classes is advantageous in the simplicity <b>of</b> <b>obtained</b> rules. However, because of independent {{applications of the}} rule induction method, inclusion relations among upward/downward unions in conclusion parts are not inherited to the condition parts <b>of</b> <b>obtained</b> rules. This non-inheritance may debase the quality <b>of</b> <b>obtained</b> rules. To ensure that inclusion relations among conclusions are inherited to conditions, we propose two rule induction approaches. The performances of the proposed approaches considering the inclusion relations between conclusions are examined by numerical experiments...|$|R

5|$|However, the Attorney-General may not {{consent to}} lend {{his name to}} a relator action. This matter lies entirely within his discretion, and his {{decision}} is not considered reviewable by the courts. In addition, it has been forcefully argued that since the Attorney-General is the principal legal advisor of the executive, it is overly idealistic to expect his consent to an action against the Government. This makes a relator action an uncertain, and hence an unsatisfactory, means <b>of</b> <b>obtaining</b> relief.|$|E

5|$|In {{individuals}} with developmental disabilities, occurrence of self-harm is often demonstrated {{to be related}} to its effects on the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way <b>of</b> <b>obtaining</b> these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus is to teach an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.|$|E
