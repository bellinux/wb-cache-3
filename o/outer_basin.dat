40|$|High P-wave {{velocities}} (7. 1 – 7. 8 km/s) lower crustal bodies (LCBs) imaged along volcanic {{margins are}} commonly interpreted as plume and breakup-related thick mafic underplating. This interpretation is partly challenged {{in this paper}} based on new seismic observations and modelling of the <b>outer</b> Vøring <b>Basin</b> (Norway). An exceptional strong amplitude reflection, the T Reflection, is particularly well defined below the North Gjallar Ridge (NGR) between 7 and 8 s TWT. The T Reflection is located near the volcanic lava flows emplaced during the NE Atlantic breakup (55 – 54 Ma ago) and coincides with {{the top of the}} LCB, forming a mid-crustal dome. Based on structural and temporal relationships, we show that the dome clearly influences the structural development of the NGR and predates the continental breakup at least by 10 – 15 Ma. Using a thermo-kinematical model, we tried also to investigate and quantify the relationships between the extension, LCB and the magmatic production. Modelling suggests that significant Paleocene–Early Eocene magmatism can be produced without any temperature anomaly in the mantle if differential stretching occurs during the breakup initiation. The conclusion of 2 D thermo-kinematical parametric analysis is that the magmatic model predicts, either little extension (? 5) with significant melting along the <b>outer</b> Vøring <b>Basin.</b> We suggest that the continental part of the LCB could not necessarily be breakup-related and so magmatic, as has often been stated previously. It is concluded here that the continental part of the LCB observed beneath the <b>outer</b> Vøring <b>Basin</b> may be partly (or fully) attributed to inherited, high-pressure granulite/eclogite lower crustal rocks. The real amount of mafic material emplaced along the <b>outer</b> Vøring <b>Basin</b> could be 20 – 40 % less than thought...|$|R

2500|$|One {{feature of}} Penarth Dock was the tunnel {{underpass}} that connected Penarth dock to Ferry Road Grangetown under the River Ely (...) [...] Not quite {{wide enough for}} motor vehicles it was used by commuting pedestrians and cyclists as a short cut to work in Cardiff. The circular tunnel was {{about half a mile}} long with an entrance foyer at each end. Lined with cream and green coloured ceramic tiles, the route was lit originally by gaslight and later by electricity. Completed in 1899, from parts cast by T Gregory Engineering Works, Taffs Well, the tunnel remained in use until the autumn of 1965, when it was closed and the ends bricked up, after a series of violent muggings, repeated vandalism and the cost of maintenance becoming uneconomical. The tunnel entrance at the Penarth end was located near the lock gates, between the <b>outer</b> <b>basin</b> and the number one dock. This historic short cut route was 'almost' replicated and replaced in June 2008 with the opening of a pedestrian and cycle route across the new Cardiff Bay Barrage.|$|E

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to define the role of various sources of recharge in the surficial alluvial aquifer system in arid Alice Springs in central Australia, for future {{management of water resources}} in the region. Multiple sources of natural recharge include infiltration from ephemeral stream flow in the Todd River; groundwater throughflow between connected alluvial basins; regional groundwater flow from the underlying Tertiary aquifer; and diffuse recharge. In addition treatment, storage and irrigation reuse of Alice Springs' waste water has resulted in additional recharge of effluent, via infiltration. Water resource management plans for the region include effluent reuse through Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) within one of the connected alluvial basins, with the purpose of managing the excess waste water overflows while also supplementing groundwater resources for irrigation and protecting their quality. Hydrogeochemical tracers, chloride and the stable isotopes of water, were used in a three-member mixing model to define and quantify the major recharge sources. The mixing model was not sensitive enough to quantify minor contributions from effluent in groundwater that were identified only by an evaporated isotopic signature. The contribution of the multiple recharge sources varied spatially with proximity to the recharge source; with Todd River, effluent and Town Basin throughflow contributing to the Inner Farm <b>Basin</b> groundwater. The <b>Outer</b> Farm <b>Basin</b> was largely influenced by the Todd River, the Inner Farm Basin throughflow and the older Tertiary aquifer. While Inner Farm groundwater throughflow contains an effluent component, only <b>Outer</b> Farm <b>Basin</b> groundwater near the interface between the two basins clearly illustrated an effluent signature. Aside from this, effluent recharge was not evident in the <b>Outer</b> Farm <b>Basin,</b> indicating that past unmanaged recharge practices will not mask signs of Managed Aquifer Recharge through the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) operation. The long-term impact of effluent recharge is a shift from sodium and calcium as co-dominant cations in the groundwater, as evident in the <b>Outer</b> Farm <b>Basin,</b> to dominance by sodium alone, as typical for the Inner Farm Basin...|$|R
40|$|The Neogene {{structural}} and sedimentary {{evolution of the}} <b>Outer</b> Cilicia <b>Basin</b> is investigated using marine multi-channel seismic data collected during a 1992 survey. The Cilicia Basin is a relatively shallow Neogene basin, which {{is located on the}} Aegean-Anatolian microplate in the fore-arc region of the Cyprean Arc. The basin's evolution is recorded in four main stratigraphic units each separated by laterally extensive erosional unconformities. These units from youngest to oldest are: Unit 1 - Pliocene-Quaternary aged siliclastics, Unit 2 - Messinian aged evaporites, Unit 3 A - mid- to late-Miocene aged marls and chalks, and Unit 3 B - Oligocene to mid-Miocene aged marls and turbidite deposits. The deformation of these sequences, throughout the basin's history, gives rise to both compressional and extensional structures, largely affected by the ductile salt layer. [...] The structural evolution of the <b>Outer</b> Cilicia <b>Basin</b> can be separated into two main phases. The first is a compressional phase which began in Miocene time in association with convergence along the Cyprean Arc. During this phase, a south-verging thrust belt developed directly south of the <b>Outer</b> Cilicia <b>Basin.</b> Since the mid-late Miocene, the basin has evolved on the back limb of the thrust system. A second evolutionary phase began in Pliocene time, coinciding with the initiation of westward escape and rotation of the Aegean-Anatolian microplate. The Pliocene-Quaternary succession is primarily affected by two main types of structures: 1) Transtensional faults, which provide accommodation for strain induced in the basin by the westward escape of the microplate, and 2) Salt tectonic structures, which develop in association with the basin-ward flow of salt, driven by gravitational forces and sedimentary loading...|$|R
40|$|Typical of glaciated environments, {{the inner}} {{continental}} shelf of New Hampshire is composed of bedrock outcrops, remnants of glacial deposits (for example, drumlins), sand and gravel deposits, as well as muddier sediments farther offshore. A number of previous studies have defined the general trends of the New Hampshire inner shelf from the coarser deposits nearer the shore to the muddier <b>outer</b> <b>basins.</b> Most recently, a seismic survey (150 km of side-scan sonar and subbottom seismic profiles), as well as bottom sediment sampling (74 stations), has provided a detailed bottom map of the southern New Hampshire shelf area (landward of the 30 -m contour). The surficial sediments within this area range from very fine sand to gravel. Bedrock outcrops are common. The seismic survey indicated several large sand deposits exceeding 6 - 8 m in thickness that occur relatively close to the coast. These sedimentary units, which are within 3 km of the shoreline, are composed of fine to medium sands. Examination of the general morphology and depositional setting indicates {{at least some of}} these features are probably relic ebb tidal delta shoals. However, a large eroding drumlin occurs between two of the sand bodies and may represent the source of these deposits. Additional work is needed to verify the origin of these sediment bodies...|$|R

40|$|The {{southern}} Aegean Sea is a present-day forcarc basin {{characterized by}} an outer arc of strongly uplifted, older, deformed rocks. Since {{the time of its}} formation, it was split by extensional tectonic movements into several basins in which different sedimentary sequences developed. The study of sand-size turbiditic sediments from the basins reveals two main compositional sand suites (plus a third group of sediments showing aberrant compositions derived from the mixing of the other two) : 1) quartzolithic sand suite derived from the outer arc; and 2) lithovolcanic suite derived from the volcanic arc of the Cyclades. The suites develop separately in the different basins depending on the control exercised by the tectonics of the source areas and the physiography of the basins. Quartzolithic sands occur mostly in the <b>outer</b> <b>basins,</b> close to the outer arc, whereas lithovolcanic sands occur in the central part, where deposition of terrigenous quartzolithic sediments is small. Volcanic-derived sediments are mostly wind-blown ashes first deposited on the edges of the basins and then redeposited by turbidity currents. Transport of sediments occurs mainly longitudinally to the basins along tectonically controlled canyons. There is a direct correlation between these sand suites and the small-scale tectonic setting of the source area. However, because of the anomalous presence of an ancient orogenic belt such as the outer arc, a quartzolithic sand suite can develop in the forearc basin, representing an exception to current ideas on the relationship between plate tectonics and sand composition. This exception is due to the difference between the actual tectonic setting in the southern Aegean Sea and the oversimplified models...|$|R

40|$|Sand {{provenance}} in the Kwanza Basin, Angola, is {{assessed using}} conventional and varietal heavy mineral analysis. There are contrasting heavy mineral signatures {{in the north}} and south of the basin separated by a hybrid zone. These contrasts are attributed to different hinterland geology. Heavy mineralogy, sand body distribution and prominent structures allowed the subdivision of the Kwanza Basin into five depositional domains. Heavy mineral indices filter important provenance signatures in space and time in addition to providlng tectonic and geomorphologic information. Quantitative and qualitative thermal and composition information was obtained from fluid inclusions using UV fluorescence and microthermometry. There were at least two pulses of hydrocarbon generation and migration from source rocks in the basin based on homogenization temperatures of 52 - 129 Ã‚Â°C, geochemical characterization of oil shows from proprietary data, and Genesis basin modelling: 1) during Albian time, rift-related high heat flow triggered the first pulse, and 2) high rates of sedimentation led to a burial-induced pulse during the Neogene-Quaternary. There are three main controls on diagenesis: stratigraphy and facies; thermal history; and provenance. Significant authigenic minerals (illite, smectite, dolomite, quartz and feldspar) were only noted in Cenomanian or older rocks. Apatite fission track analysis (AFTA) yields a record of the temperature regime experienced by the basin and basement through the pre-rift, syn-rift and post-rift stages. There were three main tectono-thermal events in the basin: 1) pre-rift and early syn-rift cooling; 2) a post-rift period of tectonic quiescence (Cretaceous to early Tertiary); interrupted by 3) a rapid cooling (denudation) due to epeirogenic uplift of the Inner Kwanza Basin and hinterland at ca. 23 Ma. Miocene denudation of the Inner Kwanza Basin and the hinterland is mirrored by a burial-related temperature increase in the <b>Outer</b> Kwanza <b>Basin.</b> This source to sink correlation indicates a period of bypassed sedimentation into the <b>Outer</b> Kwanza <b>Basin</b> and possibly onto the abyssal plain of Angola.

40|$|The stratigraphic {{position}} of the Goryczkowiec Sandstone reflects the Paleocene ridge geodynamics in the <b>Outer</b> Carpathian <b>basins.</b> The Goryczkowiec Sandstone was deposited on the slope of a ridge, known as the Subsilesian Sedimentary Area that originated during reorganization of the Outer Carpathian realm.

40|$|Several {{sections}} {{record the}} relation between the "black flysch" and Upper Cretaceous red shales in the Grajcarek thrust-sheets. In all the sections studied the "black flysch" appears in the core of imbricated folds or thrust-sheets, whereas the limbs are composed of Upper Cretaceous deposits. The transitional beds between the "black flysch" and the Upper Cretaceous red shales are composed of green and black bituminous shales, green and red radiolarites and cherty limestones. Biostratigraphical investigations have revealed a similar type and sequence of microfauna assemblages in all the sections studied and significant redeposition of Jurassic calcareous benthic foraminifera, calcareous nannoplankton, molluscs, sponge spicules and crinoid elements. The Cretaceous age (Aptian/Albian-Cenomanian) of the "black flysch" is shown by the presence of agglutinated foraminifera and microfacies data. These deposits are underlain by a Kimmeridgian-Aptian radiolarite/limestone condensed succession and overlain by Turonian-Campanian hemipelagic red shales and Maastrichtian/Lower Paleocene conglomerates and thick-bedded silicilastic turbidites of the Jarmuta Formation.

Our project is intended to provide a history of deposition {{in one of the}} ultimate sinks: the eastern Mediterranean. We mapped the distribution of sediment deposits and delineated the structures that developed in the Cilicia Basin precisely in space and time. The focus of this research is on the basin-wide structures that developed near the Turkish continental slope and extend through the entire Cilicia Basin. [...] Detailed interpretation and mapping of the seismic reflection profiles showed that during the Miocene a major south- and southeast-verging fold-thrust belt developed across the entire Cilicia Basin. The leading portion of this fold-thrust belt is well imaged in the Inner Latakia Basin, south east of the present-day Misis-Kyrenia Fault Zone. The trailing portion of the fold-thrust belt is believed to constitute the thrust panels which form the core of the central Taurus Mountains of southern Turkey. A north- and northwest-verging fold-thrust belt is locally mapped in the <b>Outer</b> Cilicia <b>Basin.</b> The belt is overprinted by smaller positive flower structures all soling into the primary thrust surface(s), and showing tip points extending to the depositional surface. This structural architecture suggests that they are developed within a transpressional regime during the Pliocene Quaternary. Seismic stratigraphic correlations with deep offshore exploration wells provided the chronology for the seismic data. A thick evaporite succession is unconformably deposited over deeper portions of the fold-thrust belt. This evaporite succession presently forms numerous salt pillows and salt rollers in Inner Cilicia Basin, and salt diapirs and salt walls in the <b>Outer</b> Cilicia <b>Basin.</b> [...] Detailed mapping showed that Miocene contraction was followed by partitioned contraction and extension that is related to strike-slip fault activity along the Kozan Fault Zone, a major splay from the East Anatolian Transform Fault.
