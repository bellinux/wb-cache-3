Protecting the ecosystems, like the rainforest, upon which the endangered species depend serves as an important indirect benefit.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this descriptive research is to determine how effective the implementation <b>of</b> school <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> policies is and how this can be improved upon. If schools do have an <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> policy, how successful are they in implementing it. The school <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> policies provide incentives and frameworks {{for the development of}} strategies and action plans which result in the <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> goals being achieved effectively and efficiently. For the effective implementation <b>of</b> the school <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> policies within an OBE paradigm, educators need to be knowledgeable, skilled and motivated. Overall, teacher education is probably the biggest challenge to the implementation <b>of</b> the school <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> policies.

25|$|In higher education, the {{analysis}} of students’ individual writing assignments after viewing films/documentaries presents an interesting case of using radical ‘messages’ within the aims <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> in order to trigger both student’s engagement and critical thinking. The case study “If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound” {{provides an example of}} how environmental advocacy and the objective of pluralistic education can be combined as mutually supportive means of achieving both democratic learning in which students’ individual opinions are seen as extremely valuable, and simultaneously provide an example of the type of ecopedagogy that supports learning for environmental sustainability. The role of environmental advocacy can be crucially important if the interests of all planetary citizens—and not just one species—are to be taken seriously.|$|E

2500|$|Ecopedagogy {{calls for}} the remaking of {{capitalist}} practices and seeks to re-engage democracy to include multispecies interests {{in the face of}} our current global ecological crisis. It does so by using different ideas that challenge the way we see education. [...] In Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement, Richard Kahn (2010) reformulates Herbert Marcuse’s critical theories of society, and supports the kind of education that seizes the power of radical environmental activists and supports the earth democracy in which multispecies interests are represented. The destruction of habitats and threats to biodiversity resulting from expansion of human population and consumption is rarely addressed in a way that confronts students with the necessity to consider moral implications of such destruction. Pedagogically, a return to education associated with significant life experiences, such as hiking in wilderness areas as a youth; as well as strategically significant education, action competence, social learning, and variations and combinations of those and many other pedagogical approaches developed in the past 40 years. Some of these pedagogical approaches have been disputed—for example, the belief that experiencing environment first hand is an essential component of engaging people in conservation has been disputed by arguments that these education efforts have been informed by behaviorist socio-psychology models that assumed a linear causality between education experience and pro-environmental behavior. [...] Rather, the critics have argued that people’s environmental behaviors are too complex and contextually dependent to be captured by a simple casual model.
