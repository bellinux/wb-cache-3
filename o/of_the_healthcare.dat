Ellsworth later voted for the Stupak Amendment. He eventually voted for the Senate language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> bill lacking the Stupak Amendment's anti-abortion language.|$|E

If you don't take out insurance, you risk a fine. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone {{over the age of}} 18 years, regardless of age or state of health – it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions.

25|$|RNs are {{the largest}} group of health care workers in the United States, with about 2.7 million {{employed}} in 2011. It has been reported that the number of new graduates and foreign-trained nurses is insufficient to meet the demand for registered nurses; this {{is often referred to as}} the nursing shortage and is expected to increase for the foreseeable future. There are data to support the idea that the nursing shortage is a voluntary shortage. In other words, nurses are leaving nursing of their own volition. In 2006 it was estimated that approximately 1.8 million nurses chose not to work as a nurse. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 296,900 healthcare jobs were created in 2011. RNs make up the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> work force, therefore these positions will be filled primarily by nurses. The BLS also states that by 2020, there will be 1.2 million nursing job openings due to an increase in the workforce, and replacements. (Rosseter, 2012).|$|E
