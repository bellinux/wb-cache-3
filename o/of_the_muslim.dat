50|$|Nawab M. Ismail Khan entered {{politics}} {{at a very}} early age. As a young man, he had closely observed <b>the</b> agitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> masses for a separate electorate and had seen how a delegation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> was sent (October 1906) to Lord Minto -- which secured <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> a separate representation for <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Muslim force, now {{numbering}} around 700, {{was stationed}} {{on the slopes}} of Uhud, facing Medina with the rear being protected by the towering mount itself. Before the battle, Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the West side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> camp. This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated on the east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> camp. Protecting the flanks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army meant that the Meccan army {{would not be able to}} turn around the Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.|$|E
5|$|The remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army {{once again}} sought refuge in Mineo, where Theodotus {{blockaded}} them and soon reduced {{them to the}} point of eating their horses and even dogs. When they heard of this reversal, the Arab garrison of Agrigento abandoned the city and retreated to Mazara. Thus, by the autumn of 829, Sicily had almost been cleared <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> invaders.|$|E
5|$|After the {{accession}} of Caliph Hisham (r. 723–743), {{the scale}} and ambition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> raids grew. One {{of the most prominent}} Umayyad leaders in these campaigns was Hisham's son Mu'awiya, who led expeditions in 725 and 726, the first of which went as far west as Dorylaion.|$|E
50|$|In 1931 the All India Kashmir Committee {{was set up}} for <b>the</b> {{establishment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{civil rights}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> <b>of</b> Kashmir and to alleviate their oppression.

The committee turned <b>the</b> attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> <b>of</b> Kashmir towards acquiring education and Mahmood Ahmad himself gave practical help towards this cause.

5|$|Phase 3: With the Byzantine cavalry {{completely}} routed, Khalid {{turned to}} the Byzantine left center which already held the two-pronged attack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> infantry. The Byzantine left center was attacked at its rear by Khalid's cavalry and was finally broken.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle lines}} of the Muslims and the Byzantines were divided into four sections: the left wing, the left center, the right center and the right wing.

5|$|The picture {{painted by}} the few and {{scattered}} {{references to the}} Cretan emirate from the Muslim world, on the other hand, is of an ordered state with a regular monetary economy and extensive trade links, and {{there is evidence that}} Chandax was a cultural centre of some importance. The survival of numerous gold, silver, and copper coins, of almost constant weight and composition, testifies to a strong economy and a high living standard among the population. The economy was strengthened by extensive trade with the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> world, especially with Egypt, and by a booming agriculture: the need to sustain an independent state, as well as access to the markets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> world, led to an intensification of cultivation. It is also possible that sugar cane was introduced to Crete at the time.|$|E
5|$|After the Allies {{landed in}} Sumatra, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> Indian {{soldiers}} {{brought by the}} English deserted and joined the native revolutionaries. They planned strategy in the mosque, including the assault on a British barracks. One of these Indian soldiers, {{who had died in}} the assault, was buried at the mosque. Since 1950, after Indonesia's independence was recognised, the Ganting Grand Mosque has hosted numerous statesmen from both Indonesia and abroad, including Vice President Mohammad Hatta, Minister of Defence Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, and General Abdul Haris Nasution. Foreign dignitaries who have visited the mosque included people from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.|$|E
5|$|All three named commanders were slain {{during the}} battle, and Khalid was {{selected}} as the commander. He was able to maintain his heavily outnumbered army of 3,000 men against an army of 10,000 of the Byzantine Empire and Ghassanid Arabs in what would be known as the Battle of Mu'tah. Khalid assumed command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army at the crucial moment, and defeated the Byzantine forces even when another 10,000 soldiers had arrived as reinforcements for the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|As {{a symbol}} of the Caliph's ritual role as the leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> community, they were closely paralleled in {{official}} propaganda by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca.

5|$|Caliph Abu Bakr died in Madinah, making Umar his successor. Umar removed Khalid from command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> {{army and}} {{appointed}} Abu Ubaidah {{as the new}} commander in chief. In later years, following the Battle of Yarmuk, the Rashidun Caliphate annexed the whole Levant, followed by the conquest of Antioch in 638. By 639, the Byzantines had lost Armenia and Mesopotamia. Emperor Heraclius concentrated on the defenses of Egypt and Anatolia, creating a buffer-zone in Anatolia west of Caesarea by abandoning all the Byzantine fortifications there. The Muslims never invaded Anatolia. However, by 642 the Byzantines lost Egypt and Tripolitania to the Caliphate.|$|E

Nevertheless, the island was never conquered and despite occasional raids in the 8th century it remained securely in Byzantine hands; Crete was too far from the Arab naval bases in the Levant for an effective expedition against it to be undertaken.|$|E
