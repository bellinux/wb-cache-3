40|$|Abstract. Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) {{composites}} {{are thin}} laminates that are externally bonded to <b>broken</b> <b>concrete</b> specimens using an epoxy system {{to increase their}} load-carrying capacity in this study. This paper reports the test results of <b>broken</b> <b>concrete</b> specimens strengthened with CFRP sheets and subjected to two aggressive environments including ultraviolet (UV) and freeze-thaw cycles. Test results revealed that three different CFRP layers are effective in retrofit on the broken compressive or flexural <b>concrete</b> specimens. The <b>broken</b> <b>concrete</b> specimens repaired with an epoxy and CFRP system could improve their compressive strength, flexural strength or ductility. Both aggressive environment tests didn’t cause obvious degradation to hardness index, compressive or flexural strength. The flexural specimens used half-U coating and anchorage systems were much higher strength than those only wrapped with CFRP sheets on the flat surface...|$|R

50|$|The battery site, {{situated}} on the northern bank of the dam, has been stripped of all buildings and plant.

50|$|As the {{facilities}} within the tubes of Lion Rock Tunnel {{are suffering from}} serious deterioration due to aging, as well as <b>broken</b> <b>concrete</b> on road surface which causes bumping when vehicles pass through, the Highways Department decided to undergo renovation works upon the tunnels in 2008. It will extend {{the lives of the}} tunnels for around 80 years more.|$|R
50|$|The northernmost {{of these}} islands, Ragged Key #1 has been {{inhabited}} in the past. The remains {{of an old}} wooden dock are in hazardous condition. The deteriorated concrete wall encircles majority of the island. The remains of previous development are concrete pillars and {{what used to be}} a cistern and looks like a <b>broken</b> <b>concrete</b> tank.|$|R
50|$|The major {{architectural}} {{feature of}} the building is the <b>broken</b> <b>concrete</b> facades with a vertical motif. This was achieved by creating vertical fluting {{to a depth of}} about 10 cm, with a width of about 6cm, at a horizontal pitch of about 10cm. The resulting <b>concrete</b> 'lands' were <b>broken</b> off with hammers, by hand, to create the jagged and smashed appearance.|$|R
50|$|Ritter {{moved the}} family to Don Pio Drive in Woodland Hills, California, in the early 1950s. The home {{included}} a studio building on a hilltop which, like all his studios, featured a pot-belly stove. In addition to his painting, Ritter was a talented landscaper and he terraced {{the front and rear}} hills with steps, paths and pools all made from slabs of <b>broken</b> <b>concrete.</b>|$|R
60|$|Dick {{wondered}} how much Jake suspected, particularly as he {{did not appear to}} be searching for anything when he moved up and down among the <b>broken</b> <b>concrete.</b> Half an hour later, when none of the peons were immediately about, he came up with his hand in his pocket and indicated a corner beside a block where there was a little shade and they were not likely to be overlooked.|$|R

5000|$|Although the Town Hall {{is owned}} by the city, the grounds are {{landscaped}} and maintained by local volunteers, including members of the Miller Historical Society and Miller Garden Club. In 2011, the Town Hall became a flashpoint of controversy when the city government attempted to stop neighborhood volunteers from removing <b>broken</b> <b>concrete</b> {{from the front of the}} building.

The recycled material was used on interstate highways for the subbase and shoulders. The major problem IADOT encountered {{on this project}} was the removal of reinforcing steel from the <b>broken</b> <b>concrete.</b> The contractor used hydraulic powered shears to clip off all protruding steel during the removal and loading of the concrete on the grade.

The site is described in 2015 by the LWT as one of London's most important refuges for amphibians. It has four ponds, grassland and scrub. Banks of <b>broken</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs, which are a remnant of the site's industrial past, provide a habitat for basking lizards. Other species include grasshoppers, bush crickets, dragonflies and butterflies.|$|R

50|$|About 30 metres {{north of}} the stockmen's {{quarters}} {{is the site of}} a demolished building that contained a concrete floor and corrugated iron walls and roof. This building accommodated up to six families of Aboriginal stockmen during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1960 the building was converted into a white stockmen's quarters, and by the late 1960s it become an ablutions block. The building was bulldozed post 1979 and the floor is still evident as a pile of <b>broken</b> <b>concrete</b> {{north of the}} site.|$|R

Zorthian called the ranch The Center for Research and Development with an Emphasis on Aesthetics, and fashioned rental houses out of discarded items including telephone poles and railroad ties. He also built rock walls, towers, inlaid bridges and walkways. He painted in a studio and bred horses for his horse ring.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{resorted to}} the use of construction operations simulation modeling to investigate the cost efficiency of waste-handling practices on the Kai Tak Airport demolition project in Hong Kong. By modeling the site operation of sieving and stockpiling <b>broken</b> <b>concrete,</b> the well-established construction simulation methodology of CYCLONE was contrasted with the newly developed simplified discrete event simulation approach (SDESA). Further, the SDESA model was readily extended to include (1) raw demolition waste collecting and sorting; (2) <b>broken</b> <b>concrete</b> sieving and stockpiling; (3) steel bar recycling; and (4) debris disposal at the landfill. The production rate derived from simulation was indicative of a close match between the simulation model and the actual site system. The resulting simulation model provided a basis for evaluating the cost efficiency of actual site operations and alternative resource provision scenarios being postulated. Through computer simulation, the actual site operation was found smooth and efficient with utilization rates for resources of different types ranging from 79 to 99 %. In addition, the cost-time reduction ratios were calculated for four alternatives of resource provisions in comparison with the original base case. The research findings suggested that provided the project budget had satisfied the higher cash flow requirement, doubling the resource provision on site would potentially cut the project duration by half and not increase the total direct cost.
