5|$|The Guianan cock-of-the-rock has {{distinctive}} territorial markings. Males {{usually take}} dominance {{of an area}} on the ground, although they sometimes they occupy middle strata in forests. They make their characteristic marking by clearing out debris from the ground, including twigs, leaves, and pellets. This area is called a “court”. Quality of courts {{are known to have}} some influence on mate choice. The court quality is determined by the territory density and location to the center <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> the lek. The reason for the focus on the center <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> the lek is that successful males tended to own courts in the most densely clustered lek areas. Guianan courts are commonly found in the Guianan Shield, a forested region in northeastern South America.|$|E
5|$|While {{significant}} {{attempts have}} been made recently to identify the exact locations of the individual Upanishads, the results are tentative. Witzel identifies the center <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad. The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more western than eastern location in the Indian subcontinent, possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru-Panchala country.|$|E
5|$|A flint {{arrowhead}} {{discovered in}} Sale suggests a prehistoric human {{presence at the}} location, {{but there is no}} further evidence <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> the area until the Roman period. A 4th-century hoard of 46Roman coins was discovered in Ashton upon Mersey, one of four known hoards dating from that period discovered within the Mersey basin. Sale lies along the line of the Roman road which runs between the fortresses at Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum), via the fort at Manchester (Mamucium); the present-day A56 follows the route of the road through the town. After the Roman departure from Britain in the early-5th century, Britain was invaded by the Anglo-Saxons.|$|E

5|$|A {{graduate}} of Boyd High School and Texas Tech University, Tolliver was selected 51st in the 1989 NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers. He started 19 games {{in two seasons}} at San Diego before being traded to Atlanta, where he saw playing time as a backup for three seasons. In 1994, {{he became one of}} three starting quarterbacks for Houston and then served as quarterback of the Shreveport Pirates in the CFL during their final season <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> 1995. After not competing in 1996, Tolliver played for both Atlanta and Kansas City in 1997. He then started 11 games for New Orleans in two seasons but did not take the field in 2000. A stint with Green Bay in the 2001 offseason concluded his professional career.|$|E
5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene {{has been linked}} to an increase in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but {{it is unlikely that the}} pattern <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E
5|$|Al-Hajj Muhammad {{was born}} in the village of Dhinnaba (today a part of Tulkarm city) in 1892.

During the invasion of Syria by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798–99, al-Hajj Muhammad's great-grandfather fought in the Ottoman defense of the country, but was later sentenced to death.

He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E
5|$|Evidence <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> the Quantocks from prehistoric times {{includes}} finds of Mesolithic flints at North Petherton and Broomfield {{and many}} Bronze Age round barrows (marked on maps as tumulus, plural tumuli), such as Thorncombe Barrow above Bicknoller. Several ancient stones can be seen, {{such as the}} Triscombe Stone and the Long Stone above Holford. Many of the tracks along ridges of the Quantocks probably originated as ancient ridgeways. A Bronze Age hill fort, Norton Camp, was built to the south at Norton Fitzwarren, close to the centre of bronze making in Taunton.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Prior to and during the 2005 season, Gray issued four forecasts, each time increasing the predicted level of activity. The NOAA issued two forecasts, one shortly before the season and one two months into the season, drastically increasing the predicted level <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> the second release. Nonetheless, all forecasts fell {{far short of the}} actual activity of the season.|$|E

It {{is important to note that}} the set <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> are assumed to be complete in the sense that, whatever be the choice <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> the earlier stages (consistent with the restrictions applicable to their stage), there is a possible choice <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> the latter stages. In other words it is not possible to get in a position where the programming problem admits of no solution. ...|$|R
5|$|In 2001, the Ministry of Justice {{considered}} reorganizing {{the search}} and rescue services, and looked into moving the 330 Squadron from Banak to Hammerfest Airport. The rationale was the proximity to Hammerfest Hospital and a typical 40-minute shorter flight time to the coast. However, such a location would give longer travel time to the inner parts of Finnmark. The plans were hindered by opposition from the Air Force, {{as they would have}} to establish a military station at Hammerfest. The Norwegian Armed Forces announced in 2007 that they would carry out a major restructuring and decrease <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> Finnmark, with the long-term plan to close the Garrison of Porsanger.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Eddy was a Massachusetts-born {{resident}} of Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, where the fort was located. He and John Allan, {{both of whom}} served in the provincial assembly, were the prime movers of Patriot activity in the area, {{which was one of}} several hotbeds of agitation in Nova Scotia. The other major areas of Patriot activity were Maugerville in the St. John River valley of Sunbury County (present-day New Brunswick), and Cobequid, and there were also pockets <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> Pictou and the Passamaquoddy Bay area, which separates present-day Maine and New Brunswick. Patriots in these communities were in contact with each other, and those of Cumberland and Maugerville were active in trying to interest nearby natives (Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and Mi'kmaq) in their cause.|$|E
5|$|Mount St. Helens {{remained}} dormant {{from its}} last period <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980. Several small earthquakes, apparently beginning on March 15, indicated that magma {{may have begun}} moving below the volcano. On March 20, at 3:45p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake (the initial reading was 4.1), centered below the volcano's north flank, signaled the volcano's violent return from 123years of hibernation. A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels {{in the next two}} days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale. A total of 174 shocks of magnitude2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of objects for the spatio-temporal {{recognition}} <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> videos. More specifically, we investigate what, when, and where specific <b>activities</b> occur <b>in</b> visual content by examining object representations, centered around the main question: what do objects tell about the extent <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> visual space and time? The thesis presents six works on this topic. First, the spatial extent <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> is investigated using objects and their parts. Second, over two works, it is investigated whether activities exhibit different object preferences over time and which objects matter for representing activities. Third, the full spatio-temporal extent <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> is investigated, where over three works the extensive annotation burden of action localization is replaced respectively with point annotations, pseudo-annotations, and a zero-shot setting, where no video examples are given during training. The works lead {{to the conclusion that}} objects provide valuable information about the presence and spatio-temporal extent <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> videos...|$|R

5|$|On May 22, 2006, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) CPC (CPC) {{released}} their forecasts for the 2006 Atlantic and Pacific hurricane seasons. The Pacific {{season was}} expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in 1995, which generally increased wind shear across the basin. NOAA predicted a below-normal level <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> the Eastern Pacific, with 12–16named storms, of which 6–8 were expected to become hurricanes, and 1–3 expected to become major hurricanes. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility was also expected to be below average, with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area. They expected that neither El Niño nor La Niña would affect conditions significantly.|$|E
5|$|Other {{distinctive}} features are a relatively long, level croup, or {{top of the}} hindquarters, and naturally high tail carriage. The USEF breed standard requires Arabians have solid bone and standard correct equine conformation. Well-bred Arabians have a deep, well-angled hip and well laid-back shoulder. Within the breed, there are variations. Some individuals have wider, more powerfully muscled hindquarters suitable for intense bursts <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> events such as reining, while others have longer, leaner muscling better suited for long stretches of flat work such as endurance riding or horse racing. Most have a compact body with a short back. Arabians usually have dense, strong bone, and good hoof walls. They are especially noted for their endurance, and {{the superiority of the}} breed in Endurance riding competition demonstrates that well-bred Arabians are strong, sound horses with superior stamina. At international FEI-sponsored endurance events, Arabians and half-Arabians are the dominant performers in distance competition.|$|E
