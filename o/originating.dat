5|$|A recent test of {{this model}} {{involved}} a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (nutrient rich) and white sand (nutrient poor) to determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings <b>originating</b> from clay outgrew those <b>originating</b> from the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores the seedlings <b>originating</b> from white sand performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the rolling}} bearing, the flaking caused by rolling contact fatigue is {{classified}} into two types: surface <b>originated</b> flaking and subsurface <b>originated</b> flaking. It {{has been recognized}} that marked microstructural change can occur in subsurface <b>originated</b> flaking due to rolling contact fatigue. But there are few reports in surface <b>originated</b> flaking about microstructural change. In this study, surface <b>originated</b> flaking caused by rolling contact fatigue was investigated based on microstructural change. Thrust ball bearing and radial ball bearing was used for fatigue test. Simulation of dent <b>originated</b> flaking was carried out using the bearing with artificial dent. Another fatigue test subjected to surface <b>originated</b> flaking was done under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. Microstructural change was measured by X-ray Diffractmetry (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) during fatigue testing. Microstructure of bearing steel used for fatigue test is consisted of martensite with small amount of retained austenite. XRD measurement reveals that the half peak width of martensite and volume fraction of retained austenite decreasing with increasing testing time, {{and the amount of}} decrease in these parameter were small in the surface <b>originated</b> flaking compared with subsurface <b>originated</b> flaking when the specimens were flaking. This suggests that surface <b>originated</b> flaking occurs in spite of mild microstructural change. TEM observation about the surface <b>originated</b> flaking shows plastic flow in the surface layer. Especially, it was confirmed that partial recrystallization occurs in the fatigue test under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. But it was also confirmed that degree of recrystallization is lower in the surface <b>originated</b> flaking than subsurface one, and this reasonably explains XRD result. From these results, it was cleared that recrystallizaiton of martensite is differ in degree but not in kind between surface <b>originated</b> flaking and subsurface <b>originated</b> flaking...|$|R
