5|$|Built on {{the slopes}} of Mount Carmel, the {{settlement}} has a history spanning more than 3,000 years. The earliest known settlement in the vicinity was Tell Abu Hawam, a small port city established in the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE). In the 3rd century CE, Haifa was known as a dye-making center. Over the centuries, the city has changed hands: being conquered and ruled by the Phoenicians, Persians, Hasmoneans, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, Ottomans, British, and the Israelis. Since the establishment of the State <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>in</b> 1948, the Haifa Municipality has governed the city.|$|E
5|$|Hebrew {{developed}} during {{the latter half of}} the second millenniumBCE between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, an area known as Canaan.

The earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered was found at Khirbet Qeiyafa and dates to the 10th centuryBCE.|$|E

5|$|That year, {{relations}} with Israel soured. Although Israel had previously supplied Uganda with arms, in 1972 Amin expelled Israeli military advisers {{and turned to}} Muammar Gaddafi of Libya and the Soviet Union for support. Amin became an outspoken critic <b>of</b> <b>Israel.</b> <b>In</b> return, Gaddafi gave financial aid to Amin. In the 1974 French-produced documentary film , Amin discussed his plans for war against Israel, using paratroops, bombers, and suicide squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Black Christians have {{identified}} themselves spiritually with the Children <b>of</b> <b>Israel.</b> <b>In</b> the late 19th century, {{some of them}} also began to claim {{that they were the}} biological descendants of the Israelites. This identification with the Israelites was a response to the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including slavery and racial discrimination. For African-Americans, appropriating Jewish history was part of a rebellion against the American racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their desire to know their origins and regain their lost history.|$|E
5|$|The Command {{was kept}} {{busy in the}} late 1940s. Units {{were sent to the}} Middle East and Palestine as part of an air {{policing}} policy, in co-operation with the Israeli Air Force and Egyptian Air Force to prevent conflict between the two countries owing to the formation of the state <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>in</b> 1948. While there, they undertook a major operation, Operation Bobcat, to prevent illegal Jewish migrants coming into Palestine. In May 1948 the variety of aircraft was reduced despite increasing demand for operations. In May, Palestinians began attacking British military installations throughout the region. In the largest British post-war action, Operation Dawn (13 to 14 May 1948) was launched with the support of Coastal Command.|$|E

5|$|The Israel {{national}} football team has represented Israel in international association football since 1934, when it played its first official game (as Mandatory Palestine or Eretz Israel—"Land of Israel") against Egypt. It is fielded by the Israel Football Association (IFA), which has governed football {{in the country}} since 1928, and has borne its present name since {{the foundation of the}} State <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>in</b> 1948. Israel competed {{as a member of the}} Asian Football Confederation from 1956 until 1974, when it was expelled for political reasons; it then played without formal affiliation to any regional bloc for two decades. In 1994 the IFA was made a full member of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), enabling the inclusion of Israeli teams in UEFA competitions.|$|E
5|$|The UN Charter {{was drafted}} {{at a conference}} between April–June 1945 in San Francisco, and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the {{conclusion}} of the conference; this charter took effect 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as approving the creation of the state <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> <b>in</b> 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success.|$|E
