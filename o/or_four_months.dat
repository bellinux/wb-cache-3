5|$|After {{initializing}} {{the concept}} in January 2013, the two discussed {{the project for}} three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> before creating an outline for the whole story. The original outline was for 12 issues, but it left room for improvisation and a few points were removed as the story progressed. They looked at past and present social movements for civil rights for inspiration for how one would progress and how people might respond to a movement for android rights. Luna wrote {{the first draft of}} issue one, then the two worked together to rewrite it.|$|E
5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone. This vaginal ring appears to be effective for three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> and is currently available {{in some areas of}} the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E

5|$|Several Gemini Ferry {{spacecraft}} were {{proposed to}} provide transportation of crews and cargo to NASA and USAF space stations in low Earth orbit. NASA contracted McDonnell {{to conduct a}} study into what modifications {{would be needed to}} allow the Gemini spacecraft to support this. Three spacecraft were envisioned; a manned spacecraft to transport crew to the stations, a manned spacecraft with a cargo module for both crew and cargo delivery, and a dedicated unmanned spacecraft to resupply the station every three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shorter hydroperiods {{of three}} <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> promote {{the growth of}} periphyton: algae and other {{microscopic}} organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over {{hundreds or thousands of}} years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gonzalo de Alvarado and his {{soldiers}} pushed south to meet Chávez. They were already exhausted from their previous expeditions; {{both men and}} horses were in poor shape, and supplies were a constant worry. Their progress was further hindered by {{the onset of the}} rain season, and the constant resistance of hostile natives. After three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months,</b> Gonzalo de Alvarado arrived at Lepaera, where they were expecting to find Chávez and his men. Unable to locate them, Alvarado sent out his lieutenant Xuárez de Ávila to scout the surrounding area. At length he returned with news that Chávez, faced with the threat of mutiny by his men, had marched back to Guatemala. Since Pedro de Alvarado had already left for Spain, this left Gonzalo as the highest-ranking Spanish officer in Honduras-Higueras.|$|E
5000|$|Earley also {{elaborated}} on the songwriting process: [...] "Those two {{albums and}} American Goldwing, I wrote {{all the songs}} at once and they all hang together. But the records that came in between, they were written {{over the course of}} a year-and-a-half or so ... For All Across This Land, he continues, “I had all the songs written and demoed in a three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>month</b> span. And I think they work together because everything came in such a short period.” ...|$|R

5|$|Three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> {{before the}} release of Little Busters!, {{it was decided that}} an adult version of the game would be {{developed}} titled , or Little Busters-EX for short. Na-Ga designed the heroine Saya Tokido and Maeda wrote her scenario. Tonokawa wrote Sasami Sasasegawa's scenario, and Shirokiri wrote Kanata Futaki's story. Lines from the original game were rewritten as well for Ecstasy, and the total number of lines with spoken dialogue comes to 43,347 lines. The total word count in Ecstasy exceeds that of Clannad by about 4,000 words, making it Key's longest work, and carries so much data that Ecstasy was released on two DVDs instead of one for the original release.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman {{government}} {{ended the}} Albanian revolts by accepting all demands (ignoring only last one) on September 4, 1912.

25|$|The {{thoracic}} and sacral kyphotic curves are termed primary curves, {{because they}} {{are present in the}} fetus. The cervical and lumbar curves are compensatory or secondary, and are developed after birth. The cervical curve forms when the infant is able to hold up its head (at three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months)</b> and to sit upright (at nine months). The lumbar curve forms later from twelve to eighteen months, when the child begins to walk.|$|E
5000|$|Charles J. Gradante, {{co-founder of}} hedge-fund {{research}} firm Hennessee Group, observed that Madoff [...] "only had five down months since 1996", and commented on Madoff's investment performance: [...] "You can't go 10 or 15 years {{with only three}} <b>or</b> <b>four</b> down <b>months.</b> It's just impossible." ...|$|R

30|$|The {{productivity}} {{increased as}} re-cropping years increasing, but the yield decreased obviously after 5 yrs re-cropping, this indicted that {{degradation of soil}} quality was occurred. The increase of fungus and bacteria number became main factors of soil degradation as re-cropping years increasing. The cropping models of cucumber and greengrocery, cucumber and cowpea showed significant higher cucumber yield, the second higher yield appeared in the cropping models between cucumber and maize for green manure, cucumber and tomato, cucumber and kidney bean. Therefore, that was effective method to use different cropping rotation models for decreasing number of microbe in soil, to prevent from soil degradation in greenhouse to fallow three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>month</b> <b>or</b> to plant leguminous during summer season after winter-spring season cucumber harvested.|$|R
25|$|Negative reports {{continued}} {{to reach the}} American delegation {{through a variety of}} Vietnamese civilian figures. A group of university professors complained to McNamara that Diệm had transformed the country into a police state with widespread use of torture. They asserted that this had prompted people to turn to the Viet Cong. The mission was also informed by the French embassy and the Canadian and Indian members of the International Control Commission that was charged with enforcing the Geneva Accords that Nhu was pursuing a peace agreement with North Vietnam and that an agreement would be reached in the next three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
25|$|In September 1943 {{semi-autonomous}} militarized squads of Fascist fanatics sprouted up {{throughout the}} Republic of Salò. These squads spread terror among Jews and anti-Fascists {{for a year}} and a half. In the power vacuum that existed during the first three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> of the occupation, the semi-autonomous bands were virtually uncontrollable. Many were linked to individual high-ranking Fascist politicians. Italian Fascists, sometimes government employees but more often fanatic civilians or paramilitary volunteers, hastened to curry favor with the Nazis. Informers betrayed their neighbors, squadristi seized Jews and delivered them to the German SS, and Italian journalists seemed to compete in the virulence of their anti-Semitic diatribes.|$|E
25|$|On 25 December 2011, it was {{reported}} that three commandos who sustained moderate and serious injuries had still not been recognized as disabled veterans and granted state benefits. The Ministry of Defense demanded that additional proof of injury be produced, though its rehabilitation wing had already made a preliminary decision to grant them disability status. The commandos filed a lawsuit against the Defense Ministry, and hired private attorneys. A source close to the proceedings told Ynet that the soldiers were supposed to have received their benefits three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> after the proceedings began, especially with the photographs and video footage that documented the incident.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} supporting some {{deviations from the}} standard regimen when treating pulmonary TB. Sputum culture positive patients who are smear negative {{at the start of}} treatment do well with only 4 months of treatment (this has not been validated for HIV-positive patients); and sputum culture negative patients do well on only 3 months of treatment (possibly because some of these patients never had TB at all). It is unwise to treat patients for only three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months,</b> but all TB physicians will have patients who stop their treatment early (for whatever reason), and it can be re-assuring to know that sometimes retreatment is unnecessary. Elderly patients who are already taking a large number of tablets may be offered 9HR, omitting PZA which is the bulkiest part of the regimen.|$|E
25|$|Allied forces {{begin to}} take large numbers of Axis prisoners: The total number of prisoners taken on the Western Front in April 1945 by the Western Allies was 1,500,000. April also {{witnessed}} the capture of at least 120,000 German troops by the Western Allies in the last campaign {{of the war in}} Italy. In the three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> up to the end of April, over 800,000 German soldiers surrendered on the Eastern Front. In early April, the first Allied-governed Rheinwiesenlagers were established in western Germany to hold hundreds of thousands of captured or surrendered Axis Forces personnel. Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) reclassified all prisoners as Disarmed Enemy Forces, not POWs (prisoners of war). The legal fiction circumvented provisions under the Geneva Convention of 1929 on the treatment of former combatants. By October, thousands had died in the camps from starvation, exposure and disease.|$|E
25|$|Promotion {{from one}} geup {{to the next}} can proceed rapidly in some schools, since schools often allow geup {{promotions}} every two, three, <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months.</b> Students of geup rank learn the most basic techniques first, {{and then move on}} to more advanced techniques as they approach first dan. Many of the older and more traditional schools often take longer to allow students to test for higher ranks than newer, more contemporary schools, as they may not have the required testing intervals. In contrast, promotion from one dan to the next can take years. In fact, some styles impose age or time-in-rank limits on dan promotions. For example, the number of years between one dan promotion to the next may be limited to a minimum of the practitioner's current dan-rank, so that (for example) a 5th dan practitioner must wait 5 years to test for 6th dan.|$|E

25|$|Zeus, {{pressed by}} {{the cries of}} the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. However, it was a rule of the Fates that whoever {{consumed}} food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Before Persephone was released to Hermes, who had been sent to retrieve her, Hades tricked her into eating pomegranate seeds, (either six or four according to the telling) which forced her to return to the underworld for some months each year. She was obliged to remain with Hades for six <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> (one month per seed) and lived above ground with her mother {{for the rest of the}} year. This left a long period of time when Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone's absence, neglecting to cultivate the earth. When Persephone returned to the surface, Demeter became joyful and cared for the earth again.|$|E
500|$|Finally Shea's {{superiors}} {{were forced}} {{to take a more}} direct approach. On April 7 it was announced that Shea would be moving to NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., where he would serve as George Mueller's deputy at the Office of Manned Space Flight. He was replaced as chief of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office by George Low. While Shea had already acted as Mueller's de facto deputy in Florida during the investigation, the reality of this permanent posting was very different. When Shea's reassignment was announced, one of his friends gave an anonymous interview to Time magazine in which he said that [...] "if Joe stays in Washington, it'll be a promotion. If he leaves in three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months,</b> you'll know this move amounted to being fired." ...|$|E

That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in." [...] Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: [...] "When I signed on... well, one, I didn't realize that I would be wearing Spandex—'cause you know that's Superman's costume—I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well," [...] Crowe said. [...] "But, I also didn't realize the type of organizer that Zack Snyder is, 'cause this was really old school prep. This is sort of David Lean-level preparation, and I really appreciated him. And I was on the movie for three-and-a-half <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> before I even got in front of the camera." ...|$|E
