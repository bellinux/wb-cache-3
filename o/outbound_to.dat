25|$|Leixlip is {{connected}} to the Irish railway network on the Dublin-Sligo railway line, running from Dublin Connolly to Sligo, with two stations, Leixlip (Louisa Bridge), opened on 1 September 1848, and Leixlip (Confey), opened on 2 July 1990, located {{at either end of the}} town. While InterCity services to Sligo do not serve the town, the Maynooth/Longford Commuter services do, the frequency of the trains peaking in the mornings and evenings. Some of these services continue <b>outbound</b> <b>to</b> Mullingar and Longford. Leixlip has the distinction of being the only town in the Republic of Ireland with two operational train stations.|$|E

25|$|During {{emergencies}} where {{evacuation of}} a heavily populated area is required, local authorities may institute contraflow lane reversal, {{in which all}} lanes of a road lead away from a danger zone regardless of their original flow. Aside from emergencies, contraflow may {{also be used to}} ease traffic congestion during rush hour or {{at the end of a}} sports event (where a large number of cars are leaving the venue at the same time). For example, the six lanes of the Lincoln Tunnel can be changed from three inbound and three <b>outbound</b> <b>to</b> a two/four configuration depending on traffic volume. The Brazilian highways Rodovia dos Imigrantes and Rodovia Anchieta connect São Paulo to the Atlantic coast. Almost all lanes of both highways are usually reversed during weekends to allow for heavy seaside traffic. The reversibility of the highways requires many additional highway ramps and complicated interchanges.|$|E
25|$|However, a 2007 {{study by}} the Auckland Regional Council showed that peak hour traffic volumes were {{actually}} down compared to the early 1990s. The morning peak (from 7 am - 9 am) dipped from 17,048 vehicles inbound (towards Auckland City) in 1991 to 16,032 vehicles in 2006 (though the opposing traffic climbed from 5,872 to 10,555 vehicles). At the same time, the afternoon peak (from 4 pm - 6 pm) fell from 17,092 vehicles <b>outbound</b> <b>to</b> 16,759 (though again, the opposing traffic rose substantially, from 6,944 to 10,991). This was generally attributed to travel demand management, to drivers avoiding peak hours, and to increased bus usage since {{the construction of the}} hugely successful Northern Busway - 40% of peak time passengers across the bridge are now carried by bus rather than cars. This has raised some doubts about whether a second crossing is actually necessary.|$|E
2500|$|From 7 September 1939, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of World War II, OB convoys sailed from Liverpool south through St George's Channel to the open Atlantic. [...] Off Land's End the convoy would be joined by an OA convoy from London on the River Thames via the English Channel. [...] The combined OA/OB convoys were escorted for about four days. After detaching ships bound for more distant locations, ships <b>Outbound</b> <b>to</b> Gibraltar would form an OG convoy off Ushant to be escorted south by French warships recently escorting a northbound HG convoy. Convoy OG 1 formed on 2 October 1939 and reached Gibraltar on 8 October. Convoy OG 4 {{was the only one}} of the series to continue through the Mediterranean to reach Port Said on 8 November 1939. Separate fast sections began with convoy OG 13(F) on 1 January 1940, and ended with convoy OG 34(F) on 17 June 1940. Beginning with convoy OG 38 on 17 July 1940, convoys assembled at Liverpool following the surrender of France. The series was interrupted by Operation Torch. Convoy OG 89 left Liverpool on 31 August 1942 as the last of the series until convoys OG 90 thru OG 95 sailed combined with their replacement KMS convoys a year later.|$|E

2500|$|From 7 September 1939, OutBound OB convoys had sailed from Liverpool south through St George's Channel to {{the open}} Atlantic. [...] OB convoys were escorted for about four days from Land's End before the convoy would {{disperse}} and individual ships proceed independently to their destinations. As U-boats found and sank increasing numbers of ships dispersed from OB convoys, OB convoys were replaced by ON convoys and by OS convoys formed of ships <b>Outbound</b> <b>to</b> the South Atlantic and escorted {{all the way to}} Freetown. Convoy OS 1 sailed from Liverpool on 24 July 1941, and reached Freetown on 10 August. An escort group would screen a southbound OS convoy and return with a northbound SL convoy. Convoy OS 40 reached Freetown on 27 September 1942, but following convoys OS 41 and OS 42 dispersed at sea; and OS convoys were suspended by Operation Torch until convoy OS 43 left Liverpool on 14 February 1943. Convoy OS 46 was combined with convoy KMS 13 of ships detaching off Gibraltar with the joint designation OS 46/MKS 13. Sailings from Liverpool continued under the joint designations until convoy OS 130/KMS 105 on 27 May 1945; but, as the Mediterranean route became safe for Indian Ocean destinations, convoy OS 92/KMS 66 was the last to proceed as far as Freetown on 4 November 1944.|$|E
