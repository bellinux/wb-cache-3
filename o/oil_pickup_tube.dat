40|$|Abstract: A {{numerical}} model is {{developed for the}} complete oil supply system of a scroll com-pressor. The system includes <b>oil</b> sump, <b>pickup</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>oil</b> gallery, bearings, and associated oil feed holes, vent, and port. There are two fluids, oil and gas, inside the system. The flow is numerically simulated as a heterogeneous Eulerian–Eulerian turbulent multi-phase flow. The investigation covers the entire working process of the scroll compressor from dry-start to steady state. Two design parameters, initial oil sump depth and viscosity, are studied comparatively. The detailed oil–gas flow inside the oil supply system {{is characterized by the}} field quantities. The physical mechanisms controlling oil supply rate are defined. The oil supply rate and the bearing prime time (the time after which oil is flowing through a bearing) are obtained. The results can be used to design and optimize the oil supply system to improve the reliability and efficiency of scroll compressors...|$|R

50|$|Series 1 (2004-2008) RX-8 Renesis {{commonly}} {{suffer from}} engine failures between 80,000 and 120,000 miles due to premature apex seal wear from {{the lack of}} a center/middle oil injector which gets its oil from the oil metering pump. The rotor main bearing can also fail due to various problems like low oil pressure, and a lower viscosity oil was recommended in the North American market. The oil pan has a common problem of being crushed or bent during maintenance and can decrease the <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>tube</b> flow causing main bearing failures as well. Modified Renesis engines can experience side seal failures due to a combination of exhaust back pressure and higher exhaust temperature. Overheating and heat expansion of housings can cause seals in the rotary engine to fail as well. Most of the issues can be circumvented by using a higher viscosity oil and adding 2 cycle oil to the gas.Flooding can occur in the RX-8 as in previous generations of rotary engine cars.|$|E

25|$|In color {{television}} and video cameras manufactured before the 1990s, the incoming light was separated by prisms and filters into the three RGB primary colors feeding each color {{into a separate}} video camera <b>tube</b> (or <b>pickup</b> <b>tube).</b> These tubes are a type of cathode ray tube, {{not to be confused}} with that of CRT displays.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} obtaining {{electronic}} chroma signals {{with a single}} scanning-type image device is described. A color multiplexed light signal is produced using an arrangement of dichroic filter stripes.

50|$|Historically, flying-spot {{scanners}} {{were also}} used as primitive live-action studio cameras {{at the dawn of}} electronic television, in the 1920s.A projector equipped with a spinning perforated Nipkow disc created the spot that scanned the stage. Scanning a subject this way required a completely dark stage, and was impractical for production use, but gave early researchers a way to generate live images before practical imaging <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes</b> were perfected.|$|R
50|$|Even {{after passing}} through the <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> screen and the oil filter, debris can remain in the oil. It is very {{important}} to change the oil and oil filter to minimize the amount of debris flowing through your engine. This harmful debris along with normal engine wear in high mileage engines causes an increase in clearances between bearings and other moving parts.|$|R
5000|$|Particles {{in the oil}} {{can also}} cause serious {{problems}} with oil pressure. After oil flows through the engine, it returns to the oil pan, and can carry along a lot of debris. The debris can cause problems with the <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> screen and the oil pump itself. The holes in the <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> screen measure about 0.04 sq in. [...] Holes of this size only pick up bigger pieces of debris and allow a lot of smaller pieces to flow through it. The holes in the screen are so big (relative to debris) because at low temperatures and slow engine speed the oil is very viscous and needs large openings to flow freely. Even with these large holes in the screen, it can still become clogged and cause low oil pressure. A [...]005 in coating on the screen can reduce hole size to about [...]03 sq in, which in turn reduces the flow of oil by 44 percent.|$|R
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of commercially viable {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) technology in the 1980s, first the <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes</b> were replaced {{with this kind of}} sensor. Later, higher scale integration electronics was applied (mainly by Sony), simplifying and even removing the intermediate optics, thereby reducing the size of home video cameras and eventually leading to the development of full camcorders. Current webcams and mobile phones with cameras are the most miniaturized commercial forms of such technology.|$|R
50|$|Due to Apollo 12's camera failure, a new {{contract}} was awarded to the RCA Astro Electronics facility in East Windsor, NJ. The RCA system used a new, more sensitive and durable TV camera tube.

The ATC350X also got various updates, including white plastics and most notably a revised <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> point in the engine, to help reduce engine oil starvation when riding long wheelies.|$|R
50|$|Lebar and his Westinghouse team {{wanted to}} add color to their camera as early as 1967, and {{they knew that the}} CBS system would likely be the best system to study. The Westinghouse Lunar Color Camera used a {{modified}} version of CBS's field-sequential color system. A color wheel, with six filter segments, was placed behind the lens mount. It rotated at 9.99 revolutions per second, producing a scan rate of 59.94 fields per second, the same as NTSC video. Synchronization between the color wheel and <b>pickup</b> <b>tube's</b> scan rate was provided by a magnet on the wheel, which controlled the sync pulse generator that governed the tube's timing.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{return to}} the United States from Munich, Ramberg {{returned}} to Cornell and continued the work on which he based his thesis: X-ray satellites and line widths. In 1935, he left Cornell {{to take a position}} at RCA to work on both theoretical and experimental work on secondary emission, <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes,</b> and field electron emission. He later took part {{in the development of the}} theory of thermoelectric refrigeration and image tube aberrations and in demonstrating the mathematical operability of a multistage electrostatic electron multiplier. He also took part in construction of one of the first electron microscopes in the mid-1940s. He remained at RCA until 1972.|$|R
5000|$|However, Vitascan cameras only worked indoors, due to Vitascan {{being in}} essence a flying-spot scanner based system.

Four photomultiplier tubes (two for red, one for green, and one for blue) mounted inside special [...] "scoops" [...] placed {{in the studio and}} pointed at the subject would pick up the light from the camera's CRT and produce the final image to be televised.|$|R
50|$|Apollo 12 was {{the first}} mission to use the color camera on the lunar surface. About 42 minutes into telecasting the first EVA, {{astronaut}} Alan Bean inadvertently pointed the camera at the Sun while preparing to mount it on the tripod. The Sun's extreme brightness burned out the video <b>pickup</b> <b>tube,</b> rendering the camera useless. When the camera was returned to Earth, it was shipped to Westinghouse, {{and they were able}} to get an image on the section of the tube that wasn't damaged. Procedures were re-written in order to prevent such damage in the future, including the addition of a lens cap to protect the tube when the camera was repositioned off the MESA.|$|R

5000|$|Any {{vacuum tube}} which {{operates}} using a focused beam of electrons, [...] "cathode rays", {{is known as}} a cathode ray tube (CRT).

50|$|The 130 was {{designed}} in the mid 1980s as a high tech modern camera with aspirations of quality and high tech design {{through the use of}} microprocessors for full auto setup. Unfortunately it soon became apparent that there were several hardware and/or software errors made during the design and manufacture of this model, which seriously affected the manufacturer's reputation with its broadcast customer base, much in the same way the 2005 had done for EMI around 15 years before.This was compounded by competition from high quality camera systems from Japanese manufacturers including Sony, Ikegami and Hitachi and by the Dutch manufacturer Philips. Also at this time RCA had started to use CCDs in its cameras which produced what was considered a superior picture to the then prevailing technology of camera <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes,</b> which necessitated not so many regular adjustments in their setup procedures.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{video cameras}} were mechanical flying-spot scanners {{which were in}} use in the 1920s and 1930s {{during the period of}} mechanical television. Improvements in video camera tubes in the 1930s ushered in the era of electronic television. Earlier, cameras were very large devices, almost always in two sections. The camera section held the lens and tube pre-amplifiers and other necessary electronics, and was connected to a large diameter multicore cable to the remainder of the camera electronics, usually mounted in a separate room in the studio, or a remote truck. The camera head could not generate a video picture signal on its own. The video signal was output to the studio for switching and transmission. By the fifties, electronic miniaturization had progressed to the point where some monochrome cameras could operate stand alone and even be handheld. But the studio configuration remained, with the large cable bundle transmitting the signals back to the camera control unit (CCU). The CCU in turn was used to align and operate the camera's functions, such as exposure, system timing, video and black levels.The first color cameras (1950s in the US, early 1960s in Europe), notably the RCA TK-40/41 series, were much more complex with their three (and in some models four) <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes,</b> and their size and weight drastically increased. Handheld color cameras did not come into general use until the early 1970s - the first generation of cameras were split into a camera head unit (the body of the camera, containing the lens and <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes,</b> and held on the shoulder or a body brace in front of the operator) connected via a cable bundle to a backpack CCU. The Ikegami HL-33, the RCA TK45 and the Thomson Microcam were portable two piece color cameras introduced in the early 1970s. For field work a separate VTR was still required to record the camera's video output. Typically this was either a portable 1" [...] reel to reel VTR, or a portable 3/4" [...] U-matic VCR. Typically, the two camera units would be carried by the camera operator, while a tape operator would carry the portable recorder. With the introduction of the RCA TK76 in 1976, camera operators were finally able to carry on their shoulders a one piece camera containing all the electronics to output a broadcast quality composite video signal. A separate videotape recording unit was still required.|$|R
50|$|The Apollo TV Camera {{refers to}} several {{television}} cameras {{used in the}} Apollo program's space missions, and on the later Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project missions, in the late 1960s and 1970s. These cameras varied in design, with image quality improving significantly with each successive model. Two companies made these various camera systems: RCA and Westinghouse. Originally, these slow-scan television (SSTV) cameras, running at 10 frames-per-second (fps), produced only black-and-white pictures and first flew on the Apollo 7 mission in October 1968. A color camera — using a field-sequential color system — flew on the Apollo 10 mission in May 1969, and every mission after that. The Color Camera ran at the North American standard 30 fps. The cameras all used image <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes</b> that were initially fragile, as one was irreparably damaged during the live broadcast of the Apollo 12 mission's first moonwalk. Starting with the Apollo 15 mission, a more robust, damage-resistant camera was used on the lunar surface. All of these cameras required signal processing back on Earth to make the frame rate and color encoding compatible with analog broadcast television standards.|$|R
50|$|The 2.4 L (2389 cc) KA24DE {{was used}} in many Nissan cars and trucks. Most KA24DEs bound for the US {{were built in the}} Mexican city of Aguascalientes, with the {{exceptions}} of the 240SX, 1994-97 Altima (re-badged Bluebird SSS), and the U13 Bluebird released in Australia with FWD configuration, which were manufactured in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The KA24DE is very similar to the KA24E. The KA24E is SOHC with three valves per cylinder actuated by rocker arms, and the KA24DE is DOHC with four valves per cylinder and shim-over-bucket valve actuation. Design improvements of the dual cam engine include the use of a knock sensor, larger diameter girdled main bearings in the Japanese block, different oil pan (not interchangeable between Japanese and Mexican blocks), different <b>oil</b> <b>pickup</b> (front pickup on Japanese block and side on Mexican block), dipstick location (toward the rear of block on Mexican and mid block on Japanese) and piston oil squirters. In addition to the increased power and torque, the KA24DE has a higher redline than the KA24E.|$|R
50|$|Compared to the wedge, the ball-stud block had two {{additional}} clean-out holes to remove casting sand, because the large bore made coolant {{in the water}} jacket very significant, and an additional oil drainback hole {{at either end of}} the block, due to demand for lubrication of the rocker arms. Suggestions to increase the size of the <b>oil</b> pump <b>pickup</b> to 3/8 in (compared to the 426's 1/2 in) never passed the endurance testing stage.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} pickup makers {{producing}} modern replacements {{based on the}} original design, namely Jason Lollar, Curtis Novak, Seymour Duncan and Telenator in the US, The Creamery from Manchester, UK and <b>Oil</b> City <b>Pickups</b> from London UK are also available.

40|$|Design {{processes}} in industry {{are influenced by}} scientific, technological, market, political/juridical and aesthetical factors. In design methodological analyses these factors {{and their impact on}} the way a chain of designs is developed are studied. In a piecemeal rationality insight into the combination of these factors in a certain situation leads to decisions about {{the next step in the}} design process. This concept is illustrated by three case studies: the Brabantia corkscrew, the Philips Stirling (hot air) engine and the Philips Plumbicon (a television camera <b>pickup</b> <b>tube).</b> Differences between these three designs show the need to differentiate between the following kinds of technologies: experience-based technologies, macrotechnologies and microtechnologies. This distinction gives us insight into the level of abstraction of the knowledge that is used in the various technologies and thus can be useful for determining the order in which the various technologies should be dealt with in education. If we accept that one of the aims of Technology Education is to give a realistic idea of how technological developments take place in the industrial practice, these design methodological analysis can serve as a tool for teaching this school subject. This requires a didactical transformation of the academic way in which design methodological analyses are made into a more practical approach that fits with the abilities of pupils...|$|R
