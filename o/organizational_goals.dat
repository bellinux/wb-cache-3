25|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the divisional structure {{is that it}} can support unhealthy rivalries among divisions. This type of structure may increase costs by requiring more qualified managers for each division. Also, there is usually an over-emphasis on divisional more than <b>organizational</b> <b>goals</b> which results in duplication of resources and efforts like staff services, facilities, and personnel.|$|E
25|$|Through {{incentive}} compensation structures, {{employees can}} be guided {{to focus their}} attention and efforts on certain <b>organizational</b> <b>goals.</b> The goals that are reinforced through incentive pay should be carefully considered {{to make sure they}} are in alignment with the organizational objectives. If there are multiple rewards programs, it is important to consider if there might be any conflicting goals. For example, individual and team-based rewards can sometime work at cross-purposes.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{functional}} units often {{perform with}} a high level of efficiency, their level of cooperation with each other is sometimes compromised. Such groups may have difficulty working well with each other as they may be territorial and unwilling to cooperate. The occurrence of infighting among units may cause delays, reduced commitment due to competing interests, and wasted time, making projects fall behind schedule. This ultimately can bring down production levels overall, and the company-wide employee commitment toward meeting <b>organizational</b> <b>goals.</b>|$|E

The present study aims to explore how the firm’s <b>organizational</b> <b>goal</b> affects its knowledge creation process. Based on Nonaka’s knowledge creation theory, questionnaires were developed and sent to Taiwanese firms in various industries, including the manufacturing and service industries. These questionnaires were collected either by mail or interview. Our findings suggest that externalization and combination activities should be emphasized when the <b>organizational</b> <b>goal</b> is innovation, whereas internalization activity should be emphasized when the <b>organizational</b> <b>goal</b> is customer satisfaction...|$|R

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the problem of}} {{aligning}} individual and <b>organizational</b> <b>goals</b> remains. In addition, in this case, we would also need to consider departmental goals. Also, {{the high level of}} specialization is a barrier for the flexible reallocation of resources within the organization, i.e. people can not perform other tasks than those they are working with in their functional occupation. The most common way of process departmentalization is the division of the firm into business functions, such as purchasing, manufacturing, sales, accounting, etc.|$|E
25|$|Job {{performance}} represents behaviors employees {{engage in}} while at work which contribute to <b>organizational</b> <b>goals.</b> These behaviors are formally evaluated by an organization {{as part of}} an employee's responsibilities. In order to understand and ultimately predict job performance, {{it is important to be}} precise when defining the term. Job performance is about behaviors that are within the control of the employee and not about results (effectiveness), the costs involved in achieving results (productivity), the results that can be achieved in a period of time (efficiency), or the value an organization places on a given level of performance, effectiveness, productivity or efficiency (utility).|$|E
25|$|Also {{included}} in the game are season and franchise modes.

40|$|Risk {{management}} {{approach has been}} widely used for software development. It helps identify and handle risks, and may also improve an efficiency of a software development process in any organization. Performing risk assessment during early development phases could help to discover and handle risks critical to business success for implementing an organizational business strategy. In this paper, we present a framework for risk assessment during analysis and design phase which identifies risk from object behaviors and their interactions {{in order to satisfy}} the software functions that support the <b>organizational</b> <b>goal.</b> First, the goal-oriented requirements engineering is used to analyze <b>organizational</b> <b>goal</b> to produce software functional, structural and behavioral model. Then, risk assessment is performed from object behaviors and their interactions using the number of test cases generated from a condition transition on a state machine and dynamic coupling of object interaction. Finally, all risks caused from each single object are integrated into a scenario risk factor and a functional risk factor of the functional model. The obtained result can be used to manage and control risk from coarse-grained to a fine-grained level in order to support an <b>organizational</b> <b>goal...</b>|$|R
25|$|Decisions can be complex {{admixtures}} {{of facts}} and values. Information about facts, especially empirically-proven facts or facts derived from specialized experience, are more easily transmitted {{in the exercise of}} authority than are the expressions of values. Simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the <b>organizational</b> <b>goals</b> and values. Following Lasswell, he states that “a person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group”. A person may identify himself with any number of social, geographic, economic, racial, religious, familial, educational, gender, political, and sports groups. Indeed, the number and variety are unlimited. The fundamental problem for organizations is to recognize that personal and group identifications may either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization. A specific organization has to determine deliberately, and specify in appropriate detail and clear language, its own goals, objectives, means, ends, and values.|$|E

2500|$|Programs of {{organizational}} innovation are typically tightly linked to <b>organizational</b> <b>goals</b> and objectives, {{to the business}} plan, and to market competitive positioning. One driver for innovation programs in corporations is to achieve growth objectives. As Davila et al. (2006) notes, [...] "Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone...

2500|$|Also {{referred}} to as contextual behavior, prosocial behavior, and extra-role behavior, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) consists of employee behavior {{that contributes to the}} welfare of the organization but {{is beyond the scope of}} the employee’s job duties. [...] These extra-role behaviors may help or hinder the attainment of <b>organizational</b> <b>goals.</b> [...] Research supports five dimensions of OCB: altruism, conscientiousness, courtesy, sportsmanship, and civic virtue. [...] Researchers have found that the OCB dimensions of altruism and civic virtue can have just as much of an impact on manager’s subjective evaluations of employees’ performances as employees’ objective productivity levels. [...] The degree to which OCB can influence judgments of job performance is relatively high. [...] Controversy exists as to whether OCB should be formally considered as a part of performance appraisal (PA).|$|E
2500|$|An {{organizational}} {{analysis is}} {{an examination of}} <b>organizational</b> <b>goals</b> and resources {{as well as the}} organizational environment. The results of an organizational analysis help to determine where training should be directed. The analysis identifies the training needs of different departments or subunits. It systematically assesses manager, peer, and technological support for transfer of training. An organizational analysis also takes into account the climate of the organization and its subunits. For example, if a climate for safety is emphasized throughout the organization or in subunits of the organization (e.g., production), then training needs will likely reflect an emphasis on safety. A task analysis uses the results of a job analysis to determine what is needed for successful job performance, contributing to training content. With organizations increasingly trying to identify [...] "core competencies" [...] that are required for all jobs, task analysis can also include an assessment of competencies. A person analysis identifies which individuals within an organization should receive training and what kind of instruction they need. Employee needs can be assessed using a variety of methods that identify weaknesses that training can address.|$|E
40|$|Past {{research}} suggests that autonomy has highly variable effects on team performance, and that one explanation for this pattern of findings is that autonomous teams fall {{into a state of}} disorder where they lack clarity regarding the goals of the broader organization. Following this perspective, the authors develop a model proposing that performance feedback coupled with high autonomy enables teams to have greater clarity of the organization’s goals, which in turn increases team performance. This model was tested on 110 teams in a defense industry manufacturing firm in South Korea using mediated-moderation techniques. Results indicate that highly autonomous teams that receive a high degree of performance feedback outperform other teams because of their heightened level of <b>organizational</b> <b>goal</b> clarity. In contrast, highly autonomous teams that receive low levels of feedback perform at the lowest levels compared to other teams {{because of a lack of}} <b>organizational</b> <b>goal</b> clarity. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for theory, research, and practice. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014 clos...|$|R
40|$|This study proposes {{and tests}} {{a model of}} affective {{organizational}} commitment that seeks to capture aspects of the unique institutional context of public organizations. An analysis of survey data from seven public sector organizations suggests external control increases <b>organizational</b> <b>goal</b> ambiguity and two types of bureaucratic red tape, which, in turn, negatively affects affective commitment. Although personnel red tape has a direct adverse impact on affective commitment, procurement red tape is not {{found to have a}} significant effect. <b>Organizational</b> <b>goal</b> ambiguity’s influence on affective organizational commitment, however, is mediated through its effect on centralization and role ambiguity.
