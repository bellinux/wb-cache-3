40|$|Aim of study: Assessing {{the effect}} of soil {{development}} on the stand structure of a Spanish juniper forest traditionally shaped by livestock browsing and wood extraction. Area of study : Berlanga de Duero (Soria, Castilla y León), Spain. Material and Methods : A stand inventory served to record stand structure. Tree age, height, DBH, basal area, and <b>overbark</b> volume were determined in each plot. Results were pooled considering two well-differentiated degrees of soil evolution. One-way ANOVAs (and Tukey’s test) and regressions between growth parameters were performed to assess significant differences between growth performances on both types of soils. Research highlights : Deeper soils yielded significant higher plant density and stand stock figures than stony shallower profiles despite the intense past livestock activity in the area; and single tree-size was also significantly greater. Non-significant differences were found for merchantable junipers age (≈ 120 - 160 years). Wood extraction and livestock browsing should be limited on shallower soils to allow soil and forest evolution; {{as well as to}} preserve the genetic pool better adapted to hardest growing conditions. Keywords : livestock browsing; forest development; Juniperus thurifera L.; soil evolution; stand stock. </p...|$|E
40|$|With their {{widespread}} utilization, cut-to-length harvesters {{have become}} {{a major source of}} ‘‘big data’’ for forest management as they constantly capture, and provide a daily flow of, information on log production and assortment over large operational areas. Harvester data afford the calculation of the total log length between the stump and the last cut but not the total height of trees. They also contain the length and end diameters of individual logs but not always the diameter at breast height <b>overbark</b> (DBHOB) of harvested stems largely because of time lapse, operating and processing issues and other system deficiencies. Even when DBHOB is extracted from harvester data, errors and/or bias of the machine measurements due to the variation in the stump height of harvested stems from that specified for the harvester head prior to harvesting and diameter measurement errors may need to be corrected. This study developed (1) a system of equations for estimating DBHOB of trees from diameter <b>overbark</b> (DOB) measured by a harvester head at any height up to 3 m above ground level and (2) an equation to predict the total height of harvested stems in P. radiata plantations from harvester data. To generate the data required for this purpose, cut-to-length simulations of more than 3000 trees with detailed taper measurements were carried out in the computer using the cutting patterns extracted from the harvester data and stump height survey data from clearfall operations. The equation predicted total tree height from DBHOB, total log length and the small end diameter of the top log. Prediction accuracy for total tree height was evaluated both globally over the entire data space and locally within partitioned subspaces through benchmarking statistics. These statistics were better than that of the conventional height-diameter equations for P. radiata found in the literature, even when they incorporated stand age and the average height and diameter of dominant trees in the stand as predictors. So this equation when used with harvester data would outperform the conventional equations in tree height prediction. Tree and stand reconstructions of the harvested forest is the necessary first step to provide the essential link of harvester data to conventional inventory, remote sensing imagery and LiDAR data. The equations developed in this study will provide such a linkage for the most effective combined use of harvester data in predicting the attributes of individual trees, stands and forests, and product recovery for the management and planning of P. radiata plantations in New South Wales, Australia...|$|E
40|$|Two-way volume {{formulae}} {{for nine}} indigenous species or crop types {{have been developed}} from earlier data on sectionally measured trees. Volume tables for the major indigenous tree species in New Zealand had, since about 1924 and until recently, been compiled by graphical methods. These tables were cumbersome to use in computer programs so volume formulae have now been developed. These formulae are given in detail in a concurrently published report (Ellis, 1978). The volume formulae were constructed for two main crop types; mature trees and pole trees. For mature trees, volumes were estimated from d. b. h. (<b>overbark)</b> at 1. 4 metres above ground and merchantable height and were usually merchantable volumes above an average stump {{to a point where}} heavy branching occurs and no further utilisation is possible. Volumes of poles were derived from d. b. h. and total height and included total volume from ground level to the tip of the tree. The earlier graphically-derived tables were based on data from trees (approximately 3900) which had been sectionally measured for accurate calculation of volume. So the new formulae were developed from these data in imperial units rather than from new data. The following nine species or crop types were represented in the basic data: Mature kauri {Agathis australisSalisb. ...|$|E

Cunn. ex Benth. Oven dry and green weight single entry tables are given for Cassia siamea Lam. using diameter at ground level (5 to 10 cm height) as the predictor variable. Single entry <b>overbark</b> and underbark total volume tables are given for E. camaldulensis and D. sissoo using DBH as the predictor variable. The E. camaldulensis biomass and volume regressions were compared with two Eucalyptus tereticornis and two E. camaldulensis provenances. There {{was no significant difference}} between the equations of the four provenances for volume or stem biomass. The tables for all of the species have been validated for short rotation clean weeded plantations in the Bhabar-Terai region of Central Nepal. The yield of the four species was estimated for different sites, ages, and spacings using the equations developed. E. camaldulensis and C. siamea are the most productive species with an oven dry fuelwood (stem and branch) MAl at age 4. 5 and 2. 5 years of 14 and 10 tons per ha respectively.

40|$|Using {{data from}} 239 trees that were destructively sampled and {{completely}} weighed in the field, four systems of nonlinear additive equations were {{developed for the}} estimation of product and residue fresh and dry weight of individual trees in rotation age (28 to 42 years) Pinus radiata stands under three thinning regimes: unthinned (T 0), one thinning (T 1) and two thinnings (T 2). To cater for all practical applications, the four systems of equations included diameter at breast height <b>overbark</b> (DBHOB) as the only independent variable or both DBHOB and total tree height as predictors either {{with or without the}} incorporation of dummy variables for stand types. For all systems, the property of additivity was guaranteed by placing constraints on the structural parameters of the system equations. The parameter estimates were obtained by the generalized methods of moments (GMM) following a comparison with weighted nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression (WNSUR). Based on the predicted values from the system that had DBHOB as the predictor and dummy variables for stand types, the percentage of total tree fresh weight accounted for by residues increased from 14. 8 % to 20. 5 %, from 15. 6 % to 22. 2 % and from 13. 9 % to 18. 7 % for trees in the T 0, T 1 and T 2 stands, respectively, as DBHOB increased from 15 to 70 cm. The corresponding changes in the percentage of residue dry weight were from 15. 1 % to 16. 1 %, from 15. 7 % to 17. 1 % and from 14. 9 % to 15. 8 % for the three stand types. In addition, two systems of allocative equations were developed to allocate the predicted product and residue biomass to their respective subcomponents. The system of allocative equations for product biomass predicted that sawlogs with bark accounted for 83 % to 85 % of product fresh weight and 82 % to 87 % of product dry weight over the same range of DBHOB. The predicted allocation of total residue dry weight to stump changed little, between 12 % and 13 %, over the same diameter range, but it was slightly higher for trees with DBHOB between 30 and 45 cm. The predicted allocation of total residue biomass to branches increased from 18 % to 65 % in fresh weight and from 18 % to 57 % in dry weight and that to waste decreased from 71 % to 27 % in fresh weight and from 70 % to 32 % in dry weight as DBHOB increased from 15 to 70 cm. Among the five biomass components, prediction accuracy was the lowest for pulpwood and waste. The systems of additive and allocative biomass equations developed in this study provided the first example of how the two approaches could be used together for the estimation of total tree, major and sub-component biomass. They will provide forest management with an enhanced capacity to more accurately estimate product and residue biomass of rotation age trees and thus to include the production of biomass for renewable energy generation in their management systems for P. radiata plantations...|$|E
40|$|Se desarrollaron ecuaciones de volumen aprovechable con corteza (m 3) para árboles en pie de apamate (Tabebuia rosea Bertol.) a partir de las {{variable}}s, diámetro {{a la altura}} de pecho (d), altura total (ht), y altura de fuste (hf). Se ajustaron modelos de regresión lineales y no lineales con efectos fijos y mixtos. El conjunto de datos para el ajuste de modelos fue una {{muestra de}} árboles en pie. Los modelos fueron validados utilizando una muestra independiente de árboles apeados. Los modelos de efectos mixtos presentaron menores errores estándar de los coeficientes que los de efectos fijos. También, presentaron mejores valores de los criterios de bondad de ajuste (criterios de máxima verosimilitud) y fueron superiores en términos de sesgo e índice de ajuste. Para los datos de validación los modelos mixtos presentaron menor sesgo que los modelos de efectos fijos. La variable combinada d 2 *hf fue el mejor predictor del volumen aprovechable. Se evaluó la calidad de forma de los fustes de los árboles en pie de plantaciones sometidas a diferentes intensidades y edad de aclareos. Para ello, el fuste de los árboles se subdividió “visualmente” en rolas de tres metros de longitud y se clasificaron de acuerdo a su forma y posición (altura). El tratamiento con el aclareo más temprano y más intenso presentó la mayor cantidad de rolas de calidad óptima en la primera posición del fuste (110 rolas/ha y 37 m 3 /ha). Para este régimen, más del 60 % de las rolas fueron de calidad óptima hasta seis metros de altura. 195 - 205 anaq@ula. vemjerez@ula. veaymoret@ula. veonoguera@ula. vesemestralIn this study, merchantable <b>overbark</b> (m 3) volume equations for standing trees of apamate (Tabebuia rosea Bertol.) were developed using as independent variables diameter at breast height (d), total height (ht), and bole height (hf). Linear and non-linear regression models with fixed and mixed effects were fitted. The dataset for fitting came from a sample of standing trees. The models were validated using an independent sample of felled trees. Both, linear and non linear mixed effects models showed lower standard errors for the estimated coefficients than those of fixed effects. Also, they had better goodness of fit (maximum likelihood criteria) and were superior in terms of bias and fit index. For the felled trees dataset {{the performance of the}} mixed models showed a lower bias for the mean value of the function than the fixed effects models. The combined variable d 2 *hf was the best predictor of merchantable volume. The form quality of boles for standing trees was evaluated in plantations subjected to thinning differing in age and intensity. For it, the boles were subdivided “visually” in three meters sections and classified according to their form and position in the bole. The treatment with the earliest and most intensive thinning showed the greatest amount of sections (per ha) of optimum quality in the first position of the bole (110 pieces/ha and a raw volume of 37 m 3 /ha). For this regime, more than 60 % of the bole sections were of optimum quality up to six meters in height...|$|E
40|$|U radu je istražena mogućnost primjene digitalnih aerosnimaka visokih prostornih rezolucija za procjenu glavnih strukturnih elemenata sastojina (srednji sastojinski promjer i visina, broj stabala, temeljnica i volumen). Za dio gospodarske jedinice ‘Donja Kupčina – Pisarovina’ (14 odsjeka) na sistematskom uzorku ploha provedena je manualna (klasična/analogna) stereo fotogrametrijska izmjera na aerosnimkama GSD 30 cm i 10 cm (GSD – eng. Ground Sample Distance). Svakom stablu na plohi određena (interpretirana) je vrsta drveća, izmjerena visina i delineirana krošnja, na temelju čega su procijenjeni glavni strukturni elementi sastojina. Kako bi se utvrdila točnost fotogrametrijski procijenjenih strukturnih elemenata sastojina provedena je usporedba s podacima terenske izmjere. Rezultati provedenog istraživanja potvrdili su velik potencijal primjene digitalnih aerosnimaka visokih prostornih rezolucija u stereomodelu pri inventuri šuma. Usporedbom rezultata fotogrametrijske izmjere na digitalnim aerosnimkama GSD 30 cm i GSD 10 cm s rezultatima terenske izmjere utvrđeno je da aerosnimke GSD 30 cm pružaju mogućnost procjene srednjih sastojinskih visina, sastojinske temeljnice i volumena s gotovo jednakom točnošću kao i aerosnimke GSD 10 cm. Međutim, pogreške procijene srednjeg sastojinskog promjera i broja stabala bile su gotovo dvostruko veće na aerosnimkama GSD 30 cm nego na aerosnimkama GSD 10 cm. Stoga se može zaključiti kako aerosnimke GSD 10 cm sveukupno daju bolje rezultate procjene strukturnih elemenata sastojina, jer prikazuje strukturu sastojine bliže stvarnoj. Although the {{application}} of aerial stereo photogrammetry in forest inventory has a long tradition, in many countries including Croatia forest inventories are based on labour and time consuming field surveys. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} research was to evaluate the applicability of using the digital aerial images of high spatial resolution (ground sampling distance – GSD of 10 cm and 30 cm) for predicting forest stand attributes (basal-area weighted mean dbh – DBHg, Lorey’s mean height – HL, stand density – N, basal area – G, volume – V). This research continues the work of the previous research (Balenović et al. 2013, 2015 a), where accuracy of photogrammetrically estimated arithmetic mean diameter and arithmetic mean height of forest stands were evaluated. The research was conducted in the even-aged (sessile oak management class) and the multi-aged stands (European beech and common hornbeam management classes) of a privately owned forest in the management unit Donja Kupčina – Pisarovina, 25 km south of Zagreb, Croatia (Figure 1). Field data were collected during {{the spring and summer of}} 2009 as part of the regular forest inventory conducted according to the valid Regulation on Forest Management. A total of 183 circular plots with radii of 8 or 12 m were systematically set in the 14 selected subcompartments. The positions of the sample plot centres were recorded with GPS receiver. Within each plot, the diameter at breast height (dbh) was measured and tree species was determined for all trees with dbh&# 8805; 10 cm. The height of each tree was calculated by means of the constructed local height curves fitted with Michailloff’s function. The basal area (g) of each tree was calculated from the measured dbhs using standard equation, whereas the merchantable tree volume up to a diameter of 7 cm <b>overbark</b> (v) was calculated from field-measured dbh and estimated h using the Schumacher-Hall function and parameters from Croatian volume tables. The forest stand attributes were calculated by averaging data of all sampled tree within each stand (DBHg, HL) or summing the tree data and dividing it by the total area of all plots for each stand (N, G, V). Stand-level field data were used in the statistical analysis and comparison with photogrammetric data as a ground-truth reference data (Table 1). The colour infrared (CIR) digital aerial images of GSD 30 cm and GSD 10 cm were acquired using a Microsoft UltraCamX digital large-format aerial camera during two aerial surveys in July 2009 (Figure 1, Table 2). The digital terrain data (breaklines, formlines, spot heights and mass points) for the digital terrain model (DTM) generation were collected by stereo-mapping of digital aerial images according to the rules of the Croatian State Geodetic Administration. The whole procedure of image acquisition, aerial triangulation, and collection of 3 D data was conducted by Geofoto Ltd. (Zagreb, Croatia). The photogrammetric stereo measurements and the visual interpretation of tree attributes were performed on digital aerial images of 30 cm GSD and 10 cm GSD using PHOTOMOD 5. 24 digital photogrammetric system according to procedures described in Balenović et al. 2013, 2015 a. The photogrammetric plots were overlaid upon the aerial images based on the spatial coordinates (x, y) of the field plot centres recorded by the GPS receiver. The determination of tree species and crown tops as well as the delineation of crown areas was performed manually for each tree whose top fell inside the plot. The height of each tree was calculated as the difference between the tree top elevations and the corresponding tree bottom elevations determined from the DTM. A raster DTM of 1 m grid size was generated through linear interpolation of a triangular irregular network (TIN) which was previously created from the digital terrain data. The dbh of each tree on the plot was calculated using local regression models with tree height and crown diameter as inputs (Balenović et al. 2012). Crown diameter was calculated from delineated crown area by applying the equation for circle surface area. Further calculations of photogrammetric tree (g, v) and stand variables (DBHg, HL, N, G, V) were identical to previously described calculations of field data. The accuracy of the photogrammetrically estimated stand attributes was evaluated by calculating differences (D), mean differences (MD) and RMSE between photogrammetric- and field-estimates. The relative values of D%, MD%, RMSE% were calculated according to the mean of the field reference values. The D and D% were calculated for each subcompartment, whereas MD, MD%, RMSE and RMSE% were calculated for the whole study area. The results in Table 3 show that photogrammetric measurements of the aerial images of 30 cm GSD (PM 30) and 10 cm GSD (PM 10) produced reasonable accurate estimates for HL, G, V with relative RMSEs ranging from 3. 65 % to 5. 36 %. Similar accuracy was obtained for DBHg estimated by PM 10 (RMSE= 4. 94 %), while lower accuracy was obtained for N estimated by PM 10 (RMSE= 7. 71 %) and DBHg estimated by PM 30 (RMSE= 9. 460 %). The lowest accuracy was obtained for N estimated by PM 30 (RMSE= 15. 90 %). Both photogrammetric measurements (PM 10 and PM 30) estimated HL and G with similar level of accuracy, whereas V was estimated with slightly higher accuracy by PM 10 then by PM 30. For estimation of DBHg and V, PM 10 produced considerably better results, i. e. estimates of approximately twice higher accuracy then PM 30. Figure 2 shows relations between D% and field estimates of corresponding attributes for each subcompartment. As can be seen, photogrammetrically estimated HL and V varied between overestimation and underestimation (HL: from - 13. 6 % to 2. 8 % for PM 10, from - 12. 8 % to 3. 7 % for PM 30; V: from - 7. 0 % to 2. 2 % for PM 10, from - 10. 2 % to 8. 2 % for PM 30), but with a slight tendency to underestimate field estimates. Photogrammetrically estimated G also varied between overestimation and underestimation (from - 6. 2 % to 12. 9 % for PM 10, from - 5. 0 % to 10. 2 % for PM 30), but with a slight tendency to overestimate field estimates. DBHg was overestimated for all subcompartments by both photogrammetric measurements (from 1. 1 to 9. 5 % for PM 10; from 3. 0 % to 16. 5 % for PM 30). On the contrary, both photogrammetric measurements underestimated N throughout all subcompartments (from - 2. 6 % to - 10. 6 % for PM 10; from - 5. 1 % to - 24. 4 % for PM 30). For both DBHg and N, PM 30 produced estimates of lower accuracy than PM 10. This is a consequence of lesser visibility of details (e. g. crown boundaries) on images of lower spatial resolution (GSD 30 cm) and decreased ability to detect individual trees, especially in the part of stands with greater proportion of younger trees. According to Figure 3, the notable underestimation of N by PM 30 was found in the lowest dbh size class (10. 0 - 14. 9 cm). The results of this research showed that HL, G and V can be accurately estimated by manual measurements of digital aerial images of high spatial resolution. The use of images of high spatial resolution, along with the use of local dbh models, led to improved accuracy regarding individual tree detection and dbh estimation. Moreover, the errors of N underestimation and DBH overestimation have been mutually abolished, which in the end resulted with reasonably accurate estimates of G and V at stand level. Since the errors of N underestimation and DBH overestimation with PM 30 were both proportionally (twice) greater than with PM 10, G and V were estimated on both 10 cm and 30 cm GSD images with similar level of accuracy. Although PM 10 overall produced the more accurate results than PM 30, it should be noted that the price of 10 cm images is several time higher than of 30 cm images. Therefore, a potential user should decide which images to use depending on desired accuracy and available funds...|$|E
