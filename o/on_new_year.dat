25|$|The {{imagery of}} the verse is echoed in the screen design, which {{features}} an outline of Mount Fuji, a soaring hawk and an eggplant. These three elements belong to the hatsuyume (初夢) or 'First Dream' tradition, a belief that, when seen in order in the first dream of the year, these items augur good fortune. This was a popular notion by the mid-seventeenth century, and is a common motif in prints and paintings from the period. These images continue to appear <b>on</b> <b>new</b> <b>year</b> greeting cards (nengajō - 年賀状) to this day.|$|E

500|$|Tippett had {{intended}} The Ice Break {{to be his}} final opera, but in 1985 he began work <b>on</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year.</b> [...] Bowen saw this work as a summary of ideas and images that had attracted Tippett throughout his working life. Donal Henahan was dismissive of the music: [...] "...the score generally natters along in the numbing, not-quite-atonal but antimelodic style familiar from other Tippett works." [...] In Byzantium (1990), Tippett set the five stanzas of W. B. Yeats's poem, with added orchestral interludes. By {{this time he was}} professing little interest in his own work beyond its creation; performance and reception had become irrelevant to him. In 1996 he told an interviewer: [...] "I'm outside the music I've made, I have no interest in it". After the String Quartet No. 5 (1991), which connects thematically with earlier works, Tippett closed his main output with The Rose Lake (1993), described in Tippett's Daily Telegraph obituary as [...] "of luminous beauty... a worthy ending to a remarkable career." ...|$|E
500|$|RCA noticed Kesha's strong {{following}} {{on social}} media when negotiating her contract and thus relied on viral marketing to build a following for her debut single, [...] "Tik Tok" [...] offering it for free a month before releasing it for digital download. [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was released for digital download in August 2009 and reached number one on iTunes in New Zealand without radio airplay. Radio stations soon began expressing interest in the song, but RCA/Jive Label Group chairman/CEO Barry Weiss decided to delay its shipping to radio by a month, to October, to let the song continue to build viral support digitally and good word of mouth. While [...] "Tik Tok"'s airplay was not stellar {{right out of the}} gates, it soon gained enough momentum to give RCA the go ahead to release Animal in January 2010. Finance executives had pushed for a Christmas release to capitalize on the usual strong sales during that time period, but Weiss thought that the album would be lost in the shuffle among the many other releases released at that time. Animal was released in Denmark, Italy and Philippines <b>on</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year,</b> January 1, 2010. It was released in North America and Spain four days later.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pamphlet}} was {{a direct}} challenge to the rabbinical establishment. When [...] "Radiance of Justice" [...] appeared in Berlin it caused much controversy, owing mainly to Chorin's response, which was both enthusiastic and penned by a relatively high-ranking rabbi. <b>On</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> (1–2 October) 1818, brawls between the Orthodox and Reform factions {{broke out in the}} main synagogue. However, it calmed quite soonly. Apart from being conservative in general, The Prussian authorities were concerned that any modification of Judaism would make it more attractive and reduce the rapid rate of conversions to Christianity. Goaded by Weyl, they quickly placed various limits on Beer and Gumperz. In 1823, the government permanently shut down the association. [...] "Radiance of Justice" [...] had little influence in Berlin; The [...] "polemical storm" [...] it did elicit, wrote Meyer, [...] "swirled around the temple in Hamburg." ...|$|E
