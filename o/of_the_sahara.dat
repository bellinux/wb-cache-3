5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased aridity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> and the Horn of Africa. Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E
5|$|Pigeons and doves are {{distributed}} everywhere on Earth, {{except for the}} driest areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Desert, Antarctica and its surrounding islands, and the high Arctic. They have colonised most of the world's oceanic islands, reaching eastern Polynesia and the Chatham Islands in the Pacific, Mauritius, the Seychelles and Réunion in the Indian Ocean, and the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The olive baboon (Papio anubis), {{also called}} the Anubis baboon, {{is a member of}} the family Cercopithecidae (Old World monkeys). The species is the most wide-ranging of all baboons, being found in 25 {{countries}} throughout Africa, extending from Mali eastward to Ethiopia and Tanzania. Isolated populations are also present in some mountainous regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara.</b> It inhabits savannahs, steppes, and forests. The common name is derived from its coat color, which is a shade of green-grey at a distance. A variety of communications, vocal and non-vocal, facilitate a complex social structure.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> people <b>of</b> Phoenicia, who flourished from 1200–800 BCE, {{created a}} {{confederation}} <b>of</b> kingdoms across <b>the</b> entire <b>Sahara</b> to Egypt. They generally settled along the Mediterranean coast, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> among <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> ancient Libya, who were <b>the</b> ancestors <b>of</b> people who speak Berber languages in North Africa and <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> today, including <b>the</b> Tuareg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central <b>Sahara.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the week}} before the 2011 Indian Grand Prix, Force India {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Group had purchased a 42.5% stake in the team, valued at US$100million. The investment gave <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Group and team principal Vijay Mallya an equal stake in the team, with team director Michiel Mol controlling <b>the</b> remaining 15% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team. Under <b>the</b> terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sale, <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Group became Force India's naming-rights sponsor. Mercedes GP also changed <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> their team, announcing that they were to become known as Mercedes AMG. The new name originates from AMG, Mercedes-Benz's performance and luxury road car brand.|$|R
5|$|Two of the {{subspecies}} {{listed above}} (Falco peregrinus pelegrinoides and F. p. babylonicus) are often instead treated {{together as a}} distinct species, Falco pelegrinoides (the Barbary falcon), although they were included within F. peregrinus in the 1994 Handbook of the Birds of the World. These birds inhabit arid regions from the Canary Islands along the rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> through the Middle East to Central Asia and Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17weeks. Photography {{then moved to}} the Sahara desert outside {{the small town of}} Erfoud, and then to the United Kingdom before {{completion}} of shooting on August 29, 1998. The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions. To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours. Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.|$|E
5|$|Located on the Atlantic coast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Desert, it lies on {{the west}} coast of Africa. With the {{exception}} of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There are areas of quicksand close to the harbour. Nouakchott is largely flat and only a few meters above sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story.|$|E
50|$|A {{strengthening}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{summer monsoon}} 9000-7000 years ago increased rainfall across <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> {{which became a}} grassland, with lakes, rivers, and wetlands. After a period <b>of</b> climatic instability, <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> settled into a desert state by the 4th millennium BCE.|$|R
25|$|The Phoenician {{alphabet}} {{seems to}} have been adopted by <b>the</b> ancient Libyans <b>of</b> north Africa, and Tifinagh is still used today by Berber-speaking Tuareg camel herders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central <b>Sahara.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Tifinagh {{alphabet}} {{is still}} actively used {{to varying degrees}} in trade and modernized forms for writing of Berber languages (Tamazight, Tamashek, etc.) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maghreb, <b>Sahara,</b> and Sahel regions (Savage 2008).|$|R
5|$|Several parasites {{have been}} {{isolated}} from the hartebeest. These parasites regularly alternate between hartebeest and gazelles or wildebeest. Hartebeest can be infected with theileriosis due to Rhipicephalus evertsi and Theileria species. South <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> common parasites include Loewioestrus variolosus, Gedoelstia cristata and G. hassleri. The latter two species can cause serious diseases such as encephalitis. However, parasites are not always harmful – 252 larvae {{were found in the}} head of one Zambian individual without any pathogenicity. Nematodes, cestodes, paramphistomes; and the roundworm Setaria labiatopapillosa have also been {{isolated from the}} hartebeest. In 1931, a red hartebeest in Gobabis (southwestern Africa) was infected with long, thin worms. These were named Longistrongylus meyeri after their collector, T. Meyer.|$|E
5|$|The {{masked shrike}} breeds in the Balkans, {{northeast}} Greece {{and some of}} the Greek islands, Turkey, Cyprus and from Syria south to Israel. It also nests in eastern Iraq and western Iran. The range in the east is uncertain, and may include Afghanistan and northern Saudi Arabia. It is migratory, wintering south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> mainly in Chad, Sudan and Ethiopia. Smaller numbers are found west to eastern Mali and Nigeria, and in northern Kenya and southern Saudi Arabia. Most birds leave the breeding areas in late August and September, and return north in February and March.|$|E
5|$|All {{populations are}} migratory, and most birds winter in Africa south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> {{with just a}} few records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Migration is mainly at night, singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds. European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North Africa, whereas eastern populations move through the Middle East and East Africa. Some Asian birds may {{therefore}} cross 100° of longitude on their travels. Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern Africa, although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records elsewhere in West Africa may be wintering birds of this subspecies or C. e. meridionalis. Most autumn migration takes place from August to September, and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May. Recent tracking data has revealed that European nightjars have a loop migration from Western Europe to sub-equatorial Africa where they have to cross several ecological barriers (Mediterranean Sea, Sahara and the Central African Tropical Rainforest). Individuals use similar stop-over sites as do other European migrants. Vagrants have occurred in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Seychelles, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.|$|E
50|$|C. elegans is {{from the}} Campanian-Maastrichtian (Upper Cretaceous) <b>of</b> Tinrhert in <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> {{province}} <b>of</b> Algeria. <b>The</b> type specimen (number MNHN.F.R53841) is kept at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris.|$|R
2500|$|Similarly, <b>the</b> Sahrawi autochthones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Sahara</b> {{observed}} a class system consisting of high castes and low castes. Outside of these traditional tribal boundaries were [...] "Negro" [...] slaves, who {{were drawn from}} the surrounding areas.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2010, the Polisario Front {{suspended}} {{contacts with}} <b>the</b> MINURSO, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failure on implementing the self-determination referendum, and accused <b>the</b> force <b>of</b> [...] "...turning into a protector shield of a colonial fact, <b>the</b> occupation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Sahara</b> by Morocco".|$|R
5|$|Chad is a {{landlocked}} country in Africa whose northern region lies within the eastern reaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Desert and whose southern region lies within the eastern {{portion of the}} Sahel. It borders Libya to the south, Niger to the east, Sudan to the west, and the Central African Republic to the north. Chad was originally part of French West Africa until 1960, when it declared independence. Some four years later, the former French colony made its début at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. For the next three decades, Chad became embroiled in civil war and experienced invasions by Libya and upheavals by Sudanese-backed rebels; the civil war ended in 1990, although rebel threats had persisted between then and 2008. During Chad's greatest era of instability, athletes from the country {{did not attend the}} 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal, Canada or the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, USSR, although delegations were sent to all other games between 1964 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|In December1994, CSU {{predicted}} that only 12named storms would form and 8of those would become hurricanes; 3major hurricanes were projected. CSU noted an above average season due to expectations {{that the existing}} El Niño would dissipate, while a La Niña would develop {{by the summer of}} 1995. Additionally, the western areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Desert were predicted to have the fourth or fifth rainiest season since 1970. A year with heavier precipitation in this region usually correlates with an active Atlantic hurricane season. In April1995, CSU revised their forecast, decreasing the number of named storms to 10, hurricanes to 6, and major hurricanes to 2. However, in June, CSU reverted to their December forecast, which called for 12named storms, 8hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. The forecast by the WRC in early 1995 was 10named storms and 6hurricanes, with no prediction on the number of major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Martin pairs often nest alone, {{although}} where suitable {{sites are}} available small loose colonies may form. These {{are more common}} south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> where up to 40 rock martin pairs together have been recorded. Crag martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. The nest, built by both adults over several weeks, is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry grass or sometimes feathers. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Usually two broods are raised, and the rock martin may nest for a third time in a season.|$|E
50|$|Araouane or Arawan is a {{small village}} in <b>the</b> Malian part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vast <b>Sahara</b> Desert, lying 243 km north <b>of</b> Timbuktu on <b>the</b> caravan route to <b>the</b> salt-mining centre <b>of</b> Taoudenni. <b>The</b> village once served as an entrepôt in the trans-Saharan trade.|$|R
40|$|Billions of songbirds {{breeding}} in the Western Palaearctic cross <b>the</b> largest desert <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, <b>the</b> <b>Sahara,</b> twice a year. While crossing Europe, {{the vast}} majority use an intermittent flight strategy, i. e. fly at night and rest or feed during the day. However, it was long assumed that they overcome <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> in a 40  h non-stop flight. In this study, we observed bird migration with radar in the plain sand desert <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Sahara</b> (Mauritania) during autumn and spring migration and revealed a clear prevalence of intermittent migration. Massive departures of songbirds just after sunset independent of site and season suggests strongly that songbirds spent {{the day in the}} plain desert. Thus, most songbirds cross <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> predominately by <b>the</b> intermittent flight strategy. Autumn migration took place mainly at low altitudes with high temperatures, its density decreased abruptly before sunrise, followed by very little daytime migration. Migration was highly restricted to night-time and matched perfectly the intermittent flight strategy. However, in spring, when migratory flights occurred at much higher altitudes than in autumn, in cool air, about 17 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songbird migration occurred during the day. This suggests that flying in high temperatures and turbulent air, {{as is the case in}} autumn, may lead to an increase in water and/or energy loss and may prevent songbirds from prolonged flights into the day...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Berber people <b>of</b> North Africa were {{traditionally}} farmers, {{living in}} mountains relatively {{close to the}} Mediterranean coast, or oasis dwellers. However, the Tuareg and Zenaga <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>Sahara</b> practice nomadic transhumance. Other groups, such as the Chaouis, practiced fixed transhumance.|$|R
5|$|Species that {{breed in}} {{subtropical}} or temperate areas of Europe, Asia and Australia are all migratory. The European bee-eaters that breed in southern Europe and Asia migrate to West and southern Africa. Another {{population of the}} same species breeds in South Africa and Namibia; these birds move northwards after breeding. In Australia the rainbow bee-eater is migratory in the southern areas of its range, migrating to Indonesia and New Guinea, but occurs year-round in northern Australia. Several species of bee-eater, are intra-African migrants; the white-throated bee-eater, for example, breeds on the southern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> and winters further south in equatorial rainforest. The most unusual migration is that of the southern carmine bee-eater, which has a three-stage migration; after breeding in a band between Angola and Mozambique it moves south to Botswana, Namibia and South Africa before moving north to its main wintering grounds in northern Angola, Congo and Tanzania.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} for generating solar {{energy from the}} Sahara Desert is huge, the highest found on the globe. Professor David Faiman of Ben-Gurion University has stated that the technology now exists to supply all of the world's electricity needs from 10% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sahara</b> Desert. Desertec Industrial Initiative was a consortium seeking $560 billion to invest in North African solar and wind installations over the next forty years to supply electricity to Europe via cable lines running under the Mediterranean Sea. European interest in the Sahara Desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land. The Sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of Europe. The Sahara Desert also has the empty space totalling hundreds of square miles required to house fields of mirrors for solar plants.|$|E
