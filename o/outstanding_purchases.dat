500|$|The third director, Sir Frederick William Burton, {{laid the}} {{foundations}} of the collection of 18th-century art and made several <b>outstanding</b> <b>purchases</b> from English private collections. The acquisition in 1885 of two paintings from Blenheim Palace, Raphael's Ansidei Madonna and Van Dyck's Equestrian Portrait of Charles I, with a record-setting grant of £87,500 from the Treasury, brought the Gallery's [...] "golden age of collecting" [...] to an end, as its annual purchase grant was suspended for several years thereafter. When the Gallery purchased Holbein's Ambassadors from the Earl of Radnor in 1890, it did so with the aid of private individuals {{for the first time in}} its history. In 1897 the formation of the National Gallery of British Art, known unofficially from early in its history as the Tate Gallery, allowed some British works to be moved off-site, following the precedent set by the Vernon collection and the Turner Bequest. Works by artists born after 1790 were moved to the new gallery on Millbank, which allowed Hogarth, Turner and Constable to remain in Trafalgar Square.|$|E

In 1997 the club acquired legendary hard man defender Pietro Vierchowod. Despite his advancing years, Vierchowod proved an <b>outstanding</b> <b>purchase,</b> more than holding {{his own in}} defence and even scoring decisive goals in the relegation battle. Relegation in 2000 was followed by an instant return to Serie A for two years with outstanding form shown by players like midfielder Enzo Maresca.|$|R

50|$|TXU {{divested}} {{itself of}} its European holdings in late 2002 mainly {{due to the}} collapse of its UK holdings and then its Australian holdings in 2004. The UK business had been purchased and the cost indebeted back onto its UK operations, however the falling energy prices (all other UK energy companies had foreseen this problem and had re-negogiated their contracts) and the <b>outstanding</b> <b>purchase</b> debt crippled the European business. TXU had planned to invest £250 million from its US business, but its financiers and shareholders pulled the plug in September 2002. The UK retail business and several of its gas fields were purchased by Powergen, who closed its commercial operations in Rayleigh, Essex and relocated them to Powergen offices in Nottingham & Coventry.

50|$|When {{the amount}} of stock {{purchased}} is between 20% and 50% of the common stock <b>outstanding,</b> the <b>purchasing</b> company’s influence over the acquired company is often significant. The deciding factor, however, is significant influence. If other factors exist that reduce the influence or if significant influence is gained at an ownership of less than 20%, the equity method may be appropriate (FASB interpretation 35 (FIN 35) underlines the circumstances where the investor is unable to exercise significant influence).|$|R

50|$|In August 1996, Heritage Media began {{trading on}} the New York Stock Exchange. The {{following}} month, it asked for stockholder approval of a 2-for-1 forward stock split, which was later approved. That fall, News Corporation {{expressed an interest in}} <b>purchasing</b> <b>outstanding</b> stock belonging to Heritage Media at $20.50 per share. On March 17, 1997, News Corporation announced that it would purchase Heritage's broadcasting properties for $1.35 billion; News Corporation's main interest in purchasing Heritage Media was the in-store marketing subsidiary ACTMEDIA, which, through its integration with the Rupert Murdoch-owned company's existing marketing operations, would make it the world's largest in-store marketing company. FCC approval was dependent upon Heritage divesting most or all of its stations, as an acquisition of the company's broadcast properties would place News Corporation over the agency's national ownership cap, which, at the time, limited the collective reach of an individual group's television station portfolio to at or below 35% of the U.S. (by 1997, News Corporation had operated 22 Fox owned-and-operated stations and one independent station through its Fox Television Stations subsidiary, including twelve that the company had recently acquired through its acquisition of New World Communications).|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{companies}} with relatively high debt-to-asset (leverage) ratios exhibit more variability in investment and employment patterns. Other studies argue that high aggregate corporate leverage is associated with macroeconomic instability. This paper establishes and compares the evolution of aggregate corporate leverage trends in Canada and the United States from 1961 to 1996. Leverage has increased nearly 50 percent in both countries, and the majority of this increase is attributable to a greater use of short-term debt instruments. Although the magnitude of the increase is similar in both countries, the period harboring the lion's share of the increase is country-specific. Most of the increase in corporate leverage in Canada occurred between 1974 to 1983; a period associated with low real interest rates and rapid capital expansion in western Canada. The brunt of the increase in American corporate leverage occurred between 1982 and 1990. Over this period, U. S. companies {{were in the process of}} massive capital restructuring by <b>purchasing</b> <b>outstanding</b> equity with borrowed funds. This period was also associated with an increase in the number and value of U. S. leveraged buy-outs that aided in pushing financial leverage higher.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Descrever a variação {{temporal}} na prevalência de desnutrição infantil na região Nordeste do Brasil, em dois períodos sucessivos, identificando os principais fatores responsáveis pela evolução observada em cada período. MÉTODOS: Os dados analisados provêm de amostras probabilísticas da população de crianças menores de cinco anos estudadas por inquéritos domiciliares do programa Demographic Health Surveys realizados em 1986 (n= 1. 302), 1996 (n= 1. 108) e 2006 (n= 950). A identificação dos fatores responsáveis pela variação na prevalência da desnutrição (altura para idade OBJETIVO: Describir la variación temporal en la prevalencia de desnutrición infantil en la región Noreste de Brasil, en dos períodos sucesivos, identificando los principales factores responsables por la evolución observada en cada período. MÉTODOS: Los datos analizados provienen de muestras probabilísticas de la población de niños menores de cinco años estudiados por pesquisas domiciliares del programa Demographic Health Surveys realizados en 1986 (n= 1. 302), 1996 (n= 1. 108) y 2006 (n= 950). La identificación de los factores responsables por la variación en la prevalencia de la desnutrición (altura para edad OBJECTIVE: To describe {{changes in}} prevalence of child undernutrition in Northeastern Brazil in two successive time periods, identifying, in each period, the major factors {{responsible for these}} changes. METHODS: Data analyzed are from probabilistic samples of underfives from three Demographic Health Surveys carried out in 1986 (n= 1, 302), 1996 (n= 1, 108), and 2006 (n= 950). Identification of factors responsible for temporal changes in child undernutrition (height-for-age below < - 2 z) took into account time changes in five potential determinants of child nutritional status, statistical modeling of the independent association between determinants and risk of undernutrition, and calculation of attributable fractions. RESULTS: Prevalence of child undernutrition fell by one-third between 1986 and 1996 (from 33. 9 % to 22. 2 %) and by almost three-quarters between 1996 and 2006 (from 22. 2 % to 5. 9 %). Improvements in maternal schooling and in the coverage of water and sewage services were particularly important for the decline in child undernutrition in the first period, while increasing purchasing power of the poorest families and, again, maternal schooling were more relevant in the second period. CONCLUSIONS: The acceleration {{of the decline in}} child undernutrition between the two periods was consistent with accelerated improvement of maternal schooling, water supply and sewage, health care, and maternal reproductive antecedents, {{as well as with the}} <b>outstanding</b> increase in <b>purchasing</b> power among the poor during the second period. If the rate of decline in growth deficits is kept at around the rate of the most recent period, child undernutrition will be controlled in the Brazilian Northeast in less than ten years. Achieving this will depend on sustaining the increase in purchasing power among the poor and on ensuring public investment in completing the universalization of access to essential services such as education, health, and sanitation...|$|R
