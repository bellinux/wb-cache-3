On 9 April 1991, Croatian President Tuđman ordered the special police forces to be renamed Zbor Narodne Garde ("National Guard"); this marks the creation of a separate military of Croatia.|$|E

5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his {{desperate attempt to}} appease the {{cultural}} authorities, The Story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Real</b> Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors ordered him to limit his composing to an hour a day.|$|E

5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern.

The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E

5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E
5|$|Examination of {{the radar}} array also allowed British {{scientists}} {{to conclude that}} they would have to deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed, code-named Window. Examination of the Würzburg array showed that it was impervious to being jammed by conventional means used by the British during the early years of the conflict; thus Window would have to be deployed against German radars. The effectiveness of Window against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah); when the bombers utilised Window, all of the radar arrays in Hamburg were blinded and their operators confused, unable to distinguish between the radar signature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> bomber and several pieces of Window giving off a similar signature.|$|E

Butlin's mother and stepfather then asked him to join them in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was unhappy at school in Canada, mocked because of his English accent, and he left school at fourteen. Eventually {{he got a job}} as a messenger boy at Eatons, Toronto's largest department store.
