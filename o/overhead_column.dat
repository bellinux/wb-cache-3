40|$|Two photometers with bandpasses of 170 to 500 and 170 to 800 A were {{employed}} to observe dayglow emissions in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) over an altitude range of 90 to 186 km. The emissions observed with these photometers are identified as resonantly scattered He I 584 -A and He II 304 -A radiations. At 186 km, 209 plus or minus 70 rayleighs of 584 -A and 9. 3 plus or minus 3. 1 rayleighs of 304 -A radiation were measured. These observations are compared with theoretical calculations of resonance scattering of solar emissions from geocoronal He and He(+). Using the Jacchia (1971) atmospheric model for He, {{it is found that}} the observed brightness of the 584 -A emission requires that the solar 584 -A line width be 0. 014 plus or minus 0. 004 A. In this model the maximum overhead brightness of 584 -A dayglow would occur at 900 km, and its magnitude would be 1. 9 plus or minus 0. 6 kR.

40|$|Two {{simple and}} {{computationally}} efficient models for simulating stratospheric ozone in three-dimensional global transport models are presented. The first, linearized ozone (or Linoz), is a first-order Taylor expansion of stratospheric chemical rates {{in which the}} ozone tendency has been linearized about the local ozone mixing ratio, temperature, and the <b>overhead</b> <b>column</b> ozone density. The second, synthetic ozone (or Synoz), is a passive, ozone-like tracer released into the stratosphere at a rate equivalent {{to that of the}} cross-tropopause ozone flux which, based on measurements and tracer-tracer correlations, we have calculated to be 475 ± 120 Tg/yr. Linoz and Synoz have been evaluated in the UC Irvine chemical transport model (CTM) with three different archived meteorological fields: the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) general circulation model (GCM) version II′, the GISS GCM version II, and merged forecast data from the European Centre forecast model (EC/Oslo). Linoz produced realistic annual, cross-tropopause fluxes of 421 Tg/yr for the GISS II′ winds and 458 Tg/yr for the EC/Oslo winds; the GISS II winds produced an unrealistic flux of 790 Tg/yr. Linoz and Synoz profiles {{in the vicinity of the}} tropopause using the GISS II′ and EC/Oslo winds were found to be in good agreement with observations. We conclude that either approach may be adequate for a CTM focusing on tropospheric chemistry but that Linoz can also be used for calculating ozone fields interactively with the stratospheric circulation in a GCM. A future version of Linoz will allow for evolving background concentrations of key source gases, such as CH 4  and N 2 O, and thus be applicable for long-term climate simulations...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{complexity}} constraining the hydroxyl radical (OH) in global models, a single-column model has been constructed to investigate how chemistry-climate model data biases affect OH concentrations. By using a single-column model, only the fast photochemical processes of the <b>overhead</b> <b>column</b> are considered, hence neglecting the interaction with circulation dynamics present in chemistry-climate models. As a starting point to this work, the single-column model {{has been set up}} for Lauder, a research station located in New Zealand representative of the background conditions of the southern mid-latitudes. By using long-term observations and other available data (e. g. re-analysis data), a bias-correction was applied to a few factors that are mostly driving the OH chemistry at this site, i. e. O 3, H 2 O, CO, CH 4, and temperature, inferring the concentrations of OH and other short-lived species. For testing purposes, a tropospheric steady-state model for Lauder has been developed to be compared with the single-column model. The result of this comparison shows that OH concentrations obtained from the single-column model are mostly consistent with those of the steady-state model, meaning that the single-column model passes a basic plausibility test of its functionality. In the sensitivity analyses using the single-column model, the contribution of O 3, H 2 O, CO, CH 4, and temperature to the budget of tropospheric OH at Lauder has been assessed, individually and in combination. Results indicate that OH responds approximately linearly to correcting biases in O 3, H 2 O, CO, and CH 4, except for temperature. The individual sensitivity coefficients show directly related OH responses to relative changes in O 3 and photolysis [jO(1 D) ], which range from around 0 % to 25 %, and between 20 % and 50 % respectively. The response of OH is also directly related to the applied relative changes in H 2 O, varying from around 5 - 10 % to 50 %. The OH sensitivity to correcting CH 4 and CO biases is inversely related to the relative changes applied to these two chemical species, which range from about - 17 % to - 35 %, and between - 30 % and - 50 % respectively. The assessment of the effects of temperature in OH indicates a non-linear response of OH to temperature biases, but these effects are found to be small. Furthermore, the modelled OH obtained from driving the major forcings simultaneously shows an approximately linear relationship with the combination of the individual linear contributions. Therefore, the quantification of the individual contributions of biases in the major trace gases and temperature to OH chemistry allows for a bias-corrected calculation of OH in the troposphere at Lauder, especially for H 2 O and O 3, which are the dominating factors controlling the OH abundance at this site. Additional analyses of long-term time series of OH at Lauder under clear-sky conditions provide evidence of short-term variations of OH but a significant long-term trend (5. 4 &#x 00 B 1 2. 7 % at the 95 % confidence interval) was only found at 5 - 7. 5 km in the troposphere. This trend in OH is mainly caused by an increase in humidity in the re-analysis data at these altitudes. Sensitivity simulations taking the effect of clouds into account were also conducted using the single-column model. Results indicate that OH responds approximately linearly to changes in photolysis rates due to the presence of clouds. The impacts of liquid water and ice clouds were studied separately and in combination. The modelled OH responds plausibly to the presence of clouds corresponding to proportional changes in jO(1 D) that vary between 0 % - 10 %, 0 % - 12 %, and 0 % - 20 % due to ice, liquid water, and the combination of ice + liquid water clouds respectively. Moreover, the vertical distribution of clouds seems to have more in uence on photolysis and OH, rather than the change in cloud water content. Because of the large uncertainty of the impact of clouds on photolysis and OH in global models, and the lack of suitable observations for clouds at Lauder to constrain the single-column model, their impact on OH has been quantified separately from the effect of bias-correcting the major forcings. By using a single-column model, only instantaneous changes in the chemistry of the <b>overhead</b> <b>column</b> caused by correcting biases in the major species to OH chemistry have been considered. The advantage is that it allows straight forward control of all impact parameters and enables separation of long- and short-lived effects. The single-column model could also be applied to other clean environments using the same methods conducted in this work. However, its applicability would need to be reassessed for regions where tropospheric chemical conditions become more complex, i. e. organic compounds and NOx that {{play a key role in}} the chemistry of O 3 and OH...|$|E

40|$|We {{assess the}} major factors {{contributing}} to local biases in the hydroxyl radical (OH) as simulated by a global chemistry–climate model, using a single-column photochemical model (SCM) analysis. The SCM has been constructed to represent atmospheric chemistry at Lauder, New Zealand, which {{is representative of the}} background atmosphere of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) mid-latitudes. We use long-term observations of variables essential to tropospheric OH chemistry, i. e. ozone (O 3), water vapour (H 2 O), methane (CH 4), carbon monoxide (CO), and temperature, and assess how using these measurements affect OH calculated in the SCM, relative to a reference simulation only using modelled fields. The analysis spans 1994 to 2010. Results show that OH responds approximately linearly to correcting biases in O 3,[*]H 2 O,[*]CO,[*]CH 4, and temperature. The biggest impact on OH is due to correcting an overestimation by approximately 20 to 60  % of H 2 O, using radiosonde observations. Correcting this moist bias leads to a reduction of OH by around 5 to 35  %. This is followed by correcting predominantly overestimated O 3. In the troposphere, the model biases are mostly in the range of − 10 to 30  %. The impact of changing O 3 on OH is due to two pathways; the OH responses to both are of similar magnitude but different seasonality: correcting in situ tropospheric ozone leads to changes in OH in the range − 14 to 4  %, whereas correcting the photolysis rate of O 3 in accordance with <b>overhead</b> <b>column</b> ozone changes leads to increases of OH of 8 to 16  %. The OH sensitivities to correcting CH 4, CO, and temperature biases are all minor effects. The work demonstrates the feasibility of quantitatively assessing OH sensitivity to biases in longer-lived species, which can help explain differences in simulated OH between global chemistry models and relative to observations. In addition to clear-sky simulations, we have performed idealized sensitivity simulations {{to assess the impact of}} clouds (ice and liquid) on OH. The results indicate that the impacts on the ozone photolysis rate and OH are substantial, with a general decrease of OH below the clouds of up to 30  % relative to the clear-skies situation, and an increase of up to 15  % above. Using the SCM simulation we calculate recent OH trends at Lauder. For the period of 1994 to 2010, all trends are insignificant, in agreement with previous studies. For example, the trend in total-column OH is 0. 5 [*]±[*] 1. 3  % over this period...|$|E

One calculated consequence of the El Chichon volcanic eruption is an increase in the midday surface actinic flux at 20 °N latitude, summer, by as much as 45 % at 2900 Å.

Metals were examined at pH 1. 5, 4, 6, 8 and 10 values for both electrolytes to identify effects of key contaminants.

40|$|We used a 3 -D {{model of}} {{chemistry}} and transport to investigate trends and variability in tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) for 1988 – 1997 caused {{by changes in}} the <b>overhead</b> ozone <b>column,</b> fossil fuel emissions, biomass burning emissions, methane, and transport. We found that the decreasing CO burden in the northern extra-tropics (&minus; 0. 85 %/y) was more heavily influenced by the decrease in European emissions during our study period than by the similar increase in Asian emissions, as transport pathways from Europe favored accumulation at higher latitudes in winter and spring. However, the opposite trends in the CO burdens from these two source regions counterbalanced at lower latitudes. Elsewhere, the factors influencing CO often compete, diminishing their cumulative impact, and trends in model CO were small or insignificant for our study period, except in the tropics in boreal fall (1. 1 %/y), a result of emissions from major fires in Indonesia late in 1997. There was {{a decrease in the}} ozone column during the study period {{as a result of the}} phase of the solar cycle and the eruption of Pinatubo in 1991. This decrease contributed negatively to the trend in model CO by increasing the hydroxyl radical (OH). The impact of this negative contribution was diminished by a positive contribution of similar magnitude from increasing methane. However, the trends in these two factors did not cancel for tropospheric OH, which responded primarily to changes in the ozone column...|$|R
40|$|ER- 2 {{aircraft}} {{observations of}} OH and HO 2 {{concentrations in the}} upper troposphere during the NASA/STRAT campaign are interpreted u sing a photochemical model constrained by local observations of O 3, H 2 O, NO, CO, hydrocarbons, albedo and <b>overhead</b> ozone <b>column.</b> We find that the reaction O(D) + H 2 O is minor compared to acetone photolysis as a primary source of HO x (= OH + peroxy radicals) in the upper troposphere. Calculations using a diel steady state model agree with ob served HO x concentrations in the lower stratosphere a nd, for some flights, in the upper troposphere. However, for other flights in the upper troposphere, the steady state model underestimates observations {{by a factor of}} 2 or more. These model underestimates are found to be related to a recent (< 1 week) convective origin of the air. By conducting time-dependent model calculations along air trajectories determined for the STRAT flights, we show that convective injection o f CH 3 OOH and H 2 O 2 from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere ca n resolve the discrepancy. These injections of HO x reservoirs cause large HO x increases in the tropical upper troposphere for over a week downwind of the convective activity. We propose that this mechanism provides a major source of HO x in the upper troposphere. Simultaneous measurements of peroxides, formaldehyde a nd acetone a long with OH and HO 2 are needed to test our hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model study of carbon {{monoxide}} for 1988 - 1997 using the GEOS-Chem 3 -D model driven by assimilated meteorological data, with time-varying emissions from biomass burning and from fossil fuel and industry, <b>overhead</b> ozone <b>columns,</b> and methane. The hydroxyl radical is calculated interactively using a chemical parameterization to capture chemical feedbacks. We document the inventory for fossil fuels/industry and discuss major uncertainties and the causes of differences with other inventories that give significantly lower emissions. We find that emissions hardly change from 1988 to 1997, as increases in Asia are offset by decreases elsewhere. The model reproduces the 20 % decrease in CO at high northern latitudes and the 10 % decrease in the North Pacific, caused primarily by the decrease in European emissions. The model compares well with observations at sites impacted by fossil fuel emissions from North America, Europe, and east Asia suggesting that the emissions from this source are reliable to 25 %, and we argue that bottom-up emission estimates {{are likely to be}} too low rather than too high. The model is too low at the seasonal maximum in spring in the southern tropics, except for locations in the Atlantic Ocean. This problem may be caused by an overestimate of the frequency of tropical deep convection, a common problem in models that use assimilated meteorological data. We argue that the yield of CO from methane oxidation is near unity, contrary to some other studies, based on removal rates of intermediate species...|$|R
40|$|We use a {{three-dimensional}} chemical transport model {{to examine the}} shortwave radiative effects of clouds on the tropospheric ozone budget. In addition to looking at changes in global concentrations as previous studies have done, we examine changes in ozone chemical production and loss caused by clouds and how these vary {{in different parts of}} the troposphere. On a global scale, we find that clouds have a modest effect on ozone chemistry, but on a regional scale their role is much more significant, with the size of the response dependent on the region. The largest averaged changes in chemical budgets (&plusmn; 10 – 14 %) are found in the marine troposphere, where cloud optical depths are high. We demonstrate that cloud effects are small on average in the middle troposphere because this is a transition region between reduction and enhancement in photolysis rates. We show that increases in boundary layer ozone due to clouds are driven by large-scale changes in downward ozone transport from higher in the troposphere rather than by decreases in in-situ ozone chemical loss rates. Increases in upper tropospheric ozone are caused by higher production rates due to backscattering of radiation and consequent increases in photolysis rates, mainly J(NO 2 ). The global radiative effect of clouds on isoprene is stronger than on ozone. Tropospheric isoprene lifetime increases by 7 % when taking clouds into account. We compare the importance of clouds in contributing to uncertainties in the global ozone budget with the role of other radiatively-important factors. The budget is most sensitive to the <b>overhead</b> ozone <b>column,</b> while surface albedo and clouds have smaller effects. However, uncertainty in representing the spatial distribution of clouds may lead to a large sensitivity on regional scales...|$|R
