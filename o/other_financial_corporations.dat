40|$|Processes of {{globalization}} are completely {{reflected in the}} world financial market. Mergers and alliances of financial institutions are the indications of these processes. Among <b>others,</b> the world <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> define standards in range of serving a customer and a level of provided services. Hence question comes to mind: how Polish banks are prepared and how they do realize systems of quality management? This paper aim is to answer the above question. The basis is the outcome of Polish-wide research, in which 295 managers of banks took participation. This research showed, that realization phase of system of quality management was evaluated better than phase of its preparation. It is possible to ascertain simultaneously, that Polish banks are not fully prepared for coping with demands of global financial market.

5000|$|Kotlikoff's {{proposed}} {{reform of}} the financial system, discussed in Jimmy Stewart Is Dead, called Limited Purpose Banking, transforms all financial companies with limited liability, including incorporated banks, insurance companies, financial exchanges, and hedge funds, into pass-through mutual funds, which do not borrow to invest in risky assets, but, instead, allows the public to directly choose what risks it wishes to bear by purchasing more or less risky mutual funds. [...] According to Kotlikoff, Limited Purpose Banking keeps banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> from borrowing short and lending long, which leaves the public {{to pick up the}} pieces when things go south. Instead, Kotlikoff argues Limited Purpose Banking forces financial intermediaries to limit their activities to their sole legitimate purpose—financial inter-mediation. It would substitute the vast array of extant federal and state financial regulatory bodies with a single financial regulator called the Federal Financial Authority (FFA), which would have a narrow purpose namely to verify, disclosure, and oversee the independent rating and custody off all securities purchased and sold by mutual funds.|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis through 2007 - 2009 {{was a critical}} period for finance capital in the USA and UK, {{and to a lesser}} extent continental Europe. The viability of many banks and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> was seriously questioned: some disappeared while many others only survived because of state dispensation of large amounts of taxpayerfunded largesse. Australian finance capital, by contrast, escaped the crisis relatively unscathed. Two significant banks were swallowed up by members of the Big Four, and the viability of the banking system was crucially reliant on an open-ended state guarantee, but these were minor developments compared to the traumatic experiences in the US and Europe. With the discrediting and debilitation of much of global finance capital, it might have been expected that this would have taken a step back in terms of its control and ownership of the Australian economy. Because of the relatively strong performance outcomes of the Australian economy it might have been expected that Australian finance capital would have reasserted a new role for itself in ownership and control within the local economy.

The views expressed in this Paper are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of the European Central Bank. 1. The widespread practice of establishing special purpose entities (SPEs) in financial (often offshore) centres generates numerous statistical problems that have been analysed in several issues papers considered by both DITEG and BOPTEG. This paper focuses on the specific problems generated by conduits (as described in BOPTEG # 9) whose main (most often only) activity is borrowing funds from international (non-affiliated) investors. Such proceeds are subsequently channelled to the (financial or non-financial) parent company. From a more general perspective, the paper also considers the possible extension of recommendations aimed at solving these problems to the intra-group financial activities of banks and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> (i. e. not only to such financial SPEs). As in the case of most issues considered by DITEG, at the core of this topic lies the definition of what FDI statistics should measure and the concept of direct investment itself. This paper does not tackle statistical distortions linked to the existence and operation of holding companies. Such issues were already discussed at length by both DITEG and BOPTEG in their respective meetings. I. Current international standards for the statistical treatment of the issu...|$|E
