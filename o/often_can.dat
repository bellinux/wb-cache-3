5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, <b>often</b> <b>can</b> be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
5|$|The FA Cup is English football's {{primary cup}} competition. Clubs in the Premier League enter the FA Cup {{in the third}} round and are drawn {{randomly}} out of a hat with the remaining clubs. If a match is drawn, a replay comes into force, ordinarily at the ground of the team who were away for the first game. As with league fixtures, FA Cup matches are subject to change in the event of games being selected for television coverage and this <b>often</b> <b>can</b> be influenced by clashes with other competitions.|$|E

This was the first season that The Football Association introduced guidelines to prevent the withdrawal of clubs from the competition. The final was scheduled a week before the final weekend of the Premier League, to aid any successful club playing European football.|$|E

5|$|The FA Cup is English football's {{primary cup}} competition. Clubs in the Premier League enter the FA Cup {{in the third}} round and are drawn {{randomly}} with the remaining clubs.

As with league fixtures, FA Cup matches are subject to change in the event of games being selected for television coverage and this <b>often</b> <b>can</b> be influenced by clashes with other competitions. In September 2004, it was announced that the Millennium Stadium was chosen as the venue for the semi-finals, in addition to the final.|$|E
5|$|The FA Cup is English football's {{primary cup}} competition. It was first held in 1871–72 with only 15 teams entering; {{the growth of}} the sport and changes to the competition's {{structure}} meant that by 2000, more than 600 teams took part. Clubs in the Premier League enter the FA Cup in the third round and are drawn randomly out of a hat with the remaining clubs. If a match is drawn it is replayed, ordinarily at the ground of the team who were away for the first game. As with league fixtures, FA Cup matches are subject to change in the event of games being selected for television coverage and this <b>often</b> <b>can</b> be influenced by clashes with other competitions. In the case of Arsenal, all but one of their ties (fourth round) was televised to the British audience.|$|E

25|$|Migrants {{from the}} Middle East are {{generally}} located in occupations representing the higher strata of society, {{in comparison to}} the average Asian migrant. There is also a recognizable distinction between Middle Eastern and Asian migrants concerning the phenomenon of family reunification. While the former group <b>often</b> <b>can</b> bring family members with them, the latter group generally do not have this possibility.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} microscopic feature for identification of mushrooms is the spores.

25|$|Gossans {{of nickel}} mineralisation, {{especially}} massive sulfides, are dominated in the arid Yilgarn Craton by boxworks of goethite, hematite, maghemite and ocher clays. Non-sulfide nickel minerals are typically soluble, and preserved rarely at surface as carbonates, although <b>often</b> <b>can</b> be preserved as nickel arsenates (nickeline) within gossans. Within subtropical and Arctic regions, {{it is unlikely}} gossans would be preserved or, if they are, would not contain carbonate minerals.|$|E
25|$|While {{traditional}} {{broadcast and}} consumer video systems operate {{at a rate}} of 30 frames per second, advances in digital signal processing and consumer graphics hardware has made high-speed image acquisition, processing, and display possible for real-time systems on the order of hundreds to thousands of frames per second. For applications in robotics, fast, real-time video systems are critically important and <b>often</b> <b>can</b> simplify the processing needed for certain algorithms.

25|$|Diagnosis <b>often</b> <b>can</b> be {{made through}} {{clinical}} examination and urine tests (excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted in the urine). Enzyme assays (testing {{a variety of}} cells or body fluids in culture for enzyme deficiency) are also used to provide definitive diagnosis {{of one of the}} mucopolysaccharidoses. Prenatal diagnosis using amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can verify if a fetus either carries a copy of the defective gene or is affected with the disorder. Genetic counseling can help parents who {{have a family history of}} the mucopolysaccharidoses determine if they are carrying the mutated gene that causes the disorders.|$|E
25|$|MRSA is {{a common}} type of {{bacteria}} that is normally found on the skin of people and cats. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the same bacterium that has become resistant to some antibiotics. Cats and other animals <b>often</b> <b>can</b> carry MRSA without being sick, but MRSA can cause a variety of infections, including of the skin, respiratory tract, and urinary tract of people. MRSA can be transmitted {{back and forth between}} people and animals through direct contact. In people, MRSA most often causes skin infections that can range from mild to severe. If left untreated, MRSA can spread to the bloodstream or lungs and cause life-threatening infections.|$|E
25|$|Real-time {{multimedia}} streaming applications require timely {{delivery of}} information and <b>often</b> <b>can</b> tolerate some packet loss to achieve this goal. For example, loss of a packet in audio application may result in loss of {{a fraction of a}} second of audio data, which can be made unnoticeable with suitable error concealment algorithms. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), although standardized for RTP use, is not normally used in RTP applications because TCP favors reliability over timeliness. Instead the majority of the RTP implementations are built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Other transport protocols specifically designed for multimedia sessions are SCTP and DCCP, although, , they are not in widespread use.|$|E
