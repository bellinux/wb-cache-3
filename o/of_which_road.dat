Kennedy,Special Message to Congress on Urgent National Needs, May 25, 1961 Before Gagarin's flight, US President John F. Kennedy's support for America's crewed space program was lukewarm. Jerome Wiesner of MIT, who served as a science advisor to presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, and himself an opponent of crewed space exploration, remarked, [...] "If Kennedy could have opted out of a big space program without hurting the country in his judgement, he would have." [...] As late as March 1961, when NASA administrator James E. Webb submitted a budget request to fund a Moon landing before 1970, Kennedy rejected it because it was simply too expensive. Some were surprised by Kennedy's eventual support of NASA and the space program because of how often he had attacked the Eisenhower administration's inefficiency during the election.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThis {{population-based}} study aims {{to determine}} the incidence, mechanisms and outcomes of aortic trauma in patients from Scotland between 1992 – 2002. MethodsPatients with aortic trauma were identified from the Scottish Trauma Audit Group database. Demographics, mechanism of injury, initial management and outcome were analysed. Results 165 (0. 3 %) patients suffered trauma to the thoracic or abdominal aorta. Of these, 130 (79 %) patients had an injury of the thoracic aorta, 33 (20 %) an injury of the abdominal aorta and two (1 %) had injuries of both. There were 123 (75 %) men and 42 (25 %) women with a median (range) age of 36 (14 – 90) years. Blunt trauma was responsible for 121 (73 %) injuries, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>road</b> traffic accidents were the most common mechanism.

The operative mortality was 35 (59 %) of 59 patients and overall mortality 141 (86 %) of 165 patients. ConclusionsThe incidence of aortic trauma presenting to Scottish hospitals is low.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been {{published}} on the health effects associated with exposure to air pollution. Air pollution is acknowledged {{as a public health}} risk and air quality regulations are set for specific air pollutants to protect human health. A major pollutant, well known for its adverse health impact, is particulate matter (PM) <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>road</b> traffic is a major source. Therefore, the health effects of traffic-related air pollution have been under considerable scrutiny. We examined in vivo the role of road traffic emissions exerting biological responses and toxicity of PM. PM collected at high traffic locations was more potent in enhancing inflammation in the lung than PM from low traffic density areas, which underlined the importance of considering road traffic as a source of harmful air pollutants. Furthermore, the results of our studies suggest that PM from other sources like wood combustion and wear emissions (e. g. from brake and tyre wear) could be of relevance based on the associations with specific elements like potassium, copper, barium and zinc. To what extent emission of various sources of air pollution contribute to the health effects is still surrounded by uncertainty. PM mass seems not the best metric to predict air-pollution-related health effects and our research has emphasized the importance of particle size and composition as determinants of the health risks imposed by air pollution. The results of the in vivo studies in which we examined the acute detrimental effects of PM from different locations showed that coarse particles (2. 5 - 10 µm) exert significant adverse toxicity, which stresses the importance of coarse particles as a health relevant fraction of PM, in addition to fine...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate, through an empirical study, the different functions of the highways maintenance departments and to suggest methods by means <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>road</b> maintenance work could be carried out in a more efficient way by utilising its resources of men, material and plant to the utmost advantage. This is particularly important under the present circumstances of national financial difficulties which have resulted in continuous cuts in public expenditure. In order to achieve this objective, the researcher carried out a survey among several Highways Authorities by means of questionnaire and interview. The information so collected was analysed {{in order to understand}} the actual, practical situation within highways manintenance departments, and highlight any existing problems, and try to answer the question of how they could become more efficient. According to the results obtained by the questionnaire and the interview, and the analysis of these results, the researcher concludes that it is the management system where least has been done, and where problems exist and are most complex. The management of highways maintenance departments argue that the reasons for their problems include both financial and organisational difficulties, apart from the political aspect and nature of the activities undertaken. The researcher believes that this ought to necessitate improving the management's analytical tools and techniques in order to achieve the most effective way of performing each activity. To this end the researcher recommends several related procedures to be adopted by the management of the highways maintenance departments. These recommendations, arising from the study, involve the technical, practical and human aspects. These are essential factors of which management should be aware - and certainly should not neglect - in order to achieve its objectives of improved productivity in the highways maintenance departments...|$|E
40|$|Between 1906 and 2005, {{records show}} that global average air {{temperature}} near the earth’s surface increased by 0. 74 ± 0. 18 °C. If emissions of greenhouse gases, and in particular CO 2, continue unabated the enhanced greenhouse effect may alter the world’s climate system irreversibly. Total emissions of greenhouse gases, across all sectors, were 42. 4 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO 2 -eq in 2005. Energy sector, accounts for 84 % of global CO 2 emissions and 64 % of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions. Energy-related CO 2 emissions rise from 28. 8 Gt in 2007 to 34. 5 Gt in 2020 and 40. 2 Gt in 2030. Global percapita emissions of energy-related CO 2 in 2007 was 4. 4 tonnes. Higher growth of automobiles and consumption of petroleum products is invariably attended by concerns of pollution and climate changes. Global fleet of passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) is estimated to increase from 770 million in 2007 to 1. 4 billion in 2030. Among all sectors that emit CO 2, the transport sector is the fastest growing, representing from 22 % to 24 % of global GHG emissions from fossil fuel sources, {{second only to the}} industrial sector. World emissions of NOx were 82 Mt in 2007, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>Road</b> transport was responsible for about one-third of NOx emissions. Only Road transport related CO 2 emission is estimated to increase from 4. 8 Gt in 2007 to 6. 9 Gt in 2030. The increase in CO 2 emissions is largely a result of increasing demand for individual mobility in developing countries. There are strong efforts and renewed investments by manufacturers and suppliers in providing solutions to the CO 2 reduction challenge. Low-carbon vehicles, such as hybrid cars, plug-in hybrids and electric cars, have received widespread public attention recently. It is estimated that share of hybrids in the global fleet will reach about 5 % by 2020 and almost 8 % by 2030, up from just 0. 15 % in 2007. Plug-in hybrids and electric cars will constitute only 0. 2 % of the global fleet in 2030. But increase in electricity consumption in road transport in future due to increased penetration of plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles, sees transport sector CO 2 savings partially offset by power generation emissions. An estimated increase of 880 TWh of electricity consumption in transport in 2030, of which 90 % occurs in PLDVs, will result in about 250 Mt of additional CO 2 emissions. Authors forecasted that the use of environmentfriendly and clean technologies is going to make all the difference between the winners and the losers of the industry. It is noted that current policies are insufficient to prevent a rapid increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is recommended that policy makers and researchers should give more emphasis on ‘cost-effectiveness as most important factor to reduce automotive GHG emission reduction’. It is also concluded that CO 2 savings will be maximized if well-to-wheel impact is clearly addressed at all stages of the fuel and energy chain...|$|E
