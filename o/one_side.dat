5|$|A Test {{match is}} won when <b>one</b> <b>side</b> has scored more runs {{than the total}} runs scored by the {{opposing}} side during their two innings. If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it {{is known as a}} win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If <b>one</b> <b>side</b> scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.|$|E

We have come up with several re-ordering and aggregating schemes to achieve better network utilization. We have evaluated these schemes on both PCI-X and PCI-Express platforms. With re-ordering scheme, we see an improvement in the throughput up to 76 %, latency up to 40 %. With aggregation scheme, we observe an improvement of 44 % and 42 % for MPI Put and MPI Get latency respectively on PCI-Express platform. 1...|$|R

Gold finish can maintain high contact reliability but increase the manufacture cost. In this paper, the effects of <b>one</b> <b>sided</b> gold plated contacts with various thickness of gold finish on the contact reliability were investigated. The failure mechanism of the <b>one</b> <b>sided</b> gold plated contacts under fretting conditions was analyzed. The contact life and the optimum thickness of the <b>one</b> <b>sided</b> gold finish under fretting conditions was achieved and compared. The effect of the curvature of the probes on the contact life was also discussed...|$|R
