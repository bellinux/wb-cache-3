Within the Ryukyu Kingdom, {{official}} texts {{were written in}} kanji and hiragana, derived from Japan. However, this was a sharp contrast from Japan at the time, where classical Chinese writing was mostly <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>official</b> texts, <b>only</b> <b>using</b> hiragana <b>for</b> informal ones. Classical Chinese writing was sometimes used in Ryukyu as well, read in kundoku (Ryukyuan) or in Chinese. In Ryukyu, katakana was hardly used.|$|R
5000|$|Unclassified is not {{technically}} a classification; {{this is the}} default and refers to {{information that can be}} released to individuals without a clearance. Information that is unclassified is sometimes restricted in its dissemination as Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) or <b>For</b> <b>Official</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Only</b> (FOUO). <b>For</b> example, the law enforcement bulletins reported by the U.S. media when the United States Department of Homeland Security raised the U.S. terror threat level were usually classified as [...] "", or [...] "Unclassified - Law Enforcement Sensitive". This information is supposed to be released only to law enforcement agencies (sheriff, police, etc.), but, because the information is unclassified, it is sometimes released to the public as well. Information that is unclassified but which the government does not believe should be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests is often classified as —"Unclassified—For <b>Official</b> <b>Use</b> Only". In addition to FOUO information, information can be categorized according to its availability to be distributed (e.g., Distribution D may only be released to approved Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Defense contractor personnel). Also, the statement of NOFORN (meaning [...] "no foreign nationals") is applied to any information that may not be released to any non-U.S. citizen. NOFORN and distribution statements are often used in conjunction with classified information or alone on SBU information. Documents subject to export controls have a specific warning to that effect. Information which is [...] "personally identifiable" [...] is governed by the Privacy Act of 1974 and is also subject to strict controls regardless of its level of classification.|$|R
50|$|Goans mainly {{speak the}} Konkani {{language}}, a Prakrit based language {{belonging to the}} Southern group of Indo-Aryan Languages. Various dialects of Konkani spoken by the Goans include Bardeskari, Sashtikari, Pednekari, Antruj bhasha, whereas Konkani spoken by the Catholics is notably {{different from those of}} the Hindus, with a lot of Portuguese influence in its vocabulary. Konkani was suppressed <b>for</b> <b>official</b> documentation <b>use</b> <b>only</b> not <b>for</b> unofficial <b>use</b> under the Portuguese governance, playing a minor part in education of the past generations. They are mostly multilingual and Marathi has played a significant role for Hindus near the borders of Goa close to Maharashtra and parts of Nova Goa conquest.They use Devanagari and Latin script for education as well as communication (personal, formal and religious). However the entire liturgy of the Catholic church is solely in the Latin script. In the past Goykanadi, Modi, Kannada scripts were also used which later fell into disuse owing to many social, political and religious reasons.|$|R

40|$|To enable {{efficient}} management of inland navigation processes,specialized information systems should be developedthrough {{the application of}} modern information and communicationtechnology (ICT). For this purpose, individual Europeanwaterway and port authorities have developed their ownlocal information systems and databases. Due to the non-conformityof these databases, their integration at the Europeanlevel is confronted with selious problems (COMPRIS, 2003). One of the major problems {{is the lack of}} a common Europeanunique identification number for inland barges. For this reason,in some locally managed databases several different identificationnumbers are attributed to one and the same inlandbarge or certain identification numbers are not available. Thesame problem occurs in the communication between waterwayautholities and between waterway and port authorities. Therefore,a unique identification number for all floating objects onthe European waterways should be introduced. At the momentthere are only two official numbers for vessels. The first, the!MO number, introduced in 1978, is <b>only</b> <b>used</b> by maritimevessels. The second, the OFS number (<b>Official</b> Ship Number),is <b>used</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> vessels that have a Rhine patent (issued by theCCNR). The OFS number cannot satisfy all the requirementsof RIS Directive 2005 / 44 /EC and the amendment to Directive 82 / 714 /EEC on technical requirements for inland navigationvessels in the enlarged European Union. The fact is that only 20 % of the ranges of codes are reserved for the non-Rhinecountries. A special Electronic Reporting International group(ER!) was appointed to formulate a new system for uniqueidentification of inland vessels and also define a databasemodel for vessel characteristics. The initial suggestion of ERIwas to add one character in front of the OFS number in orderto increase its coding capacity. The intention was to make asfew as possible differences/modifications to the system currentlyused under the regime of the Rhine Vessel InspectionRegulations in order to minimize the administrative efforts ofharmonization. As members of the ER! group, we made a proposalfor such a new identification number (the so calledERN), which was discussed by the ERI expert group takinginto account the input from the Joint Working Group ofCCNR and EC. In this paper, we will desclibe our proposal toER!, which was later slightly modified within a special ER! expertgroup...|$|R
