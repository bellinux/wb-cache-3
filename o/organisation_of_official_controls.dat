The audit was carried out under the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 882 / 2004 between 5 - 9 December, 2011. The objective of this audit was to assess the <b>organisation</b> and implementation <b>of</b> <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> at import points for foods of non animal origin supervised by the HSE.

40|$|The {{expectations}} <b>of</b> <b>official</b> <b>control</b> are high, {{and resources}} are limited. What {{is most important}} in conducting such control? How can we prioritise between risks which are not directly comparable? Which approach provides most safety, relative to resource allocation? Risk categorisation is a tool to make such assessments more explicit, fact-based and transparent. The quality of risk management can never {{be better than the}} available knowledge of the risks. Prioritisation <b>of</b> <b>official</b> <b>control</b> must be based on knowledge available at any given time, and {{not on the basis of}} knowledge that is being worked towards obtaining in the future. The report presents a new model that incorporates the following knowledge types into a system, with a view to improving resource use in <b>official</b> <b>control.</b> - Knowledge <b>of</b> the life-cycles of products, processes and services, - Knowledge of the products, processes and services of different industries, - Knowledge of the individual traders. The model has been developed for prioritising control of the various risks in the food chain, but could also be suitable, and used for, prioritising of control of other risk types...|$|R

40|$|Comparability {{of results}} {{is the most}} {{important}} feature of the measurements for <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> purposes. Reliability <b>of</b> results is in turn strongly dependent on test conditions, on how well a method performs and how it is performed by the laboratory that does it. The Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) and its National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for Food Contact Materials (FCM) have recognised that technical specifications are not always detailed in standards or legislative documents, and consequently there are sometimes gaps and lack of harmonisation in how <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> are practically performed. Therefore several guidelines were been initiated. The scope is to develop a unified understanding of the practical implementation of existing or new legislation in the context <b>of</b> <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> for FCM. The expected impact is to constantly improve the ability for NRLs to give the same competent advice in this field to National Authorities, food Inspection and private compliance laboratories for the practical implementation <b>of</b> <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> for FCM. This guide contains practical information to define the parameters of an overall or specific migration test according {{to the nature of the}} materials and objects in contact with food, with a focus on kitchenware. This focus was chosen because kitchenware is typically placed in contact with food in the home and thus the challenge is to define worst foreseeable conditions of use. This guide is intended as a dynamic document and therefore will evolve and expand into further editions to cover more aspects. This is the first edition. These guidelines have been endorsed by the EU <b>official</b> Network <b>of</b> National Reference Laboratories and approved by the EU Commission competent service DG SANCO. This work also highlights an important deliverable for the Network of NRLs. In particular, the members of the task force ¬øtest conditions¬ø that have dedicated time and effort to provide input into the development of these guidelines.

40|$|The Regulation <b>of</b> <b>official</b> <b>control</b> on {{products}} <b>of</b> animal origin gives {{the opportunity for}} amending or supplementing existing procedures for meat inspection, whilst taking into account scientific and technical progress.

It is important to make use of those possibilities in the Regulation to obtain a meat inspection system in the Nordic countries, which is more risk-based, and to optimise the use of resources to maximise the effectiveness of meat inspection. These aspects, the <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> meat inspection in the Nordic countries and results from national projects are among the topics presented in this report.

Advocates highlight {{the importance of}} situated knowledge to continuous teacher learning, sustained school reform and improved student learning. Critics portray collaboration as an invisible and coercive means <b>of</b> <b>official</b> <b>control.</b> The framework {{presented in this paper}} aims to treat these perspectives not as ideological positions but as starting points for empirical investigation into the dynamics of power in professional collaboration.

Excerpts from an in-depth study of interaction among science teachers and teacher-leaders in a secondary school undergoing broad reform illustrate the application of this framework. Attention to the dynamics of support and challenge in the most generative of these interactions reveals distinctive patterns of the negotiation of interpersonal and ideational meaning. These patterns of control provide a means of connecting the microprocesses of building knowledge with the broader dynamics of power at play in educational change...|$|R
