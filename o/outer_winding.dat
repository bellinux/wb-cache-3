In critical applications where continuous {{operation of the}} machine is required, the faults pose a major challenge leading to stalling of the industrial operations. In this paper, a new winding configuration for the stator windings is proposed {{to have a better}} ride-through capability of the induction motor. This improvises the fault tolerance capability {{in such a way that}} two sets of stator windings, inner and outer windings, are used instead of single conventional winding. When both the windings are energized, the same torque-speed characteristic as in the conventional winding is achieved. The inner winding has marginally higher average torque than the <b>outer</b> <b>winding</b> because the inner winding is placed proximal to the air gap between stator and rotor. The fault tolerance capacity of the proposed configuration is investigated by inducing a fault situation on the inner winding.

The driving force is that of line radiation pressure, in the formalism developed by Castor, Abbott & Klein for O stars. Our main assumption is that wind helical streamlines lie on straight cones. We find that the Euler equation for the disk wind has two eigenvalues, the mass loss rate and the flow tilt angle with the disk. Both are calculated self-consistently. The wind is characterized by two distinct regions, an <b>outer</b> <b>wind</b> launched beyond four white dwarf radii from the rotation axis, and an inner wind launched within this radius. The inner wind is very steep, up to 80 degrees with the disk plane, while the <b>outer</b> <b>wind</b> has a typical tilt of 60 degrees. In both cases the ray dispersion is small.

50|$|F09 {{noted that}} storm with {{stronger}} <b>outer</b> <b>winds</b> tracked {{more to the}} northwest than storms with weak winds. They hypothesize {{that this can be}} explained with an atmosphere in hydrostatic balance. Assuming an atmosphere that is in hydrostatic balance, the average column virtual temperature contributes the most to the surface pressure. The virtual temperatures of the three F09 storms varied with the Kessler storm having temperatures several degrees warmer than the other storms. The winds are determined by the radial pressure gradients, which are related to the temperature gradients. Therefore, storms that have a large radial variation in virtual temperature will have stronger <b>outer</b> <b>winds.</b> The temperature differences between the models {{can be explained by the}} change in radiative heating and cooling. The K microphysics scheme produced particle fall speeds that were slower than the others, thereby increasing the size of its anvil. F09 report that the most important factor that influences the size of the anvil is the terminal velocity, and that the terminal velocity of the particles depends on their geometry, density, and size. Interactions between the anvil and incoming and emitted radiation changes the radial temperature gradient, leading to changes in the track direction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mass-loss {{rates of}} Galactic Wolf–Rayet stars have been {{determined}} from their radio emission power and spectral index (α = d ln fν/d ln ν), {{accounting for the}} clumped structure and (potential) variable ionization in their <b>outer</b> <b>winds.</b> The average spectral index between mm- and cm- wavelengths is ∼ 0. 77 for WN stars and ∼ 0. 75 for WC stars, in contrast with ∼ 0. 58 expected for smooth winds. The observed wavelength dependence of α can be explained using clumped wind models in some cases, with shocks (at 30 – 100 stellar radii) producing a higher ionization zone in the <b>outer</b> <b>wind.</b> We obtain an empirical formula relating mass-loss with observed optical emission line equivalent widths, with application to stars without measured radio fluxes. Clumpingcorrected mass-loss rates are generally lower than those obtained by current smooth wind models. Specifically we find log. M(clumpy) –log. M(smooth) =− 0. 19 (σ= 0. 28) for WN stars, and log. M(clumpy) –log. M(smooth) =− 0. 62 (σ= 0. 19) for WC stars. New mass-loss rate estimates agree very well with (clumping independent) determinations of WR components in binary systems...|$|R

A Nb 3 Sn block-coil model dipole was fabricated, using magnetic mirror geometry and wind/react coil technology. The primary objective of this phase {{was to make a}} first experimental test of the stress-management strategy pioneered at Texas A&M. In this strategy a high-strength support matrix is integrated with the windings to intercept Lorentz stress from the inner winding so that it does not accumulate in the <b>outer</b> <b>winding.</b> The magnet attained a field that was consistent with short sample limit on the first quench; there was no training. The decoupling of Lorentz stress between inner and outer windings was validated. In ramp rate studies the magnet exhibited a remarkable robustness in rapid ramping operation. It reached 85 percent of short sample(ss) current even while ramping 2 - 3 T/s. This robustness is attributed to the orientation of the Rutherford cables parallel to the field in the windings, instead of the transverse orientation that characterizes common dipole designs.

40|$|The {{principle}} of using hollow spiral winding is not novel, but the study {{on this topic}} is far from complete. In this paper, how hollow the central region of the coreless printed spiral winding (CPSW) inductor should be for a given footprint area {{in order to achieve}} the maximal quality factor Q max and to maintain high inductance value is explored. A hollow factor based on the ratio of the inner hollow radius and the <b>outer</b> <b>winding</b> radius τ = R in/R out, is proposed as for optimization and quantifying how hollow a spiral winding is. The relationship between τ and Q max, which depends on the operating frequency and the dimensional parameters of CPSW inductor, is established. For a specific operating frequency, it is discovered that if the conductor width is comparable with the skin depth, or the conductors are placed relatively far away from each others, the hollow design of the CPSW inductor has little improvement on Q but reduces the inductance. If the conductor width is much larger than the skin depth and the conductors are closely placed, the hollow spiral design is recommended. The optimal range of τ with which the Q max can be achieved is found to be around 0. 45 - 0. 55. © 2006 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Subjective and {{objective}} analyses of near-surface winds are utilized to estimate tropical cyclone (TC) size over {{a region of}} the western North Pacific. An empirical <b>outer</b> <b>wind</b> profile assuming partial conservation of angular momentum is utilized to determine the radial extent of cyclonic winds, which may {{be defined as the}} TC size in four categories. The first method uses the radii of either 3 O-kt or 35 -kt wind in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) warnings during 1989 - 1994 to estimate the size categories each 6 h. A second subjective method based on satellite imagery has more cases of large and midget TCs than the first method. A multi-quadric interpolation (MQI) of composited wind observations over +/- 12 h is tested as a more objective method of estimating the 30 -kt or 35 -kt wind radii.

Condi-tion based maintenance by hired staff and online moni-toring as an early warning system are gaining impor-tance in insulation ageing assessment of power trans-formers in service. Insulation ageing is a four dimensi-onal problem due to dielectric, chemical, thermal and electromechanic stresses, which are highly depending on operational conditions.

Therefore, water plays a key role for the ageing of oil paper insula-tion systems since water acts as a catalyst for the ageing process.

40|$|An a. c bridge for the {{measurement}} of the magnetic susceptibility of rocks in low fields has been constructed. The sensing unit is a double coil similar to the design by Bruckshaw and Robertson (1948), where two co-axial windings are connected in series opposition so that the net output emf is zero {{in the absence of}} a specimen. Following a treatment by Hall (1963) aimed at maximizing the sensitivity; the coil was designed for almost optimum proportions for the case when the specimen is placed on the coil axis at a bounding plane. The coil is 7. 9 cms. thick, has an outer radius of 16. 0 cms., and the inner radius of the inner winding is 4. Ocms. The inner and outer windings have 33, 090 and 12, 550 ± 10 turns respectively. Use of relatively thick wire (AWG No. 26) resulted in a low Johnson noise level of 7. 0 x 10 ⁻⁹ volts rms. The signal due to a specimen of volume susceptibility K = 1. 0 x 10 ⁻⁵ cgs units placed 4. 0 cms. beyond a bounding plane is 0. 67 μv rms, giving a signal-to-noise ratio of 95. [...] Because of its large distributed capacitance the coil could be balanced adequately only at frequencies below 250 cps. The present frequency was 33. 0 cps, and at this value the phase difference between the output emf's in the two windings could be made almost exactly 180 ° with the aid of 0. 079 μF capacitor placed across the <b>outer</b> <b>winding.</b> The output signal was amplified by a pre-amplifier and two narrow-band amplifiers connected in cascade, the total gain being 2700. To measure K ~ 1 x 10 ⁻⁷ cgs units would require a gain of about 10 ⁺⁵ but so far an increase in gain has been precluded by the presence in the bridge output of second and higher harmonics; moreover, the output signal at 'balance' has a serious instability with the time constant of the order of 10 ⁻¹ sec. The cause of instability has been traced to the oscillator and power amplifier in the input and the selective amplifiers in the output. [...] The bridge was calibrated with rock specimens whose absolute volume susceptibility had been determined with an astatic magnetometer. With a calibration value of (7. 3 ± 0. 2) x 10 ⁻⁵ cgs units/cm potentiometer reading for a specimen at the coil center, the susceptibility of a fairly wide range of igneous rocks and the more strongly magnetic sedimentary rocks could be measured. For K ~ 1 x 10 ⁻³ the error in a single measurement is 6 %, increasing to 25 % for K ~ 8 x 10 ⁻⁵, the actual error being reducible through repeat measurements. [...] Volume susceptibilities of 80 cylindrical specimens cut from 21 basalt samples from Southern Labrador were measured with the calibrated bridge. The mean value of K at two basalt exposures was (3. 27 ± 1. 02) x 10 ⁻³ and (9. 74 ± 0. 19) x 10 ⁻³ cgs units respectively where the quoted standard deviations are based on sample averages and, apart from error in the method are a measure of the inhomogeneous distribution of the chief ferromagnetic constituents in the rocks. [...] The bridge was used to determine K in fields as low as 0. 005 oe. rms. A significant decrease in K was observed in the case of three specimens when the magnetizing field was lowered from 0. 02 to 0. 005 oe. rms. [...] The experimental variation of sensitivity with specimen positioning relative to the coil was compared in two cases with the theoretical variation and found to agree to less than 10 % at the coil center...|$|E

It is known that model physics choices (especially those relating to convection) can significantly alter these <b>outer</b> <b>winds</b> and thus the storm track. Here, semi-idealized simulations are used to {{explore the influence of}} the initialization on subsequent vortex evolution and motion. Specifically, TCs bred from a buoyant "bubble" are compared to bogussed vortices having a wide variety of parameterized shapes and sizes matching observations. As expected, the bogussed storms commencing with the strongest <b>outer</b> <b>winds</b> propagated fastest and, as a result, huge structure-dependent position differences quickly appeared. However, the forward speed variation among the initially bogussed TCs subsequently declined as a progressive homogenization harmonized the initially supplied structural differences. The homogenization likely involved model physics such as microphysics. This result casts doubt on the ability of models to retain and propagate forward information supplied at the initialization by advanced data assimilation techniques or parameterized vortex wind profiles. Asymmetries in near-core convective heating emerged as an important structural aspect that survived the homogenization tendency. The bubble and bogussed TCs developed markedly different heating patterns, which appear to help explain why the artificially-established storms tended to move about three times faster than their bubble counterparts. The reasons for this are not presently understood fully...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Vela X- 1, a prototypical high mass X-ray binary (HMXB), hosts {{a neutron}} star (NS) in a close orbit around an early-B supergiant donor star. Accretion of the donor star's wind onto the NS powers its strong X-ray luminosity. To {{understand}} the physics of HMXBs, detailed knowledge about the donor star winds is required. AIMS: To gain a realistic picture of the donor star in Vela X- 1, we constructed a hydrodynamically consistent atmosphere model describing the wind stratification while properly reproducing the observed donor spectrum. To investigate how X-ray illumination affects the stellar wind, we calculated additional models for different X-ray luminosity regimes. METHODS: We use the recently updated version of the PoWR code to consistently solve the hydrodynamic equation together with the statistical equations and the radiative transfer. RESULTS: The wind flow in Vela X- 1 is driven by ions from various elements with Fe III and S III leading in the <b>outer</b> <b>wind.</b> The model-predicted mass-loss rate {{is in line with}} earlier empirical studies. The mass-loss rate is almost unaffected by the presence of the accreting NS in the wind. The terminal wind velocity is confirmed at v_∞≈ 600 km/s. On the other hand, the wind velocity in the inner region where the NS is located is only ≈ 100 km/s, which is not expected {{on the basis of a}} standard β-velocity law. In models with an enhanced level of X-rays, the velocity field in the <b>outer</b> <b>wind</b> can be altered. If the X-ray flux is too high, the acceleration breaks down because the ionization increases. CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for radiation hydrodynamics, our Vela X- 1 donor atmosphere model reveals a low wind speed at the NS location, and it provides quantitative information on wind driving in this important HMXB.

Our method emphasizes the curved streamlines in the corotating frame, where the flow is steady-state, allowing us to obtain an exact solution for the mass density at all pre-shock locations. Assuming an initially isotropic wind, fluid elements launched from the interior hemisphere of the wind {{will be the first to}} cross other streamlines, resulting in a spiral structure bounded by two shock surfaces. Streamlines from the <b>outer</b> <b>wind</b> hemisphere later intersect these shocks as well. An analytic solution is obtained for the geometry of the two shock surfaces. Although the inner and outer shock surfaces asymptotically trace Archimedean spirals, our tail solution suggests many crossings where the shocks overlap, beyond which the analytic solution cannot be continued. Our solution can be readily extended to an initially anisotropic wind. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figures, accepted to Ap...|$|R
50|$|The {{center of}} {{circulation}} emerged over the Gulf of Mexico later that morning. Passage over land disrupted the hurricane's center of circulation, {{and it had}} weakened to a minimal hurricane with wind speeds of 75 mph (120 km/h). However, several hours over the warm waters of the western Gulf provided the energy needed for Emily to regenerate, and by midnight wind speeds were increasing. The increase in wind speed stalled, but the storm continued to become better organized. Emily started to show very symmetrical outflow, but the hurricane's strongest winds were being found at three different distances from the center. However, the <b>outer</b> <b>wind</b> radii subsided in the end, and the inner core prevailed. The result was a rapid strengthening of the inner core {{on the evening of}} July 19. The pressure dropped about 30 millibars and the winds went from 90 mph (145 km/h) to more than 125 mph (200 km/h), all within a few hours.|$|R
