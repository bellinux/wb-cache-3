5000|$|During the <b>O-P</b> <b>process,</b> the deuteron's {{positive}} charge is spatially polarized, and collects preferentially {{at one end}} of the deuteron's density distribution, nominally, the [...] "proton end". As the deuteron approaches the target nucleus, the {{positive charge}} is repelled by the electrostatic field until, assuming the incident energy is not sufficient for it to surmount the barrier, the [...] "proton end" [...] approaches to a minimum distance having climbed the Coulomb barrier as far as it can. If the [...] "neutron end" [...] is close enough for the strong nuclear force, which only operates over very short distances, to exceed the repulsive electrostatic force on the [...] "proton end", fusion of a neutron with the target nucleus may begin. The reaction proceeds as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>O-P</b> <b>process,</b> as {{the neutron}} fuses {{to the target}} nucleus, the {{deuteron}} binding force pulls the [...] "proton end" [...] closer than a naked proton could otherwise have approached on its own, increasing the potential energy of the positive charge. As a neutron is captured, a proton is stripped from the complex and is ejected. The proton {{at this point is}} able to carry away more than the incident kinetic energy of the deuteron since it has approached the target nucleus more closely than what is possible for an isolated proton with the same incident energy. In such instances, the transmuted nucleus is left in an energy state as if it had fused with a neutron of negative kinetic energy. There is an upper bound of how much energy the proton can be ejected with, set by the ground state of the daughter nucleus.|$|E
30|$|The water-vapor {{sorption}} {{processes in}} nanoporous MgO-Al 2 O 3 ceramics are studied with positron annihilation lifetime (PAL) spectroscopy employing positron trapping and positronium (Ps)-decaying modes. It is {{demonstrated that the}} longest-lived components in the four-term reconstructed PAL spectra with characteristic lifetimes near 2 and 60 – 70  ns can be, respectively, attributed to ortho-positronium (o-Ps) traps in nanopores with 0.3 - and 1.5 – 1.8 -nm radii. The first <b>o-Ps</b> decaying <b>process</b> includes “pick-off” annihilation in the “bubbles” of liquid water, while the second is based on o-Ps interaction with physisorbed water molecules at {{the walls of the}} pores. In addition, the water vapor modifies structural defects located at the grain boundaries in a vicinity of pores, this process being accompanied by void fragmentation during water adsorption and agglomeration during water desorption after drying.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{results of}} {{positron}} annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) studies of MnFe 2 O 4 /MCM- 41 nanocomposites in N 2 and O 2 atmosphere have been presented. In particular, {{the influence of}} manganese ferrite loading and gas filling on pick-off ortho-positronium (<b>o-Ps)</b> annihilation <b>processes</b> in the investigated samples was a point of interest. Disappearance of the longest-lived o-Ps component with τ 5 present in the PAL spectrum of initial MCM- 41 mesoporous material in the PAL spectra of MnFe 2 O 4 -impregnated MCM- 41 measured in vacuum {{is a result of}} either a strong chemical o-Ps quenching or the Ps inhibition effects. The intensity I 4 of the medium-lived component initially increases, reaching a maximum value for the sample with minimum manganese ferrite content, and then decreases monotonically. Analogous dependence for the intensity I 3 of the shortest-lived component shows a maximum at higher MnFe 2 O 4 content. Filling of open pores present in the studied nanocomposites by N 2 or O 2 at ambient pressure causes partial reappearance of the τ 4 and τ 5 components, except a sample with maximum ferrite content. The lifetimes of these components measured in O 2 are shortened in comparison to that observed in N 2 because of paramagnetic quenching. Anti-inhibition and anti-quenching effects of atmospheric gases observed in the MnFe 2 O 4 /MCM- 41 samples are a result of neutralization of some surface active centers acting as inhibitors and weakening of pick-off annihilation mechanism, respectively...|$|R
