40|$|Time-distance {{analysis}} and acoustic imaging are two related techniques {{to probe the}} local properties of solar interior. In this study, we discuss the relation of phase time and envelope time between the two techniques. The location of the envelope peak of the cross correlation function in time-distance analysis is identified as the travel time of the wave packet formed by modes with the same w/l. The phase time of the cross correlation function provides information of the phase change accumulated along the wave path, including the phase change at {{the boundaries of the}} mode cavity. The acoustic signals constructed with the technique of acoustic imaging contain both phase and intensity information. The phase of constructed signals can be studied by computing the cross correlation function between time series constructed with ingoing and outgoing waves. In this study, we use the data taken with the Taiwan Oscillation Network (TON) instrument and the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument. The analysis is carried out for the quiet Sun. We use the relation of envelope time versus distance measured in time-distance analyses to construct the acoustic signals in acoustic imaging analyses. The phase time of the cross correlation function of constructed ingoing and <b>outgoing</b> <b>time</b> series is twice the difference between the phase time and envelope time in time-distance analyses as predicted. The envelope peak of the cross correlation function between constructed ingoing and <b>outgoing</b> <b>time</b> series is located at zero time as predicted for results of one-bounce at 3 mHz for all four data sets and two-bounce at 3 mHz for two TON data sets. But it is different from zero for other cases. The cause of the deviation of the envelope peak from zero is not known...|$|E

40|$|The {{collision}} time is {{an important}} quantity of an elementary chemical reaction and describes {{the speed of the}} collision process in a collision reaction. In this study, we present a generalized method to calculate the collision time of a triatomic reaction in which the collision time is defined by the sum of the incoming time, the intermediate complex time, and the <b>outgoing</b> <b>time.</b> Two variables including the total distance R-total and R-avg, the average value of R-total over time, are used to compute the three components of the collision time. We compute three triatomic reactions including Ca + HCl -> CaCl + H, O + HCl -> OH + Cl/OCl + H, and O + HF -> OH + F at different collision energies and initial diatomic vibrational levels using the quasi-classical trajectory method to confirm that the method could be reliable and reasonable. The time evolutions of R-total could efficiently classify the direct and indirect reactive mechanisms and reveal a distinct discrepancy of the two mechanisms. As the collision energy and initial diatomic vibrational level increase, the percentage of direct reaction trajectories increases. At the same time, the average and maximal values of collision time decrease. Comparing the maximal collision time and the reactive probability distributions of the products, it could be found that most reactive trajectories' collision time is less than 2 ps. Moreover, the present calculations indicate that the method could be applicable to estimate the lifetime of the intermediate complex for the reaction systems with deep potential wells and the collision time of the reactions with a direct abstraction mechanism...|$|E

The crowd produced in a traffic jam is a dynamic entity in which the application of physics, mathematics and biology can provide practical help to understand how and why this problematic situation occurs and what solutions can be found to resolve it. In the mobility education Project "SicuraMENTE, we carried out anexperiment on the conduct of a crowd by simulating a situation of intense city traffic. Taking a cue from an experimental situation proposed in traffic physics, we have verified that a route with limited access can generate a traffic jam and the crowd of pedestrians can be mitigated by forcing the crowd to use dedicated streets. Taking the <b>outgoing</b> <b>time</b> of the student crowd from the outlet road, with and without {{the presence of an}} obstacle {{in the middle of the}} roadway, it was found that the traffic jam is resolved more quickly in the situation with an obstacle because the flow of people is divided into two separate channels, reducing the probability that two individuals are close and that this creates an obstruction (example of counter-intuitive physical principle). We verified also that the speed of the elements of the crowd influences the formation of traffic jams, which are on average more likely in the case of higher speed. These important aspects in the design of road networks and transport infrastructure have made students reason on physics' topics, but also on the correct conduct in traffic.

If we assume that the switch is saturated, the queues are always non-empty. If we assume that arrivals are i. i. d. (independent identically distributed) with uniformly distributed destinations, then the probability of each of the above combinations is 0. 25, and it is independent of the combination in the previous time slot and of the service decision made in the previous time slot.

We show that the proper retarded solution of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime for this process can be described in terms of the ingoing Kerr-Schild form of the Schwarzschild metric for both the initial and final states. An <b>outgoing</b> Kerr-Schild or <b>time</b> symmetric metric does not give the proper solution.

Statistically significant travel-time shifts are recovered upon numerically simulating wave propagation {{in the presence of a}} localized decrease in source strength.

Statistical <b>Time</b> Division Multiplexing (STDM) is a technique that allows the number of users to be multiplexed over the channel more than the channel can afford.

In this way STDM normally utilizes channel bandwidth better than traditional Time Division Multiplexing (TDM). In this work, the statistical multiplexer is viewed as M/M/ 1 queuing system and the performance is measured by comparing analytical results to simulation results using Matlab.

40|$|Of course not, {{but if one}} {{believes}} that information cannot be destroyed in a theory of quantum gravity, then we run into apparent contradictions with quantum theory when we consider evaporating black holes. Namely that the no-cloning theorem or the principle of entanglement monogamy is violated. Here, we show that neither violation need hold, since, in arguing that black holes lead to cloning or non-monogamy, one needs to assume a tensor product structure between two points in space-time that could instead be viewed as causally connected. In the latter case, one is violating the semi-classical causal structure of space, which is a strictly weaker implication than cloning or non-monogamy. We show {{that the lack of}} monogamy that can emerge in evaporating space times is one that is allowed in quantum mechanics, and is very naturally related to a lack of monogamy of correlations of outputs of measurements performed at subsequent instances of time of a single system. A particular example of this is the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal, and we argue that it needn't lead to cloning or violations of entanglement monogamy. For measurements on systems which appear to be leaving a black hole, we introduce the notion of the temporal product, and argue that it is just as natural a choice for measurements as the tensor product. For black holes, the tensor and temporal products have the same measurement statistics, but result in different type of non-monogamy of correlations, with the former being forbidden in quantum theory while the latter is allowed. In the case of the AMPS firewall experiment we find that the entanglement structure is modified, and one must have entanglement between the infalling Hawking partners and early <b>time</b> <b>outgoing</b> Hawking radiation which surprisingly tame violation of entanglement monogamy.

However, {{in a review of}} instruments measuring creativity and innovativeness within the work environment the 10 -factor model version of CCQ was criticized for lacking psychometrically documentation (Mathisen & Einarsen, 2004). Furthermore, in a study using an English translation of the CCQ the factor structure showed support for only 9 dimensions (Isaksen, Lauer & Ekvall, 1999). The purpose of the current study was to test Ekvall’s 10 -factor model of creative organizational climate on a large Swedish sample in order to gain knowledge on the psychometrical attributes of CCQ. Data collected from 3830 individuals representing both public and private organizations was used for the analyses. The factor structure was confirmed to a large extent. In total the 10 components explained 66 per cent of the variance. However, the first and the second extracted component consisted of 11 items each and explained 46 per cent of the variance. The tenth component contained only 1 item with a loading over. 40. The result suggests a model consisting of 9 dimensions rather than 10 as the two dimensions “dynamism” and “playfulness” seem to melt together in the second component. The components contained between 3 and 11 items each, which means that the structure of 5 items in each climate factor was not confirmed.
