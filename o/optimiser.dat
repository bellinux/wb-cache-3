25|$|Particle swarm {{optimization}} {{is another}} algorithm widely used {{to solve problems}} related to swarms. It was developed in 1995 by Kennedy and Eberhart and was first aimed at simulating the social behaviour and choreography of bird flocks and fish schools. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The system initially seeds a population with random solutions. It then searches in the problem space through successive generations using stochastic optimization {{to find the best}} solutions. The solutions it finds are called particles. Each particle stores its position as well as the best solution it has achieved so far. The particle swarm optimizer tracks the best local value obtained so far by any particle in the local neighbourhood. The remaining particles then move through the problem space following the lead of the optimum particles. At each time iteration, the particle swarm <b>optimiser</b> accelerates each particle toward its optimum locations according to simple mathematical rules. Particle swarm optimization has been applied in many areas. It has few parameters to adjust, and a version that works well for a specific applications can also work well with minor modifications across a range of related applications. A book by Kennedy and Eberhart describes some philosophical aspects of particle swarm optimization applications and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of applications is made by Poli.|$|E

The method proposed replaces the antenna under test by equivalent magnetic surface currents whose components are computed from reference near-field data using an appropriate optimisation technique. From the optimised equivalent model, antenna far-fields can be reconstructed. The Nelder Mead downhill simplex algorithm, along with global <b>optimisers</b> such as genetic algorithms (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) were all investigated and compared.

40|$|A new risk return {{optimisation}} model is described that overcomes {{much of the}} instability inherent in Mean Variance <b>optimisers,</b> with minimal sacrifice of efficiency. The Robust Frontier model identifies portfolios that {{are close to the}} efficient frontier, less likely to produce extreme results and, most importantly, are much more stable to changes in input assumptions. Practitioners using this model can approach the task of asset allocation with confidence that small errors in forecasts will not be the primary driver of asset allocation outputs and that, if the model is used over time, it will not produce huge swings in allocations with consequent high transaction costs. Difficulties in implementing Mean Variance style <b>optimisers</b> Various authors have documented the difficulties that many practitioners have had in implementing Mean Variance (MV) style <b>optimisers.</b> At the heart of these difficulties is the instability inherent in the way the MV models trade off risk and return. Michaud (1989) and others have referred to the extreme sensitivity of Mean Variance style <b>optimisers</b> to imput assumptions. Small changes in input variables can have quite profound impacts on the structure of Efficient Portfolios, so much so that Michaud refer...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} macroscopic {{descriptions of}} particles where repulsion is modelled by non-linear power-law diffusion and attraction by a homogeneous singular/non-singular kernel leading to variants of the Keller–Segel model of chemotaxis. We analyse {{the regime in}} which both homogeneities scale the same with respect to dilations, that we coin as fair-competition. In the singular kernel case, we show that existence of global equilibria can only happen at a certain critical value and they are characterised as <b>optimisers</b> of a variant of HLS inequalities. We also study the existence of self-similar solutions for the sub-critical case, or equivalently of <b>optimisers</b> of rescaled free energies. These <b>optimisers</b> are shown to be compactly supported radially symmetric and non-increasing stationary solutions of the non-linear Keller–Segel equation. On the other hand, we show that no radially symmetric non-increasing stationary solutions exist in the non-singular kernel case, implying {{that there is no}} criticality. However, we show the existence of positive self-similar solutions for all values of the parameter under the condition that diffusion is not too fast. We finally illustrate some of the open problems in the non-singular kernel case by numerical experiments...|$|R

LisBON aims at simplifying {{the development}} of memetic algorithms - a combination of heuristic, population-based search approaches with local <b>optimisers.</b> Moreover, LisBON's design allows for an integration of virtually any optimisation algorithm. It could hence be used to implement a large variety of different hybrid approaches, multiple-restart methods in local search routines, and multiple populations and meta-evolution in evolutionary algorithms.

40|$|MATLAB® builds in {{a number}} of derivative-free <b>optimisers</b> (DFOs), {{conveniently}} providing tools beyond conventional optimisation means. However, with the increase of available DFOs and being {{compounded by the fact that}} DFOs are often problem dependent and parameter sensitive, it has become challenging to determine which one would be most suited to the application at hand, but there exist no comparisons on MATLAB DFOs so far. In order to help engineers use MATLAB for their applications without needing to learn DFOs in detail, this paper evaluates the performance of all seven DFOs in MATLAB and sets out an amalgamated benchmark of multiple benchmarks. The DFOs include four heuristic algorithms - simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization (PSO), the genetic algorithm (GA), and the genetic algorithm with elitism (GAe), and three direct-search algorithms - Nelder-Mead’s simplex search, pattern search (PS) and Powell’s conjugate search. The five benchmarks presented in this paper exceed those that have been reported in the literature. Four benchmark problems widely adopted in assessing evolutionary algorithms are employed. Under MATLAB’s default settings, it is found that the numerical <b>optimisers</b> Powell is the aggregative best on the unimodal Quadratic Problem, PSO on the lower dimensional Scaffer Problem, PS on the lower dimensional Composition Problem, while the extra-numerical genotype GAe is the best on the Varying Landscape Problem and on the other two higher dimensional problems. Overall, the GAe offers the highest performance, followed by PSO and Powell.
