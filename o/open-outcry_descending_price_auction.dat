In this paper, we introduce efficient descending auctions for two environments: multiple nonidentical items and buyers with unit-demand valuations; and multiple identical items and buyers with non-increasing marginal values. Our auctions are designed using the notion of universal competitive equilibrium (UCE) prices and they terminate with UCE prices, from which the Vickrey payments can be determined. For the unit-demand setting, our auction maintains linear and anonymous prices. For the homogeneous items setting, our auction maintains a single price and adopts Ausubelâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s notion of â 8 ̆ 09 ̆cclinchingâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆d to compute the final payments dynamically.

In this format, usually known as <b>price</b> reveal <b>auction,</b> the <b>price</b> is hidden and players have to pay a fee to observe it. The price decreases only if a bidder observes it and not because of the time, like in the usual Dutch format. In the following pages, we will analyse the effect of the concealment of the price in a standard Dutch auction. We will, then, define a model for <b>price</b> reveal <b>auction,</b> and analyse its most important aspects. We will, finally, derive players' best strategy and the Nash equilibrium of the game. Our result is that players use a threshold strategy to decide whether or not participate the <b>auction</b> (observe the <b>price</b> and pay the fixed fee). However, in our model there is not a separating equilibrium. Moreover, we will find that there is a process of beliefs updating, which takes account of the time as a signal of the price. Therefore, if the game continues, players infer that the price is too high and update their beliefs accordingly.

An innovative resource allocation scheme is proposed to improve the performance of mobile peer-to-peer, i. e., device-to-device (D 2 D), communications as an underlay in the downlink (DL) cellular networks. To optimize the system sum rate over the resource sharing of both D 2 D and cellular modes, we introduce a reverse iterative combinatorial auction as the allocation mechanism. In the auction, all the spectrum resources are considered {{as a set of}} resource units, which as bidders compete to obtain business while the packages of the D 2 D pairs are auctioned off as goods in each auction round. We first formulate the valuation of each resource unit, as a basis of the proposed auction. And then a detailed non-monotonic <b>descending</b> <b>price</b> <b>auction</b> algorithm is explained depending on the utility function that accounts for the channel gain from D 2 D and the costs for the system. Further, we prove that the proposed auction-based scheme is cheat-proof, and converges in a finite number of iteration rounds. We explain non-monotonicity in the price update process and show lower complexity compared to a traditional combinatorial allocation. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm efficiently leads to a good performance on the system sum rate.

Different types of economic instruments have been employed by conservation agencies to meet this challenge. Notable among them are Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes that pay private landowners to change land uses to pro-environmental ones on their properties. This paper focuses on a PES scheme - an auction for the cost-efficient disbursal of government funds for selection of spatially contiguous land management projects. The auction is structured as an iterative <b>descending</b> <b>price</b> <b>auction</b> where every bid is evaluated {{on the basis of}} a scoring metric - a benefit cost ratio. The ecological effectiveness and economic efficiency of the auction is tested with data generated from lab experiments. These experiments use the information available to the subjects about the spatial goal as the treatment variable. Analysis indicates that the information reduces the cost-efficiency of the auction. Experience with bidding also has a negative impact on auction efficiency. The study also provides an analysis of the behavior of winners and losers at the final auction outcome as well as during the entire lifetime of the auction. Winners and losers are found to have significantly different behavior in this analysis. Behavior is also found to be significantly affected by the treatments as well.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the outcome of}} a dynamic price-descending auction when the distribution of the private values is uncertain and bidders exhibit ambiguity aversion. In contrast to sealed-bid auctions, in open auctions the bidders get information about the other bidders' private values and may therefore update their beliefs on the distribution of the values. The bidders have smooth ambiguity preferences and update their priors using consequentialist Bayesian updating. It is shown that ambiguity aversion usually affects bidding behavior the same way risk aversion does, but the main result is {{that this is not the}} case for continuous <b>price</b> <b>descending</b> <b>auctions.</b> This is new among a few theoretical cases where ambiguity aversion does not reinforce the risk aversion implications. ...|$|R

Auctions may permit the regulator {{to identify those}} management changes that have greater environmental benefit and lower opportunity cost. This paper reports a testbed laboratory experiment in which landowner/sellers compete in sealed-offer auctions to obtain part of a fixed budget allocated by the regulator to subsidize pollution abatement. One treatment employs uniform <b>price</b> <b>auction</b> rules in which the price is set at the lowest price per unit of environmental benefits submitted by a seller who had all of her offers rejected. Another treatment employs discriminative price rules in which successful sellers receive their offer price. Our results indicate that subjects recognize the cost-revelation incentives of the uniform <b>price</b> <b>auction,</b> as a majority of offers are within 2 percent of cost. By contrast, a majority of offers in the discriminative <b>price</b> <b>auction</b> are at least 8 percent greater than cost.

40|$|Results of {{the recent}} US Treasury {{experiment}} comparing uniform and discriminatory <b>price</b> <b>auctions</b> suggest that uniform <b>price</b> <b>auctions</b> achieve lower award concentration and higher average revenues but experience higher variance of revenues from auction to auction relative to discriminatory <b>price</b> <b>auctions.</b> In other words, uniform pricing offers higher risk for higher return. This apparent trade-off may deter some sellers considering the switch from discriminatory to uniform pricing; thus, {{it is important to}} investigate whether these results can be generalized. The Treasury's results are driven by the tendency for bidders in the uniform auctions to submit multiple bids at a wide range of prices, essentially steep bid curves, instead of the flat bids submitted in the discriminatory auctions. However, theory and data from discriminatory auctions in Sweden and Portugal suggest that bidders in discriminatory auctions will submit steeper bids when there is more potential for winner's curse. It is possible that bidders in the US auctions, which are preceded by a when-issued market, are relatively unconcerned with the winner's curse. We examine the auction formats in an environment much more likely to generate the winner's curse: the initial public offering market. We compare discriminatory <b>price</b> <b>auctions</b> in Japan and uniform <b>price</b> <b>auctions</b> in Israel on the basis of revenue and slope of the demand curves and test a number of divisible good auction theory implications. In contrast with the Treasury's results, we find that revenues are likely to be insignificantly different in the discriminatory and uniform <b>price</b> <b>auctions</b> and that bid curves may be equally steep under both formats in markets with information asymmetry.
