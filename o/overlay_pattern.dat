50|$|The thermal {{cantilevers}} are fabricated from silicon wafers using bulk- {{and surface}} micro-machining processes. Probes have a radius of curvatures below 5 nm, enabling sub-10 nm {{resolution in the}} resist. The resistive heating is carried out by integrated micro-heaters in the cantilever legs which are created by different levels of doping. The time constant of the heaters lies between 5 μs to 100 μs. Electromigration limits the longterm sustainable heater temperature to 700-800 °C. The integrated heaters enable in-situ metrology of the written patterns, allowing feedback control, field stitching {{without the use of}} alignment markers and using pre-patterned structures as reference for sub-5 nm <b>overlay.</b> <b>Pattern</b> transfer for semiconductor device fabrication including reactive ion etching and metal lift-off has been demonstrated with sub-20 nm resolution.|$|E
40|$|The reduced {{depth of}} focus (DOF) caused by higher {{numerical}} aperture (NA) is making the accuracy of best focus measurement increasingly important. A new <b>overlay</b> <b>pattern</b> is developed herein to precisely measure the best focus of lithographic tools. Specially designed "bar-in-bar " (BIB) was employed to obtain the best focus by using the opposite shifting direction of inner and outer bars when defocused. The inner and outer bars are composed of various pattern sizes. When defocused, the shrinkage of the smaller patterns is more significant {{than that of the}} larger patterns, thus causing the center of gravity to shift. The distribution and pattern sizes are optimized to obtain high reproducibility and sensitive position shifting for various defocus conditions. Employing the special BIB pattern, the best focus, tilting and field curvature can be easily measured via the conventional overlay measurement tool. By adding the special BIB to the scribe lanes of the production wafers, the best focus and tilting of the stepper can be obtained when measuring a layer-to-layer overlay shift, and can then be fed back to the stepper as a reference for following processing wafers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Color {{is one of}} {{the most}} common ways to convey {{information}} in visualization applications. Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects approximately 200 million individuals worldwide and considerably degrades their performance in understanding such contents by creating red-green or blue-yellow ambiguities. While several content-specific methods have been proposed to resolve these ambiguities, they cannot achieve this effectively in many situations for contents with a large variety of colors. More importantly, they cannot facilitate color identification. We propose a technique for using patterns to encode color information for individuals with CVD, in particular for dichromats. We present the first content-independent method to <b>overlay</b> <b>patterns</b> on colored visualization contents that not only minimizes ambiguities but also allows color identification. Further, since <b>overlaying</b> <b>patterns</b> does not compromise the underlying original colors, it does not hamper the perception of normal trichromats. We validated our method with two user studies: one including 11 subjects with CVD and 19 normal trichromats, and focused on images that use colors to represent multiple categories; and another one including 16 subjects with CVD and 22 normal trichromats, which considered a broader set of images. Our results show that <b>overlaying</b> <b>patterns</b> significantly improves the performance of dichromats in several color-based visualization tasks, making their performance almost similar to normal trichromats’. More interestingly, the patterns augment color information in a positive manner, allowing normal trichromats to perform with greater accuracy...|$|R
30|$|To {{fabricate}} a retinal vessel {{structure on}} a curved surface, we hydraulically transferred the PDMS pattern. Hydraulic transfer is generally used for printing on curved surfaces [24, 25]. By floating a printed film on water and pressing a curved surface onto the film, uniform printing on the curved surface is obtained. Retinal vessels on a curved surface are obtained by <b>overlaying</b> <b>patterned</b> PDMS sheets on a curved surface, {{as shown in}} Fig. 5. With this hydraulic transfer process, we can realize the fine microchannel with size of ≃ 10 μm on a curved surface, which is difficult to achieve with conventional fabrication techniques.|$|R

Two groups of eighteen young adults were selected from seventy-eight on the basis (i) that their rate of reading increased by 5 % or more with an overlay compared to their rate without it, and (ii) that they reported more than 2 symptoms of pattern glare (group 1) or had no such increment in reading speed and reported fewer than 3 symptoms (group 2). Under double-masked conditions participants observed at 0. 4 m a pattern of stripes while measurements of accommodation were made using an open field autorefractor with and without positive and negative trial lenses (0. 75 D), and with and without a coloured <b>overlay.</b> <b>Pattern</b> glare was also assessed with and without the trial lenses. Without lenses, the mean accommodative response in group 1 was 1. 55 D, a lag of 0. 95 D ± 0. 24 D relative to the demand. The lag decreased by 0. 43 D (p < 0. 0001) when the chosen overlay was used, an effect that was not shown in group 2 even when lag increased with negative trial lenses (p = 0. 13). In both groups, pattern glare scores were reduced by the trial lenses, but were unaffected by {{the sign of the}} lenses.

40|$|Current {{alignment}} {{technology is}} incapable of satisfying the needs of imminent generations of lithography. This dissertation delineates a novel method of alignment and three-dimensional position metrology that is compatible with many forms of proximity lithography. The method is called Interferometric-Spatial-Phase Imaging (ISPI), {{and is based on}} encoding three-dimensional position information in the spatial phase and frequency of interference fringes, viewed with specialized oblique-incidence, dark-field optical microscopes. Alignment detectivity is 500 gm. Unlike amplitude-based interferometers, this spatial-phase-encoding interferometer achieves high alignment detectivity without sensitivity to variations in wavelength, gap and other factors, such as resist layers and changes in the index of refraction in the beampath. Several novel gap detection methods are introduced, with gap detectivity 500 jgm. (cont.) Gap is confirmed with exposure of patterns in resist, taking advantage of near-field interference in a novel Chirped Talbot Effect. Alignment and <b>pattern</b> <b>overlay</b> are confirmed in experiments combining x-ray exposures with continuous ISPI position feedback. Dynamic <b>overlay</b> of <b>patterns</b> in resist is demonstrated to be 2. 7 nm, with a clear path for further improvement.

(2001) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1515, 120 - 132]. Here, {{we show that}} variations in the relative abundance of these four central elements of excitation-contraction coupling in different fiber types, and during chronic electrostimulation-induced fiber type transitions, are reflected by distinct alterations in the calsequestrin <b>overlay</b> binding <b>patterns.</b> Comparative immunoblotting with antibodies to markers of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, {{in combination with the}} calsequestrin <b>overlay</b> binding <b>patterns,</b> confirmed a lower ryanodine receptor expression in slow soleus muscle compared to fast fibers, and revealed a drastic reduction of the RyR 1 isoform in chronic low-frequency stimulated tibialis anterior muscle. The fast-to-slow transition process included a distinct reduction in fast calsequestrin and triadin and a concomitant reduction in calsequestrin binding to these sarcoplasmic reticulum elements. The calsequestrin-binding protein junctin was not affected by the muscle transformation process. The increase in calsequestrin and decrease in junctin expression during postnatal development resulted in similar changes in the intensity of binding of the calsequestrin conjugate to these sarcoplasmic reticulum components. Aged skeletal muscle fibers tended towards reduced protein interactions within the calsequestrin complex. This agrees with the physiological concept that the key regulators of Ca(2 +) homeostasis exist in a supramolecular membrane assembly and that protein-protein interactions are affected by isoform shifting underlying the finely tuned adaptation of muscle fibers to changed functional demands...|$|R
