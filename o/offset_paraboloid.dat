40|$|A series {{approach}} for the rapid computation of the vector secondary pattern of <b>offset</b> <b>paraboloid</b> reflectors wherein the feed is displaced is presented. We {{show that the}} Jacobi polynomial series method, which has been demonstrated to provide an efficient means for evaluating the radiation integral of symmetric paraboloid reflectors, can be extended {{to the case of}} an <b>offset</b> <b>paraboloid</b> without compromising the ease or speed of computation. The analysis leading to the series formula is also useful for deriving an analytic expression for the optimum scan plane for the displacement of the feed.

40|$|Method and {{apparatus}} {{for determining}} the focal axis of an asymmetrical antenna such as an <b>offset</b> <b>paraboloid</b> reflector whose physical rim is not coincident with the boundary of the electrical aperture but whose focal point is known is provided. A transmitting feed horn array consisting {{of at least two}} feed horn elements is positioned asymmetrically on either side of an estimated focal axis which is generally inclined with respect to the boresight axis of the antenna. The feed horn array is aligned with the estimated focal axis so that the phase centers (CP sub 1, CP sub 2) of the two feed horn elements are located on a common line running through the focal point (F) orthogonally with respect to the estimated focal axis...|$|E
40|$|An analytical/numerical {{approach}} to identifying and correcting the aberrations introduced by a general {{displacement of the}} feed from {{the focal point of}} a single <b>offset</b> <b>paraboloid</b> antenna used in deployable radiometer systems is developed. A 15 meter reflector with 18 meter focal length is assumed for the analysis, which considers far field radiation pattern quality, focal region fields, and aberrations appearing in the aperture plane. The latter are obtained by ray tracing in the transmit mode and are expressed in terms of optical notation. Attention is given to the physical restraints imposed on corrective elements by real microwave systems and to the intermediate near field aspects of the problem in three dimensions. The subject of wave fronts and caustics in the receive mode is introduced for comparative purposes. Several specific examples are given for aberration reduction at eight beamwidths of scan at a frequency of 1. 414 GHz...|$|E

40|$|The Diffraction {{coefficient}} for electromagnetic waves incident obliquely incident on a curved edge formed by {{perfectly conducting plane}} surfaces. This diffraction coefficient remains valid in the transition region adjacent to shadow and reflection boundaries where the diffraction coefficients of Keller’s original theory fail. Our method is proposed on Keller’s method of the canonical problem, {{which in this case}} is the perfectly conducting wedge illuminated by plane, cylindrical, conical, and spherical waves. The expressions for the acoustic wedge diffraction coefficients contain Fresnel integral, which ensure that the total field is continuous at shadow and reflection boundaries. Since the diffraction is a local phenomenon, and locally the curved edge structure is wedge shaped, this result is readily extended to the curved wedge. It is interesting that even though the polarizations and the wavefront curvature of the incident, reflected, and diffracted waves are markedly different, the total field calculated from this high frequency solution for the curved wedge is continuous at shadow and reflection boundaries. The Jacoby polynomial series method, which has been demonstrated to provide an efficient means for evaluating the radiation integral of symmetric paraboloid. The analysis leading to the series formula is also useful for deriving an analytic expression for the optimum scan plane for the displacement of the feed.

40|$|Reflector antennas {{are widely}} used in {{communication}} satellite systems because they provide high gain at low cost. Offset-fed single paraboloids and dual reflector offset Cassegrain and Gregorian antennas with multiple focal region feeds provide a simple, blockage-free means of forming multiple, shaped, and isolated beams with low sidelobes. Such antennas are applicable to communications satellite frequency reuse systems and earth stations requiring access to several satellites. While the single <b>offset</b> <b>paraboloid</b> {{has been the most}} extensively used configuration for the satellite multiple-beam antenna, the trend toward large apertures requiring minimum scanned beam degradation over the field of view 18 degrees for full earth coverage from geostationary orbit may lead to impractically long focal length and large feed arrays. Dual reflector antennas offer packaging advantages and more degrees of design freedom to improve beam scanning and cross-polarization properties. The Cassegrain and Gregorian antennas are the most commonly used dual reflector antennas. A computer program for calculating the secondary pattern and directivity of a generalized dual reflector antenna system was developed and implemented at LeRC. The theoretical foundation for this program is based on the use of physical optics methodology for describing the induced currents on the sub-reflector and main reflector. The resulting induced currents on the main reflector are integrated to obtain the antenna far-zone electric fields. The computer program is verified with other physical optics programs and with measured antenna patterns. The comparison shows good agreement in far-field sidelobe reproduction and directivity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The plane-wave {{synthesis}} {{is brought}} to the CATR. The feed scans in the focal plane and antenna pattern is measured several times in different feed positions. The corrected antenna pattern is obtained by weighting the measured patterns. The weight is obtained by the least squares method for the electric fields in the aperture plane of the test antenna. The fashion, number and spacing of feed scanning are investigated. By the plane-wave synthesis in the CATR, a larger antenna can be tested, and higher test accuracy can be obtained {{than that of the}} CATR. Lower test number and less test time are needed than the conventional plane-wave synthesis. The technique proposed in this paper is numerically investigated in an <b>offset</b> single <b>paraboloid</b> CATR and verified experimentally in a Cassegrain CATR at 100 GHz. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{subset of}} the total Global Change Technology Initiative {{instruments}} are required to be in low Earth, sunsynchronous orbits. There is one instrument, however, that requires its own specialized spacecraft; the Soil Moisture Microwave Radiometer (SMMR). The characteristic structure of the instrument is the 118 m hoop column support structure. The hoop is supported by an axially placed column. Tension cables support and shape an electromagnetically reflective mesh surface. The instrument is capable of detecting frequencies in the 1. 4 GHz range (Soil Moisture and Sea Salinity). Three apertures are used to reduce the degree of <b>paraboloid</b> <b>offset</b> and improve the beam quality. The spacecraft configuration {{is determined by the}} instrument support requirements and the requirement that it can fit into the Titan IV cargo bay. The configuration is derived by cross referencing the instrument performance requirements with the performance of the spacecraft. The spacecraft design is similar with the Multi-mission Modular Spacecraft in terms of size and packaging. A description of the spacecraft's features will yield a summary of the technologies needed for the SMMR spacecraft...|$|R
