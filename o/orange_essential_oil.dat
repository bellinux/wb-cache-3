Using GC-MS analysis, 11, 12 and 24 chemical constituents were identified in orange, lemon and lime <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> respectively. The 3 main components and their percentage compositions are D-Limonene (54. 151 %), Pulegone (11. 652 %) and L-Carvone (2 -cyclohexen- 1 -one) (5. 457 %) for <b>orange</b> peel <b>essential</b> <b>oil,</b> D-limonene (64 %), 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -ol (6. 21 %) and β-Pinene (3. 822 %) for lemon peel <b>essential</b> <b>oil,</b> and β-Pinene (23. 124 %), D-limonene (17. 07 %) and α-Pinene (10. 399 %) for lime <b>essential</b> <b>oil.</b> D-limonene was the most prevalent chemical constituent in <b>orange</b> and lemon <b>essential</b> <b>oil,</b> but β-Pinene was the most prevalent in lime peel <b>essential</b> <b>oil.</b> Although lemon contained more D-limonene per unit volume of <b>essential</b> <b>oil,</b> application of these percentages on the volume of <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> obtained from 370 g of the peels at 180 minutes showed that orange peel can deliver more D-limonene per unit mass of available peel.

Both species showed high percentage repellency values when exposed to filter paper treated with catnip <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> or the individual nepetalactone isomers. Of the two nepetalactone isomers evaluated, German cockroaches were most responsive to the E,Z isomer. House flies showed similar trends in contact irritancy, responding to surfaces treated with the predominant catnip isomer, Z,E-nepetalactone, more intensely than to the catnip <b>essential</b> <b>oil.</b> Catnip and Osage <b>orange</b> <b>essential</b> <b>oils,</b> and a sesquiterpene found in Osage orange, elemol, were evaluated for repellency to the northern house mosquito (Culex pipiens) and are presented here. Two mosquito bioassays were used to measure percentage and contact repellecy. Mosquitoes responded initially with high percentage repellency to surfaces treated with catnip <b>essential</b> <b>oil.</b> From the residual repellency study, this trend in repellency by the catnip oil significantly decreased over the 180 -minute test period.

40|$|Plant {{extracts}} are a {{rich source}} of bioactive compounds and have been traditionally used for both cosmetic and therapeutic purposes. In plants and fungi, the presence of a variety of phenolic compounds leads to the undesirable browning of fruits and vegetables (1). In humans, disorders in the amount and distribution of melanin pigments can be associated to disease states. Plant-derived chemicals have been shown to exert various biological activities and pharmacological effects (2). Because tyrosinase catalyzes the key steps of melanogenesis, most of the strategies for developing skin-lightening and/or anti-food-browning agents are based on the inhibition of tyrosinase activity (i. e. oxidation of L-DOPA) (3). In this study, the <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> obtained by hydrodistillation from nine different plants were investigated for their potential inhibitory activity on mushroom tyrosinase (MT) and on B 16 melanoma cell line tyrosinase (MCLT). The <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> composition was assessed by GC-mass-spectrometry techniques, anyway we decided to investigate their possible anti-tyrosinase activity considering the oil in its entirety because the biological activity of plant extracts often derives from the combined effect of their different components (4, 5). Our results indicate a different inhibitory efficacy on MT and MCLT activities. While extracts from Cinnamonum zeylanicum, Syzigium aromaticum and Citrus aurantium amara appear to be the best inhibitors of both MT and MCLT, with an oil dose-dependent effect, oils from Origanum vulgaris and Rosmarinus officinalis have major inhibitory effect on MT.

40|$|Citric plants, {{specially}} orange, are {{of great}} importance in Brazilian economy, mainly Southeast region. Theessential oils from Citrus {{are one of the}} most important of raw material group of several industries, mainly forfoods, pharmaceutical and toiletry. In foods industry, <b>orange</b> <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> is utilized to enhance the juice flavor andit is exported, more specific to United States (main consumer). In this work was developed an analyticalmethodology for identification and quantification of coumarins in citric plants (oils, wax) using chromatographictechniques such as high resolution gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (HRGC-FID) and massspectrometry detector (HRGC-MS). The results of HRGC-MS qualitative analyses using selective ion monitoring(SIM) indicated the presence of coumarin in the samples of essential oil and wax, and in the latter it was detectedthe presence of coumarin and psoralen. Quantitative analyses by external standard methods, internal standard andaddition of standard showed good results, specially internal standard method which showed greater repeatebilitywere statistically identical (t test and ANOVA, p = 0. 95) ...|$|E
40|$|The ternary {{phase diagram}} for the <b>orange</b> <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> (OEO) /sodium bis(2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) /water system was {{constructed}} at 25 degrees C. It indicates a large single phase region, comprising an isotropic water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsion (ME) phase (L(2)), a liquid crystal (LC) (lamellar or hexagonal) {{and a large}} unstable emulsion phase that separates in two phases of normal and reverse micelles (L(1) and L(2)). In this communication {{the properties of the}} ME are investigated by viscosity, electric conductivity and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicating that the isotropic ME phase exhibits different behaviors depending on composition. At low water content low viscous ""dry"" surfactant structures are formed, whereas at higher water content higher viscous water droplets are formed. The experimental data allow the determination of the transition from ""dry"" to the water droplet structures within the L(2) phase. SAXS analyses have also been performed for selected LC samples.

30|$|<b>Essential</b> <b>oils</b> are {{mixtures}} of many compounds consisting mainly of isoprenoids, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes (Marin et al. 2007). They are {{a group of}} volatile aromatic compounds produced by several plant species. These BAC {{are responsible for the}} scents of many aromatic plants (Rossi et al. 2011; Yu et al. 2011) and can be used for pharmaceuticals, food flavor additives, and natural antimicrobials amongst others (Bakkali et al. 2008). <b>Essential</b> <b>oils</b> are utilized in the manufacture of food and medicines as flavoring agents, cosmetics, and domestic household products (Braddock et al. 1986). They also exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, and insecticidal properties (Burt 2004; Thormar 2011; and Zoubiri and Baaliouamer 2014). They are produced from orange peel extraction using several extraction methods which include steam or hydro-distillation, water, steam and organic solvent extraction, cold pressing, and supercritical CO 2 (Palazzolo et al. 2013). <b>Essential</b> <b>oils</b> from <b>orange</b> peels are very complex matrices which consist of many compounds of various chemical classes which are majorly separated into two parts, viz. the volatile part which constitutes between 85 and 99 % and the non-volatile part which constitutes between 1 and 15 % (Palazzolo et al. 2013). The oil content of citrus peels range between 0.5 and 5.0 % (w/v) as reported by Palazzolo et al. (2013). They are complex natural {{mixtures of}} lipophilic substances constituting about 20 – 60 components at different concentrations and consist of two or three major components, namely limonene, pcymene, and ocimene at fairly high concentrations (20 – 70 %) compared to other components which are present in trace amounts (Palazzolo et al. 2013). Several factors affect the quality, quantity, and composition of <b>orange</b> peel <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> which include the nature of the fruit, provenance, genotype, soil type, climate, plant organ, age, vegetative cycle, and the extraction process (Dugo et al. 2000 and Palazzolo et al. 2013).|$|R

Aromatherapy is the controlled use of plant essences for therapeutic purposes. Its applications are numerous (i. e., wellbeing, labour, infections, dementia, and anxiety treatment) but often {{they have not been}} scientifically validated. The aim of the present study is to review the available literature to determine if there is evidence for effectiveness of aromatherapy in surgical patients to treat anxiety and insomnia, to control pain and nausea, and to dress wound. Efficacy studies of lavender or <b>orange</b> and peppermint <b>essential</b> <b>oils,</b> to treat anxiety and nausea, respectively, have shown positive results. For other aspects, such as pain control, <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> therapy has shown uncertain results. Finally, there are encouraging data for the treatment of infections, especially for tea tree oil, although current results are still inconclusive. It should also be considered that although they are, allergic reactions and toxicity can occur after oral ingestion. Therefore, while rigorous studies are being carried out, {{it is important that the}} therapeutic use of <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> be performed in compliance with clinical safety standards. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceKeywords: Ultrasound DIC (instant {{controlled}} {{pressure drop}}) Extraction Naringin Hesperidin Orange peel a b s t r a c t The instant controlled pressure drop (DIC) technology enabled both {{the extraction of}} <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> {{and the expansion of}} the matrix itself which improved solvent extraction. The sequential use of DIC and Ultra-sound Assisted Extraction (UAE) triggered complementary actions materialized by supplementary effects. We visualized these combination impacts by comparing them to standard techniques: Hydrodistillation (HD) and Solvent Extraction (SE). First, the extraction of <b>orange</b> peel <b>Essential</b> <b>Oils</b> (EO) was achieved by HD during 4 h and DIC process (after optimization) during 2 min; EO yields was 1. 97 mg/g dry material (dm) with HD compared to 16. 57 mg/g dm with DIC. Second, the solid residue was recovered to extract antioxidant compounds (naringin and hesperidin) by SE and UAE. Scanning electron microscope showed that after HD the recovered solid shriveled as opposite to DIC treatment which expanded the product structure. HPLC analyses showed that the best kinetics and yields of naringin and hesperidin extraction was when DIC and UAE are combined. Indeed, after 1 h of extraction, DIC treated orange peels with UAE were 0. 825 ± 1. 6 Â 10 À 2 g/g of dry material (dm) for hesperidin and 6. 45 Â 10 À 2 ± 2. 3 Â 10 À 4 g/g dm for naringin compared to 0. 64 ± 2. 7 Â 10 À 2 g/g of dry material (dm) and 5. 7 Â 10 À 2 ± 1. 6 Â 10 À 3 g/g dm, respectively with SE. By combining DIC to UAE, it was possible to enhance kinetics and yields of antiox-idant extraction...|$|R
