This study looked at the tar to cannabinoid ratio in the gas in output by various bongs, as well as unfiltered and filtered joints, and vaporizers. The results showed that only vaporizers produced a better tar to cannabinoid ratio than unfiltered joints, but that within the cannabinoids produced, even vaporizers warped the ratio of THC (the psychoactive component of the smoke) to CBN (capable of producing medical benefits but is not psychoactive) in favor of CBN. This showed an unfiltered joint had the best tar to THC ratio of all, and bongs were actually seriously detrimental in this respect.|$|E

40|$|Sunnyside (Utah) {{tar sand}} was {{subjected}} to programmed temperature pyrolysis and the volatile products were detected by tandem on-line mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in real time analyses. A heating rate of 4 °C/min from room temperature to 900 °C was employed. Evolution of hydrogen, light hydrocarbons, nitrogen-, sulfur- and oxygen-containing compounds was monitored by MS or MS/MS detection. Evolution of volatile organic compounds occurred in two regimes: 1) low_temperature (maximum evolution at 150 to 175 °C) f corresponding to entrained organics, and 2) high temperature (maximum evolution at 440 to 460 °C), corresponding to cracking of large organic components. The pyrolysis yields were dominated by the evolution of light hydrocarbons. Alkanes and alkenes of two carbons and higher had temperatures of maximum evolution at approximately 440 °C, and methane at approximately 474 °C. Aromatic hydrocarbons had temperatures of maximum evolution slightly higher, at approximately 450 °C. Comparing the Sunnyside pyrolysis to the pyrolysis of <b>other</b> domestic <b>tar</b> sands indicated the following for hydrocarbon evolution: 1) the evolution of entrained organics relative to the total evolution was much less for Sunnyside tar sand, 2) the temperatures of maximum evolution of hydrocarbons due to cracking reactions were at slightly lower, and 3) the temperatures of maximum evolution for benzene and toluene are slightly higher than observed for <b>other</b> <b>tar</b> sands. In general, the noncondensible gases, H 2, CO, and CO 2, exhibited evolution associated with hydrocarbon cracking reactions, and high temperature evolution associated with mineral decomposition, the water-gas shift reaction, and gasification reactions.

40|$|The maltose {{chemoreceptor}} in Escherichia coli {{consists of}} the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP) and the Tar signal transducer, which is localized in the cytoplasmic membrane. We previously isolated strains containing malE mutations that cause specific defects in the chemotactic function of MBP. Four of these mutations have now been characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Two of them replace threonine at residue 53 of MBP with isoleucine (MBP-TI 53), one replaces an aspartate at residue 55 with asparagine (MBP-DN 55), and the fourth replaces threonine at residue 345 with isoleucine (MBP-TI 345). The chemotactic defects of MBP-TI 53 and MBP-DN 55, but not of MBP-TI 345, are suppressed by mutations in the tar gene. Of the tar mutations, the most effective suppressor (isolated independently three times) replaces Arg- 73 of Tar with tryptophan. Two <b>other</b> <b>tar</b> mutations that disrupt the aspartate chemoreceptor function of Tar also suppress the maltose taxis defects associated with MBP-TI 53 and MBP-DN 55.

40|$|Total ankle {{replacement}} (TAR) designs {{have still}} several important {{issues to be}} addressed before the treatment becomes fully acceptable clinically. Very {{little is known about}} the performance, in terms of the contact pressures and kinematics of TAR when subjected to daily activities such as level gait. For this purpose, an explicit finite element model of a novel 3 -component TAR was developed, which incorporated a previously validated mechanical model of the ankle ligament apparatus. The intermediate mobile polyethylene meniscal bearing was modelled as an elastic–plastic continuum while the articulating surfaces of the tibial and talar metal components as rigid bodies. Overall kinematics, contact pressures and ligament forces were analysed during passive, i. e. virtually unloaded, and active, i. e. stance phase of gait, conditions. Simulation of passive motion predicted similar kinematics as reported previously in an analytical four-bar linkage model. The meniscal bearing was observed to move 5. 6 mm posteriorly during the simulated stance and the corresponding antero-posterior displacement of the talar component was 8. 3 mm. The predicted pattern and the amount (10. 61) of internal–external rotation of the ankle complex were found to be in good agreement with corresponding in vivo measurements on normal ankles. A peak contact pressure of 16. 8 MPa was observed, with majority of contact pressures below 10 MPa. For most ligaments, reaction forces remain within corresponding physiological ranges. A first realistic representation of the biomechanical behaviour of the human ankle when replaced by prosthetic joints is provided.

40|$|Although biomass {{is getting}} {{increased}} attention as a renewable energy source, {{one of the}} remaining problems still to be solved is {{the reduction of the}} high level of tar present in the product gas from gasification of biomass. The purpose of the present work is to study the activity of olivine and dolomite for tar destruction. Some researchers investigated olivine as bed material for biomass gasification. But it is not yet known how tars behave in the presence of olivine and whether olivine has some activity towards tar destruction. A slipstream from a lab-scale atmospheric bubbling-fluidised-bed gasifier (located at ECN) is passed through a secondary fixed-bed reactor where the additives are placed. For easy understanding, the results are represented in terms of the following tar classes; GC-undetectable tars (class 1), heterocyclic compounds (class 2), aromatic compounds (class 3), light polyaromatic compounds (class 4), heavy polyaromatic compounds (class 5). The general observation is that the conversion of all tar classes increases as the temperature was raised from 800 to 900 °C for both additives. The water-soluble heterocyclic compounds can be easily converted by thermal treatment. At the temperature of 900 °C, the water-soluble heterocyclic compounds are completely converted. A 48 % decrease in heavy PAHs is observed with pure sand. Addition of 17 wt% olivine to the sand leads to a 71 % decrease of PAHs at 900 °C, whereas addition of 17 wt% (pre-calcined) dolomite converted 90 %. Also improvement in conversion of <b>other</b> <b>tar</b> classes is observed when olivine and dolomite are added during hot gas cleaning. A total tar amount of 4. 0 g m 0 - 3 could be reduced to 1. 5 and 2. 2 g m 0 - 3 using dolomite and olivine, respectively, at a temperature of 900 °C.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionDespite good {{clinical}} results following total ankle replacement (TAR), {{the development}} of large periprosthetic cysts (> 400 mm 2) in the medium-term {{is a source of}} concern. ObjectiveThe primary objective {{of this study was to}} detect any large periprosthetic cysts in a cohort of AKILE™ patients using radiographs and CT scans, and then to compare these findings to published ones. Material and methodsA total of 127 TAR procedures were performed between June 1995 and January 2012. We retrospectively reviewed 68  cases with the newest AKILE™ implant design that had a minimum follow-up of 36  months. The average follow-up was 81 ± 33  months; eight patients were lost to follow-up. The outcomes consisted of analyzing radiographs (A/P and lateral weight bearing views, Meary view and lateral views of flexion/extension) and helical CT scans, performing clinical evaluations (range of motion, AOFAS score, Foot Function Index, pain levels) and determining the survivorship of TAR implants. ResultsTAR survival at 5 years was 79 % for in situ implants and 62 % for revision-free implants. The AOFAS score improved from 33. 7 ± 14. 7 to 77. 1 ± 15. 1 (out of 100) and the pain sub-score was 30. 2 ± 9. 7 (out of 40) at the last follow-up. The average ankle range of motion was 32. 3 °± 12. 7 ° on the radiographs. CT scan revealed Type A cysts (< 200 mm 2) under the talar implant in 52 % of cases and in the tibia in 50 % of cases; these cysts were smaller than 100 mm 2 in 80 % of cases and had no effect on the implants. No periprosthetic cysts larger than 400 mm 2 in size were identified. DiscussionThe medium-term functional results and survivorship are comparable to those reported for <b>other</b> <b>TAR</b> designs. The incidence of cysts was low overall and there were no large-diameter cysts, which should improve long-term survival. The implant's design and materials likely played a role in preserving the periprosthetic bone stock. The AKILE™ TAR has distinctive features related to the low rate of large periprosthetic cysts in the medium-term. Level of evidenceIV (retrospective case series) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{remediation}} {{of sites}} where soils have been contaminated with hydrophobic organic compounds {{is a major}} problem. This {{is especially true for}} manufactured gas plants (MGP) and similar industries. Gasification of fossil fuels has resulted in the production of tars that contain polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are of concern because they are persistent in the environment and because many of them are carcinogenic. When soils contain very high concentrations of PAHs and <b>other</b> <b>tar</b> components, it is generally most feasible to use a chemical-physical remediation technique such as incineration. However, when the contaminant concentrations are medium to low, the most inexpensive technology is generally biological treatment. Biological treatment is an environmentally acceptable method of remediation that is relatively low-cost for many organic contaminants. PAHs and similar hydrophobic compounds, however, present major challenges to the microbial methods. These problems can be broken down into two related areas: mass transfer and bioavailability. The water volubility of most PAW is very small, and they have very low vapor pressures. As a result the diffkion of the sorbed PAHs to a location where a biodegrading microorganism can encounter it is often limiting. Complicating this is that especially in aged samples, the PAHs are bound so strongly to soil components, they are not available for the microorganisms. These two phenomena can be better understood by examination of a typical biodegradation curve, such as might be observed for mixed PAHs. In Figure 1, there are three phases of the biodegradation process plotted with respect to time. In the first phase, concentrations are changing only slowly as the microbes adapt to the conditions, grow to a larger population, and begin to biodegrade the PAHs. The second phase is the phase of rapid, often logarithmic, biodegradation. The third and last phase is that period when available concentrations of PAHs are dropping so that the microorganisms cannot degrade them. The rate observed during the second phase is dependent {{on the size of the}} microbial population that can degrade the contaminants, the availability of the contaminants, and suitable nutrients (e. g., phosphorus) and electron acceptors (e. g., oxygen). When readily biodegradable contaminants are present this phase is often very rapid. However, when any one of the above factors is limiting, a reduced rate is observed...|$|R

50|$|Dr. Hans-Jörg Barth, German {{geographer}} (2001 research report): The study demonstrated that, {{in contrary}} to previously published reports e.g. already 1993 by UNEP, several coastal areas even in 2001 still show significant oil impact {{and in some}} places no recovery at all. The salt marshes which occur at almost 50% of the coastline show the heaviest impact {{compared to the other}} ecosystem types after 10 years. Completely recovered are the rocky shores and mangroves. Sand beaches are on the best way to complete recovery. The main reason for the delayed recovery of the salt marshes is the absence of physical energy (wave action) and the mostly anaerobic milieu of the oiled substrates. The latter is mostly caused by cyanobacteria which forms impermeable mats. In <b>other</b> cases <b>tar</b> crusts are responsible. The availability of oxygen is the most important criteria for oil degradation. Where oil degrades it was obvious that benthic intertidal fauna such as crabs re-colonise the destroyed habitats long before the halophytes. The most important paths of regeneration are the tidal channels and the adjacent areas. Full recovery of the salt marshes will certainly need some centuries.|$|R
