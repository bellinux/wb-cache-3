40|$|ABSTRACT- In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of electric diesel <b>particulate</b> <b>trap</b> (E-DPT) that has been proposed by the authors, behavior of trapping and re-burning of diesel soot was investigated using an electric diesel <b>particulate</b> <b>trap</b> {{with a pair of}} electro-plates (1 -channel E-DPT). The E-DPT was capable to trap soot by applying DC electric field between electro-plates. Experimental results showed that soot was accumulated on the electro-plates and some of soot deposits were like whiskers. Soot trapped on the plates formed bridge structures in narrow space between electro-plates and was ignited with Joule heat of electrification. When a soot bridge was re-burned, soot deposits on the plates near the bridge were also re-burned. After the re-burning, a new soot bridge was re-formed and above behaviors were automatically repeated...|$|R

To produce a model that simulates the filtration efficiency of non-loaded <b>particulate</b> <b>traps,</b> an existing flow field model of DPF filtration was modified to better capture the fundamental physics of deep-bed filtration. The improved model includes additional sedimentation and thermophoretic modes of filtration and the soot-cake related filtration approximations were removed. Size-dependent particulate concentrations were measured using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), both upstream and downstream of the filters. By comparing upstream and downstream particle number concentrations, the particle size-dependent filtration efficiency of filter samples was determined. Experimental results were compared to model predictions, and showed excellent agreement...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reveal the soot removal {{mechanism}} in Electric Diesel <b>Particulate</b> <b>Trap</b> (E-DPT), mechanism of soot trapping and re-burning of soot particles in exhaust gas was investigated using one channel electric diesel <b>particulate</b> <b>trap</b> (1 channel E-DPT). The E-DPT is capable to trap soot particles by applying DC electric field between electro-plates. The results showed that soot particles like a whisker grew up from negative electrode side toward positive one. Soot particles trapped on the plates formed many soot bridges in narrow space between electro-plates. Formation of soot particles depended on electric intensity. In the condition of F= 200 kV/m, lumps of soot were observed instead of whisker like soot bridges and soot trapping and soot re-burning were balanced. Ignition of the soot lump was occurred at the contact point between the lump and electro-plate, however re-burning of whole the lump was rarely observed. Remained soot drifted to down stream. It is thought that many remained soot particles were discharged from the E-DPT. Incomplete reburning of soot lump caused soot removal efficiency deterioration of E-DPT. In the case of narrow space and high electric intensity (F= 600 kV/m, L= 0. 5 mm), however, soot bridge re-burning was main phenomenon and soot lump re-burning was controlle...|$|R
40|$|This report {{represents}} an inventory {{derived from a}} desk study on particulate emissions from road traffic. These emissions concern exhaust-gas particulate emissions, as well as particulate emissions caused by tyre wear, wear of brake linings and wear of road surface. Another particulate emission source is dust caused by moving traffic. In addition to emission factors also size distribution and chemical composition of road traffic related particulates were investigated. Besides the effect of technical measures like oxidation catalysts and <b>particulate</b> <b>traps</b> were also discussed. From the study {{it can be concluded}} that: particulates in exhaust gas are smaller than 1 mum; cars with diesel engines were found in 1995 to have a 40 -times higher particulate emission than cars with petrol engines with three-way catalysts; oxidation catalysts applied to light-duty diesel engines lead to a 25 - 70 % reduction the particulate emissions; oxidation catalysts combined with heavy-duty diesel engines can lead to higher particulate emissions caused by the conversion of SO 2 to sulphates, with a reduction in the sulphate content of diesel fuel decreasing this phenomenon; <b>particulate</b> <b>traps</b> mounted on heavy duty engines give an 80 % reduction in the particulate emissions; traffic-related <b>particulate</b> emissions from <b>other</b> sources than exhaust gas also contribute subtantially to particulate emissions from a moving vehicle...|$|R

This paper examines the energy density required for oxidation of the SOF hydrocarbons {{and the fate of}} NO{sub 2 } during the oxidation of the particulate carbon. The energy density required for complete oxidation of the SOF hydrocarbons is shown to be unacceptably large. The reaction of NO{sub 2 } with carbon is shown to lead mainly to backconversion of NO{sub 2 } to NO. These results suggest that the use of a catalyst in combination with the plasma will be required to efficiently reduce the NO{sub x} and oxidize the SOF hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|Lean burn {{after-treatment}} {{systems are}} the current focus for reducing emissions from diesel exhaust. The trend is for commercial CFD packages {{to use a}} single channel modelling approach. Due to computational demands, this necessitates specification of representative channels for modelling, implying prior knowledge of the flow field. This paper investigates a methodology for applying the porous medium approach to lean burn after-treatment systems. This approach has proved successful for three-way catalysis modelling and has the advantage that the flow field is predicted. Chemical kinetic rates for NOx trapping and regeneration in the model are based on information available in the open literature. Similarly, filtration information based on mass accumulation and soot combustion kinetics are also readily available. Modification of the source terms in a commercial CFD package enables prediction of trapping and release of NOx. This is {{an effective way to}} model a NOx trap after-treatment system and provides simultaneous 3 D modelling of the flow field. With diesel, particulate filtration is required. In the case of <b>particulate</b> <b>traps,</b> however, because of channel geometry, some assumptions are necessary for use of the porous medium approach and these are discussed in this paper. Both models produce qualitatively correct output and have parameters that can be tuned to conform to experimental data. Data to validate the NOx trap model is to be measured. The <b>particulate</b> <b>trap</b> model, on the other hand, is a feasibility study for modelling the complete diesel after-treatment system using the porous medium approach. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this CRADA between Lockheed Martin and Cummins Engine Company was to develop fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (SiC) composite materials for use as diesel engine <b>particulate</b> <b>traps.</b> Chemical vapor deposition techniques were used to partially densify and rigidize a thin fibrous substrate and produce the porous SiC- based filter. Microwave energy was used to directly couple to the deposited SiC to uniformly heat the filter and oxidize the collected carbon particulates. For commercial usage <b>particulate</b> <b>traps</b> must: (1) filter carbon particulates from a high temperature diesel exhaust at an acceptably low backpressure, (2) survive thousands of thermal transients due to regeneration or cleaning of the filter by oxidizing the collected carbon, (3) be durable and reliable over the expected life of the filter (300, 000 miles or 10, 000 hours), and (4) provide a low overall operating cost which is competitive with other filtering techniques. The development efforts performed {{as part of this}} CRADA have resulted in a very promising new technology for Cummins Engine Company.

40|$|Catalytic {{combustion}} is {{an important}} area of catalysis and is used in energy production {{as well as in}} the abatement of harmful emissions of various types. This thesis is focused on three different areas of catalytic combustion: - Catalytic combustion of diesel soot - Development of catalytically active wire meshes through thermal spraying - Stabilisation and activation of g-alumina for methane combustion The first part of the thesis gives an introductory description of different aspects of catalytic combustion. This part also includes a review of different catalytic burners which have been studied during the course of the research work. Emissions of diesel soot may be trapped and combusted in a <b>particulate</b> <b>trap</b> coated with catalytically active materials. The soot particles must be combusted at temperatures prevailing in diesel exhausts, generally between 150 and 400 °C. To facilitate effective combustion at these temperatures, the <b>particulate</b> <b>trap</b> should be coated with an oxide catalyst consisting of V 2 O 5 /CuO (V:Cu= 0. 9 on molar basis). Catalytically active wire meshes offer a number of advantages over pellets and monolith catalysts. They combine geometric flexibility with excellent mass- and heat- transfer characteristics and a low pressure drop. By using a modified thermal spray technique, it is possible to produce porous adhesive ceramic coatings on metal surfaces. The specific surface area can be increased through deposition of a high-surface-area material into the macro-porosity of the as-sprayed layer. The ceramic layer is finally activated through a conventional impregnation technique. Palladium dispersed onto a Si-stabilised g-alumina is an appropriate combustion catalyst at temperatures below 1000 °C. Adding small amounts of rhodium or platinum to the palladium increases the catalyst activity but decreases the catalyst's stability to thermal deactivation. The addition of rare-earth-metal oxides will lead to increased thermal stability but to a decreased activity. Long-term deactivation tests show that the activity for combustion of methane decreases to the same extent as the value of the specific surface area, thus indicating that the alumina surface may play an important role during the activation of adsorbed methane molecules...|$|R
