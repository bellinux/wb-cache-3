5|$|The Walls of Constantinople are {{a series}} of {{defensive}} stone walls that have surrounded and protected the city of Constantinople (today Istanbul in Turkey) since its founding as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great. With numerous additions and modifications during their history, they were the last great fortification system of antiquity, and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complex</b> and elaborate systems ever built.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complex</b> eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E

The genitalia arise from the tenth or most distal segment of the abdomen. Lepidoptera have some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complex</b> genital structures of all insects, {{with a wide variety of}} complex spines, setae, scales and tufts in males, claspers of different shapes and different modifications of the ductus bursae in females, through which stored sperm is transferred within the female directly, or indirectly, to the vagina for fertilisation.|$|E
5|$|The {{judiciary}} of Texas is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complex</b> in the United States, {{with many}} layers and overlapping jurisdictions. Texas has two courts of last resort: the Texas Supreme Court, for civil cases, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Except for some municipal benches, partisan elections select judges {{at all levels}} of the judiciary; the governor fills vacancies by appointment. Texas is notable for its use of capital punishment, having led the country in executions since capital punishment was reinstated in the Gregg v. Georgia case (see Capital punishment in Texas).|$|E
5|$|The {{wreck of}} the Mary Rose was rediscovered in 1971. It was raised in 1982 by the Mary Rose Trust, in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complex</b> and {{expensive}} projects {{in the history of}} maritime archaeology. The surviving section of the ship and thousands of recovered artefacts are of immeasurable value as a Tudor-era time capsule. The excavation and raising of the Mary Rose was a milestone in the field of maritime archaeology, comparable in complexity and cost only to the raising of the Swedish 17th-century warship Vasa in 1961.|$|E
40|$|Tool path {{generation}} {{problem is}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complexes</b> in Computer Aided Manufacturing.

In <b>the</b> article we propose a model that will set apart the geometrical issues involved in the manufacturing process from the purely technology-dependent physical issues by means of a topological system. Presented in the paper there is a method for offsetting any kind of curve regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machining technology (i. e. independent of any tool geometry: spherical, conical, toroidal and so on). Specifically, we use parametric cubic curves, which is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> general and popular models in CAD/CAM applications...|$|R

5|$|Birds {{have one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complex</b> {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% {{of the fresh}} air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of}} the trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is {{an element}} in which the 5f {{electrons}} are the transition border between delocalized and localized; it is therefore considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complex</b> elements. The anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure. The energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low. The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice, on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior. The proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels. This leads to competing 5fn7s2 and 5fn−16d17s2 configurations, which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior. The highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|The soils {{in which}} plants grow are {{inhabited}} by microbial communities, with one gram of soil containing around 109-1010 microbial cells which comprise about one gigabase of sequence information. The microbial communities which inhabit soils are some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complex</b> known to science, and remain poorly understood despite their economic importance. Microbial consortia perform {{a wide variety}} of ecosystem services necessary for plant growth, including fixing atmospheric nitrogen, nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and sequester iron and other metals. Functional metagenomics strategies are being used to explore the interactions between plants and microbes through cultivation-independent study of these microbial communities. By allowing insights into the role of previously uncultivated or rare community members in nutrient cycling and the promotion of plant growth, metagenomic approaches can contribute to improved disease detection in crops and livestock and the adaptation of enhanced farming practices which improve crop health by harnessing the relationship between microbes and plants.|$|E

5|$|Myles' Mary Collins {{prosthetic}} {{took six}} hours to accomplish, and the shot where she morphs into the younger Lady Helen took seven hours to complete because it required three stages of make-up. Her first {{performance at the}} beheading scene was met with applause by the extras; Head requested that he redo {{his part of the}} scene because he felt that it was not good enough. Gaius' fall from the balcony was done by a stuntman and filmed with a high-speed camera. The mattress that Merlin magically moves across the floor was achieved with rigging it up to hidden wires and pulleys under the set. The knives Arthur throws were actually shot out of a nitrogen gun; James did throw them in a separate shot, but against a cloth that he still missed. Fake fruit was made for the stocks scene, but it was deemed too fake-looking and was replaced with real tomatoes. The mace fight was originally filmed with plastic maces, but they were not believable as they did not have enough weight. The scene was then shot with real steel maces; it was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complex</b> and hardest scenes to execute. The climax, where the guests all fall asleep and are covered by cobwebs, took many days to complete. The chandelier falling was also considered difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{length and}} {{internal}} structure of Peking-opera plays is highly variable. Prior to 1949, zhezixi, short plays or plays {{made up of}} short scenes from longer plays, were often performed. These plays usually center on one simple situation or feature a selection of scenes designed to include {{all four of the}} main Peking opera skills and showcase the virtuosity of the performers. This format has become less prevalent in recent times, but plays of one act are still performed. These short works, as well as individual scenes within longer works, are marked by an emotional progression {{from the beginning of the}} play to the end. For example, the concubine in the one act play The Favorite Concubine Becomes Intoxicated begins in a state of joy, and then moves to anger and jealousy, drunken playfulness, and finally to a feeling of defeat and resignation. A full-length play usually has from six to fifteen or more scenes. The overall story in these longer works is told through contrasting scenes. Plays will alternate between civil and martial scenes, or scenes involve protagonists and antagonists. There are several major scenes within the work that follow the pattern of emotional progression. It is these scenes that are usually excerpted for later zhezixi productions. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complex</b> plays may even have an emotional progression from scene to scene.|$|E

This is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>complexes,</b> intriguing and difficult to treat syndromes. This study aimed at promoting a narrative review including <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> central pain, its intercurrent symptoms which are important for the diagnosis, and different available treatments, indications, results and complications. CONTENTS: Relevant articles available in Medline, Scielo, Cochrane Library and Pubmed databases in the last 10 years were selected by means of keywords: chronic neuropathic pain, central neuropathic pain, central pain. CONCLUSION: Central painful syndrome is diagnosed by means of neurological clinical evaluation. It is often refractory to clinical and neuromodulatory treatment, its management should be multimodal and allow for rehabilitation...|$|R
