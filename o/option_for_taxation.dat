40|$|This study offers {{insights}} into the design of economically efficient policies to curb carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions in Switzerland and in other European countries. The method uses {{a model of the}} energy system to investigate various <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>taxation</b> to reduce CO 2 emissions. This study proposes as a first option the introduction of a 'hedging tax', that balances the risks of delaying measures to reduce cO 2 emissions against those of premature reduction measures. It then assesses multinational policy options and considers as a second alternative international co-operation to curb joint cO 2 emissions by means of a uniform tax applied in different countries. The simulation of such a strategy among three European countries (Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium) suggests that there may be significant benefits to be gained when CO 2 reduction takes place in the countries where it is relatively cheap to do so...|$|R

40|$|Background Childhood {{obesity is}} a {{recognised}} {{public health problem}} and around 25 % of Australian children are overweight or obese. A major contributor is the obesogenic environment which encourages over consumption of energy dense nutrient poor food. Taxation is commonly proposed as a mechanism to reduce consumption of poor food choices and hence reduce rates of obesity and overweight in the community. Methods/Design An economic model will be developed to assess the lifetime benefits and costs to a cohort of Australian children by reducing energy dense nutrient poor food consumption through taxation mechanisms. The model inputs will be derived {{from a series of}} smaller studies. Food <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>taxation</b> will be derived from literature and expert opinion, the acceptability and impact of price changes will be explored through a Citizen’s Jury and a discrete choice experiment and price elasticities will be derived from the discrete choice experiment and consumption data. Discussion The health care costs of managing rising levels of obesity are a challenge for all governments. This study will provide a unique contribution to the international knowledge base by engaging a variety of robust research techniques, with a multidisciplinary focus and be responsive to consumers from diverse socio-economic backgrounds...|$|R

A 2009 study of 26 European countries found that: [...] "In France, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Portugal, couples are jointly assessed. Ireland and Germany operate joint taxation, respectively, with an <b>option</b> <b>for</b> individual <b>taxation</b> {{and the right to}} be individually taxed when this is more advantageous; conversely individual taxation is the default option in Spain and Poland, but the option of joint assessment is offered. Elements of jointness remain in some income tax codes for which the individual is the unit of taxation - the Belgian, Estonian, Greek, Icelandic and Norwegian codes - some of which are minor while others matter. The remaining countries enforce individual income taxation without exceptions".|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} adapted from a {{submission}} {{in response to the}} Australian Government’s Consultation Paper ‘Native Title, Indigenous Economic Development and Tax’. The Consultation Paper mainly canvasses <b>options</b> <b>for</b> income <b>taxation</b> reforms with very little actually said about Indigenous economic development. This paper raises four key issues and ends with a brief conclusion and five recommendations. The key issues are: 1. What is motivating the native title taxation reform process given that the recently completed (Henry) Review of Australia’s Future Tax System made no mention of taxation of native title? 2. What are the intersections between native title payments and the income tax system? 3. What are the lessons to be learnt from the operations of the Mining Withholding Tax? 4. What are the lessons to be drawn for tax policy making from the 2010 Resources Super Profits Tax debate? Commentary in this paper draws largely on the author 2 ̆ 7 s research on these issues from 1982 to the present. Image: Milkwooders / flick...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{faced by}} {{many developing countries}} in raising revenue from direct taxes have forced them to rely heavily on indirect taxes to finance development interventions. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to illustrate how to identify socially desirable <b>options</b> <b>for</b> commodity <b>taxation</b> in the context of a poverty reduction strategy. Within the logic of social evaluation the author assesses tax options on the basis of value judgments underlying members of the additively separable class of poverty measures. The criterion hinges on both the pattern of consumption of each commodity and the price elasticity of the poverty measure used. An application of this methodology to data for Guinea shows that many components of food expenditure (particularly cereals, grains and roots) would be good candidates for exemption from VAT. Even though expenditure on health and education is distributed in favor of the non-poor, their importance for human capital development argues for a program of targeted subsidies in a broader context of cost recovery...|$|R
