50|$|Currently, CSSNC LED {{efficiency}} {{is less than}} that of <b>organic</b> <b>LEDs.</b> However, studies show that they have potential to accomplish what <b>organic</b> <b>LEDs</b> cannot. CSSNC LEDs constructed using multiple layers of CSSNCs resulted in poor conduction, charge imbalance, low luminescence efficiency, and a large number of pinhole defects. LEDs constructed of one monolayer avoid these problems. An advantage of CSSNC <b>LEDs</b> over <b>organic</b> <b>LEDs</b> is that CSSNC LEDs have narrower emissions, as narrow as 32 nm, than <b>organic</b> <b>LEDs,</b> which range from 50-100 nm. Specifically, the core-shell motif is desirable for use in LEDs because of their electroluminescence and photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and their ability to be processed into devices easily. Current aims for LED displays include developing materials with wavelength emissions of 610-620 nm for red displays, 525-530 nm for green displays, and 460-470 nm for blue displays. This is because these wavelengths maximize the perceived power and they lie outside of the National Television System Committee standard color triangle. CSSNCs have been synthesized that meet these wavelength emissions: (CdSe)ZnS for red emission, (CdS)ZnS for blue emission, and (CdxZn1−xSe)CdyZn1−yS for the green emission. Using CdSe core and ZnS or CdS/ZnS shells, the maximum luminance values of red, orange, yellow and green LEDs were improved to 9,064, 3,200, 4,470 and 3,700 cd m−2, respectively; electroluminescent efficiency (1.1-2.8 cd A21), and turn-on voltages (3-4 V) were also increased.|$|R

5000|$|Due to its stability, processability, and {{electrical}} and optical properties, PPV {{has been considered}} {{for a wide variety}} of applications.1 In 1989 the first polymer-based light emitting diode (LED) was discovered using PPV as the emissive layer. Polymers are speculated to have advantages over molecular materials in LEDs, such as ease of processing, reduced tendency for crystallization, and greater thermal and mechanical stability. Ever since the first breakthrough in 1989, a large number of PPV derivatives have been synthesized and used for LED applications. Although solid-state lasing has yet to be demonstrated in an <b>organic</b> <b>LED,</b> polyvinylene (MEH-PPV) has been proven to be a promising laser dye due to its high fluorescence efficiency in solution.|$|E
