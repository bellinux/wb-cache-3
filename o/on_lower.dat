5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon. Flowers are self-fecundating and protogynous (with female parts {{maturing}} first), and will self-pollinate if {{they have not been}} pollinated by insects during the day. While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies. The hair <b>on</b> <b>lower</b> stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.|$|E

5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens <b>on</b> <b>lower</b> socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lookout}} {{at the summit}} was abandoned, the Forest Service changed {{strategies}} from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts <b>on</b> <b>lower</b> peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as airplanes became the cheaper method to spot fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed or left to disintegrate. One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending. Two lookouts remain nearby on the Yakama Indian Reservation. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of high fire danger.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, castles {{were built}} {{throughout}} the Holy Roman Empire, which then spanned central Europe. They now typically {{took the form}} of an enclosure on a hilltop, or, <b>on</b> <b>lower</b> ground, a tall, free-standing tower (German Bergfried.) The largest castles, known in German as Hohenburgen, had well-defined inner and outer courts, but no mottes. The motte-and-bailey design began to spread into Alsace and the northern Alps from France {{during the first half of}} the 11th century, spreading further into Bohemia and Austria in the subsequent years. This form of castle was closely associated with the colonisation of newly cultivated areas within the Empire, as new lords were granted lands by the emperor and built castles close to the local gród, or town. Motte-and-bailey castle building substantially enhanced the prestige of local nobles, and it has been suggested that their early adoption was because they were a cheaper way of imitating the still more prestigious hohenburgen, but this is usually regarded as unlikely. In many cases, bergfrieds were converted into motte and bailey designs by burying existing castle towers within the mounds.|$|E

5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices <b>on</b> <b>lower</b> tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are herbivores that browse during drier {{winter months}} but have also adapted to grazing {{during the rainy}} season when grasses are more common. They require a high-protein diet of {{succulent}} leaves from flowering plants but will consume lower quality plant material if available including forbs, trees, shrubs, grasses, seeds and tubers. The eland can conserve water by increasing its body temperature. Grasses the eland eats include Setaria and Themeda and fruits from Securinega and Strychnos. Large antelope can survive <b>on</b> <b>lower</b> quality food in times of little rain. Elands feed during the night in hot weather and sleep for long periods during the day.|$|E
5|$|Equines are {{monogastric}} hindgut fermenters. They {{prefer to}} eat grasses and sedges, {{but may also}} consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits and roots if their favored foods are scarce, particularly asses. Compared to ruminants, equines have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist <b>on</b> <b>lower</b> quality vegetation. After food is passed though the stomach, it enters the sac-like cecum. where cellulose is broken down by micro-organisms. Fermentation is quicker in equines than in ruminants; 30–45 hours for a horse compared to 70–100 hours for a cow. Equines may spend 60-80 {{percent of their time}} feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation. In the African savannas, the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer; mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialized grazers like blue wildebeests and Thomson's gazelles which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.|$|E

5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} Equidae, which {{includes}} horses, asses, and zebras. Within Equidae, Equus is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven living species. The term equine refers to any member of this genus, including horses. Like Equidae more broadly, Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist <b>on</b> <b>lower</b> quality vegetation.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{charting}} of Renegades, {{marked the}} third decade {{in which a}} Feeder album had been released and charted {{at least in the}} Top 20.

The album also debuted at #1 on the Official UK Rock Albums chart. Still, Renegades has yet to accumulate sales that approach or eclipse any of their other studio albums before this. 2012 follow-up Generation Freakshow, charted higher at #13 although <b>on</b> <b>lower</b> debut week sales, before 2016 saw the band return to the top 10 with All Bright Electric. 2002's Comfort in Sound is the band's second best selling release, shifting over 506,000 units in the United Kingdom alone with The Singles shifting 524,000 units, as of October 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany.

The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass <b>on</b> <b>lower</b> costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about this species' behavior. The Congo serpent eagle lives in the {{understory}} of its habitat and occasionally perches <b>on</b> <b>lower</b> boughs in tall trees. It lives either alone or in pairs. This species is known to hunt snakes, lizards, especially chameleons, toads, and potentially small mammals. It hunts by dropping to the ground from its perch in the understory, where it may strike its prey repeatedly with its feet; this serpent eagle may also grab prey from the foliage while hunting. Its large eyes enable this species to hunt in low light, though it is diurnal. Studies on the species' eyes have shown that they have about two times the visual resolution of a human's. It may breed from October to December in Gabon and from June to November in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
5|$|NY3 {{originally}} {{followed a}} vastly different alignment {{than it does}} today.

In New York, it connected North Tonawanda (near Niagara Falls) in the west to Plattsburgh in the east via Rochester and Watertown. NY3 began at what is now the intersection of US62 and NY425 and followed modern NY425 north through Cambria Station to Cambria Center, from where the highway continued to Lockport <b>on</b> <b>Lower</b> Mountain, Gothic Hill, and Upper Mountain Roads and modern NY31. It remained on current NY31 through the city and mostly followed that route's modern alignment across western New York to the city of Rochester. The most significant exception to this was between Lockport and Gasport, where NY3 veered south by way of modern NY77 and County Route10 (CR10) to serve the hamlet of McNalls.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} a lattice model of polymers where the nearest-neighbour monomer-monomer interaction strengths differ {{according to whether}} the local configurations have so-called "hydrogen-like" formations or not. If the interaction strengths {{are all the same}} then the classical θ-point collapse transition occurs <b>on</b> <b>lowering</b> the temperature, and the polymer enters the isotropic liquid-drop phase known as the collapsed globule. On the other hand, strongly favouring the hydrogen-like interactions give rise to an anisotropic folded (solid-like) phase <b>on</b> <b>lowering</b> the temperature. We use Monte Carlo simulations up to a length of 256 to map out the phase diagram in the plane of parameters and determine the order of the associated phase transitions. We discuss the connections to semi-flexible polymers and other polymer models. Importantly, we demonstrate that for a range of energy parameters two phase transitions occur <b>on</b> <b>lowering</b> the temperature, the second being a transition from the globule state to the crystal state. We argue from our data that this globule-to-crystal transition is continuous in two dimensions in accord with field-theory arguments concerning Hamiltonian walks, but is first order in three dimensions...|$|R
