50|$|Alisa Freindlich was the director's primary {{choice for}} the role of Kalugina. Eldar Ryazanov created the {{character}} having in mind Freindlich as the one to portray it. Moreover, he started working on the screenplay seriously only after securing consent of all the actors he wanted to cast to participate in the film. It was a rare case in Soviet cinema when a director would be allowed to cast all actors of his own choice without preliminary screen-tests and approval of the Art Council. Ryazanov worried that Freindlich {{would not be able to}} come to Moscow for shooting of the film because of stage performances and rehearsals she was busy with in her native Leningrad. So he assured both the actress and her management that she would be allowed to go to Leningrad <b>on</b> the <b>first</b> <b>demand.</b> It came out that she was compelled to leave for the theater often and thus travel between Moscow and Leningrad all the time.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Safety {{issues are}} usually of primary {{importance}} in industries as accidents can have extremely severe {{consequences for the}} human, environment and the property. To provide a safe and efficient operation of an industrial complex, some demands should be fulfilled. These are: 1. Hazards and incident scenarios should be identified and eliminated, 2. Protective tools should be designed to minimise {{the effect of the}} accident, 3. Operators and personnel should be trained, and 4. A more effective rescue organisation should be provided. In this study which is focused <b>on</b> the <b>first</b> <b>demands</b> a safety model is presented to assess the risks in industry and minimise them to an acceptable level by applying an analytical procedure at semi quantitative level. It was found from the literature that analytical method accompanied by risk ranking matrix could be capable to identify the incident scenarios and level of risk in relation with each scenario. The reduction of the risk level could be achieved by providing appropriate safeguards and control. These efforts should be performed in the frame of a system safety. Copyright © SHO 200...|$|R

Gas demand forecasts commonly show optimistic trends increasing gently or steeply, as shown in Figure 1. The reasons for this expected ‘dash for gas’ are well known: the economics and efficiency of the new combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants, the environmental qualities of gas, and the adaptability, flexibility and availability of gas in an open power sector...|$|R
50|$|Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius {{were sent}} to {{negotiate}} terms with the plebeians at their discretion. The plebeians welcomed and thanked them because of their previous stand at the forum.

The envoys agreed <b>on</b> the <b>first</b> three <b>demands</b> and asked that the issue of punishment be postponed. The plebeians accepted this. The senate decreed the abdication of the decemviri, the election of the plebeian tribunes and the mentioned immunity. The plebeians returned to Rome and elected their tribunes. The plebeian council carried a motion of immunity and passed a bill for the election of consuls subject to appeal.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the implications of}} increasing land supply constraints in the United States <b>on</b> urban <b>demand.</b> <b>First,</b> because shifts in demand are now capitalized more into the price of land, house prices in some metropolitan areas have grown increasingly unaffordable to typical households. This might {{have an effect on}} the fundamental character of such cities. Second, the effect of home owners' financial interests as landowners on their decisions about what regulations or investments in their communities to support may become stronger. Third, researchers may now be able to better use land prices to make inferences about urban demand. However, interpreting real estate prices still is tricky.

40|$|Health {{insurance}} companies curb price-insensitive {{behavior and the}} moral hazard of insureds by means of cost-sharing, such as tiered co-payments or reference pricing in drug markets. This paper evaluates the effect of price limits –below which drugs are exempt from co-payments– on prices and <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b> <b>First,</b> using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, {{we find that the}} new policy decreases prices by 5 percent for generics and increases prices by 4 percent for brand-name drugs in the German reference price market. Second, estimating a nested-logit demand model, we show that consumers appreciate co-payment exempt drugs and calculate lower price elasticities for brand-name drugs than for generics. This explains the different price responses of brand-name and generic drugs and shows that price-related co-payment tiers are an effective tool to steer demand to low-priced drugs...|$|R

60|$|The {{holidays}} were over, without {{there being}} any material revival of trade, when my deliverance unexpectedly occurred. It was in February, and I do believe our mistress {{had abandoned the}} expectation of disposing of us that season, when I heard a gentle voice speaking near the counter, one day, in tones which struck me as familiar. It was a female, of course, and her inquiries were about a piece of cambric handkerchiefs, which she said {{had been sent to}} this shop from a manufactory in Picardie. There was nothing of the customary alertness in the manner of our mistress, and, to my surprise, she even showed the customer one or two pieces of much inferior quality, before we were produced. The moment I got into the light, however, I recognized the beautifully turned form and sweet face of Adrienne de la Rocheaimard. The poor girl was paler and thinner than when I had last seen her, doubtless, I thought, the effects of her late illness; but I could not conceal from myself the unpleasant fact that she was much less expensively clad. I say less expensively clad, though the expression is scarcely just, for I had never seen her in attire that could properly be called expensive at all; and, yet, the term mean would be equally inapplicable to her present appearance. It might be better to say that, relieved by a faultless, even a fastidious neatness and grace, there was an air of severe, perhaps of pinched economy in her present attire. This it was that had prevented our mistress from showing her fabrics as fine as we, <b>on</b> the <b>first</b> <b>demand.</b> Still I thought there was a slight flush on the cheek of the poor girl, and a faint smile on her features, as she instantly recognized us for old acquaintances. For one, I own I was delighted at finding her soft fingers again brushing over my own exquisite surface, feeling as if one had been expressly designed for the other. Then Adrienne hesitated; she appeared desirous of speaking, and yet abashed. Her color went and came, until a deep rosy blush settled on each cheek, and her tongue found utterance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} about a {{paradigm}} shift from the current practice of manually searching for and adapting components and their manual assembly to Generative Programming, which is the automatic selection and assembly of components <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b> <b>First,</b> we argue that the current 00 technology does not support reuse and configurability in an effective way. Then we show how a system family approach can aid in defining reusable components. Finally, we describe how automate the assembly of components based on configuration knowledge. We compare this paradigm shift {{to the introduction of}} interchangeable parts and automated assembly lines in the automobile industry. We also illustrate the steps necessary to develop a product line using a simple example of a car product line. We present the feature model of the product line, develop a layered architecture for it, and automate the assembly of the components using a generator. We also discuss some design issues, applicability of the approach, and future development. 1 From Handcrafting to an Automated Assembly Line This paper {{is about a}} paradigm shift from the current practice of manually searching for and adapting components and their manual assembly to Generative Programming...|$|R
