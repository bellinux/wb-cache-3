5|$|In 1920, Wilson {{applied for}} and {{received}} a Regular Army commission in the Air Service, into which he was commissioned as a first lieutenant on 1 July 1920. He was immediately advanced to captain and posted to the <b>Observation</b> <b>School</b> at Post Field, Oklahoma as a senior instructor. In 1922, {{he was sent to}} Carlstrom Field, Florida for primary pilot training and then to Kelly Field, Texas for advanced training. He also served there as an instructor in observation. From 1924 to 1927, he served in Washington, DC, in the Office of the Chief of the Air Service. This was followed by a two-year tour of duty in the Philippines as commander of the 2nd Observation Squadron.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Lympne was {{designated}} a First Class Landing Ground and the Day and Night Bombing <b>Observation</b> <b>School</b> was formed here in May. The RFC and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged {{to form the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1918. From 17 July 1919, No. 120 Squadron RAF flew air mail services between Lympne and Cologne, Germany, using de Havilland DH.9 aircraft fitted with Beardmore Halford Pullinger engines. This service ended on 1 September 1919 when 120 squadron moved to RAF Hawkinge. Hawkinge and Lympne lay within {{a few miles of}} each other and as the Air Ministry could not justify keeping the two bases open following the end of the war, they decided to retain Hawkinge. In August 1919 the RAF moved out of Lympne and it was turned over to civilian use, although 120 Squadron did not depart until 21 October.|$|E

25|$|In 1918 Lympne was a First Class Landing Ground {{and used}} by Sopwith Camels of No. 50 Squadron RFC (Home Defence Squadron) and in January 1918 No. 120 Squadron RFC (Bomber Squadron) was formed at Lympne.

2500|$|The <b>Observation</b> <b>School</b> {{course was}} ten weeks in length. [...] The {{observers}} were thoroughly trained in code {{practice and the}} use of the radio for air-to-ground communication, and the pilots were trained in transition flying. [...] Later in the course, photography from aircraft was taught and concentration of instruction was performed in flying as a team. [...] Six student observers and three pilots were assigned to each flight.|$|E
2500|$|Budget {{reductions}} {{and a need}} for better coordination of flight training brought on a major Air Service reorganization in 1922. San Antonio thereupon became the flying training center of the Air Service. [...] In the reorganization of 1922, the Air Service opened an Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field to take over training formerly performed by the tactical units and by the <b>Observation</b> <b>School</b> at Post Field, Oklahoma. [...] To accommodate this consolidation, the Air Corps Advanced Flying School was organized at Kelly Field Number 1, which let the tactical units operate from the main field (Kelly Field Number 2). [...] The 10th School Group was organized on 19 July 1922 to perform duties as the headquarters for the school. Four Flying Training Squadrons (40th, 41st 42d 43d) {{were assigned to the}} group to train the students.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine how reform at the middle school level translates into classroom practice within the framework of innovation and decision-making. A set of field notes was developed through formal and informal interviews with the building principal and two interdisciplinary teams of teachers (N= 11) who had moved away from traditional curriculum and instruction in favor of a more integrated, active approach. Data were also gathered from school, team, and classroom <b>observations,</b> <b>school</b> documents, curriculum guides, and unit plans. Findings indicated that teams negotiated decisions and accommodated personal preferences in a culture of trust, collegiality, and support.
