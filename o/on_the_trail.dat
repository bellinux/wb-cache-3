Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of South Vietnam, the trail system had been the target of continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts that had begun in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|E

That season, Roy won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in a near-unanimous vote. He was selected as a reserve to the 2008, 2009, and 2010 All-Star games. Roy played the most minutes of any Western Conference player, and tied for the most points in the West in the 2008 season, and he played the most minutes of any player during the 2009 season.|$|E
5|$|Francis {{spends most}} of the season as the newly {{appointed}} Vice President of the United States. In early episodes Frank vanquishes reporters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> of a murder he committed in the previous season. However, the drama soon shifts to tensions involving Frank, President Walker, the Chinese government, and the wealthy Raymond Tusk, eventually culminating in a bitter political war between Frank and Tusk. Frank's wife Claire publicly reveals that she was raped in college by a prominent general and pursues anti-rape legislation. The most significant new character is Jackie Sharp, Frank's successor as House Whip, who soon finds herself embroiled in Frank's plans. As the war between Frank and Tusk consumes the Presidency, things culminate in a scandal that leads to Walker resigning, Tusk being arrested, and Frank ascending to the Oval Office.|$|E

5|$|The {{first season}} of Supernatural, an American fantasy horror {{television}} series created by Eric Kripke, premiered on September 13, 2005, and concluded on May 4, 2006 after 22 episodes.

During their travels, they use their father's journal to help them carry on the family business—saving people and hunting supernatural creatures. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles star as Sam and Dean, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan recurring as their father, John, and Nicki Aycox as the demonic Meg Masters. This is the only season to air on The WB Television Network, with all subsequent seasons airing on The CW Television Network, a joint venture of The WB and UPN.|$|E

40|$|Naphthalene {{sublimation}} {{technique and}} the heat/mass transfer analogy {{are used to}} determine the detailed local heat/mass transfer distributions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leading and <b>trailing</b> walls of a twopass square channel with smooth walls that rotates about a perpendicular axis. Since the variation of density is small in the flow through the channel, buoyancy effect is negligible. Results show that, in both the stationary and rotating channel cases, very large spanwise variations of the mass transfer exist in he turn and in the region immediately downstream of the turn in the second straight pass. In the first straight pass, the rotation-induced Coriolis forces reduce <b>the</b> mass transfer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leading wall and increase <b>the</b> mass transfer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> wall. In <b>the</b> turn, rotation significantly increases <b>the</b> mass transfer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leading wall, especially in the upstream half of the turn. Rotation also increases <b>the</b> mass transfer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> wall, more in the downstream half of the turn than in the upstream half of the turn. Immediately downstream of the turn, rotation causes the mass transfer to be much higher <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> wall near <b>the</b> downstream corner of the tip of the inner wall than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposite leading wall. The mass transfer in the second pass is higher <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leading wall than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> wall. A slower flow causes higher mass transfer enhancement in <b>the</b> turn <b>on</b> both <b>the</b> leading and <b>trailing</b> walls...|$|R
