5|$|A {{major feature}} in the early {{development}} of Modern English was the codification <b>of</b> <b>explicit</b> norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language {{in an effort to}} establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|But several {{defining}} {{features of}} modern Canada {{can be traced}} back to Diefenbaker. Diefenbaker's Bill of Rights remains in effect, and signalled the change in Canadian political culture that would eventually bring about the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which came into force after his death. Diefenbaker was the first to appoint women and ethnic minorities to Cabinet. It was under Diefenbaker that Canada finally achieved universal adult suffrage, with the granting of the vote to Native Canadians in 1960. The removal <b>of</b> <b>explicit</b> racial discrimination from the criteria for admission to Canada under the Immigration Act of 1961 was a factor in the creation of today's multi-cultural and multi-ethnic Canada.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Argentinean {{zoologist}} Elio Massoia {{suggested that}} Winge's Hesperomys simplex {{and the living}} Pseudoryzomys wavrini are in fact the same species. In a 1991 study, American zoologists Voss and Myers confirmed this suggestion after re-examining Winge's material, finding no appreciable differences among specimens of H. simplex and P. wavrini. Since then, the species has been known as Pseudoryzomys simplex (Winge, 1887), because simplex is the oldest specific name for the animal; Oryzomys wavrini Thomas, 1921, and Pseudoryzomys wavrini reigi Pine and Wetzel, 1975, are junior synonyms. Voss and Myers also re-evaluated the relationships of Pseudoryzomys; they considered it closer to oryzomyines than to phyllotines, but declined to formally place it in Oryzomyini in the absence <b>of</b> <b>explicit</b> phylogenetic justification for such a placement.|$|E

She has a lot <b>of</b> <b>explicit</b> knowledge but lacks the intuition to win games. Her grandfather was infamously known for losing games and giving up Elkia's land. As a result, Stephanie strives to restore the honor of her grandfather and humanity. When Sora and Shiro are crowned, she becomes their assistant and deals with Elkia's economics and politics. They discover her grandfather kept hidden records on the other species which becomes an asset to their victories; her experience with Sora and Shiro improves her skill {{to the point that}} she can win against normal humans.

40|$|Although {{a growing}} body of {{literature}} addresses the effects of young people's use <b>of</b> sexually <b>explicit</b> Internet material, research on the compulsive use of this type of online content among adolescents and its associated factors is largely lacking. This study investigated whether factors from three distinct psychosocial domains (i. e., psychological well-being, sexual interests/behaviors, and impulsive-psychopathic personality) predicted symptoms of compulsive use <b>of</b> sexually <b>explicit</b> Internet material among adolescent boys. Links between psychosocial factors and boys' compulsive use symptoms were analyzed both cross-sectionally and longitudinally with compulsive use symptoms measured 6 months later (T- 2). Data were used from 331 Dutch boys (M (age) = 15. 16 years, range 11 - 17) who indicated that they used sexually explicit Internet material. The results from negative binomial regression analyses indicated that lower levels of global self-esteem and higher levels of excessive sexual interest concurrently predicted boys' symptoms of compulsive use <b>of</b> sexually <b>explicit</b> Internet material. Longitudinally, higher levels of depressive feelings and, again, excessive sexual interest predicted relative increases in compulsive use symptoms 6 months later. Impulsive and psychopathic personality traits were not uniquely related to boys' symptoms of compulsive use <b>of</b> sexually <b>explicit</b> Internet material. Our findings, while preliminary, suggest that both psychological well-being factors and sexual interests/behaviors are involved in the development of compulsive use <b>of</b> sexually <b>explicit</b> Internet material among adolescent boys. Such knowledge is important for prevention and intervention efforts that target the needs of specific problematic users <b>of</b> sexually <b>explicit</b> Internet material...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} <b>of</b> <b>expliciting</b> {{practice has}} been and still is a controversial issue {{that has been the}} central focus of theoretical papers, dissertations and practical models within the knowledge management field. Although most of these discrepancies are of a theoretical nature, they have nonetheless a great impact on the practical domain that goes far beyond just the knowledge management field. This paper aims to shed light on some aspects related to the possibility <b>of</b> <b>expliciting</b> knowledge. The Operations Management field will provide us the opportunity to address this issue. In this field, process documentation is a well-established practice that aims to capture the business practice in process representations like blueprintings and flowcharts. These explicit documents {{play a key role in}} process management, design and improvement. But, to what extent do they reflect practice? This is the dilemma of process formalisation that we will tackle through a theoretical analysis and through a case study of a Spanish service company immersed in making their practice explicit. ...|$|R
