It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{was chosen}} as the showrunner for the series by Killen. Gordon commended the pilot script at first glance. Gordon {{originally}} read the script on a flight to New York City. [...] "I read the pilot, and <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> past my envy, I was struck by the voice," [...] he stated. [...] "So few writers have real voices. Kyle is disarmingly self-effacing; and at the same time, he's disarmingly confident. It's that duality thing: On the one hand, he's open; on the other, he's closed." [...] Gordon later compared the television series to The Good Wife. He said that The Good Wife has so many procedural aspects that you have to decide which format to use each week. He compared it to Awake, saying, then, [...] "What makes an Awake episode?" [...] "Pilot" [...] was written by Killen, and directed by David Slade.|$|E
500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, you know what? I can change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it'll come to you and end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|E

500|$|Awake is a co-production of Letter Eleven and Howard Gordon's Teakwood Lane Productions, in {{association}} with 20th Century Fox Television.

500|$|Recurring {{guest star}} Mike O'Malley {{appears in the}} episode as Kurt's father Burt, sharing a scene with Colfer and Monteith which Colfer has {{described}} as the most emotional scene of the series thus far, explaining: [...] "Reading it on paper I {{had no idea it}} was going to be that intense. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into it, then I kind of realised, 'Oh, there's such a bigger meaning behind this. Oh my God, this is so dramatic'." [...] Colfer called [...] "Theatricality" [...] his favorite episode of the whole series. Other recurring characters who appear in [...] "Theatricality" [...] are glee club members Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton, who gets his first lines in this episode), school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman), school athletes and bullies Karofsky and Azimio, Principal Figgins, Vocal Adrenaline coach Shelby Corcoran and Finn's mother Carole Hudson.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Rita Bennett was originally invented by Jeff Lindsay for his series of novels about Dexter Morgan, {{and she is}} featured {{in all but the}} final book in the series. Clyde Phillips and Melissa Rosenberg wanted to bring the character into the television series when casting for the TV version, Dexter. Julie Benz was given a copy of the script in 2005 and was asked to audition for the part. She was surprised because the script was [...] "one of the best pilot scripts [...] ever read." [...] She also read for the part of Debra and joked that she would have auditioned for Dexter's role. Benz had been a fan of Michael C. Hall from his role in Six Feet Under. She {{said in an interview with}} Vanity Fair, [...] "I was such a fan, to the point where my cell-phone ring was the show’s theme song. I had to change it <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> cast!". Benz performed for four seasons, until her character was killed in the series.|$|E

500|$|Espinosa {{landed the}} lead role of the film Gloria in 2014. The film is a biopic about singer-songwriter Gloria Trevi, and her {{relation}} with her manager, record producer Sergio Andrade. The movie chronicles {{the rise and fall}} of the singer's career, detailing Trevi's first encounter with Andrade (who became her mentor), her brief tenure in a band, her rise to musical stardom, a sex scandal involving minors, and her imprisonment in Brazil. Espinosa won the role after a month-and-a-half casting process, stating that [...] "I do not know how many actresses were , or who they were, but <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the role I knew it was a big responsibility, because it is a character who is alive and has a lot of fans, I had to do it well. It is a very complex character, full of nuances, with great force". Espinosa took singing lessons and had to learn Trevi's accent. Also, to fully prepare for the role, the actress was assigned a choreographer and worked with the film director to find the right tone for the scenes. Espinosa watched Trevi's interviews, concerts and films to be able to play her. [...] "The role was meant for me", Espinosa said to Noticine.|$|E
500|$|While {{waiting for}} Lasers to be released, Fiasco {{completed}} another album, titled [...] [...] He was unsure if the Food and Liquor II {{would ever be}} released, though he released the song [...] "Go To Sleep" [...] from the record [...] "out of desperation" [...] to put out new music. He also pursued numerous side projects {{in the midst of}} the delay. [...] In April 2010, Fiasco formed the hip hop collective All City Chess Club along with Pharrell, Asher Roth, B.o.B, The Cool Kids, Charles Hamilton, Blu, Diggy Simmons, Wale, J. Cole, & Dosage. [...] The group has so far made one song, a remix of Fiasco's [...] "I'm Beamin". [...] Additionally, On July 16, 2010, Fiasco released his rock side-project Japanese Cartoon's debut EP In The Jaws of the Lords of Death. Japanese Cartoon was influenced by a variety of musical genres, with Fiasco saying, [...] "I've always been a fan of all music...Hip hop is just something I actually know how to do but I always had aspirations to participate in other forms of music. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to create some hip hop, it was like, 'Okay, what am I going to do now?' So my artistic side was like, 'Yo, let's do some rock music.'" ...|$|E

"I don't {{suppose that}} they will care much about it one way or another," [...] O'Driscol remarked; [...] "their pockets are so full of English gold {{that the loss of}} a few tons of tobacco won't affect them much.

500|$|Night {{fighter pilot}} Wilhelm Johnen {{commented on the}} arrival of Sayn-Wittgenstein at his unit: [...] "... A madman, I thought, as I took my leave. <b>Once</b> outside <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into {{conversation}} with the Prince's crew. Among other things {{they told me that}} their princely coachman had recently made his radio operator stand to attention in the plane and confined him to his quarters for three days because he (the radio operator) had lost his screen [...] during a mission." ...|$|R
500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E
2500|$|We'd {{decided to}} write a Christmas song and I {{wanted to make it}} reflect a British family Christmas. Economically, the country was up the creek.

That's why I came up with the line [...] "Look to the future now, it's only just begun". <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the line, [...] "Does your Granny always tell you that the old ones are the best", I knew I'd got a right cracker on my hands.|$|E
2500|$|Jimmie Johnson {{took the}} lead with nine laps {{remaining}} to take his first win at Michigan International Speedway. This was his first career win at Michigan, after numerous unsuccessful attempts that ended with crashes, engine failures, or running out of fuel. [...] "We had figured out every way to lose this race," [...] Johnson said after winning at Michigan {{for the first time}} in 25 tries. [...] "And today we were able to get it done. [...] "We really were in a win-win situation," [...] he added. [...] "Those guys still had to come to pit road to make it to the end. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> an idea of how the race was unfolding, I knew we were in the catbird seat and were able to take advantage of it.

The guy said, 'I can't give this to you, knowing what you're doing.'" [...] Holmgren has received emails from over 20 countries, and there are several websites devoted to his truck.

2500|$|In December 2006, Norwood was {{involved}} in a fatal automobile accident on Los Angeles' San Diego (405) Freeway. The accident claimed the life of the 38-year-old driver of a Toyota that was struck by Norwood's Range Rover. Norwood was neither arrested nor charged with vehicular manslaughter due to insufficient evidence. Nevertheless, multiple lawsuits were filed against Norwood, all of which were ultimately settled out of court by her civil attorney. Posing an extraordinary hardship for Brandy and her family, Norwood stepped down from her role as a judge on the second season of the amateur talent contest America's Got Talent and went into hiatus. Expanding on dealing with the aftermath of the tragedy, Norwood explained, [...] "I just wanted people to know that this wasn't news. It's not something that should be talked about like it's gossip. You don't like me? Fine. But don't use this situation to try to hurt me, because the guilt of being involved is enough. It's something that I'll never truly, truly get over." [...] While the accident put a halt on the album's production, Norwood soon resumed recording which she found to be therapeutic: [...] "I had to face it and find the strength to move forward. Connecting back with music has definitely helped me through everything. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back in the studio, the butterflies went away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three {{weeks after}} the Eclipse, Golden Horn was the only three-year-old {{scheduled}} to contest the 55th running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over {{one and a half}} miles at Ascot Racecourse. On the eve of the race, Gosden indicated that colt had made further progress, saying [...] "Golden Horn's been fine since the Eclipse and even progressed physically - he's filled out. We always thought that he was a good, proper horse, but he just seems that much more streetwise - harder and tougher now." [...] Heavy rain on the day before the race softened the ground and led to the withdrawal of the only French challenger Flintshire. After walking the course {{on the morning of the}} race, Gosden withdrew Golden Horn, saying [...] "It is very frustrating... The ground in the straight would be no problem - it's just the old track. It rides deep, deep down there and holding. If it was all on the new track I wouldn't hesitate on running, but it is not. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> down to Swinley Bottom the stick went in 12 inches and made a pop sound as it came out... He can go on good to soft no problem. He can probably go on genuine soft, but I don't want to involve him in a sticky, holding ground". In Golden Horn's absence the race was won by Postponed.|$|E
