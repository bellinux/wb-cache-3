5|$|When {{a public}} {{authority}} fetters its discretion, it {{can either be}} said to have failed to exercise its discretionary power or to have been subject to external influences. In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), two distinct forms of fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> were recognized: fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> through rigid adherence to a policy, and fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> by an unlawful delegation of authority. These two forms of fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> have been said to represent two elements defining the concept <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> in administrative law – the first form relates to freedom of choice, and second form the notion of one's personal discretion.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{subjective}} test applied in Karam Singh and Lee Mau Seng, the exercise <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> by the President and the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA is {{not open to}} review. The court cannot enquire about the grounds and the facts justifying the executive's decision. In contrast, under the objective test, the exercise <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> is reviewable by {{a court of law}} and the executive has to satisfy the court that there are objective facts justifying the executive's decision.|$|E
5|$|Secondly, the Court concurred with {{judicial}} opinion {{expressed in}} other Commonwealth jurisdictions that courts can objectively review the executive's exercise <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> {{in the context}} of preventive detention on national security grounds. Cases from Zimbabwe, South-West Africa, and St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla were referred to with approval.|$|E

5|$|Fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> by {{a public}} {{authority}} {{is one of the}} grounds of judicial review in Singapore administrative law. It is regarded as a form of illegality. An applicant may challenge a decision by an authority on the basis that it has either rigidly adhered to a policy it has formulated, or has wrongfully delegated the exercise of its statutory powers to another body. If the High Court finds that a decision-maker has fettered its discretion, it may hold the decision to be ultra vires – beyond the decision-maker's powers – and grant the applicant a suitable remedy such as a quashing order to invalidate the decision.|$|E
5|$|In Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the appellants {{had been}} {{detained}} without trial under section 8(1) of the Internal Security Act ("ISA") for alleged {{involvement in a}} Marxist conspiracy to subvert and destabilize the country. The detention orders were subsequently suspended under section 10 of the Act, but the suspensions were revoked following {{the release of a}} press statement by the appellants in which they denied being Marxist conspirators. Having applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for writs of habeas corpus to be issued, the appellants appealed against the ruling. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the narrow ground that the Government had not adduced sufficient evidence to discharge its burden of proving the President was satisfied that the appellants' detention was necessary to prevent them from endangering, among other things, Singapore's security or public order, which was required by section 8(1) of the ISA before the Minister for Home Affairs could make detention orders against them. However, in a lengthy obiter discussion, the Court held that an objective rather than a subjective test should apply to the exercise <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> by the authorities under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. In other words, the executive could not insist that the exercise of the discretion was unchallengeable. The exercise <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> could be reviewed by the court, and the executive had to satisfy the court that there were objective facts justifying its decision.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal held {{further that}} as the {{discretion}} conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, {{the issue of whether}} detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion. However, the Court referred to two United Kingdom decisions which stood for the principle that courts are not precluded from determining whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Therefore, the court could still determine whether the matters relied on by the executive in the exercise <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> were indeed within the scope of section 8.|$|E

40|$|Studies on the {{implications}} <b>of</b> managerial <b>discretion</b> have mainly {{focused on the}} firm, executive or industry level attributes. Little work has tackled the national-level aspect of this construct and its potential implication on firm strategies. We seek to theoretically establish an association between the construct <b>of</b> managerial <b>discretion</b> and firm strategic orientation from a ational-level. Our theoretical analysis strongly suggests that the degree <b>of</b> managerial <b>discretion</b> available to executives in each country could have a strong influence on companies’ competitive strategy. We contribute to the strategic management field and the discretion literature by uncovering new national-level implications...|$|R
5|$|On {{the facts}} of Lines International, the judge held that the policy {{satisfied}} all four conditions and that {{the adoption of the}} guidelines was valid. On the fourth consideration relating to fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion,</b> the judge found that the PSA and STPB had not rigidly enforced the guidelines as they had made it clear at the meeting attended by the plaintiff that they would consider representations from cruise operators, and, in fact, a number of such concessions were made. Hence, the guidelines had been flexibly applied and the PSA had not fettered its discretion by rigidly adhering to a policy. The Lines International conditions were approved by the Court of Appeal in JD Ltd. v. Comptroller of Income Tax (2005).|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} the {{exercises}} <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> by the President and the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA are reviewable by the courts because the subjective test that had been adopted in the 1969 Malaysian case Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister of Home Affairs), Malaysia, which had been adopted locally in 1971 in Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, {{could no longer be}} supported and should be replaced by an objective test. Furthermore, although a court would not question the executive's decision as to what national security required, the court could examine whether the executive's decision was indeed based on national security considerations.|$|E
5|$|The English {{common law}} {{position}} that a public body cannot fetter its discretion by abdicating its responsibility and powers to another was discussed and adopted in Lines International. The general rules that Justice Prakash enunciated {{in the case}} are that, first, a public body has the duty to exercise discretion by itself; it cannot abdicate this responsibility by taking orders from other bodies unless it is under a legal duty to do so. Therefore, a condition in its policy {{that appeared to be}} a direction by the PSA to itself to take orders from either the Gambling Suppression Branch ("GSB") of the Singapore Police Force or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels was a fetter on PSA's exercise <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> and was held to be invalid. However, the invalid condition alone did not mean that the PSA had in fact fettered its discretion. The High Court stated that while the PSA had agreed to take orders from the GSB and STPB {{on the basis of the}} invalid condition, whether it had in fact done so was another matter. On the evidence, the Court went on to find that the PSA had in fact made its own decision in the matter.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the difference between}} statutory and effective tax rates in the value added tax in China, and explores the role <b>of</b> administrative <b>discretion</b> in generating this difference. In China, unlike in Europe where the VAT originated, there can be significant differences between effective and statutory rates because of features of tax administration.

40|$|Legal {{expert systems}} use a {{knowledge}} base of legal rules to address legal issues. Such systems {{are said to}} be undesirable (a) because of the difficulty of replicating a multitextured process such as legal reasoning, and (b) because law in its highest and best forms is humanistic rather than mechanistic.
