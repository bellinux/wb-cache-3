25|$|On 28 August 2013, a Predator {{belonging}} to the 163d Reconnaissance Wing was flying at 18,000 to 20,000feet <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rim</b> Fire in California providing infrared video of lurking fires, after receiving emergency approvals. Rules limit the Predator behavior; it {{must be accompanied by}} a manned aircraft, and its camera must only be active above the fire.|$|E
25|$|On August 8, 1964, {{a pair of}} {{commercial}} pilots in a Cessna 150 flew low over the crater. After crossing the rim, they could not maintain level flight. The pilot attempted to circle in the crater to climb <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim.</b> During the attempted climb out, the aircraft stalled, crashed and caught fire. It is commonly reported that the plane ran out of fuel, but this is incorrect. Both occupants were severely injured but survived their ordeal. A {{small portion of the}} wreckage not removed from the crash site remains visible.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E
25|$|A {{steep and}} rough slope descends north east {{from the summit}} of Green Gable, {{dropping}} through Mitchell Cove to the flat-topped and rather damp col of Blackmoor Pols (1,995ft). Beyond this the ground rises again to the steep sided dome of Base Brown. On the south eastern face are crags overlooking Styhead Gill with Seathwaite Fell across the valley. The north western flanks are equally steep, but descending only half the vertical distance into the hanging valley of Gillercomb. This is the gathering ground of Sour Milk Gill, which drops over a series of falls around the northern extremity of Base Brown. Here it joins Styhead Gill and Grains Gill to form the nascent River Derwent. Across Gillercomb is the main ridge continuing north around Ennerdale, Brandreth being the initial fell. The top of Base Brown narrows considerably {{to the north of}} the summit, a prow-like ridge descending toward the falls of Sour Milk Gill. There is a prominent hanging stone here, startlingly poised <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the crags. Another feature is the Seathwaite Slabs, a set of slabs of rocks used for rock climbing practice by novices and conveniently located only minutes from Seathwaite.|$|E
500|$|Rincewind and Twoflower are {{eventually}} washed rimwards {{to the kingdom}} of Krull, which lies on the very rim of the disc, where they are taken prisoner. The astronomers and [...] "astrozoologists" [...] of Krull have for many years attempted to determine the sex of Great A'Tuin, and {{are on the verge}} of launching a space vehicle to carry a pair of [...] "cosmo" [...] on a new mission <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of the disc. [...] Unaware of this, Rincewind and Twoflower take the place of the two cosmonauts and 'escape' to the spacecraft, which they accidentally launch, catapulting them off the rim. [...] The prospect of losing the eighth spell in this fashion prompts the Octavo to act, causing A'Tuin to perform a barrel roll to recapture Rincewind, landing the pair near the centre of the disc. Watching the Octavo's restlessness, the Archchancellor reveals his intention to use the Rite of AshkEnte to ask Death about the Octavo and also about a large red star that has recently appeared in the sky. [...] Now knowing all he needs, Trymon throws Weatherwax from the Tower of Art and becomes Archchancellor in his place.|$|E
50|$|Some Dichondra {{species are}} {{cultivated}} as ornamental plants, with cultivar selections also available. Dichondra micrantha {{is used as}} a groundcover. Dichondra argentea is a light silver leaved accent plant. The Dichondra argentea 'Silver Falls' cultivar is often used for trailing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> of potted plants, and has lower water needs.|$|R
60|$|The place seemed deserted, for at {{that time}} of day no country people were at Millville; but on passing down the aisle the visitor {{approached}} a little office built {{at the rear of the}} store.

60|$|With the {{breaking}} of dawn his eyes unclosed. The valley lay drenched and bathed, a burnished oval of glittering green. The rain-washed walls glistened in the morning light. Waterfalls of many forms poured <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims.</b> One, a broad, lacy sheet, thin as smoke, slid <b>over</b> <b>the</b> western notch and struck a ledge in its downward fall, to bound into broader leap, to burst far below into white and gold and rosy mist.|$|R
2500|$|The Ceramic Type [...] "Ometepe Red Slipped-Incised" [...] {{is found}} on Ometepe Island. It is a Late Polychrome Period ceramic type, {{and it is}} usually found {{in the form of}} jar sherds. This type of ceramic is {{identifiable}} because it is scraped on both the inside and out, and smoothing and polishing is done on the exterior body and rim. The slip, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> and outside, is a dull red to brown, while only the inside of the neck is slipped. Lines are cut into the lip of the jar, and triangles are the most common motif, either interlocking or meeting tip to tip. Other ceramic types found on the island include: Granada Polychrome from the Middle Polychrome Period, Castillo Late Polychrome, and Luna Ware Polychrome (Healy, 1980).|$|E

6000|$|Pris was not behindhand in her efforts, but {{worked in}} a {{different}} way, and got up a branch society among her little pupils, called [...] "The Water Babies." [...] That captivated the mothers at once, and even the fathers {{found it difficult to}} enjoy their wine with blue eyes watching them wistfully <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> of silver mugs; while the few topers of the town hid themselves like night-birds flying from the sun, when, led by their gentle General, that little army of innocents marched through the streets with banners flying, blithe voices singing, rosy faces shining, and childish hearts full of the sweet delusion that they could save the world.|$|R

2500|$|The glaze, {{applied in}} several layers, [...] {{continues}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> at {{top and bottom}} of the pieces, in contrast to the rival porcelain Ding ware, fired upturned and so with a rough unglazed rim, often covered with a band of metal. [...] Instead Ru ware was kept off the kiln stack surface by being supported on three or five small spurs or prongs, presumably of metal, which left little unglazed oval spots called [...] "sesame seeds" [...] on the underside. [...] The colours vary, and have been classified by Chinese authorities as [...] "sky-blue", [...] "pale-blue" [...] and [...] "egg-blue", in each case using the Chinese word qing, which can cover both blue and green.|$|R
