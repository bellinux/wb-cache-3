500|$|Kubrick was {{notorious for}} {{demanding}} multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene. Nicole Kidman {{explains that the}} large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a [...] "deeper place". Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as [...] "irrational", although he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. Kubrick explained: [...] "Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try"... "When you make a movie, it takes a few days just {{to get used to the}} crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself". He also told biographer Michel Clement: [...] "It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera." ...|$|E
2500|$|To help {{illustrate}} the care {{that must be}} taken in teaching children and to emphasise the necessity of properly directing and managing their attentiveness, Maria Edgeworth drew several comparisons with non-European peoples. In her 1798 book Practical Education she maintained that unnecessarily causing fatigue should be a great concern of educators. In making the point that any mode of instruction that tired the attention was hurtful to children, her reasoning was that people can pay attention only to <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> and because children can appear resistant to repetition, teachers naturally should vary things. However, educators should always be mindful of the fact that, [...] "while variety relieves the mind, the objects which are varied must not all be entirely new, for novelty and variety when joined, fatigue the mind" [...] as Edgeworth states. The teaching of children needed to follow carefully considered methods, needed to evidence concern for appropriateness and proper sequencing, {{and needed to be}} guided by consideration from forms of teaching that would be empowering and enabling, not fatiguing or disabling. In Edgeworth's work, the attention of the child appears as a key site for pedagogical work and interventions.|$|E

2500|$|Winchester was {{respected}} by the others professionally, {{but at the}} same time, as a Boston blue blood, he was also snobbish, as when he stated in the scrub room, [...] "I do <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> I do it very well, and then I move on," [...] which drove much of his conflict with the other characters. Still, the show's writers occasionally allowed Winchester's humanity to shine through, such as in his dealings with a young concert pianist who had partially lost the use of his right hand, the protection of a stuttering soldier from the bullying of other soldiers (it is revealed later that Winchester's sister Honoria stutters), his keeping a vigil with Hawkeye when Hawkeye's father went into surgery back in the States ("Sons and Bowlers"), his willingness to be officer of the day for Hawkeye when Hawkeye was offered three days in Seoul, giving blood to a patient even though he already donated blood five days earlier, or his continuing a family tradition of anonymously giving Christmas treats to an orphanage. Winchester subjects himself to condemnation after realizing that [...] "it is sadly inappropriate to offer dessert to a child who has had no meal." [...] Isolating himself, he is saved by Klinger's own gift of understanding. Klinger scrapes together a Christmas dinner for Charles, with the provision that the source of the gift remain anonymous (Klinger had overheard Winchester's argument with the manager of the orphanage). For the final moment of the episode ("Death Takes a Holiday"), the two are simply friends as Charles says, [...] "Thank you, Max," [...] and Klinger replies, [...] "Merry Christmas, Charles." [...] As well, in the series finale [...] "Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen", Charles comes across a group of Chinese musicians who surrender to him. When Charles takes them back to the camp as prisoners of war and later listens to his record of Mozart's [...] Quintet in A major for Clarinet and Strings, K. 581, the musicians attempt to play the piece of music. Charles, ever the perfectionist, cannot stand to hear them play the piece incorrectly (and is impressed that they can even attempt to play the music after only hearing it once) and spends the next week conducting them on how to play the piece properly. During this time, Charles is forced to use the little patience that he rarely shows. When the Chinese musicians are taken off to a prisoner of war camp in a prisoner exchange to Charles' dismay and protest, their final goodbye to Charles is the Mozart piece played correctly. Later, one of the musicians returns to the camp mortally wounded on a Jeep. When Charles inquires as to where the other musicians are, it's revealed that the truck the musicians were on was ambushed and that there were no other survivors. In a combination of shock and disbelief, Charles returns to The Swamp to listen to the Mozart record, but removes the record and smashes it in anger. Later still on the final night that everyone at the M*A*S*H is together, Charles says that before the war, music was a stress reliever to him, but because of the Chinese musicians and their fate, music will forever be a reminder of the horrors of war.|$|E

3000|$|A {{beauty of}} MongoDB {{is that its}} {{documents}} are objects themselves, which performs this process even more easily, hence the MongoDB architecture lends itself very well to ORM as the documents. One example is mongo-Java-orm or “MJORM” a Java ORM for MongoDB [97, 118]. A plain old Java object (POJO) is an ordinary Java object, not bound by any special restriction or bogged down by framework extensions [119, 120]. One of the main advantages for using POJO is its decoupling from the infrastructure frameworks [119]. POJOs accelerate the development process by separating the persistent object properties and business logic; hence facilitating the programmers to concentrate on <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time; i.e, between the business logic and persistence storage. Other variants of POJO are described in [121 – 123], and the [...].Net framework variant of POJO is POCO [124].|$|R
40|$|Research {{literature}} in the dementia field lacks examples of ‘best-practices’ demonstrating concretely {{how it is possible}} to support the sense of coherence in people with dementia. The {{purpose of this study was}} to elucidate the nurses’ views concerning a caring approach that may support the sense of coherence in people with dementia. The data were collected through participant observation and focus group interviews during a four-month period in 2011. Sixteen registered nurses recruited from two Norwegian nursing homes participated in this study. The data were interpreted using a phenomenological-hermeneutical method. Three themes were identified: ‘being in the moment’, ‘doing <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time’, and ‘creating joy and contentment’. An overall interpretation of these themes is described by the metaphor ‘slow nursing’, a caring approach that may lead to supporting the sense of coherence in people with dementia...|$|R

Proudman used to say that his partnership with Doodson was so successful because he liked to do the algebra while Doodson preferred the arithmetic, an understatement of their work which nevertheless indicated their complementary interests. In addition to his work in developing the departments of applied mathematics and oceanography, Proudman took a full part in University administration and acted as Pro-Vice-Chancellor during the war years 1940-46. Quoting the maxim that [...] "the quickest way {{to get a lot of}} things done is to do <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time" [...] he was able to go straight to the heart of a problem, whether scientific or administrative, with an intuition which matched his intellectual ability.

40|$|This is {{the first}} of a series of reports from the {{research}} program Youth culture in Sweden, FUS. It contains five texts on methodological issues, three written by the members of the FUS central group that edits this series, and two by other researchers who participate in the network of the program. The first article, by the youth culture researcher and program initiator Johan Fornäs from Stockholm, discusses some theoretical, empirical, methodological and organizational aspects of interdisciplinary and comparative cultural studies, and argues for a polydimensional ”art of thinking more than <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time”. The sociologist Magdalena Czaplicka from Uppsala dives into the problems of designing and interpreting quantitative data, especially with respect to the dimension of time, while the media researcher Keith Roe from Göteborg treats the problem of validity in both quantitative and qualitative studies. Sabina Cwejman, a sociologist in Göteborg, sums up the qualitative tradition within social sciences. Ulf Boëthius, a literary researcher in Stockholm and like Cwejman and Fornäs member of the FUS central group, finally gives an overview over some general turning points and tendencies in the humanities during the last decades, from positivism in the 60 s, over marxism, structuralism and hermeneutics in the 70 s, up to the ambivalent postmodern and deconstructionist break with totalities in the 80 s...|$|R
