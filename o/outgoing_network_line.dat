40|$|Compromised {{computers}} {{have been a}} menace to both personal and business computing. In this paper, we tackle the problem of automated detection of break-ins of new unknown threats such as worms, spyware and adware on personal computers. We propose Break-IN DEtectoR (BINDER), a host-based break-in detection system. Our key observation is that many break-ins make extrusions, stealthy malicious <b>outgoing</b> <b>network</b> connections. BINDER exploits a unique characteristic of personal computers, that most network activities are directly or indirectly triggered by user input. Since threats tend to run as background precesses and thus do not receive any user input, the intuition behind BINDER is that only threats generate connections without user input. By correlating <b>outgoing</b> <b>network</b> connections and processing information with user activities, BINDER can capture extrusions and thus break-ins. ...|$|R
50|$|In computing, a {{firewall}} is {{a network}} security system that monitors and controls the incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>network</b> traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted, secure internal network and another outside network, {{such as the}} Internet, that is assumed not to be secure or trusted.|$|R
40|$|It is {{desirable}} to hold network attackers {{accountable for their}} actions in both criminal investigations and information warfare situations. Currently, attackers are able to hide their location effectively by creating a chain of connections {{through a series of}} hosts. This method is effective because current host audit systems do not maintain enough information to allow association of incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>network</b> connections. In this paper, we introduce an inexpensive method that allows both on-line and forensic matching of incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>network</b> traffic. Our method associates origin information with each process in the system process table, and enhances the audit information by logging the origin and destination of network sockets. We present implementation results and show that our method can effectively record origin information about the common cases of stepping stone connections and denial of service zombies, and describe the limitations of our approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{computer}} attacks {{has been growing}} dramatically as the Internet has grown. Attackers currently {{have little or no}} disincentive to conducting at-tacks because they are able to hide their location eectively by creating a chain of connections through a series of hosts. This method is eective because most current host audit systems do not maintain enough information to allow associa-tion of incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>network</b> connections. In this paper, we introduce an inexpensive method that allows both on-line and forensic matching of in-coming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>network</b> trac. Our method makes small modications to the operating system that associate origin information with each process in the system process table, and enhances the audit information by logging the origin and destination of network sockets. We present implementation results, show that our method can eectively record origin information about a variety of attacks, and describe the limitations of our approach. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present in}} this paper a network {{interface}} aggregation frame-work for IP tunneling. Our framework periodically measures the level of congestion on routes going through each network interface and based on these measurements, it decides how many flows to send on an <b>outgoing</b> <b>network</b> interface at a time.

The <b>outgoing</b> <b>network</b> packet traffic is distributed according to the current load (computed relative to the speed) on each network interface slave.

30|$|When the {{magnetometer}} controller {{is powered}} up, data collection begins upon receipt of the 1 PPS signal. This {{occurs when the}} GPS unit calculates a fix on the minimum required number of satellites. On a cold start, this can take about a minute with the particular Garmin GPS module used by NPM. Afterwards, packets of ten data points are transmitted to our data logging server every ten seconds over a pre-defined range of network ports. It is necessary that the magnetometer site’s firewall, if one is in use, be configured to allow <b>outgoing</b> <b>network</b> traffic over these ports.|$|R
40|$|A {{very useful}} {{technique}} a network administrator {{can use to}} identify problematic network behavior is careful analysis of logs of incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>network</b> flows. The challenge one faces when attempting to undertake this course of action, though, is that large networks tend to generate an extremely large quantity of network traffic {{in a very short}} period of time, resulting in very large traffic logs which must be analyzed post-generation with an eye for contextual information which may reveal symptoms of problematic traffic. A better technique is to perform real-time log analysis using a real-time context-generating tool such as LoGS...|$|R

30|$|Assign {{and process}} {{sections}} The first pass labels network and elevation data with the section they belong to. The details {{are described in}} Algorithm 2. The data is processed by two mappers. The first mapper reads <b>network</b> <b>lines</b> data network_i as text and calculates the section id based on the coordinates of the <b>network</b> <b>lines.</b> The key value pairs emitted from the mapper are <sectionID_j,networkline_l >. The second mapper similarly reads elevation data elevation_j and calculates the section id and emits key-value pairs <sectionID_j,elevation_i >. The reducer reads the data and aggregates all elevation and <b>network</b> <b>line</b> observations for the section id and applies the flight plans builder algorithm for the section. It first builds a spatial index for all the elevation points for the subregion based on the network and elevation data in memory. It then identifies subregions as quadcopter and conventional subregions based on the elevation and autonomy constraints, shrinking, expanding and merging subregions as needed. The final key-value pairs emitted in the reducer consist {{of the details of}} each subregion within a section, namely the subregion id subregion_j, the subregion extent xsr_j,ysr_j,xer_j,yer_j which represents the diagonal coordinates of the subregion starting from bottom left edge xsr_j,ysr_j to top right edge xer_j,yer_j. It also includes a flag indicating if it is a quadcopter or conventional drone subregion, the <b>network</b> <b>lines</b> and elevation points and waypoints waypoint_k,...,waypoint_l for a quadcopter or conventional drone to follow along the <b>network</b> <b>lines</b> in the subregion. If there are no <b>network</b> <b>lines</b> in the subsection emitted by mapper the reducer simply exits.|$|R

50|$|Firewalls impose {{restrictions}} on incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>Network</b> packets {{to and from}} private <b>networks.</b> Incoming or <b>outgoing</b> traffic must pass through the firewall; only authorized traffic is allowed to pass through it. Firewalls create checkpoints between an internal private network and the public Internet, also known as choke points (borrowed from the identical military term of a combat limiting geographical feature). Firewalls can create choke points based on IP source and TCP port number. They can also serve as the platform for IPsec. Using tunnel mode capability, firewall {{can be used to}} implement VPNs. Firewalls can also limit network exposure by hiding the internal network system and information from the public Internet.|$|R
