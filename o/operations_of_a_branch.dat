30|$|The {{computation}} of Z(e′,f′) {{can be done}} as follows. The operations whose SRT exceeds f′ are firstly {{eliminated from}} all set of concrete services at the depth e′. If this leads to an empty set or {{if there is not}} an operation with SRT equal to f′ then we return Z(e′,f′)[*]=[*]+∞.

The sum of these minimal ECs is returned in Z(e′,f′). Naturally, at each point (e,f), we have two cases: either an assignment is possible and then we keep the one leading to the minimization of d(e,f) at depth f, or there is not a possible assignment (we only have infinite values when running Z). Then, there will not be any assignment associated with this point.|$|R

40|$|Chloroplasts are {{cytoplasmic organelles}} whose primary {{function}} is photosynthesis, {{but which also}} contain small, specialized and quasi-autonomous genetic systems. In photosynthesis, two energy converting photosystems are connected, electrochemically, in series. The connecting electron carriers are oxidized by photosystem I (PS I) and reduced by photosystem II (PS II). It has recently been shown that the oxidation reduction state of one connecting electron carrier, plastoquinone, controls transcription of chloroplast genes for reaction centre proteins of the two photosystems. The control counteracts the imbalance in electron transport that causes it: oxidized plastoquinone induces PS II and represses PS I; reduced plastoquinone induces PS I and represses PS II. This complementarity is observed both in vivo, using light favouring one or other photosystem, and in vitro, when site-specific electron transport inhibitors are added to transcriptionally and photosynthetically active chloroplasts. There is thus <b>a</b> transcriptional level <b>of</b> control that has a regulatory function {{similar to that of}} purely post-translational 'state transitions' in which the redistribution of absorbed excitation energy between photosystems is mediated by thylakoid membrane protein phosphorylation. The changes in rates of transcription that are induced by spectral changes in vivo can be detected even before the corresponding state transitions are complete, suggesting the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branched</b> pathway <b>of</b> redox signal transduction. These findings suggest a mechanism for adjustment of photosystem stoichiometry in which initial events involve <b>a</b> sensor <b>of</b> the redox state of plastoquinone, and may thus be the same as the initial events of state transitions. Redox control of chloroplast transcription is also consistent with the proposal that a direct regulatory coupling between electron transport and gene expression determines the function and composition of the chloroplast's extra-nuclear genetic system...|$|R
40|$|I. Current {{international}} {{standards for the}} statistical treatment of the issue In many cases, a business will set up a separate legal entity in order to undertake operations in an economy outside its home economy. However, where a separate entity is not created in the outside economy, but the operations are substantial, a notional institutional unit resident in that economy may be identified for statistical purposes. In this paper, such a unit is called a “branch. ” 1 Although <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> is not <b>a</b> legal entity, it behaves in many ways as if it were, and treating it as a unit can allow statistics to give <b>a</b> better portrayal <b>of</b> the economic reality, see 1993 SNA paras. 4. 49 - 52. (An issues paper for DITEG deals with the valuation of branches, so this paper is only concerned with the units and residence issues.) The BPM 5 criteria for identifying the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unincorporated <b>branch</b> as <b>a</b> separate institutional unit are that the branch: • engage in significant production of goods and services; • plan to operate the business indefinitely or <b>a</b> long period <b>of</b> time; • have a substantial physical presence; • maintain a complete and separate set of accounts of local activities (i. e., incom...|$|R

There were also livestock pens for cattle. Incoming traffic was largely domestic coal; outgoing traffic was mainly agricultural.Initially four main line trains called at Mellis per day (four up towards Ipswich and four down towards Norwich), but by 1863 this had increased to five.

40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes an idea {{to reduce}} <b>branch</b> penalty in <b>a</b> pipelined {{architecture}} by making novel use of two instruction pre-fetch queues, primary and auxiliary. When there is no branch instruction, both the queues together act as a single queue, referred to as <b>an</b> alternate mode <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> Whenever <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> instruction {{is present in the}} current instruction mix, there is a switch over to the branch mode <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> in which the primary queue fetches from the address returned by the predictor while the auxiliary queue fetches from the other path until the branch address is resolved. Hence the next instruction (irrespective of whether the branch is taken or not) is always available. The idea has been implemented using simplescalar toolset 3. 0 and tested on SPECINT 2000 benchmarks, and a 25 - 55 % improvement in IPC has been observed. <b>A</b> comparison <b>of</b> our idea with other architectures with two instruction fetch queues is also presented.

40|$|This project {{attempts}} {{to contribute to}} the field of education, by presenting and analysing change and its management and how change has affected the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign University <b>branch.</b> It describes <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> recommendations that will aid the case organization (University of Indianapolis Athens - UIA) and consequently educational organizations / institutions, in listing the various challenges affecting education and their operations in the 21 st century. It is argued that identifying these changes / challenges is a requirement towards planning and managing them for any organization. The project goes beyond identification of changes, examining how these affect a specific organization. One of the objectives of this research is to consider the level of resistance and to identify ways to cope with change at educational organizations. In essence, the project deals with identifying the various triggers of change and {{attempts to}} examine how educational organizations can successfully cope with changes affecting them. In doing so, it examines a specific educational institution in Greece, UIA, and its state of readiness in coping and implementing change. Despite the importance of the topic, the existing literature contains little empirical evidence in relation to academic institutions such as Universities, Colleges or any form of educational establishment in Greece. Through a qualitative research activity using <b>a</b> sample <b>of</b> UIA staff and academics, it was suggested {{that there is a need}} for the University to ensure that it takes into consideration the various challenges affecting the Greek educational industry. The findings suggest that the recognition issue expected in 2007 – 2008 in Greece will transform the educational scene in Greek private education and this change will trigger new changes that will most probably be coping with increased enrolment, increased competition due to the low entry barriers, a more business – like stance towards the education industry and the students and a increased reliance on up to date technology in many of the University’s departments and operations. The findings also suggest that the University will need to plan and manage the changes anticipated through appropriate leadership and adequate communication and participation to avoid conflict and resistance.
