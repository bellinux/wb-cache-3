Some of these factors are defined by airline managers and others are not controllable by airlines, they depend on external environment factors.

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{was developed to}} determine the <b>operational</b> stability <b>margin</b> of a laboratory scale combustor. Applying modern and robust techniques and tools from Dynamical System Theory, the approach was based on three basic steps. In the first step, a gray-box thermoacoustical model for the combustor was derived. The second step consisted in applying System Identification techniques to experimental data in order to validate the model and estimate its parameters. The application of these techniques to experimental data under different operating conditions allowed us to determine the functional dependence of the model parameters upon changes in an experimental control parameter. Finally, the third step consisted in using that functional dependence to predict {{the response of the}} system at different operating conditions and, ultimately, estimate its <b>operational</b> stability <b>margin.</b> The results indicated that a low-order stochastic non-linear model, including two excited modes, has been identified and the combustor <b>operational</b> stability <b>margin</b> could be estimated by applying a continuation method.

In order to continue to benefit from scaling, three dimensions can be explored: increasing <b>operational</b> <b>margins,</b> testing, and the resilience of applications. The solutions in each dimension bring out different trade-offs in yield, failure rate, test cost, and performance. We use a ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) {{as a case study}} to better understand these trade-offs. We develop two new delay tests for TCAMs, and a new method to estimate yield, failure rate, test cost, and performance of TCAM under process variations when various tests are used.

Planar fuel injection along the center plane of the leading face of a slender square cylinder against the approach cross-flow results in a stratified flame configuration stabilized alongside the wake formation region in the second setup.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of optimisation based Validation and Verification (V&V) analysis on aerospace vehicles {{in order to determine}} their worst case performance metrics. To this end, three aerospace models relating to satellite and launcher vehicles provided by European Space Agency (ESA) on various projects are utilised. As a means to quicken the process of optimisation based V&V analysis, surrogate models are developed using polynomial chaos method. Surro- gate models provide a quick way to ascertain the worst case directions as computation time required for evaluating them is very small. A sin- gle evaluation of a surrogate model takes less than a second. Another contribution of this thesis is the evaluation of <b>operational</b> safety <b>margin</b> metric with the help of surrogate models. <b>Operational</b> safety <b>margin</b> is a metric defined in the uncertain parameter space and is related to the distance between the nominal parameter value and the first instance of performance criteria violation. This metric can help to gauge the robustness of the controller but requires the evaluation of the model in the constraint function and hence could be computationally intensive. As surrogate models are computationally very cheap, they are utilised to rapidly compute the <b>operational</b> safety <b>margin</b> metric. But this metric focuses only on finding a safe region around the nominal parameter value and the possibility of other disjoint safe regions are not explored. In order to find other safe or failure regions in the param- eter space, the method of Bernstein expansion method is utilised on surrogate polynomial models to help characterise the uncertain param- eter space into safe and failure regions. Furthermore, Binomial failure analysis is used to assign failure probabilities to failure regions which might help the designer to determine if a re-design of the controller is required or not. The methodologies of optimisation based V&V, surrogate modelling, <b>operational</b> safety <b>margin,</b> Bernstein expansion method and risk assessment have been combined together to form the WCAT-II MATLAB toolbox...|$|R
