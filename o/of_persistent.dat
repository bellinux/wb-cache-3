5|$|Another family <b>of</b> <b>persistent</b> carbenes {{are based}} on the 1,2,4-triazole ring, with the {{unfilled}} orbitals in carbon 5 of this ring. The triazol-5-ylidenes pictured below were first prepared by Enders and co-workers by vacuum pyrolysis through loss of methanol from 2-methoxytriazoles. Only a limited range of these molecules have been reported, with the triphenyl substituted molecule being commercially available.|$|E

5|$|The first stable carbenes to be {{isolated}} were based on an imidazole ring, with the hydrogen in carbon 2 of the ring (between the two nitrogen atoms) removed, and other hydrogens replaced by various groups. These imidazol-2-ylidenes are still the most stable and the most well studied and understood family <b>of</b> <b>persistent</b> carbenes.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally carbenes {{are viewed}} as so {{reactive}} that were only studied indirectly, e.g. by trapping reactions. This situation has changed dramatically with the emergence <b>of</b> <b>persistent</b> carbenes. Although they are fairly reactive substances, i.e., undergoing dimerization, many can be isolated as pure substances.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 21, moving across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little development. On October 1 it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, and continuing westward it developed an area <b>of</b> <b>persistent</b> convection on October 5. Initially the system was disorganized, although gradual development was expected as conditions in the upper-levels of the atmosphere were expected to become more favorable. On October 7 it developed a broad low pressure area, and by the next day it was located in the eastern portion of a large area of disturbed weather; the western portion of the system later developed into Tropical Storm Olivia. The eastern system developed organized convection near its center, and developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E at 0000UTC on October 9, about 765mi (1235km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Eruptions from Mount Cleveland are {{generally}} vulcanian and strombolian in nature, characterized by short explosive ash clouds sometimes accompanied by a'a flows, lava fountains, pyroclastic flows, ash and steam emissions, lava dome growth, and the ejection of breadcrust bombs. Hot springs were reportedly {{found on the}} volcano in the 1800s, and persistent fumarolic activity was observed in the 1980s and 1990s. Mount Cleveland is a site <b>of</b> <b>persistent</b> steam emissions and thermal anomalies that represent constant background activity. During 2011, a summit lava dome formed, by continuous intrusion of magma at the summit. Late in 2011, nearly 6 explosions demolished the dome. In June 2012, another small dome was observed.|$|E
5|$|Iginla has {{recorded}} several Gordie Howe hat tricks – a fight, a goal and an {{assist in the}} same game – and as {{it is not an}} official statistic, The Hockey News estimated that as of 2012, he was the active leader with nine.

Iginla has suffered injuries {{as a result of his}} fighting, including a broken hand from a 2003 fight with Bill Guerin of the Dallas Stars.

5|$|Pelé {{scored the}} first goal from a free kick against Bulgaria, {{becoming}} {{the first player to}} score in three successive FIFA World Cups, but due to his injury, a result <b>of</b> <b>persistent</b> fouling by the Bulgarians, he missed the second game against Hungary. Brazil lost that game and Pelé, although still recovering, was brought back for the last crucial match against Portugal at Goodison Park in Liverpool by the Brazilian coach Vicente Feola. Feola changed the entire defense, including the goalkeeper, while in midfield he returned to the formation of the first match. During the game, Portugal defender João Morais fouled Pelé, but was not sent off by referee George McCabe. Pelé had to stay on the field limping {{for the rest of the}} game, since substitutes were not allowed at that time. After this game he vowed he would never again play in the World Cup, a decision he would later change.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Typhoon Krovanh {{can be traced}} back to an area <b>of</b> <b>persistent</b> {{convection}} well east of Chuuk State on August13. Over the course of the day the disturbance gradually consolidated within favorable atmospheric conditions, and at 1800UTC that day the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) assessed the system to have organized sufficiently to be classified as a tropical depression. Shower activity was suppressed by a nearby upper-level low for much of the storm's early existence; however, at 0600UTC on August15, the system was classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) as a tropical depression. The depression tracked northwestward under the influence of a nearby ridge. Strengthening and development of the tropical cyclone was very minimal over the next few days, and on August18, both tracking agencies discontinued monitoring the system due to the lack of an identifiable low-level circulation center.|$|E

In {{order to address}} the temperature dependence of the relevant spin relaxation mechanisms we derive and solve a semiclassical spin diffusion equation {{taking into account the}} effects of spin-dependent impurity scattering, cubic Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interactions. For the experimentally relevant regime we find that the lifetime <b>of</b> the <b>persistent</b> spin helix is mainly determined by the interplay of cubic Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction and electron-electron interactions. We propose that even longer lifetimes can be achieved by generating a spatially damped spin profile instead <b>of</b> the <b>persistent</b> spin helix state...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of development <b>of</b> a <b>persistent</b> ovarian follicle and associated elevation in 17 β-estradiol on: (1) fertility at the subsequent estrus if artificial insemination or embryo transfer was performed; and (2) recruitment of additional follicles during superstimulation of follicular development with FSH. ^ The objective of first experiment {{was to determine if}} development <b>of</b> a <b>persistent</b> ovarian follicle and associated increase in 17 β-estradiol during estrous synchronization decreases conception rates after artificial insemination. Development <b>of</b> a <b>persistent</b> ovarian follicle resulted in elevated circulation concentrations of 17 β-estradiol for 6 - 10 days compared to 1 - 2 days preceding behavioral estrus which is typically observed. Interval from simulated luteal regression until observation of estrus was decreased by development <b>of</b> a <b>persistent</b> ovarian follicle. Pregnancy rate was decreased when a persistent follicle is ovulated and cows were inseminated. In addition, pregnancy rate was negatively correlated (r = - 0. 39) to circulating concentrations of 17 β-estradiol preceding estrus. ^ The objective of the second experiment was to determine if elevated 17 β-estradiol preceding ovulation associated with a persistent ovarian follicle alters pregnancy rates after transfer of an embryo on day 7 of the estrous cycle. Development <b>of</b> a <b>persistent</b> follicle during estrous synchronization resulted in elevated 17 β-estradiol preceding ovulation similar to experiment 1. However, elevated 17 β-estradiol did not alter pregnancy rate when an embryo was transferred on day 7 of the estrous cycle. ^ The objective of the third experiment was to determine if development <b>of</b> a <b>persistent</b> ovarian follicle suppresses recruitment of additional follicles during FSH treatment. Development <b>of</b> a <b>persistent</b> ovarian follicle for 5 days but not 2 or 8 days preceding initiation of FSH stimulation was able to suppress recruitment of subordinate follicles and reduce the number of corpora lutea, total ova and transferable embryos observed on day 7 after estrus. ^ Results from these studies indicate that pregnancy rates could be improved if estrous synchronization programs more precisely controlled timing of behavioral estrus and follicular development. ...|$|R
