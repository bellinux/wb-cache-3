By combining experimental results and density functional theory calculations we studied the self-assembling <b>of</b> ordered <b>molecular</b> chains <b>of</b> Fe–phthalocyanines on Au(110). This molecular architecture results from a surface selftemplating effect, yielding a molecular-induced reconstruction of the Au surface and the rehybridization <b>of</b> the <b>molecular</b> electronic states localized on the metallic center.

This indicates that in the wax deposits not all high molecular weight paraffin hydrocarbons are concentrated.

30|$|Most possibly, the {{presence}} <b>of</b> low <b>molecular</b> n-alkanes in the asphaltenes {{is caused by}} their being trapped by porous structure of asphaltenes, while {{the presence}} <b>of</b> high <b>molecular</b> weight homologs in asphaltenes is a result from coprecipitating when the standard procedure of deasphalting by low molecular weight n-alkanes is used. The decrease in the share <b>of</b> low <b>molecular</b> weight n-alkanes in asphaltenes {{with the increase of}} the age of oil reservoir may result from: (1) decrease in the share <b>of</b> low <b>molecular</b> weight n-alkanes in greater depth crude oils and/or (2) compression of asphaltene aggregates: when the occurrence depth of oil reservoirs increases, the asphaltene aggregates in oil become denser and their ability to occlude low molecular weight oil hydrocarbons reduces. The increase in the share <b>of</b> high <b>molecular</b> weight n-alkanes in asphaltene with increasing age of oil reservoir is explained by the increase in their share in the oils, from which asphaltenes are precipitated (Ganeeva et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Zeolite and zeolite-like {{molecular}} sieves {{are being used}} in {{a large number of}} applications such as adsorption and catalysis. Achievement of the long-standing goal of creating a chiral, polycrystalline molecular sieve with bulk enantioenrichment would enable these materials to perform enantioselective functions.

Enantiopure organic structure directing agents are designed with the assistance of computational methods and used to synthesize enantioenriched, polycrystalline <b>molecular</b> sieve samples <b>of</b> either enantiomer. Computational results correctly predicted which enantiomer is obtained, and enantiomeric enrichment is proven by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.

The enantioenriched {{molecular sieves}} show enantioselectivity for the ring opening reaction of epoxides and enantioselective adsorption of 2 -butanol (the R enantiomer <b>of</b> the <b>molecular</b> sieve shows opposite and approximately equal enantioselectivity compared with the S enantiomer <b>of</b> the <b>molecular</b> sieve, whereas the racemic sample <b>of</b> the <b>molecular</b> sieve shows no enantioselectivity) ...|$|R
