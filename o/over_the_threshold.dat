25|$|In the November 2000 election, the NDP campaigned {{primarily}} {{on the issue of}} Medicare but lost significant support. The governing Liberals ran an effective campaign on their economic record and managed to recapture some of the Atlantic ridings lost to the NDP in the 1997 election. The initial high electoral prospects of the Canadian Alliance under new leader Stockwell Day also hurt the NDP as many supporters strategically voted Liberal to keep the Alliance from winning. The NDP finished with 13 MPs—just barely <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> for official party status.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union, {{after long}} {{peering through the}} keyhole of a closed door on what it {{considered}} a Western sphere of influence, now found itself invited <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> {{as a friend of}} the Arabs. Shortly after it reopened, the canal was traversed by the first Soviet warships since World War I. The Soviets' burgeoning influence in the Middle East, although it was not to last, included acquiring Mediterranean bases, introducing multipurpose projects, supporting the budding Palestinian liberation movement and penetrating the Arab countries. Nasser claimed to be the defender of the Palestinian cause, but his anti-Israel warlike rhetoric damaged the Palestinians since it convinced a lot of the Israelis to oppose reconciliation with the Palestinians.|$|E

In December of the same year, the {{prominent}} deputy Fernand Rau defected from the Christian Social People's Party after the CSV broke its pledge to make him European Commissioner, increasing the ADR's representation back up to four. At the 10 October 1993 local elections, the ADR won 7 seats in communal councils. At the 1994 general election, the ADR got 9.0% of the vote and 5 seats, putting the ADR <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> required to qualify as a caucus, but the ADR fell to fifth place, behind the resurgent Greens.|$|E

[...] Rob Anderson and former cabinet minister Heather Forsyth announced that they had joined the Wildrose Alliance after growing frustrated with Ed Stelmach's leadership, accusing the Conservative government of being undemocratic. The defections moved the Wildrose Party past the New Democrats to become the third largest party in the Legislature, [...] Guy Boutilier joined the Wildrose Alliance on June 24, 2010. [...] The fourth Wildrose MLA, Boutilier took the party <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> for recognition as an official party in the Assembly.

500|$|In each panel, Dyer {{is framed}} by a doorway, and set against a flat, {{anonymous}} foreground coloured with black and brown hues. In the left frame, he is seated on a toilet with his head crouched between his knees as if in pain. Although his arched back, thighs and legs are according to the Irish critic Colm Tóibín, [...] "lovingly painted", Dyer is by now clearly a broken man. The central panel shows Dyer sitting on the toilet bowl in a more contemplative pose, his head and upper body writhing beneath a hanging lightbulb which throws a large bat-like shadow formed {{in the shape of}} a demon or Eumenide. The art critic Sally Yard has noted that in the portrayal of Dyer's flesh, [...] "life seems to visibly drain... into the substantial character of the shadow beneath him". Dyer's posture suggests he is seated on a lavatory bowl, though the object is not described. Schmied has proposed that in this frame the blackness of the background has enveloped the subject, and it [...] "seems to be advancing forward <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold,</b> threatening the viewer like a flood or a giant bat with flapping wings and extended claws." ...|$|E

50|$|During the {{sentencing}} hearing, the District Court heard testimony {{from some of}} Mitchell's codefendants, {{that the amount of}} Mitchell's alleged drug sales put her <b>over</b> <b>the</b> five-kilogram <b>threshold.</b> Although Mitchell did not testify in defense of the government's changes regarding the quantity of the drug, her counsel argued that the quantity of cocaine attributable to her for sentencing purposes was less than <b>the</b> <b>threshold.</b> <b>The</b> District Court ruled {{that as a result of}} her guilty plea, Mitchell had forfeited the right to remain silent about the crime's details. The District Court accepted the testimony of her co-defendants' that put her <b>over</b> <b>the</b> five-kilogram <b>threshold</b> and that therefore the 10-year minimum sentence was mandated. It also noted that her failure to testify contributed to the court's decision to accept the co-defendants' testimony. The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision.|$|R

2500|$|Leading {{up to the}} election, polls {{indicated}} a range of possible outcomes on election day; some suggested Labour could form a coalition government, while others predicted National in control. Of the [...] "minor" [...] parties, only the Green Party consistently polled over the five-percent threshold, and United Future and the Progressive Party frequently failed to register a mention. Both ACT's and the Māori Party's popularity since 2005 remained steady at around two percent, while New Zealand First failed to poll <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> after December 2006. The polls gave varied results for preferred Prime Minister, with some giving Clark a slight lead, and others giving Key a sturdy margin.|$|E
5000|$|Substantial {{changes were}} made to the luxury tax regime. The dollar-for-dollar tax {{provisions}} of the previous CBA remained in effect through the 2012-13 season. Starting in 2013-14, the tax changed to an incremental system. Tax is now assessed at different levels based on the amount that a team is <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tax <b>threshold,</b> which remains at a level above the actual cap. The scheme is not cumulative—each level of tax applies only to amounts over that level's threshold. For example, a team that is $8 million <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tax <b>threshold</b> pays $1.50 for each of its first $5 million <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tax <b>threshold,</b> and $1.75 per dollar for the remaining $3 million. In addition, [...] "repeat offenders", subject to additional tax penalties, are defined as teams that paid tax in four of the five previous seasons. As in the previous CBA, the tax revenue is divided among teams with lower payrolls. However, under the new scheme, no more than 50% of the total tax revenue can go exclusively to teams that did not go <b>over</b> <b>the</b> cap; the use of the remaining 50% was not specified in the new agreement.|$|R

40|$|In cloud {{computing}}, {{users can}} rent computing resources from service providers {{according to their}} demand. Spot instances are unreliable resources provided by cloud computing services at low monetary cost. When users perform tasks on spot instances, there is an inevitable risk of failures that causes the delay of task execution time, resulting in a serious deterioration of quality of service (QoS). To {{deal with the problem}} on spot instances, we propose an estimated interval-based checkpointing (EIC) using weighted moving average. Our scheme sets <b>the</b> <b>thresholds</b> of price and execution time based on history. Whenever the actual price and the execution time cross <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>thresholds,</b> <b>the</b> system saves the state of spot instances. The Bollinger Bands is adopted to inform the ranges of estimated cost and execution time for user's discretion. The simulation results reveal that, compared to the HBC and REC, the EIC reduces the number of checkpoints and the rollback time. Consequently, the task execution time is decreased with EIC by HBC and REC. The EIC also provides the benefit of the cost reduction by HBC and REC, on average. We also found that the actual cost and execution time fall within the estimated ranges suggested by the Bollinger Bands...|$|R

50|$|Noise gates often {{implement}} hysteresis, that is, {{they have}} two thresholds: one to open the gate and another, set a few dB below, to close the gate.
