50|$|An oospore is a {{thick-walled}} sexual spore {{that develops}} from a fertilized <b>oosphere</b> in some algae, fungi, and Oomycetes.|$|E
50|$|In {{a common}} mode of {{fertilization}} found in certain species of Thallophytes, the antheridia will bind with the oogonia. The antheridia will then form fertilization tubes connecting the antheridial cytoplasm with each <b>oosphere</b> within the oogonia. A haploid nucleus (gamete) from the antheridium {{will then be}} transferred through the fertilization tube into the <b>oosphere,</b> and fuse with the oosphere’s haploid nucleus forming a diploid oospore. The oospore is then ready to germinate and develop into an adult diploid somatic stage.|$|E
5000|$|In algae, the {{egg cell}} {{is often called}} <b>oosphere.</b> Drosophila oocytes develop in {{individual}} egg chambers that are supported by nurse cells and surrounded by somatic follicle cells. The nurse cells are large polyploid cells that synthesize and transfer RNA, proteins and organelles to the oocytes. This transfer {{is followed by the}} programmed cell death (apoptosis) of the nurse cells. During the course of oogenesis, 15 nurse cells die for every oocyte that is produced. [...] In addition to this developmentally regulated cell death, egg cells may also undergo apoptosis in response to starvation and other insults.|$|E
50|$|The {{gametophyte}} is protandric (a hermaphrodite, first antheridia {{are developed}} that give antherozoids, {{and then the}} archegonia that gives the <b>oospheres).</b> The number of x chromosomes = 65.|$|R
50|$|The oogonia {{of certain}} Thallophyte species are usually round or ovoid, with {{contents}} {{are divided into}} several uninucleate <b>oospheres.</b> This {{is in contrast to}} the male antheridia which are elongate and contain several nuclei.|$|R
50|$|The conceptacles of C. baccata are {{specialised}} reproductive cavities {{and form}} in the receptacles which are fertile from June until the autumn. Inside the conceptacles are antheridial hairs on which the antheridia or male gametes develop. About forty <b>oospheres</b> or female gametes also develop in each conceptacle. The antheridia are liberated first through a pore called the ostiole and accumulate around it in an orange mound. The ripe <b>oospheres</b> are then liberated and are fertilised externally. They become more rounded and sink to the sea floor where segmentation starts within a few hours. Four primary rhizoids develop from each and the lateral branches soon begin to grow.|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of gametangia {{was examined}} in 43 pairs of isolates (mating types A 1 ¬A 2; 11 A 1 and 24 A 2 isolates; five isozyme}electrophoretic types) of Phytophthora cinnamomi. An amphigynous antheridium always formed with each oogonium. However, in 41 of the crosses a proportion (39 had 0 ± 2 – 10 % and two had " 30 %) of oogonia also consistently had single or multiple paragynous antheridia. Single or multiple paragynous antheridia formed concurrently with amphigynous ones {{during the period}} of gametangial production in paired colonies. Where there were multiple paragynous antheridia associated with an oogonium, sometimes additional antheridia formed after fertilization or even after oospores were visible. Developmental studies showed that when meiosis in amphigynous and paragynous antheridia was simultaneous, fertilization tubes developed synchronously from both. However, cytological examination indicated that either a nucleus from an amphigynous or a paragynous antheridium fertilized the <b>oosphere.</b> Observations of paragynous and amphigynous, and amphigynous-only associations suggested that fertilization from either type of antheridium only occurred when meiosis in the oogonium was nearly synchronous with that of the antheridium. Asynchronous meiosis between oogonia and antheridia may contribute to failed fertilization and aborted oospore development. This appears to be the first description of paragynous antheridia in P. cinnamomi and the second observation of oogonia with both paragynous and amphigynous antheridia in a heterothallic Phytophthora species. Moreover, the development of both paragynous and amphigynous antheridia with an oogonium is rare in Phytophthora, as is the development of multiple antheridia. Antheridial variation is a characteristic {{to be taken into account}} in isolate identification. Nuclei from paragynous antheridia appear able to fertiliz...|$|E
40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi is an {{introduced}} soilborne phytopathogen to Western Australia (WA) and {{impacts on}} 2000 {{of the approximately}} 9000 plant species indigenous in the southwest of WA. Amongst these is Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah), the dominant and economically important hardwood timber species of the jarrah forest. This thesis aimed to investigate the morphological, pathogenic and genotypic variation in two local WA populations of P. cinnamomi isolates. The populations were selected from areas where jarrah clonal lines selected for resistance to P. cinnamomi {{may be used in}} the rehabilitation of infested jarrah forest and rehabilitated bauxite minesites in the southwest of WA. Resistance against a range of isolates using different inoculation methods. Seventy-three isolates of P. cinnamomi were collected from diseased jarrah and Corymbia calophylla (marri) trees from two populations located 70 km apart and these were examined for phenotypic and genotypic variation. Microsatellite DNA analysis showed that all isolates were of the same clonal lineage. In P. cinnamomi for the first time I show that there is a broad and continuous variation in the morphology and pathology between two populations of one clonal lineage, and that all phenotypes varied independently from one another. No relationship was found between morphological and pathogenic characters. The ability of isolates in both populations to cause deaths ranged from killing all plants within 59 days to plants being symptomless 182 days after inoculation. Single and multiple paragynous antheridia formed along with amphigynous ones in mating studies with all WA isolates and a sample of worldwide isolates. Developmental studies and cytological examination showed fertilisation tubes developed asynchronously or synchronously from both antheridial types and indicated that either antheridial type contributed a nucleus for fertilisation of the <b>oosphere.</b> This is the first report of paragynous antheridial associations in P. cinnamomi. Antheridial variation is a characteristic that needs to be adjusted in the taxonomic Phytophthora identification keys. In underbark and zoospore stem inoculations of three 1. 5 -year-old jarrah clonal lines (two ranked as resistant (RR) and one as susceptible (SS) to P. cinnamomi in the original selection trials) at 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, {{it was found that the}} method of inoculation did not produce comparable results, particularly at 25 and 30 degrees C. At these temperatures, all three clonal lines had 100...|$|E
40|$|In the {{previous}} paper the author reported some interesting {{characters of the}} sexual organs in Sargassum filicinum. Notwithstanding the strong resemblance between S. horneri and S. filicinum in the external shape excepting {{the difference in the}} vesicular shape remarked by W. H. Harvey, they are distinguishable in sexuality : the former is strictly dioecious while the latter monoecious and androgynous in the receptacle. In April 1955, he happened to obtain another alga with the ellipsoidal or somewhat ovato-fusiform vesicles. It may not be identified with a typical form of S. filicinum and also not undoubtedly with S. horneri. In this paper the author intends to report the results of observations on this alga especially on the sexual organs and the embryo-development, and also to try some comparison with those of S. horneri and S. filicinum. The material were collected with some bottom gill-nets, chiefly at Hutae, Amakusa Islands, Higo Province. The results are summarized as follows : 1) The alga in question bears strong resemblance to both S. horneri and S. filicinum in having the disco-fibrous root, the fine spinous processes on stem, the cylindrical receptacles, and the alternato-pinnatisected leaves, but is different by having the ellipsoidal vesicles (Fig. 1). 2) The alga seems to mature about in April to May in Amakusa Islands, so is it in S. horneri, but comparing with the latter the former may be later slightly. 3) The receptacles are androgynous; besides male and female conceptacles the same receptacle harbours hermaphrodite ones (Fig. 2), but the number of hermaphrodite conceptacles is indeed less than the others in each receptacle. The male conceptacles are not more than the female 2 ̆ 7 s, and they are found in any part of the receptacle, not being confined in the basal part as in S. filicinum; though they gather more in the basal part. In the hermaphrodite conceptacle the oogonia and the antheridial hairs are not intermingled, but occupy the side position to each other. 4) Discharge of oogonia takes place periodically, and the discharged portion advances acropetally in each receptacle, as is usual in many other members of the genus Sargassum. 5) Discharged <b>oosphere</b> is ellipsoidal measuring ca 265 x 205 p, which is surrounded by a thick layer of mucilaginous substance. Around the outer wall of the thick layer there is observed a girdle-like dissolved portion as is reported on S. horneri (Kunieda & Suto 1940) and S. filicinum (Sawada 1955). 6) The embryo-development takes the same course with S. horneri. The rhizoid cell is segmented into 8 radially arranged cells (2 ̆ 2 radial 8 -cell type 2 ̆ 2 by Inoh 1930), and yet those 8 rhizoids developed from the rhizoid cell another group of about 7 to 15 rhizoids are observed to begin growth. 1. 筆者はシダモクによく似た植物を天草に於て入手し, 観察を行つた結果,生殖器官並びに胚発生に関して若干の知見を得ることが出来た. 2. 外形はアカモク, シダモクと非常によく似ているが, 気胞が大概楕円形である点, これらとは少し異なる. が, その他では仮盤状の根, 刺状突起のある単条の茎, 葉, 冠葉等, 外観は殆ど異なるところはない. 3. 成熟期は, アカモクと略々同時期か或いは多少遅れるのではないかと思われる. 4. 生殖器托の外形は, アカモクの雌またシダモクのものと殆ど同じであるが, 生殖案の性状に関しては大いに異なつた点がある. 即ち雌雄の両生殖案の他に, hermaphrodite の生殖案も存在することは興味深く思われるが, 尚これら 3 種の生殖案は, 1 生殖器托内に於てどの部分からも見出された. 又 hermaphrodite の生殖案にあつては, 雌雄はその案内に於て互に混生することなく, 案ロをはさんで両側に位置するものしか見られなかつた. 雄生殖案が生殖器托の基部の少部分に特に多く存在することは, シダモクに非常によく似た性質である. 5. 1 生殖器托に於て, 卵の放出は基部から上部に向つて 2 ～ 3 回位に分けて行うものと思われる. 6. 放出卵は, 大きさが略々 265 × 205 μ の楕円形で, アカモク, シダモクのものと大体一致し, 膠質状物質に包まれて暫く生殖器托表に附著している. 精子の侵入位置としてはアカモク, シダモクと同様に, 蔵卵器中膜に帯状の膨潤部が観察された. 7. 胚発生の経過は, アカモクと同様な型をとると考えられる. 即ち仮根細胞は放射状に 8 箇に分割され, その後, 仮根細胞に起因しない仮根群が内側から伸び始めて, 合計 10 数本から 20 本前後の仮根が伸長を行う. 8. 仮根細胞に起因する仮根群が或る程度仲びた後に, その内側から別な仮根群が現れる例の多かつた事実は, 従来アカモクについて報含されていたものと必ずしも一致しない. しかし, アカモクに於ても今回の植物と同様な例を福岡市外の材料で観察することが出来たので, 胚発生に関してはアカモクに同じと考えても差支えないと思う...|$|E
