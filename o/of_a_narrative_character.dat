The program holds a team of professionals that together work with the individual’s physical and mental health. In our study we have included eight women and to men in the age between 35 - 65 years who all suffered from a slight mentally illness. Out of a social psychological perspective we have based our study from the social and room environment and how their self-recovery has affected their wellbeing during their rehabilitation. In our study we have out of qualitative interviews put together our results. The interviews were out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>character</b> where the persons told us about parts out of their lives. Our results shows that there is a huge individual development depending on what faze they are in their depression ore on their way recovering from depression. Most of them felt an enormous support from the staff and by meeting people in similar situations as their own. Also the beautiful surroundings had a positive effect of their recovering. The results have been analysed from Johan Asplunds theory about social responses and unsocial responses, how the social environment affects the individual. We also made an environmental psychological analysis with the theory about restorative surroundings and the term cognitive maps that makes the spatial environmental affects of the individual rehabilitation...|$|E

40|$|Adults {{adopt the}} traits of <b>characters</b> in <b>narratives,</b> but {{little is known}} about whether {{children}} do so. In Study 1, 7 - and 10 -year-olds (N= 96) heard a 2. 5 -minute recording about a professor or cheerleader. Reporting higher engagement in the professor narrative related to more time playing with an analytical toy (a Rubik’s cube), whereas reporting higher engagement in the cheerleader narrative related to less time playing with Rubik’s cube. However, although children were randomly assigned to <b>a</b> <b>narrative,</b> within condition children may have had preexisting personality differences causing them both to become more engaged in that narrative and also to behave more like that character afterwards. To control for this possibility, in Study 2 children (N= 104) were given perspective-taking or objective instructions. Interestingly, both instructions created higher engagement than in Study 1, resulting in main effects of narrative. Children in the professor condition, compared to those in the cheerleader condition, spent more time playing with Rubik’s cube and self-reported higher levels of professor-relevant characteristics (e. g., smart, good at teaching). These studies show that, by the elementary school years and particularly when highly engaged in <b>a</b> <b>narrative,</b> children adopt the traits <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrative’s</b> central <b>character...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In a {{traditional}} tabletop role-playing game such as Dungeons & Dragons, an NPC is a fictional character portrayed by the gamemaster. If player <b>characters</b> form the <b>narrative's</b> protagonists, non-player <b>characters</b> {{can be thought}} of as the [...] "supporting cast" [...] or [...] "extras" [...] <b>of</b> <b>a</b> roleplaying <b>narrative.</b> Non-player <b>characters</b> populate the fictional world of the game, and can fill any role not occupied by a player character (PC). Non-player characters might be allies, bystanders or competitors to the PCs. NPCs can also be traders that trade currency for things such as equipment or gear.

40|$|Taking {{an interpretive}} perspective, this chapter argues that {{practice}} research has <b>a</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>character</b> {{in the sense}} that it is a speech act that retrospectively verbalises something (namely practices) that did not exist previously, and that is written from the (unique) perspective of its author. Although the narrative turn in research methodology is gaining significant scholarly attention, little is known about how scientific narratives are created by researchers and how researchers can be held accountable for them. We present two autoethnographies, to obtain insight into our own practice as scientific narrators. Our analysis reveals that our scientific narratives were created by interweaving an empirical plot and a theoretical plot. It also shows that researchers can be held accountable for their <b>narratives</b> by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ‘narrative contract’ with the narrative’s audience according to which the researchers must deliver (1) meaning, by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plot that offers a certain criticality (both empirically and conceptually) and (2) ‘truthfulness’, by resonating with the standards that their audience adheres to. We conclude by discussing the implications <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>narrative</b> turn in research methodology for the conceptualisation of practices, practice based research and practice theory...|$|R

40|$|Current {{research}} on identification with <b>narrative</b> <b>characters</b> poses two problems. First, although identification {{is seen as}} <b>a</b> dynamic process <b>of</b> which the intensity varies during reading, it is usually measured by means of post-reading questionnaires containing self-report items. Second, {{it is not clear}} which linguistic characteristics evoke identification. The present paper proposes that an interdisciplinary framework allows for more precise manipulations and measurements of identification, which will ultimately advance our understanding of the antecedents and nature of this process. The central hypothesis of our Linguistic Cues Framework is that identification with <b>a</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>character</b> is <b>a</b> multidimensional experience for which different dimensions are evoked by different linguistic cues. The first part of the paper presents a literature review on identification, resulting in <b>a</b> renewed conceptualization <b>of</b> identification which distinguishes six dimensions: a spatiotemporal, a perceptual, a cognitive, a moral, an emotional, and an embodied dimension. The second part argues that each of these dimensions is influenced by specific linguistic cues which represent various aspects of the <b>narrative</b> <b>character’s</b> perspective. The proposed relations between linguistic cues and identification dimensions are specified in six propositions. The third part discusses what psychological and neurocognitive methods enable the measurement of the various identification dimensions in order to test the propositions. By establishing explicit connections between the linguistic characteristics of narratives and readers’ physical, psychological, and neurocognitive responses to narratives, this paper develops a research agenda for future empirical {{research on}} identification with <b>narrative</b> <b>characters...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on an inquiry carried out among <b>a</b> small group <b>of</b> {{children}} between the ages of 10 and 12 years, who, in the framework <b>of</b> <b>an</b> art-workshop, attended two theatrical performances of the same subject, Homer’s Odyssey, but of quite different directorial approaches: the first performance had <b>a</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>character</b> following the basic principles of the dramatic model, while the second one belonged to the postdramatic paradigm that tends to subvert all traditional concepts about the structure and the content <b>of</b> <b>a</b> theatrical act.

As an informed instructor on philosophical and theoretical art-matters is a prerequisite, this paper aims at the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fundamental theoretical framework for the postdramatic model and at the examination of the possibilities of postdramatic performances to function both as carriers of information and as stimulators of new kinds of aesthetic experiences, in an educative manner...|$|R
