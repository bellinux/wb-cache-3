To understand Pine Gap today, it is necessary to understand the organisations of the US intelligence community and military concerned with the acquisition of technical intelligence, and their politics over the past five decades. For the first two decades, responsibility for operation of the ground control station at Pine Gap resided with the Ground Systems Division of the Office of ELINT within the CIA’s Directorate for Science and Technology. However, by the early 1990 s control passed to the Systems Acquisition and Operations Directorate of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). In the mid- 2000 s the NRO itself underwent a profound change towards new organisational structures for integrating the imagery and SIGINT operations and making the whole system more responsive to users. The latest phase of these changes in the NRO stresses the role of ground systems, including Pine Gap, in creating ‘a single networked information collection and distribution system’ worldwide. The fundamental transformation of the higher management structure is more than an <b>organisational</b> <b>matter.</b> Along with the militarisation of the facility, it has important implications for Australia 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the project. It warrants serious public discussion, which requires, in turn, greater transparency by the Australian authorities.

40|$|This {{study can}} be {{regarded}} as a continuation of the study relating to how diversity was interpreted {{in different parts of the}} City of Malmö. That particular study showed that the diversity goals formulated by the City of Malmö were interpreted in very different ways in different parts of the city; a fact that made a study of the role and importance of leadership when it comes to spreading ideas about diversity much more attractive. This study's empirical framework consists of interviews with senior managers and with politicians, as well as the scrutiny of political documents and action plans. The empirical investigation showed that politicians and managers who are close to the political level thought that the organisation should be able to handle differences of an internal as well as an external nature. They interpreted diversity as something qualitative and thought that the organisation would have to change if it was to encompass different kinds of people. The other managers interviewed had a slightly different concept of the meaning of diversity. In their view the quantitative representation of different ethnic groups was needed in order to understand and interpret the needs of the different social and ethnic groups. Social problems could, for example, be handled in a more efficient manner if the staff of the organisation had a wider local knowledge. The managers also encountered different dilemmas in relation to the implementation of the diversity idea; dilemmas relating to the interpretation of different competences and the fact that some competences are not evenly distributed in different segments of the population. Such dilemmas are also related to issues of heterogeneity and homogeneity. There was also a dilemma when it came to power and different ideas and interests in the organisation. It was apparent that the managers do not really solve these problems and that their actions are rather passive when it comes to diversity issues. Their way of dealing with the problems is either to say that the problems will solve themselves over time or to redefine them. Instead of viewing the diversity issue as an <b>organisational</b> <b>matter,</b> the managers deal with it as different forms of societal problems that have to be controlled. Qualitative issues relating to diversity and organisational change are left out. Why this happens can be explained in two ways. The first explanation is that the managers act in a pragmatic way. Organisational problems and vague action plans leave the floor open for different solutions and pragmatic ways of dealing with problems. Another interpretation is that the organisation's different ideas and views about diversity and welfare policy interact and conflict, which naturally leads to confusion. In other words, the organisation has problems in deciding whether diversity is an issue connected to social control or to innovation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring recent years, {{management}} has brought tighter controls into {{all areas of}} clinical practice, responding mainly to financial shortages coupled with increasing public demand for quality and safety of care. Management is not simply expanding and creating new roles for non-clinical managers, but doctors, too, are charged with managerial responsibilities. Consequently, the boundaries between medicine and management are no longer sustainable and this, in turn, may have complex implications for control and leadership in clinical practice. This Perspective article seeks to explore how the transformations in medicine and management matter in the control of clinical practice. The way forward is informed by rich case-study material from Denmark, England, Germany, Greece, Poland, and Spain. Research {{was carried out by}} the authors and includes analyses of policy documents and primary and secondary sources. The case study material reveals that no uniform model of control emerges across European healthcare systems. Instead, what matters in the control of clinical practice in European healthcare systems is the specific composition of a set of controls and how they are connected and re-connected and may create new more 'hybrid' patterns of controls. We suggest exploring the 'variations on the theme' of control more systematically by focusing on the organisational settings in different European healthcare states and the actors involved in the transformations. Using cross-country comparison adds further value by filtering out how <b>organisational</b> settings <b>matter</b> in relation to the wider architecture of healthcare states. Finally, this will help to outline future avenues for 'medicine and management' that are likely to create more sustainable and integrated controls in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} decade the Australian Customs Service (ACS) has been {{regarded}} as an organisation in decline. Customs' history has been sporadically influenced by numerous reports that identify many instances of 'maladministration'. More recently, instances, such as the 'Midford Paramount Affair', have brought media and public notoriety to Customs followed by {{the establishment of the}} Review of the ACS in May 1993 (The Conroy Report). This, the latest and most comprehensive report undertaken on the ACS, documented administrative malfunctions of a major kind. Each report, using its own rationale has recommended more advanced levels of information technology (IT) application. To study these protracted administrative issues, the author has used, as the basis of analysis, a dynamic contingent decision-paths schema as well as furthering the theoretical constructs of organisational 'reliability' theory. The dynamic contingent decision-paths schema is designed to provide a conceptual framework regarding public (and private) sector situations of agency decline, evaluation, strategic response and finally 'turnaround' policy and implementation. The ACS is now implementing a comprehensive turnaround strategy, which includes new and novel information technologies. Organisational 'reliability' theory relates to organisations that are required to be highly reliable in their daily work-related activities otherwise crises of some major magnitude may occur. These organisations need to practice near perfect organisational and decision-making performance, and tend to be highly technical, relying increasingly in turn on information technology in managing their respective systems or operations. Customs was an early innovator in using Electronic Data Interchange and is now pursuing e-commerce, which in part is being outsourced, to EDS, a multinational company. The study initially reviews the recent history of the ACS - 'mapping' the nature of the organisation's decline, raising relevant factors which the author argues may be seen as successive 'crisis points', and lastly, addresses the strategic 'turnaround' policies of the organisation. The author believes the nadir for Customs has been reached and there are now positive signs that the ACS has commenced its organisational 'turnaround'. <b>Organisational</b> design <b>matters</b> including structural and cultural issues have been addressed which has allowed Customs to forge new relationships with its clients, as well as fostering 'new' management philosophies. These new philosophies and relationships, together with participation with an industry lead advisory team and a new internal management team, have provided the catalyst for change and recovery. Political and industry pressure and their formal involvement in a recovery strategy provide a high level of confidence for Customs' future and the strategic and operational changes being implemented...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{innovation}} in the contemporary hotel industry is significantly important in sustaining competitive advantage. Given this, this thesis seeks to identify the determinants of employees&rsquo; creativity and innovation. Of all the factors related to employees&rsquo; behaviour, leadership {{has been found to}} be one of the most influential in supporting and encouraging subordinates&rsquo; creativity and innovation, and several authors have asserted that understanding creativity and innovation, at both individual and <b>organisational</b> levels, <b>matter.</b> The key purpose of this thesis is to examine the influence of perceived innovation -enhancing leadership behaviours, the employee&rsquo;s perceptions of an organisational climate supportive {{of innovation}}, and personal initiative on employees&rsquo; creativity and innovation in hotels and resorts in Australia and in Iran. In particular, this thesis examines the direct impact of perceived innovation-enhancing leadership behaviours on employees&rsquo; creativity and innovation. Hierarchical regression analysis is employed to investigate the moderating role of employees&rsquo; perceptions of an organisational climate supportive of innovation (contextual factor) and personal initiative (individual factor) on perceived leadership behaviours and the employees&rsquo; creativity and innovation. This thesis adopts a mixed-methods approach. Ten exploratory interviews with managers from Australian and Iranian 3 -, 4 - and 5 -star hotels and resorts were conducted to identify the salient leadership qualities influencing employees&rsquo; creativity and innovation. Findings from the qualitative study, along with relevant literature, led to the development of a new instrument comprising seven leadership behavioural categories that were likely to enhance and encourage hotel employees to be creative and innovative. A newly developed instrument measuring innovation-enhancing leadership behaviours, together with the other survey instruments adapted and adopted in this thesis, were tested for validity and reliability in a pilot study with 44 participants from Australian and Iranian hotels and resorts. The second study, a quantitative survey of 399 hotel and resort employees and managers, examined the relationships between the factors of interest in this thesis The psychometric properties of the new instrument were evaluated through rigorous examination, including exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Simple, multiple and hierarchical regression analyses were employed to examine the relationships between factors and to respond to the research questions. The empirical findings indicate that the newly developed construct for measuring innovation-enhancing leadership behaviours relates positively and significantly to employees&rsquo; creativity and innovation in Australian and Iranian hotels and resorts, and this set of behaviours is demonstrated to have an important effect on the creativity and innovation of employees. The findings also suggest that employees&rsquo; perceptions that they are working in an organisational climate supportive of innovation and personal initiative enhance the influence of their leaders&rsquo; behaviours on their creativity and innovation. This thesis provides insights into the behaviours that leaders in this industry should adopt to stimulate creativity and innovation among their employees. This thesis finds that besides the behaviours identified here, working in an organisational climate supportive of innovation and personal initiative are other important elements that promote and nurture creativity and innovation in employees&rsquo; daily work. On the basis of this finding, industry practitioners will be able to develop strategies to develop innovative and sustainable organisational advantages in the competitive hotel industry and its findings specially in the category of leadership behaviours, will offer useful directions for training and development programs. The newly developed and validated instrument to measure innovation-enhancing leadership behaviours also contributes to the literature on leadership and innovation...|$|R
40|$|Forest Conservation and People’s Livelihoods: Explaining Encroachment on Zambia’s Protected Forest Landscapes - The Case Of Mwekera National Forest, Kitwe, Copperbelt Abstract The {{conflicts}} between conservation objectives and the livelihood needs of local communities are intricate {{and difficult to}} resolve and yet {{the success of any}} conservation effort hinges on their solution. This is particularly true in forest conservation in Third World countries like Zambia, where rural populations depend directly on forest resources, which are in many cases protected. Forest reserves in Zambia have undergone drastic changes over the years due to encroachment by such human activities as agriculture, charcoal burning and even settlements. This has led to the deforestation of most of them including Mwekera National Forest in Kitwe on the Copperbelt province. The Forest Department has attempted to involve the people in the management of these resources in a bid to redress the trend. But the fundamental causes for the encroachment and deforestation are not clear. This study was focused on unearthing the underlying causes of encroachment and the subsequent deforestation of Mwekera National Forest. This was done through a qualitative ethnographic approach employing individual interviews, focused group discussions, observations and pictures of relevant phenomena. The target groups included the forest communities living in and around Mwekera National Forest as well as government forestry officials at both local and national levels. The study was based on nature-culture theory, knowledge systems theory as well as the participatory approach. The study reveals that macro-economic policies such as privatisation of the mines has undermined people’s livelihoods while the inefficient and bureaucratic land delivery system made “vacant” protected forest land an attractive option. The policy contradictions between the forest sector and other sectors such as energy, agriculture and land have not helped <b>matters.</b> <b>Organisational</b> constraints on the Forest Department such as its inadequate human, financial and other resources coupled with the delay in its transformation to a more autonomous Forest Commission have not secured protected forests. Its old centralist management approach has made participation by local people difficult to effect despite being provided for under new forestry policy and law. This has meant that decisions made by officials lack meaningful involvement and support of the local people, thereby seriously hindering effective forest protection. Herein lies one major cause of encroachment. </p...|$|R

40|$|Complex {{environmental}} health issues {{are examples of}} ‘wicked problems’ that require cross-sectoral collaboration of the public, private, not-for-profit, and academic sectors together with the communities in which they function. Although the linkages between health and sustainability have been widely acknowledged in theory, stakeholders engaged in sustainable development and health seldom collaborate in practice. Promoting {{environmental health}} has remained strongly {{in the domain of}} the health sector, despite the ambitious rhetoric of international agreements. 	This dissertation focuses on cross-sectoral integration of health and sustainable development practices by exploring the bridging of ‘siloed’ knowledge. The emphasis is on collective knowledge and the three characteristics of cross-sectoral partnerships that have been identified as valuable for improving decision-making processes: bridging key discourses, bringing together key groups, and generating new knowledge. Aristotle’s three intellectual virtues, epistemé, techné and phronesis, were modified to help describe these aspects of collective intelligence that could enhance the integration of approaches to health and sustainability. 	The theoretical foundation for this transdisciplinary research was built primarily on health promotion and sustainability governance literatures, which were examined for their overlapping and complementary aspects. Children’s environmental health was studied as a useful bridging concept and UNESCO-mandated biosphere reserves as bridging organisations for integrating health and sustainability. Activities in all Canadian and British biosphere reserves were assessed for the extent of their focus on health. In addition, by investigating four biosphere reserves as case studies, this research identified barriers to and drivers for integrating health goals into biosphere reserve activities. At the same time, the <b>organisational</b> understanding of <b>matters</b> relevant to children’s environmental health was studied to assess the potential of biosphere reserves as bridging organisations for gathering and mobilising local knowledge on these issues. The findings centre on three new perspectives for mobilising knowledge {{as it relates to the}} cross-sectoral integration of health and sustainability: (1) the bridging of health promotion and sustainability governance theories, using children’s environmental health as a bridging concept and area of application, which brings together the key discourses in a transdisciplinary manner (epistemé); (2) the value of bridging organisations offering their skills and functional platforms as mechanisms to facilitate bridging of health and sustainability in practice, by bringing together main stakeholders (techné); and (3) the importance of bridging collective knowledge and combining the theoretical, practical, and ethical aspects of the integration process, to increase the level of understanding of specific problems, in this case children’s environmental health (phronesis). 	Other contributions offered by this research include the discovery of similarities in health promotion and sustainability governance theories; development of a transdisciplinary ecohealth framework; recognition of biosphere reserves as bridging organisations that function as innovative community-based forums for the integration of sustainable development and public health; and findings that reveal an insufficiency of local data collection on children’s environmental health threats. All in all, the findings in this research offer a conceptual and practical frame for integrating health and sustainability by facilitating cross-sectoral collaboration...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three empirical case studies, originally published as MERGE- papers ('Papers on transcultural studies' published at MERGE, Centre for Studies on Migration, Ethnic Relations and Globalisation at the Department of Sociology, University of Umeå), brought together and framed by a lengthier introduction. The empirical studies examine Swedish refugee reception activities, including the experiences of refugees themselves, {{with a focus on}} <b>organisational</b> and inter-organisational <b>matters,</b> and, in this context, the suitability as well as problems, mechanisms and issues, of implementation. According to Swedish policy aims since the mid- 70 s, immigrants are guaranteed equality, freedom of choice and partnership in relation to social, political and cultural rights. Based upon this background, an ambitious institutionalisation of refugee reception and integration policy was initiated in 1985, implicating the setting up of a new reception system involving almost every Swedish municipality. However, this political reform came to meet with fundamental problems, such as the absence of clear political goals and a remarkably low priority in the work of local political bodies. As a consequence, the ability and the ambitions of civil servants to apply an integrated approach to the reception process, and to foster growing co-operation among relevant local institutions to improve services and opportunities for integration, have not materialised as intended. These deficiencies of local integration policies appear to be connected with implementation problems, issues and obstacles, such as a lack of developed inter-organisational co-ordination mechanisms, lack of a clear division of labour and responsibility among concerned parties, economic obstruction etc. In addition to this, the resources that local refugee receptions have had at their disposal have been a high degree varying and unstable, with the consequence that the reception's organisation, e. g. as immigrant bureaus, has been subjected to constant remoulding. Continuous initiatives for restructuring the reception procedures seem seldom have been well suited, and in addition to this, there has been a lack of opportunities for influence by the refugees themselves concerning conditions of reception and inroads into integration. The conclusion is, somewhat paradoxical, that many of the refugee reception's political-administrative problems are fabricated by and within the refugee reception system and immigrant policy itself. In the thesis, a general background for necessary improvements of the service for refugees is outlined, making possible a lot of reformistic suggestions. While the thesis lays bare the problems with refugee reception, its policy and implementation, it also acknowledges important positive achievements of Swedish refugee reception and its political-administrative ambitions and framework. The reason that the effects of these positive efforts and achievements haven't materialised in successful integration to a higher degree, is also due to 'external' factors, like exclusion from the labour market, social exclusion through segregation, marginalisation and discrimination, processes of racialisation etc. These kinds of ramifying 'external' factors can only to a limited extent be influenced by local actors alone. The conclusion is that a successful integration cannot be achieved solely through measures within the practical institutional setting of the local refugee reception system itself, but must be underpinned and enforced by a more generalised inclusionary or anti-exclusionary politics, a generally more decided political will and over-all more purposeful measures securing a higher degree of suited implementation. digitalisering@um...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Natal, Durban, 2002. One of {{the results}} of an {{increasing}} concern, in many countries, with the quality of schooling and its improvement, has been that considerable attention has been given, in the literature and in practice, to the management of individual and <b>organisational</b> performance. The <b>matter</b> of <b>organisational</b> performance is being addressed through various means of evaluating schools, and in South Africa, this is finding expression in the current Whole School Evaluation (WSE) project. On the other hand, concerns with individual performance typically are being addressed through various forms of systematic appraisal of teachers. In South Africa, the recently introduced variant of systematic appraisal {{is referred to as the}} "Developmental Appraisal System" (DAS). The DAS is claimed to focus entirely on developmental outcomes. According to Chetty et al (1993), prior to 1994, a variety of processes for evaluating teacher performance were evident, but most of these were substantially "bureaucratic and inspectorial" in nature, and were widely rejected by teachers. Consequently, the current approach to appraisal has been developed largely in reaction what were seen to be the limitations and shortcomings of earlier versions. Chetty et al (op. cit.) and Thurlow with Ramnarain (2001) have summarised and discussed the processes which led to the development of the DAS, which culminated in an agreement which was reached in the Education Labour Relations Council in 1998 (Resolution 4 of 1998). Subsequently the new DAS was gazetted and throughout 1999 and 2000 the process of its implementation was embarked upon in all schools. It was intended that a nation review of the implementation of DAS was due to have taken place by the end of 2002. However, for whatever reason, this has not happened and there is no substantial evidence about how successful, or otherwise, the implementation has been. Thurlow with Ramnarain (op. cit) have speculated, without empirical evidence, on the limitations of the implementation process, and the Association of Professional Educators of KwaZulu-Natal (APEK) undertook a limited review of the DAS among some of its members during 2001. The literature on the assessment of individual performance indicates that, minimally, any evaluation of systematic appraisal system requires that attention should be given to its underlying purposes (or conceptualisation), the process of its implementation, and its ultimate impact. As far as underlying purposes are concerned, it is evident that several different "models" for appraisal exist in different parts of the world (and in the literature). Some of these models are "pure" models, while some are "mixed" by design. Some, while officially conceived as "pure", in fact may be shown to have unintended outcomes. In the present study, the DAS will be examined and compared with other models with a view to offering a considered critique of the "officially" declared underlying purposes of the system. The above provides the context for this study, which will focus on one school's experiences of implementing the DAS. No matter how sound are the intentions of the DAS, it can only be successful if it is effectively implemented at the school level, and so the reported experiences of those involved at this level are significant...|$|R
