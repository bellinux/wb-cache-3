25|$|As {{the volume}} of FidoNet Mail {{increased}} and newsgroups {{from the early days}} of the Internet became available, satellite data downstream services became viable for larger systems. The satellite service provided access to FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups in large volumes at a reasonable fee. By connecting a small dish & receiver, a constant downstream of thousands of FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups could be received. The local BBS only needed to upload new <b>outgoing</b> <b>messages</b> via the modem network back to the satellite service. This method drastically reduced phone data transfers while dramatically increasing the number of message forums.|$|E

50|$|Answering {{machines}} {{became more}} widely used after {{the restructuring of}} AT&T in 1984, which was when the machines became affordable and sales reached one million units {{per year in the}} US. While early answering machines used magnetic tape technology, most modern equipment uses solid state memory storage; some devices use a combination of both, with a solid-state circuit for the <b>outgoing</b> <b>message</b> and a cassette for the incoming messages.James P Mitchell displayed a working prototype of a digital <b>outgoing</b> <b>message</b> with a taped incoming system at an Iowa State University VEISHEA engineering openhouse in April 1982. This system won a gold award from the Engineering department. In 1983, Kazuo Hashimoto received a patent for a digital answering machine architecture with US Patent 4,616,110. The first digital answering machine brought to the market was AT&T's 1337; an activity led by Trey Weaver. Mr. Hashimoto sued AT&T but quickly dropped the suit because the AT&T architecture was significantly different from his patent.|$|R

30|$|The {{details of}} BP {{decoding}} algorithm and the EXIT analysis for single-user LDPC codes {{can be found}} in[17, 19]. In EXIT analysis, the analytical computation of mutual information is feasible only if the outgoing LLRs from the nodes in the factor graph have a Gaussian (or Gaussian-mixture) distribution[19]. When the channel is binary-input AWGN (BiAWGN) channel, the outgoing LLR values are Gaussian distributed[14]. For other types of channels, the Gaussian approximation of LLRs {{is known to be}} a good approximation, due to the universality of the LDPC codes (a code designed for one type of channel performs well on a another type of a channel)[15]. The analytical expressions for iterative mutual information updates through CBV nodes and PCF nodes in EXIT analysis is well known[17]. In particular, the mutual information update through a CBV node stems from the message update through that variable node and the central limit theorem. That is, since an <b>outgoing</b> <b>message</b> of a given node has the mean equal to the sum of means of incoming messages to that node, given a reasonably high node degree, the <b>outgoing</b> <b>message</b> is approximately Gaussian. The mutual information update for a PCF node on the other hand relies on the deterministic relationship between the PCF node and the CBV nodes connected to it, as defined by the parity check equations. As a result, the mutual information update for a PCF node can be computed by simply using duality relationship that it has with a CBV node[20].|$|R
