5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, the Bay Area {{and the rest}} of Northern California became the center of the {{counterculture}} movement. Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in San Francisco were seen as centers of activity, with the hit American pop song San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair) further enticing like-minded individuals to join the movement in the Bay Area and leading to the Summer of Love. In the proceeding decades, the Bay Area would cement itself as a hotbed of New Left activism, student activism, opposition to the Vietnam War and other anti-war movements, the black power movement, and the gay rights movement. At the same time, San Jose {{and the rest of}} the South Bay began to rapidly develop as it began to transition from a largely agricultural-based economy into the hotbed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high-tech</b> industry. Fred Terman, the director of a top-secret research project at Harvard University during World War II, joined the faculty at Stanford University in order to reshape the university's engineering department. His students, including David Packard and William Hewlett would later help usher in the region's high-tech revolution. In 1955, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory opened for business near Stanford, and although the business venture was a financial failure, it was the first semiconductor company in the Bay Area, and the talent that it attracted to the region eventually led to a high-tech cluster of companies later known as Silicon Valley.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Lehigh Gorge State Park is tied into the {{development}} of anthracite coal mining, which was once the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high-tech</b> economy of northeastern Pennsylvania in its day. It is also tied into the early-to-middle period of the United State's Canal Era and the rapid development of pragmatic railroading technologies and consequent accelerated growth and use of railroadsall contributing factors in the Pennsylvanian and North American Industrial Revolution. By the 1790s deforestation of the American East, like it had in Britain a century earlier, was making the search for alternative fuels urgent and with England's experience of coal many were willing to invest in ventures to somehow mine and ship Anthracite east to the Delaware River where it could be barged to the cities of {{the east coast of}} the United States. England's technological lead was obvious and its extensive canal system was given much credit for the success of Britain's industries and its emergence as the sole world power {{at the end of the}} Seven Years' War.|$|E

Ben Sisario of The New York Times stated that the band [...] "provided the soundtrack to dot-com-era alienation, singing in a cracked yet still innocent voice of life spent staring into a computer screen". Ross Raihala, reviewing Sumday for Spin, identified what he called Lytle's [...] "geeky identification with technology". On The Sophtware Slump, CMJ writer Richard A.

Lytle described his empathy with machines in 2003, stating [...] "I find it easier dealing with certain things by living through inanimate objects" [...] and how the song [...] "I'm on Standby" [...] is about Lytle relating to a mobile phone: [...] "I was {{spending so much time}} learning the art of turning off, while still being 'on'".|$|E
