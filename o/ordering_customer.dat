40|$|Online {{purchasing}} is now popular {{following the}} growth of E-business. Retailers ordering online will get the exact delivery date of goods for their better management of sales operations. Suppliers should keep their competence at order promising to attract customers in the market filled with increasing competition. Generally Order Promising means that the supplier receiving an order should determine to accept the order or not. If accepted, then the supplier should determine the delivery date. Necessary data should be replied to the <b>ordering</b> <b>customer.</b> Optimizing Order Promising (OOP) is Order Promising (OP) that is optimized. This thesis probed into OP and OOP and summarized the characteristics and differences of the current OP software products {{on the basis of}} interviews and the investigation into the existing OP software suppliers - i 2 Technologies, Oracle and SAP. Backed by the thorough analysis on a particular case study company, this thesis discusses the workflow and model of OOP by combining the author's own thoughts on improving existing OP workflows. A company can add many new functions to the OOP model designed in this thesis {{on the basis of the}} appropriate adjustments to the existing OP workflows and systems. (cont.) For example, different customers can be managed in a classified way in accordance with historical sales; customer trust can be increased by the approach of Customer Allocation; every deal of the company can be guaranteed to be profitable; and no negligence to important customers will occur due to favoring unimportant customers. Moreover, in dealing with the disruptions that have frequently occurred these years, the thesis designed the order promising process dealing with emergencies for the manufacturers of public utilities, ensuring that a company will implement their social responsibility while harvesting profits. by Zhipeng Li.

40|$|Reverse {{logistics}} {{is different}} from forward logistics in objectives, operations, pricing, quality, quantity, packaging, product and information flow. Further, management of the returned products and their information is a major challenge since {{it is difficult to}} predict the time, place of origin, quantity and quality of the goods that will be returned. To establish the importance of reverse logistics as a business process and to understand related issues for information management, this research was undertaken with data from the Australian Manufacturing and E-Business organisations. This research examined six dimensions of reverse logistics. These were: (1) Factors that compel Manufacturing and E-Business organisations to manage reverse logistics; (2) Operations in product return process; (3) Methods of capturing value from returned goods; (4) Barriers to reverse logistics management; (5) Information management issues in reverse logistics; and (6) Product return trends in the E-Business industry. This research was exploratory in nature and was accomplished via a quantitative research method. It adopted a positivist epistemology and followed a deductive approach to capture reverse logistics knowledge. Research data from Manufacturing and E-Business industries was elicited with postal questionnaire surveys using structured questions. Since the data collected from the two main surveys was mainly nominal and ordinal, it was quantitatively analysed using non-parametric tests, Fisher&# 039;s exact test and one sample Wilcoxon test. It also employed frequency distributions, binomial test and one sample t-test. An additional statistical test was carried out on each set of data to triangulate the finding. The tests were undertaken in Minitab spreadsheet computer packages. This research highlights the fact that reverse logistics management is an important business process in the Australian Manufacturing and E-Business industries. It is a strategic advantage, as well as an important customer service. Although substantial monetary value can be recovered from returned goods, at present two industries investigated have not tapped into this potential. Findings of this research also indicate that a lack of efficient information management is a problem in reverse logistics. Information management in the two industries is based on land-line telephone, fax and computers. This research identified that from E-Business sales error in <b>ordering,</b> <b>customer</b> change of mind on receipt of good and inefficient forward logistics operations (picking, packing and delivery) are important reasons for returns. It also established that e-businesses resell the returned goods and recapture value. The value recovery process in this industry {{is different from}} the manufacturing industries where the prevalent value recovery processes are repair, resale and recycle. Further research issues emanating from this project include evaluation methods for recapturing value from returned goods, effective information management strategies for return management and the impact of a law for returning certain types of used goods. This research is an initial effort undertaken to establish returns management in the Australian industries. It establishes that reverse logistics should be recognised as a business process in these industries...|$|E

40|$|In manual {{order picking}} systems, order pickers walk or ride through a {{distribution}} warehouse {{in order to}} collect items required by (internal or external) <b>customers.</b> <b>Order</b> batching consists of combining these – indivisible – <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> into picking orders. With respect to order batching, two problem types can be distinguished: In off-line (static) batching all <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> are known in advance. In on-line (dynamic) batching <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> become available dynamically over time. This report considers an on-line order batching problem in which the total completion time of all <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> arriving within a certain time period has to be minimized. The author shows how heuristic approaches for the off-line order batching can be modified {{in order to deal}} with the on-line situation. A competitive analysis shows that every on-line algorithm for this problem is at least 2 -competitive. Moreover, this bound is tight if an optimal batching algorithm is used. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in a series of extensive numerical experiments. It is demonstrated that the choice of an appropriate batching method can lead to a substantial reduction of the completion time of a set of <b>customer</b> <b>orders.</b> Warehouse Management, Order Picking, Order Batching, On-line Optimization...|$|R
