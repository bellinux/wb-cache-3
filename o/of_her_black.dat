Her jacket had slipped from one shoulder which showed pink through the locks <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> hair.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the success}} of these volumes, it was the release of Coal in 1976 that {{established}} Lorde as an influential voice in the Black Arts Movement, and the large publishing house behind it -- Norton -- helped introduce her to a wider audience. The volume includes poems from both The First Cities and Cables to Rage, and it unties many of the themes Lorde would become known for throughout her career: her rage at racial injustice, her celebration <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> identity, and her call for an intersectional consideration of women's experiences. Lorde followed Coal up with Between Our Selves (also in 1976) and Hanging Fire (1978).|$|E
500|$|On the surface, Passing {{conforms}} to that stereotype in its portrayal of Clare Kendry, whose passing for white has tragic consequences; however, the book resists {{the conventions of}} the genre, as Clare refuses to feel the expected anguish at the betrayal <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> identity and socializes with blacks {{for the purposes of}} excitement rather than racial solidarity. Scholars have more generally considered Passing as a novel in which the major concern is not race. For instance, Claudia Tate describes the issue as [...] "merely a mechanism for setting the story in motion, sustaining the suspense, and bringing about the external circumstances for the story's conclusion." ...|$|E

500|$|After 1945, {{stories of}} the Lalaurie slaves became {{considerably}} more explicit. Jeanne deLavigne, writing in Ghost Stories of Old New Orleans (1946), alleged that Lalaurie had a [...] "sadistic appetite [...] seemed never appeased until she had inflicted on one or more <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> servitors some hideous form of torture" [...] and claimed that those {{who responded to the}} 1834 fire had found [...] "male slaves, stark naked, chained to the wall, their eyes gouged out, their fingernails pulled off by the roots; others had their joints skinned and festering, great holes in their buttocks where the flesh had been sliced away, their ears hanging by shreds, their lips sewn together... Intestines were pulled out and knotted around naked waists. There were holes in skulls, where a rough stick had been inserted to stir the brains." [...] DeLavigne did not directly cite any sources for these claims, and they were not supported by the primary sources.|$|E
500|$|Seacole {{was proud}} of both her Jamaican and Scottish ancestry and called herself a Creole, a term that was {{commonly}} used in a racially neutral sense or {{to refer to the}} children of white settlers with indigenous women. In her autobiography, The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole, she records her bloodline thus: [...] "I am a Creole, and have good Scots blood coursing through my veins. My father was a soldier of an old Scottish family." [...] Legally, she was classified as a mulatto, a multiracial person with limited political rights; Robinson speculates that she may technically have been a quadroon. Seacole emphasises her personal vigour in her autobiography, distancing herself from the contemporary stereotype of the [...] "lazy Creole", She was proud <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> ancestry, writing, [...] "I have a few shades of deeper brown upon my skin which shows me related – and I am proud of the relationship – to those poor mortals whom you once held enslaved, and whose bodies America still owns." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Spears driving a Porsche 928 {{at high speed}} in the Hollywood Hills. She crashes through a fence and lands into a pool inside a manor where a party is taking place. She emerges from the water and crawls in top {{of the car to}} sing the first verse. Spears's brother Bryan makes a cameo in these scenes. After she leaves the pool, she enters the manor and passes couples making out around her. She appears in a {{stainless}} steel kitchen, where a maid cuts the straps <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> wet dress. In the next scene, she walks into a study in which her husband at the time, Kevin Federline, is smoking and watching a black-and-white video of Spears on a projection screen. According to Jennifer Vineyard from MTV, the clip had the style of pornographic films from the 1940s and 1950s. Rolling Stone in their article [...] "Britney Spears: The Complete Video Guide", compared it to Madonna's performances of her 1984 single [...] "Like a Virgin". She then entered a dressing room with mirrors, wearing lingerie, high heels, stockings and a short fur jacket. She proceeds to a bedroom, in which a black dress is laid out on the comforter. She puts on the new dress and the camera cuts to the party outside where people gathered waiting. During the song's bridge, it is revealed that the party is actually Spears's wedding, as she starts walking towards the aisle and Federline waits next to a priest. The video ends with a shot of the black-and-white video and Spears looking into the camera. The black-and-white footage was released as an alternate version of the music video in the 2004 DVD [...]|$|E

2500|$|The film Berenice Abbott: A View of the 20th Century, {{which showed}} 200 <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> and white photographs, {{suggests}} {{that she was}} a “proud proto-feminist”; someone who was ahead of her time in feminist theory.

2500|$|Later in his career, Smith {{wrote that}} he always {{believed}} himself {{to be the first}} person to get the name [...] "Black Dahlia" [...] into print, though he admitted he didn't come up with the nickname. [...] Smith had picked up a tip that Elizabeth Short had frequented a Long Beach drugstore. [...] Upon calling and speaking to the pharmacist, Smith was told that the kids around the soda fountain called her the Black Dahlia, on account <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> hair and in reference to a then current movie The Blue Dahlia. [...] In his book, Jack Smith's L.A., he described the discovery of the nickname as [...] "a rewrite man's dream" [...] and said he [...] "couldn't wait to get it into type." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennett {{also has}} a {{response}} to the [...] "Mary the color scientist" [...] thought experiment. He argues that Mary would not, in fact, learn something new if she stepped out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> and white room to see the color red. Dennett asserts that if she already truly knew [...] "everything about color", that knowledge would include a deep understanding of why and how human neurology causes us to sense the [...] "quale" [...] of color. Mary would therefore already know exactly what to expect of seeing red, before ever leaving the room. Dennett argues that the misleading aspect of the story is that Mary is supposed to not merely be knowledgeable about color but to actually know all the physical facts about it, which would be a knowledge so deep that it exceeds what can be imagined, and twists our intuitions.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron {{syndicate}} Team New Zealand, skippered by Russell Coutts, first won {{the challenger}} series in NZL 32, dubbed [...] "Black Magic" [...] because <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> hull and uncanny speed. Black Magic then easily defeated Dennis Connor's Stars & Stripes team, 5–0, {{to win the}} cup for New Zealand. Although team Young America's cup candidate yacht USA-36 was defeated in defender trials by Stars & Stripes' USA-34, the San Diego Yacht Club elected to defend the cup with USA-36 crewed by Stars & Stripes. The run-up to the 1995 Cup was notable for the televised sinking of oneAustralia during the fourth round robin of the Louis Vuitton challenger selection series, with all hands escaping uninjured. The 1995 defender selection series also had the first mostly female (with one man) crew sailing the yacht USA-43, nicknamed [...] "Mighty Mary".|$|E
2500|$|Most {{scholars}} see Dana as {{an example}} of a strong female protagonist. Angelyn Mitchell describes Dana as a black woman [...] "strengthened by her racial pride, her personal responsibility, her free will, and her self-determination." [...] Identifying Dana as one of many Butler’s strong female black heroes, Grace McEntee explains how Dana attempts to transform Rufus into a caring individual despite her struggles with a white patriarchy. These struggles, Missy Dehn Kubitschek explains, are clearly represented by Dana’s resistance to white male control of a crucial aspect of her identity—her writing—both in the past and in the present. Sherryl Vint argues that, by refusing Dana to be reduced to a raped body, Butler would seem to be aligning her protagonist with [...] "the sentimental heroines who would rather die than submit to rape" [...] and thus [...] "allows Dana to avoid a crucial aspect of the reality of female enslavement." [...] However, by risking death by killing Rufus, Dana becomes a permanent surviving record of the mutilation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> ancestors, both through her armless body and by becoming [...] "the body who writes Kindred." [...] In contrast to these views, Beverly Friend believes Dana represents the helplessness of modern woman and that Kindred demonstrates that women have been and continue to be victims in a world run by men.|$|E
