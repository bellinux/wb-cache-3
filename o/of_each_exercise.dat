50|$|Friedland {{returned}} to Goldberg in 1531 and began that career {{which has made}} him the typical German schoolmaster of the Reformation period. His system of education and discipline speedily attracted attention. He made his best elder scholars the teachers of the younger classes, and insisted {{that the way to}} learn was to teach. He organized the school modelled on the Roman Republic {{in such a way that}} the whole ordinary discipline was in the hands of the boys themselves. Every month a consul, twelve senators and two censors were chosen from the pupils, and over all Trotzendorff ruled as dictator perpetuus. One hour a day was spent in going over the lessons of the previous day. The lessons were repeatedly recalled by examinations, which were conducted on the plan of academical disputations. Every week each pupil had to write two exercitia styli, one in prose and the other in verse, and Trotzendorff took pains to see that the subject <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>exercise</b> was something interesting. The fame of the Goldberg School extended over all Protestant Germany, and a large number of the more famous men of the following generation were taught by Trotzendorf.|$|E

Present work aims at demonstrating the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) -based sensing methodology for measuring surface strains generated on the skin of the calf muscle to evaluate the suggested airline exercises to avoid DVT.

Objective: To {{determine the effects of}} a carbohydrate plus protein (C + P) beverage consumed during resistance exercise on respiratory exchange ratio (RER), blood glucose, and performance. Methods: Ten resistance trained male subjects completed two bouts of exercise consisting of seven sets of squats and bench presses using 60 % of their one repetition maximum (1 RM). Subjects consumed C + P during one trial, and a non-caloric placebo (P) in the other. Six sets <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>exercise</b> were performed for a predetermined number of repetitions, followed by a seventh set <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>exercise</b> for as many repetitions as possible, performed as explosively as possible. Power was measured during the final set <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>exercise.</b> Glucose was measured pre, during, and post exercise. RER was measured seven times during each session. Results: No significant difference in power was found. C + P resulted in significantly greater work in the bench press (p <  0. 05), with no difference in the squat (p =  0. 10). Post-exercise glucose was significantly greater (p <  0. 05) in C + P vs. placebo. In C + P, post-exercise glucose was significantly greater (p <  0. 05) than before or during exercise. For RER, a significant effect was found for time (p <  0. 05), with no difference between conditions.
