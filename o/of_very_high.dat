In flight testing, the Avrocar proved to have unresolved thrust and stability problems that limited it to a degraded, low-performance flight envelope; subsequently, the project was cancelled in September 1961.|$|E

5|$|In {{neutrino}} astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded {{underground facilities}} such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III {{for the detection}} of neutrinos. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A. Cosmic rays, which consist <b>of</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories. Some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Official {{figures on}} wartime damage {{published}} in Croatia in 1996 specify 180,000 destroyed housing units, 25% of the Croatian economy destroyed, and US$27billion of material damage. Europe Review 2003/04 estimated the war damage at US$37billion in damaged infrastructure, lost economic output, and refugee-related costs, while GDP dropped 21% in the period. 15 percent of housing units and 2,423 cultural heritage structures, including 495 sacral structures, were destroyed or damaged. The war imposed an additional economic burden <b>of</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> military expenditures. By 1994, as Croatia rapidly {{developed into a}} de facto war economy, the military consumed as much as 60 percent of total government spending.|$|E
5|$|Professional audio subwoofers used in rock {{concerts in}} stadiums, DJ {{performances}} at dance music (e.g., EDM) and similar events must be capable <b>of</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> bass output levels, {{at very low}} frequencies, with low distortion. This {{is reflected in the}} design attention given in the 2010s to the subwoofer applications for sound reinforcement, public address systems, dance club systems and concert systems. Consumer applications (as in home use) are considerably less demanding due to much smaller listening space and lower playback levels. Subwoofers are now almost universal in professional sound applications such as live concert sound, churches, nightclubs, and theme parks. Movie theatres certified to the THX standard for playback always include high capability subwoofers. Some professional applications require subwoofers designed for very high sound levels, using multiple 12-, 15-, 18- or 21-inch drivers (30cm, 40cm, 45cm, 53cm respectively). Drivers as small as 10-inch (25cm) are occasionally used, generally in horn-loaded enclosures.|$|E

5|$|The {{volume of}} space within which an object {{can be said}} to orbit Jupiter is defined by Jupiter's Hill sphere (also called the Roche sphere). When the comet passed Jupiter in the late 1960s or early 1970s, it {{happened}} to be near its aphelion, and found itself slightly within Jupiter's Hill sphere. Jupiter's gravity nudged the comet towards it. Because the comet's motion with respect to Jupiter was very small, it fell almost straight toward Jupiter, which is why it ended up on a Jupiter-centric orbit <b>of</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> eccentricitythat is to say, the ellipse was nearly flattened out.|$|E
5|$|Whereas Henry VII had not {{involved}} Parliament in his affairs very much, Henry VIII {{had to turn}} to Parliament during his reign for money, in particular for grants of subsidies to fund his wars. The Dissolution of the Monasteries provided a means to replenish the treasury, {{and as a result}} the Crown took possession of monastic lands worth £120,000 (£36million) a year. The Crown had profited a small amount in 1526 when Wolsey had put England onto a gold, rather than silver, standard, and had debased the currency slightly. Cromwell debased the currency more significantly, starting in Ireland in 1540. The English pound halved in value against the Flemish pound between 1540 and 1551 as a result. The nominal profit made was significant, helping to bring income and expenditure together, but it had a catastrophic effect on the overall economy of the country. In part, it helped to bring about a period <b>of</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> inflation from 1544 onwards.|$|E
5|$|With {{very warm}} sea surface temperatures, high ocean heat content, low wind shear, and a moist air mass, Omar quickly {{reached its peak}} {{intensity}} early on October16 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130mph (215km/h). During the intensification phase, the forward motion of the hurricane increased to 20mph (32km/h). Once in the Atlantic Ocean, Omar began to rapidly weaken, with winds decreasing by 50mph (85km/h) in 12 hours. Visible satellite images depicted an exposed low-level circulation with convection displaced to the east due to a combination <b>of</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> wind shear and dry air. By October17, most of the deep convection associated with the system dissipated; however, a brief decrease in wind shear allowed Omar to re-strengthen to its secondary peak, with winds of 85mph (140km/h). During this phase, convection redeveloped around the center and an eye reformed. Later that day, the trough that caused the rapid northeastern motion bypassed Omar, leading to decreasing movement.|$|E

5|$|Structure C8 is a {{residential}} compound that was accessed from the alley {{running to the}} East Plaza from behind Pyramid C1. The entrance opened onto the alley from a patio situated in the southern portion of the compound. This patio was surrounded on the east, west and north sides by rooms, with the alley to the south. It was floored with stucco and Structure C8 was the only stuccoed residential building {{in the whole of}} the city. The north range of rooms backed directly onto the ravine immediately to the north of Group C; the lower portion of the walls of the west room and of half of the north room still stand. The west room was square while the north room was narrow and probably extended the entire width of the patio. Wear marks in the stucco floor indicate that a door once accessed the north room from the west. The workmanship of Structure C8 was <b>of</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> quality and indicates that it was the residence of a member of the city's elite. Its proximity to the large pyramid-temple C1 has led archaeologist Henri Lehmann to speculate that it was once the house of the high priest.|$|E
