5|$|Horses occur {{naturally}} on the steppes of Central Asia, {{and their}} domestication, around 3,000 BC in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea region, was originally {{as a source}} of meat; use as pack animals and for riding followed. Around the same time, the wild ass was being tamed in Egypt. Camels were domesticated soon after this, with the Bactrian camel in Mongolia and the Arabian camel becoming beasts <b>of</b> <b>burden.</b> By 1000 BC, caravans of Arabian camels were linking India with Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{problems}} {{pertaining to the}} allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in mixed disputes in legal and non-legal contexts are addressed. First the traditional view on the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof based on Whately’s legal conception of ‘presumption’ is discussed. Whately’s proposal is not adequate for the solution of problems related to the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in everyday mixed disputes {{where there is no}} presumption of status quo. Using the pragma-dialectical perspective it is explained how practical questions regarding the division <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof are solved in a legal context. It is shown that for argumentation theory, the combination of material and procedural rules for the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof offer an instrument for the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in both legal and non-legal discussions...|$|R

5|$|The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts <b>of</b> <b>burden,</b> {{and they}} were {{responsible}} for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also {{a central part of}} an offering ritual. Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period. Camels, although known from the New Kingdom, were not used as beasts <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly utilized in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land. Dogs, cats, and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as Sub-Saharan African lions, were reserved for royalty. Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses. During the Predynastic and Late periods, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth, and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} has {{not occurred}} naturally {{in the wild}} for nearly 2,000 years. It was probably first domesticated in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In the wild, the dromedary inhabited arid regions, including the Sahara Desert. The domesticated dromedary is generally found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia. Products of the dromedary, including its meat and milk, support several north Arabian tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a beast <b>of</b> <b>burden.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of {{the vital}} {{instruments}} which facilitated long distance trade was portage and the domestication of beasts <b>of</b> <b>burden.</b> Organized caravans, visible by the 2nd millennium BCE, could carry goods across a large distance as fodder was mostly available along the way. The domestication of camels allowed Arabian nomads {{to control the}} long distance trade in spices and silk from the Far East to the Arabian Peninsula. Caravans were useful in long-distance trade largely for carrying luxury goods, the transportation of cheaper goods across large distances was not profitable for caravan operators. With productive developments in iron and bronze technologies, newer trade routes– dispensing innovations of civilizations– began to rise.|$|E

30|$|We {{present the}} first study <b>of</b> {{treatment}} <b>burden</b> after kidney transplantation. Themes <b>of</b> treatment <b>burden</b> in kidney transplant patients {{are very similar to}} themes <b>of</b> treatment <b>burden</b> in patients with multiple chronic conditions, with the exception <b>of</b> additional <b>burden</b> from conflict with donors and fear of allograft failure. Our framework is currently being used to adapt a multidimensional, patient-reported measure <b>of</b> treatment <b>burden</b> for use after kidney transplantation [9]. A transplant-specific measure <b>of</b> treatment <b>burden</b> may promote identification of patients at high-risk for nonadherence and graft loss, allow for modification of treatment regimens and ultimately result in alleviation <b>of</b> treatment <b>burden</b> and improved patient-centered care. In addition, patient-reported measures like treatment burden could be used as exploratory endpoints in future clinical trials.|$|R
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Finnhorse were important throughout Finnish history, used as work horses and beasts <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> {{in every aspect of}} life from antiquity well into the 20thcentury. The modern breed's precise line of descent is unclear, but numerous outside influences have been recorded throughout the history of Finland. Linguistics suggest that horse has been in use in Finland in the bronze age, but the earliest archaeological evidence of horses existing in what today is Finland dates to the Finnish Middle Iron Age(400-800CE). The Finnhorse and its progenitors later became an indispensable asset for military forces from the region of Finland during the times of Swedish and Russian rule, and since independence as well. In addition to functionality as military and working horses, the Finnhorse has also been bred for speed in harness racing, and {{it can be argued that}} this sport was the main factor in the survival of the breed after its numbers crashed during the later half of the 20thcentury, from approximately 400,000 animals in the 1950s to 14,000 in the 1980s. In the 21st century, the numbers of the breed have stabilised at approximately 20,000 animals.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts <b>of</b> <b>burden.</b> They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In legal system, {{there are}} mainly two kinds <b>of</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> proof; {{one is a}} <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> persuasion {{and the other is}} a <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> produc-tion. These <b>burdens</b> have usually been formalized by an argumentation between a plaintiff/prosecutor and a defendant. In the {{previous}} work, we formalized a <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> persuasion from a different point of view; a decision making by a judge. If a <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> persuasion is not fulfilled, a judge will make a decision which is not favorable to the party having the burden. And as by-product, both parties are trying to fulfill their <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> persuasion. In this paper, we follow this idea in order to for-malize a <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production as well. We introduce a new predicate which a judge uses in order to check whether a party with the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production raised the issues and provided an enough evidence during the proceedings. ...|$|R

40|$|Courts have {{traditionally}} assigned <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> pleading and <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> proof by mechanically applying {{any of a}} number of meaningless 2 ̆ 2 tests. 2 ̆ 2 Conventional doctrine assigns these burdens to the party to whose case the issue in question is 2 ̆ 2 essential, 2 ̆ 2 or to the party who must establish the 2 ̆ 2 affirmative proposition. 2 ̆ 2 Neither of these tests provides a coherent methodology for making such allocations. The first is circular-an issue is 2 ̆ 2 essential 2 ̆ 2 by virtue {{of the fact that the}} party has been assigned the burden. The latter is unworkable; it depends on accidents of syntax and may be easily manipulated. This Article attempts to fill this analytical void by employing economic analysis to provide a framework for allocating <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> pleading and proof. The Article analyzes procedural rules on <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> pleading and <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> proof under a framework of cost minimization; the goal is to explain the law 2 ̆ 7 s allocations <b>of</b> <b>burdens</b> as attempts to minimize social costs. Part I introduces the economic framework to be employed throughout the Article. Part II utilizes the model to derive some economic justifications for the basic system ofpleading under current law; it offers a rationale for the default rule that assigns the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> pleading on most issues to plaintiffs and suggests two theories for the law 2 ̆ 7 s deviations from the default rule (i. e., affirmative defenses). Part III follows the same pattern in the context <b>of</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> proof-it first makes the economic case for thedefault rule and then outlines several economic justifications for affirmative defenses. Both sections illustrate the economic theory with specific applications under current law. Part IV sharpens the distinction between the different economic functions performed by <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> pleading and <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> proof by analyzing two areas in which the law has departed from the traditional rule that the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof follows the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> pleading. Finally, Part V attempts to synthesize the analysis developed throughout theArticle by returning to the issue of 2 ̆ 2 business necessity 2 ̆ 2 and applying the economic model to the decision of where to allocate the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> pleading and <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in Title VII disparate impact claims...|$|R
