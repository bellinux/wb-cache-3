40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{analysis}} of experimental data on measuring metal density under plastic de-formation, an adaptive model of damage accumulation, which {{takes into account the}} transient pro-cesses of damage variation with changes in loading conditions, has been formulated. The analysis of damage in the process <b>of</b> cold <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> <b>of</b> a lid-type <b>steel</b> blank being taken as an ex-ample, the applicability of the model to the prediction of fracture in the optimization of industrial metal forming technologies has been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{upper bound}} element {{technique}} (UBET) {{is used to}} determine the optimum intermediate shape for profile ring rolling using backward simulation. The lowest energy rate is the key issue in achieving the optimal intermediate shape as well as the backward simulation of the process. The plastic flow of material in ring rolling is assumed to be a sequence <b>of</b> successive <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> processes. The ring is divided into features, which provide an approximated profile consisting of a number of rectangular elements. The simulation of the profile ring rolling was tested with different profiles of rolls, and two such cases are presented here. The present method was validated using an experimental radial ring rolling mill designed and fabricated in the Dept. of Mechanical Engineering at Ohio University for the investigation of both cold and hot ring rolling processes. As the results show, this technique is capable of solving the backward simulation of profile ring rolling problems in a much shorter time compared to the finite element method (FEM). This approach can be applied effectively to the profile ring rolling process and can serve as a useful tool in industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{predict the}} minimum value of {{additional}} material volume for an acceptable preform product. To predict an acceptable preform product without shape defect such as unfilling in a <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> operation. Design/methodology/approach: In {{order to reduce the}} number of experiments, an orthogonal array from the Taguchi’s experimental method will be utilized to design the process parameter combinations for database sets to promote the prediction precision. Also, in order {{to reduce the number of}} experiments to get the minimum additional material volume of preform, the abductive network is applied to synthesize the data sets obtained from the numerical simulation. Findings: The minimum additional material volume can be determined as 7. 6 % for an acceptable preform product in conjunction with the billet settle position, E, of 11. 8 mm and the aspect ratio of width to height, B/H, of 1. 4. Research limitations/implications: The Taguchi method can be used to narrow the ranges of process parameters for database sets which can promote the precision of abductive network to search for the the minimum additional material volume for an acceptable preform product. The abductive network is applied to synthesize the data sets obtained from the numerical simulation of the reduced ranges of the process parameters. Practical implications: The combination of the abductive network and Taguchi method can be used as a reference and guidance for the development of searching the minimum or maximum value of one of the process parameters, accompanying by the other suitable parameters. Originality/value: An assessment model <b>of</b> the <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> process is developed using a neural network system and Taguchi method. Based on the developed neural network, the additional material volume of preform product, one of the forging process parameters can be minimum accompanying by the other suitable process parameters to get an acceptable product...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{multi-stage}} forming process of a sling shackle, investigated {{with the use of}} finite element simulation. Used as a lifting connector during Floating Production Unit assembly and provision of supplies for petroleum platforms, Wide Body (WB) shackles endure severe working conditions in hostile environment. Providing high level of strength and toughness as well as outstanding fatigue behavior, hot forming {{is one of the main}} production method of shackles. Aiming towards process improvement and stronger shackles development, the main purpose of this study is, with the help of numerical simulation, to understand, predict and control all aspects that can be involved in the manufacturing of a WB 125 tons shackle. In close collaboration with forging industry Le Béon Manufacturing in Lorient area, forging experiments were carried out on a 0. 3 MJ friction drive screw press and at temperatures higher than 900 °C. In order to form both jaws, two successive sequences <b>of</b> <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> and deflashing are performed. It follows an open-die forging stage to form the body. Finally, the crown is obtained using a ram bending process. The numerical model presented herein is developed using a fully coupled 3 D thermomechanical analysis and is conducted on Abaqus software. Tools are made of AISI H 13 with constant thermophysical properties. Mechanical properties of the 34 CrNiMo 6 used for the workpiece at temperatures ranging from 900 to 1200 °C and strain rates ranging from 0. 1 to 1 /s were extracted from the literature. To describe the compression behavior, the Johnson-Cook flow stress model has been used. Temperatures, duration and kinematic movements have been recorded over the production of 80 shackles, and forging loads were evaluated by instrumenting strain gauges directly on the mechanical press. A particular methodology has been developed to perform successively the numerical simulation of the various forming operations with a unique workpiece. It combines a sequence of Abaqus/Implicit-HT, Abaqus/Dynamic-Explicit and Abaqus/Static-Implicit. In all simulations, convective and radiative cooling is taken into account and heat transfer between the tools and the workpiece is considered. As in the industrial process, workpiece stability and forging accuracy are obtained with the use of a manipulator modeled as an analytical rigid surface and a combination of springs to account for the recoil and shock absorption. A remeshing method has also been developed to thwart excessive distortion in the flash and the body...|$|R

The two-step forming technology is presented. First, the billet is pre-forged by <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> for getting most of tooth profile. Second, the gear is finish-forging by local loading. The finite element method is used to simulate the cold forging process.

40|$|With many {{innovations}} in process technology, forging is establishing {{itself as a}} precision manufacturing process: as forging is used to produce complex shapes in difficult materials, it requires dies of complex configuration of high strength and of wear-resistant materials. Extensive research and development work is being undertaken, internationally, to analyse the stresses in forging dies and the flow of material in forged components. Identification of the location, {{size and shape of}} dead-metal zones is required for component design. Further, knowledge of the strain distribution in the flowing metal indicates {{the degree to which the}} component is being work hardened. Such information is helpful in the selection of process parameters such as dimensional allowances and interface lubrication, as well as in the determination of post-forging operations such as heat treatment and machining. In the presently reported work the effect of aperture width and initial specimen height on the strain distribution in the plane-strain extrusion forging of machined lead billets is observed: the distortion of grids inscribed on the face of the specimen gives the strain distribution. The stress-equilibrium approach is used to optimise a model of flow in extrusion forging, which model is found to be effective in estimating the size of the dead-metal zone. The work carried out so far indicates that the methodology of using the stress-equilibrium approach to develop models <b>of</b> flow in <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> can be a useful tool in component, process and die design...|$|R

The forgings are made using either ferrous metals or nonferrous metals. However, Carlton utilizes mainly nonferrous metals.

40|$|A {{slip line}} field is {{proposed}} for symmetrical single‐cavity <b>closed‐die</b> <b>forging</b> by rough dies. A compatible velocity field {{is shown to}} exist.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of forging design is to ensure cavity filling with minimum {{material}} wastage, minimum die load and minimum deformation energy. Given the desired shape of the component and the material to be forged, this goal is achieved by optimising the initial volume of the billet, the geometrical parameters of the die and the process parameters. It is general industrial practise to fix the initial billet volume and the die parameters using empirical relationships derived from practical experience. In this paper a basis for optimising some of the parameters for simple <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> is proposed. Slip-line field solutions are used to predict the flow, the load and the energy in a simple two-dimensional <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> operation. The influence of the design parameters; flash-land width, excess initial workpiece area and forged cross-sectional size; on complete cavity filling and efficient cavity filling are investigated. Using the latter as necessary requirements for forging, the levels of permissable design parameters are determined, the variation of these levels {{with the size of}} the cross-section then being examined...|$|R

25|$|To {{overcome}} some {{shortcomings of}} the drop-hammer, the counterblow machine or impactor is used. In a counterblow machine both the hammer and anvil move and the workpiece is held between them. Here excess energy becomes recoil. This allows the machine to work horizontally and have a smaller base. Other advantages include less noise, heat and vibration. It also produces a distinctly different flow pattern. Both of these machines {{can be used for}} open-die or <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging.</b>|$|R

50|$|One {{variation}} of impression-die forging is called flashless <b>forging,</b> or true <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging.</b> In {{this type of}} forging the die cavities are completely closed, which keeps the workpiece from forming flash. The major advantage to this process is that less metal is lost to flash. Flash can account for 20 to 45% of the starting material. The disadvantages of this process included: additional cost due to a more complex die design, the need for better lubrication, and better workpiece placement.|$|R

However, it has low recurring costs for each part, thus forgings become more economical with more volume. This {{is one of the major}} reasons closed-die forgings are often used in the automotive and tool industries. Another reason forgings are common in these industrial sectors is that forgings generally have about a 20 percent higher strength-to-weight ratio compared to cast or machined parts of the same material.|$|R
