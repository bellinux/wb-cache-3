Here, F_X is the field of rational functions on X, and K(·) is the K-theory spectrum. We prove a "reciprocity law" for these symbols: Given a partial flag, {{the sum of all}} symbols of full flags refining it is 0. Examining this result on the level of K-groups, we re-obtain various "reciprocity laws". Namely, when X is a smooth complete curve, we <b>obtain</b> <b>degree</b> of a principal divisor is zero, Weil reciprocity, Residue theorem, Contou-Carrère reciprocity. When X is higher-dimensional, we obtain Parshin reciprocity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{starts a}} {{systematic}} study of capacityachieving sequences of low-density parity-check codes for the erasure channel. We introduce a class A of analytic functions {{and develop a}} procedure to <b>obtain</b> <b>degree</b> distributions for the codes. We show various properties of this class which will help us to construct new distributions from old ones. We then study certain types of capacity-achieving sequences and introduce new measures for their optimality. For instance, {{it turns out that}} the right-regular sequence is capacity-achieving in a much stronger sense than, e. g., the Tornado sequence. This also explains why numerical optimization techniques tend to favor graphs with only one degree of check nodes. Index Terms—Erasure channel, low-density parity-check codes, sparse graphs. I...|$|E

Using our methods, we attack the problem of reducing the fraction of degree 2 variable nodes, which has important practical implications. It turns out that one can produce capacity achieving sequences for which this fraction remains below any constant, albeit at the price of slower convergence to capacity...|$|E

40|$|The {{path that}} nurse {{education}} in the UK has taken since it moved into the higher education (HE) system in the early 1990 s has been directly influenced, not only by Department of Health policy, but also by changes {{to the way in}} which HE is structured and managed. The White Paper Higher Education: Students at the Heart of the System (Department for Business Innovation and Skills, 2011 a) outlined the coalition Government’s plans to encourage better standards of teaching in HE and greater responsiveness to student experience. The reforms promote competition and contestability between HE institutions to attract students and recommend removing barriers for new providers to enter the market. The decision to introduce a strong business model for HE has a number of implications for nurse education, both in the way that it is delivered and how student nurses are positioned among their peers. There is a potential conflict of interest between the student as a source of income for the HE institution and the student nurse as a member of a professional organization dedicated to ensuring the safety of the public. The decision to make it easier for alternative providers to <b>obtain</b> <b>degree</b> awarding powers could also encourage providers to take greater ownership of healthcare qualifications in the future...|$|E

For segmentation the K-Means algorithm is used and for simplicity only two clusters are segmented. Segmentation result will clearly show that the accuracy of the in-paint and multi-temporal approaches. From the result it is evident that the multi-temporal approach produces a better result when compared to the in-painting.

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] cornerstone of nodal spectral-element methods is the co-location of the interpolation and integration points, yielding a diagonal mass matrix that is efficient for time-integration. On quadrilateral elements, Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto points are both good interpolation and integration points; on triangles, analogous points {{have not yet}} been found. In this paper, a promising set of points for the triangle that were only available for polynomial degree N <= 5 are used. However, the derivation of these points is generalized to <b>obtain</b> <b>degree</b> N <= 7 points, which are referred to as cubature points because their selection is based on their integration accuracy. The diagonal-mass-matrix (DMM) triangular-spectral-element (TSE) method based on these points can be used for any set of equations and any type of domain. Because these cubature points integrate up to order 2 N along the element boundaries and yield a diagonal mass matrix, they allow the triangular spectral elements to compete with quadrilateral spectral elements in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, while offering more geometric flexibility in the choice of grids. It is shown how to implement this DMM TSE for a variety of applications involving elliptic and hyperbolic equations on different domains. The DMM TSE method yields comparable accuracy to the exact integration (non-DMM) TSE method, while being far more efficient for time-dependent problems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Though Engagement Theory is {{a result}} of {{long-range}} educational practice, it is also applicable to our university literary education because current students are inclined to network association instead of reality. Engagement Theory emphasizes cooperation, creativity and contribution, which can settle network crisis around universities and have enormous advantages in the literary aesthetic education. When we apply the theory, it should be made scientific, effective and humane. Index Terms—Engagement Theory, literature class, education, cooperation Present university students have tremendous difference with traditional university student. They attach importance to utility value and ignore quality. They study for the material gain but not for humanism. A lot of students study hardy in order to take the credit, deal with the examination, <b>obtain</b> <b>degree,</b> and even graduate students seldom think over making any knowledge. As is even more relevant, present university structure of education are more utilitarian. Humane quality course have been generally compressed at the lessons. The contradiction between being expanded content of courses and reducing lessons day by day is very sharp. Meanwhile, many people point out that students need strengthen humane quality urgently in the situation that market economy is highly praised. In humane quality courses of university, literary aesthetical education has a very important role. Lu Jingchao once mentioned that BaJin told her daughter that the literature masterpiece could educate us, encourage us, and make us become better, more pure, more kindhearted, mor...|$|E
