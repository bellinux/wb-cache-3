5|$|The other {{divisions}} {{remaining in}} India at first <b>on</b> <b>internal</b> security {{and then as}} training divisions were the 5th (Mhow) Division, the 8th (Lucknow) Division and the 9th (Secunderabad) Division.

5|$|The tariff levels {{had been}} a major {{political}} issue since before the Civil War, and they became the most dominant matter of the 1888 election. The high tariff rates had created a surplus {{of money in the}} Treasury, which led many Democrats (as well as the growing Populist movement) to call for lowering them. Most Republicans preferred to maintain the rates, spend the surplus <b>on</b> <b>internal</b> improvements and eliminate some internal taxes.|$|E
5|$|Fakih {{was made}} the Minister of Religious Affairs in the Wilopo Cabinet and sworn in on 3 April 1952, {{which led to}} him and his family moving to the capital at Jakarta. He began to work on {{reforming}} the ministry, including formalising its mission statement: to provide religious teachers, promote interfaith relations, and to establish the dates of religious holidays. He worked <b>on</b> <b>internal</b> structure, including formalising the ministry's leadership hierarchy and the opening of the provincial and regional branches. The ministry also continued its promotion of religious education and was tasked with handling the numerous Indonesian pilgrims who went on the hajj. The Wilopo Cabinet collapsed on 30 July 1953, following an immigration and land dispute in Medan. Fakih was replaced by Masjkur.|$|E
5|$|From 1951 to 1953, Uanna was {{the special}} {{assistant}} to the Secretary of Commerce as Chief of the Facilities Protection Board, and was a staff member of the Industrial Evaluations Board. These boards were overseen by the Interdepartmental Committee <b>on</b> <b>Internal</b> Security (ICIS) and the National Security Resources Board (NSRB). The NSRB was charged with developing security programs for industry and several were developed jointly with representatives from the power, transportation, explosives, petroleum, and communications industries. Since he was directly responsible to the Secretary of Commerce, after the Republican Administration took office in 1953, Uanna found himself without a job.|$|E

5|$|Governor Crittenden {{resigned}} on July 31, 1850 {{to accept}} President Millard Fillmore's appointment as attorney general, and Helm ascended to the governorship. As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits {{in the public}} school fund by drawing money from the state's sinking fund, but the General Assembly overrode the veto. He urged the legislature to fund a survey of the state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. He called for spending <b>on</b> <b>internal</b> improvements and for raising judges' salaries to attract more qualified jurists to the bench. He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The legislature did not act on any of these proposed reforms. The only part of Helm's agenda that did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.|$|E
5|$|IABC's {{predecessor}} was the American Association of Industrial Editors (AAIE), {{which was}} founded in 1938.

In IABC's first year of operation, the association had 2,280 members and was focused <b>on</b> <b>internal</b> communications. IABC's research showed its members were moving into positions with broader public relations responsibilities and the association expanded its scope. In 1974 it merged with Corporate Communicators Canada.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, bite {{marks on}} two fragmentary gastralia of the holotype {{specimen}} {{of the large}} ornithomimosaur Deinocheirus mirificus were reported. The {{size and shape of}} the bite marks match the teeth of Tarbosaurus, the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation. Various types of feeding traces were identified; punctures, gouges, striae, fragmentary teeth, and combinations of the above marks. The bite marks probably represent feeding behavior instead of aggression between the species, and the fact that bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused <b>on</b> <b>internal</b> organs. Tarbosaurus bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite marks on bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.|$|E

5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending <b>on</b> <b>internal</b> improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow senators to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision that the president could suspend the right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of a dictator. He also opposed the appropriation of federal money to fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{because he did not}} believe Congress was given the authority to make such an allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Kenya Airways was {{established}} by the Kenyan government on , following the break-up of the East African Community and the consequent demise of East African Airways (EAA). On , two Boeing 707–321s leased from British Midland Airways inaugurated operations, serving the Nairobi–Frankfurt–London route. <b>On</b> <b>internal</b> and regional flights, the carrier deployed aircraft formerly operated by the EAA consortium, such as one Douglas DC-9-52 and three Fokker F-27-200s. In late 1977, three Boeing 707s were acquired from Northwest Orient. The following year, the company formed a charter subsidiary named Kenya Flamingo Airlines, which leased aircraft from the parent airline in order to operate international passenger and cargo services. Aer Lingus provided the company with technical and management support in the early years.|$|E

5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} {{lives on}} muddy and sandy bottoms, grazing on algae and detritus. It is gonochoristic and sexually dimorphic, depending <b>on</b> <b>internal</b> fertilization for spawning. Larvae {{of this species}} spend several days as plankton, undergoing a series of transformations until they reach complete metamorphosis. The maximum life span is 2 to 2.5 years. Predators of this snail include carnivorous gastropods such as cone snails and volutes. It is also a prey species for vertebrates including macaques, and also humans, who consume the soft parts {{in a wide variety}} of dishes.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} shown that the current species concept for H.repandum may need {{revision}} as there is a poor overlap between morphological and molecular species concepts. Phylogenetic analysis of European specimens, based <b>on</b> <b>internal</b> transcribed spacer and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicates that H.repandum specimens form two distinct clades, whose only consistent morphological distinction is cap size. These genetic differences may indicate the presence of undescribed cryptic species, and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive speciation.|$|E
5|$|People {{displaced}} by the 2010 earthquake are at {{an increased risk of}} sex trafficking and forced labor. The international protections in place for the internally displaced, primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Guiding Principles <b>on</b> <b>Internal</b> Displacement, do not apply to earthquake survivors who have crossed an international border. There is nothing protecting the externally displaced, which creates significant protection gaps for those most vulnerable to trafficking—girls and young women—who are treated as migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection. No temporary protected status has been created or granted in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
