5|$|In 1846, a {{dysentery}} epidemic swept communities {{along the}} Assiniboine River in Manitoba. On June 22 of that year, Belcourt left his mission at Baie-Saint-Paul {{to join a}} group <b>of</b> <b>hunters</b> on their journey south for the summer. The hunters carried the disease, infecting others, and 25 people died of dysentery by July 5. On the worst days, eight people had to be buried. Belcourt and six of the hunters travelled south to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in search of medicine, as the priest's supply had quickly run out. With his medicine supplies replenished, the missionary {{headed back to the}} encampment <b>of</b> <b>hunters</b> before returning to his mission.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, Chile {{completed}} the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>Hunters</b> from Britain for {{service in the}} Chilean Air Force. In June 1973, the Liberian oil tanker Napier ran aground on Guamblin Island, accidentally releasing 30,000 tons of oil. After the rescue of the crew, the vessel was fired upon and set on fire by Chilean Hunters {{in an effort to}} burn the oil to avoid further environmental contamination.|$|E

Mithra possess high dexterity and agility, but lower HP and charisma. Mithra are cursed with envy.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{were known}} to the native people of Sumatra and Borneo for millennia. While some {{communities}} hunted them for food and decoration, others placed taboos on such practices.

5|$|At the morgue, Scully {{explains}} that {{she studied the}} bite wounds and discovered that they are similar, but intrinsically different, than human bites; the saliva on the regurgitated fingers has anti-coagulants in it, which only bats have in their saliva. Doggett finds the evidence interesting, due to the newspaper article he brought Scully: in 1956, a series of deaths was reported that ended when a group <b>of</b> <b>hunters</b> killed a man-bat creature {{and brought it to}} the county morgue in part of Montana. The coroner said the creature was neither bat nor man. Then the coroner was killed a few days later and soon after a few more people were killed or disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{unfavourable}} currency {{conditions and}} conflicting {{pressures on the}} military budget, several prospective procurements of modern aircraft such as the SEPECAT Jaguar and the British Aerospace Sea Harrier were put on hold following the 1971 war; the indigenously developed HAL HF-24 Marut had also not been as successful as hoped, thus the IAF decided to retain the ageing fleets <b>of</b> <b>Hunters</b> and English Electric Canberra bombers. After considering several foreign aircraft to replace the Hunter, including the Dassault Mirage F1, the Saab 37 Viggen, and several Soviet models, the Indian government announced its intention to procure 200 Jaguars, {{a large portion of}} which were to be assembled domestically, in October 1978. In 1996, the last of the IAF's Hunters were phased out of service, the remaining single squadron operating the Hunter converting to the newer Sukhoi Su-30MKI.|$|E
5|$|Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter) are two {{brothers}} that Ellie and Joel encounter {{while trying to}} escape from a group <b>of</b> <b>hunters</b> in Pittsburgh. Henry is 25 years old, while Sam is thirteen. Joel and Henry initially think each other are hostile, until they see Sam and Ellie, respectively. Like Joel, Henry is an experienced survivor, and the two decide to team up, since both pairs {{are looking for the}} Fireflies. They work together to overpower the bandits guarding the exit to the Quarantine Zone, and escape to an abandoned radio tower in the Suburbs. There, Joel and Henry bond over their mutual love of motorbikes, but Sam becomes morose and introverted, particularly after a conversation with Ellie over death and the Infected. The next day, it emerges that Sam was bitten while escaping the Suburbs, and he attacks Ellie, forcing Henry to kill him. Overcome with grief and guilt at his brother's death, Henry commits suicide with his gun.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have been}} hunting mammals in Asia {{for at least}} 40,000years, but until recently, slow lorises were only hunted at a {{sustainable}} level. However, hunting pressure since the 1960s has become increasingly unsustainable, leading to overexploitation, because of growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife. In 1985, large wildlife markets {{began to appear in}} Phnom Penh and Sen Monorom, Cambodia, followed quickly by the development of networks <b>of</b> <b>hunters,</b> traders, and middlemen. Bright flashlights make spotting slow lorises much easier at night because of their eye shine, and in the 1990s, large-scale commercial harvesting of slow lorises began as improved batteries for spotlights became available.|$|E

5|$|IAF Hunters {{performed}} extensive operations {{during the}} Indo-Pakistani War of 1971; India had six combat-ready squadrons <b>of</b> <b>Hunters</b> {{at the start}} of the conflict. Pakistani infantry and armoured forces attacked the Indian outpost of Longewala in an event now known as the Battle of Longewala. Six IAF Hunters stationed at Jaisalmer Air Force Base were able to halt the Pakistani advance at Longewala by conducting non-stop bombing raids. The aircraft attacked Pakistani tanks, armoured personnel carriers and gun positions and contributed to the increasingly chaotic battlefield conditions, which ultimately led to the retreat of Pakistan's ground forces. Hunters were also used for many ground-attack missions and raids inside Pakistan's borders, such as the high-profile bombing of the Attock Oil refinery to limit Pakistani fuel supplies. In the aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan claimed to have shot down a total of 32 of India's Hunters.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the Swiss Air Force {{performed}} an extensive evaluation of several aircraft for a prospective purchase; competitors included the North American F-86 Sabre, the Folland Gnat, and the Hawker Hunter; a pair <b>of</b> <b>Hunters</b> were loaned to the Swiss for further trials and testing. In January 1958, {{the government of}} Switzerland chose to terminate their independent fighter aircraft project, the in-development FFA P-16, instead choosing to order 100 Hunters to replace their existing fleet of de Havilland Vampire fighters. Further development of the indigenous P-16 was discontinued. This initial order for 100 single-seat Hunters consisted of 12 refurbished RAF F.6s, and 88 new-built F.58s.|$|E
5|$|Initially the Order was a knightly brotherhood (Rittersbruderschaft), {{reflecting}} the overlapping religious and military aspects of medieval court life. Saint Hubert was {{the patron saint}} <b>of</b> <b>hunters</b> and knights. The founding of the Order of the Golden Fleece in the early 15th century started a trend in confraternal princely orders. The purpose of these, whether established by monarchs or princes, was to foster loyalty to a sovereign, replacing to the old Chivalric orders developed in the Crusades. Although some historians classify the Order of the Saint Hubert as a confraternal order, during its 600-year-life, its purpose changed as the fortunes {{and needs of the}} Dukes of JÃ¼lich and Berg and their successors changed.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} three volumes concern {{themselves with the}} battle for a third ring, which has been embedded for years {{in the body of}} a comatose young man named Emilio Lufas Getto. Gamma and company learn of Emilio's existence from his sister Wolfina, a tabloid photojournalist and vigilante who does not believe in the Rings of the Dead. The group <b>of</b> <b>hunters</b> offer to restore Emilio to consciousness in exchange for the ring he contains. Before they can do so, however, Emilio is kidnapped by Balmunk the Mystic, a powder hunting magician who leads a circus-themed gang. Wolfina teams up with Elwood, Gamma, and Smith to retrieve Emilio, and they succeed in doing so after a number of battles with Balmunk's henchmen. The conflict culminates in a fight between Gamma and a giant golem summoned by Balmunk, which Gamma defeats {{with the help of a}} berserk state. Balmunk is beaten but not killed, and departs, swearing revenge upon Gamma.|$|E
5|$|David (Nolan North) is {{the leader}} of a group of cannibals that Ellie runs into at the Lakeside Resort where she is {{sheltering}} Joel while he recovers from a grievous wound. Initially, Ellie runs into him and a fellow hunter after killing a deer, and he offers to trade the deer for some penicillin for Joel. After he and Ellie are forced to fend off a swarm of infected, David reveals that he is actually the leader of the gang <b>of</b> <b>hunters</b> that Ellie and Joel had killed previously at the University of Eastern Colorado, when Joel was injured. He allows Ellie to get away, but later tracks her down and kidnaps her, taking her to his base in the town. There, Ellie discovers that David's gang are cannibals. She resists their attempts, manages to kill his assistant and flees into the town, while David and his gang stalk her. David eventually corners her in a restaurant, and stalks her for several minutes, as it burns down. Eventually, he manages to pin her down and tries to strangle her, but she catches hold of his machete and swings it, knocking him off her, and brutally hacks him to death, before Joel arrives and pulls her off.|$|E
5|$|During the 1973 Chilean coup d'Ã©tat, {{some of the}} Hunters {{were used}} by {{military}} officers {{as part of the}} effort to successfully overthrow the socialist president of Chile, Salvador Allende, on 11 September 1973. On 10 September 1973, coup leaders ordered the Hunters to relocate to Talcahuano in preparation. The following morning, the aircraft were used to conduct bombing missions against the presidential palace, Allende's house in Santiago, and several radio stations loyal to the government. The UK had signed contracts prior to the Chilean coup d'Ã©tat for delivery of a further seven Hunters, as well as performing engine overhauls and the delivery of other equipment. The government under Prime Minister James Callaghan delayed the delivery of the aircraft, along with vessels and submarines also on order; the trade unions took action to block delivery of refurbished Hunter engines at the East Kilbride plant until October 1978. The action was led by Rolls Royce workers, Bob Fulton, Robert Sommerville and John Keenan, who hid the engines in the factory. The Government of Chile bestowed on 16 April 2015, its highest civilian medal the Order Bernardo O'Higgins Medal on the three workers for their action of solidarity. In 1982, after the Falklands War, a number <b>of</b> <b>Hunters</b> were air freighted to Chile as part of the arrangements for providing support for UK operations in the South Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|In 1216, after {{requesting}} Muhammad II of Khwarazm not to aid Kuchlug, Genghis Khan dispatched general Jebe {{with two}} tumens (20,000 soldiers) {{to deal with}} the Qara Khitai threat, while sending Subutai with another two tumens on a simultaneous campaign against the Merkits. The two armies traveled alongside each other through the Altai and Tarbagatai Mountains until arriving at Almaliq. At that point, Subutai turned southwest, destroying the Merkits and protecting Jebe's flank against any sudden attacks from Khwarazm. Jebe relieved Almaliq, then moved south of Lake Balkash into the lands of the Qara Khitai, where he besieged the capital of Balasagun. There, Jebe defeated an army of 30,000 troops and Kuchlug fled to Kashgar. Taking advantage of the unrest fomenting under Kuchlug's rule, Jebe gained support from the Muslim populace by announcing that Kuchlug's policy of religious persecution had ended. When Jebe's army arrived at Kashgar in 1217, the populace revolted and turned on Kuchlug, forcing him to flee for his life. Jebe pursued Kuchlug across the Pamir Mountains into Badakhshan in modern Afghanistan. According to Ata-Malik Juvayni, a group <b>of</b> <b>hunters</b> caught Kuchlug and handed him over to the Mongols, who promptly beheaded him.|$|E
5|$|Prior to release, {{the game}} had been playtested {{multiple}} {{times by the}} general public. An alpha version of Evolve, called the 'Big Alpha' was released for Xbox One on October 31, 2014, The alpha version of Evolve was originally set to be released for the PlayStation 4 a day later on October 31, 2014, but was delayed to November 3, 2014 due to technical issues related to PS4's firmware update. As compensation, {{the duration of the}} demo was extended by a day, and ended on November 4, 2014 for all platforms. Players can play as the four classes <b>of</b> <b>Hunters</b> as well as the Goliath and Kraken in the alpha version. Turtle Rock expected 100,000 people to participate in the alpha. The team hoped that through the alpha testing, they could test the functionality of the game's servers, and make adjustments to the game's balance. Open beta trials of Evolve on Xbox One were held January 14â€“19, 2015. A limited test for the PlayStation 4 and PC was held January 16â€“19, 2015. Players could play as the first eight Hunters as well as the Goliath and Kraken in the beta. The Evacuation mode was also added to the beta on January 17, 2015.|$|E
5|$|With steam, mass-produced steel plate, and {{exploding}} shells, European gunships {{permitted the}} New Imperialism of the 19th century, forcing open access to Africa, China, Korea, and Japan for their merchants on favorable terms. Although internal politics hampered Chinese modernization, American naval power produced a major reform in Japan which bore fruit during the 1905 Battle of Tsushima when the Japanese {{were able to}} decisively defeat Russia. The great navies initially focused their efforts on constructing great dreadnoughts and battleships, but these fought inconclusively in the First World War. By contrast, the much cheaper German U-boats showed that submarines could cripple shipping even in waters nominally controlled by the enemy. Convoys, intelligence, and airborne ASW won a hard-fought victory in the Second World War's Battle of the Atlantic, but developments in applied physics meant that by the 1960s nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines were being maintained on constant patrol as a second-strike force along with a second set <b>of</b> <b>hunters</b> intended to counter them. Meanwhile, the battles of the Mediterranean and Pacific theaters of the war had shown that air power was capable of overcoming the strongest warships.|$|E
