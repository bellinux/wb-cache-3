40|$|Difficulty with {{recall of}} {{injuries}} {{can result in}} underestimates of injury incidence and bias in risk estimates in surveys based on self-reports. This study examined the effect of recall on estimates of at-work injury obtained from the 1988 Occupational Health Supplement of the National Health Interview Survey, which used a 12 -month reference period for injury reporting. Estimates of annual injury incidence were <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>recall</b> intervals of increasing time between injury date and interview date. A linear model was fitted to these data to estimate the incidence rate expected if all respondents had been interviewed within 4 weeks of injury. The incidence rate for all at-work injuries adjusted for recall was 32 {{percent higher than the}} unadjusted rate. The percent increase in the estimates differed among demographic groups and by injury severity. Rate ratios comparing risk of injury between some demographic groups were also affected by adjustment for recall. A 12 -month or longer reference period is frequently used in injury surveys in order to obtain an adequate number of injuries for analysis. A shorter reference period is desirable to provide more accurate estimates; however this necessitates increasing the size of the sample used in the survey. This increased cost must be balanced against the need for accurate information on injury...|$|E

Within the ASA 24 software, respondents {{may choose to}} enter open-ended text to report “unfound food” and “other, specify. ” Respondents use the“unfound food” field to report a food or drink they cannot find; the ASA 24 system then asks a series of general questions to better identify the food. Respondents use the “other, specify” field to provide food details, such as brand name or cooking method, that differ from the responses offered by ASA 24. When respondents use these two open-ended text fields, the system assigns default food codes. Nutritionists reviewed these codes and assigned new codes when appropriate. Nutrient and My Pyramid Equivalent (MPE) values from default food codes (unedited) andthe researcher assigned food codes (edited) were compared. Of the 716 food codes evaluated, changes were made to 248 foods (1. 5 % of total foods reported) which affected 194 (19. 1 %) of all recalls and required over 60 hours of specialized staff time. Although 43 % of the 1013 completed recalls included {{at least one of}} the two text field responses, the ASA 24 systemassigned acceptable default food codes 68 % of the time. Editing did not significantly affect the means and ranking for most nutrients and food group MPE values; correlation coefficients for energy and macronutrient values before and after editing were 0. 95 or higher, suggesting that this editingmaynot be necessary for most large studies using ASA 24...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionPatient recall {{is often}} used by clinicians to create a history of care leading to {{consultation}} with a gynecologic oncologist. Although patient recall may be an efficient method to explore {{the context of the}} patient's concerns, the accuracy of recall and its potential impact on care are unknown. This study sought to explore the consistency of patient recall compared with data found in health care records. Patients and MethodsThis study enrolled 105 eligible patients who were referred to a gynecologic oncologist for suspected ovarian cancer. Ninety-one of these patients were interviewed regarding symptoms, health care events, and the dates leading to diagnosis. The medical records of these patients from all previous providers were obtained and data were abstracted. The intraclass correlation coefficient (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC[3, 1]) was used to examine correspondence between recall and medical record data. ResultsThere was low correspondence between patient recall and the medical record for time to diagnosis (ICC = 0. 12; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = − 0. 09 to 0. 33; P =. 12) and health care events (0. 15; 95 % CI, − 0. 05 to 0. 348; P =. 008).

However, environmental implications of dietary choices have not been previously studied in Canada. Given geographic variations of eating habits and environmental impacts, this study aims to explore current dietary patterns and their environmental implications in Ontario. This exploratory study assesses {{the environmental impact of}} seven dietary patterns and investigates the role of nutrition and dietary guidelines in evaluating sustainability of diets. Food baskets representing each dietary pattern were formed based on data <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> dietary <b>recall</b> survey. Using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), greenhouse gas emissions were estimated for farm operations, processing, distribution and household processes associated with current food consumption. Canada’s dietary guidelines were used to assess the nutritional quality of current diets and propose nutritionally optimal dietary changes. Results showed that Ontario population overconsumes protein. Popular dietary patterns including foods rich in animal protein exhibit the highest impact. This interdisciplinary approach helps combine nutritional and environmental research which can facilitate the formulation of environmentally friendly, healthy and socially acceptable diets. The study outlines key limitations in diet-related LCA, provides recommendations for improvement and serves as a primer for further diet-related research in Canada...|$|R

In this study, an indirect approach was used to estimate the exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), respiratory dust (PM 10) and carbon monoxide (CO) pollutants experienced by different age groups of people in Hong Kong. The average concentrations of the 20 major microenvironments <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> our measurement survey data, together with the people activity pattern data <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> 7 -day <b>recall</b> questionnaires, were used to predict frequency distributions to exposure assessment. Our results showed that Hong Kong people spent more than 86 % of their time indoors. Homes were shown to be the one of the major exposure sites to NO 2, CO and PM 10 for all age groups. Our results also indicate that the 24 -h NO 2 exposure for individuals, irrespective of age, spending more than 2 h in commuting daily, was observed to be exceeding the 24 -h NO 2 exposure standards.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{assessed}} {{the adequacy of}} nutrient intakes of 135 rural Bangladeshi breast-fed infants 6 – 12 mo of age and examined nutritional trade-offs due to possible displacement of breast milk by complementary foods. Observers completed 12 -h daytime measurements of breast milk and complementary food intakes; data for the previous 12 h were <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> maternal <b>recall,</b> yielding estimates of total 24 -h intakes. On average, infants were mildly wasted (mean SD weight-for-length Z-score 0. 92 0. 88) and moderately stunted (length-for-age Z-score 1. 49 0. 96). Total energy intakes at 6 – 8 and 9 – 12 mo were 88 and 86 % of absolute energy requirements (kJ/d), 106 and 105 % of requirements per kg body weight, and 97 and 94 % of requirements per kg median weight-for-length, respectively. Breast milk contributed 78 % of energy intake at 6 – 8 mo and 75 % at 9 – 12 mo. Mean meal frequency and energy density of complementary foods were generally consistent with recommen-dations, but only small amounts of food were offered. Nevertheless, only 72 % of the food energy offered was consumed. Total energy intake {{was positively correlated with}} meal frequency, quantity consumed per meal, and energy intake from breast milk, but not with energy density of complementary foods. Energy intake from comple-mentary foods was inversely related to energy intake from breast milk. The diets fell short of recommended intakes for numerous vitamins and minerals. We conclude that although greater intakes of complementary foods were associated with higher total energy intake, micronutrient intake remained low due to the low micronutrient densit...|$|R

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A case-control design was nested within a prospective cohort of healthy pregnant women. Fasting concentrations of serum total FAs (enzymatic assay) and FA composition (gas chromatography–mass spectrometry) were determined at entry and the third trimester. Dietary fat intake data were <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> 24 -h <b>recalls.</b> RESULTS — There was a graded increase among groups (control subjects, impaired GCT non-GDM, and GDM) during the third trimester for total FAs and individual FAs, including myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids (P for trend � 0. 03 to P � 0. 001).

The present study focused on the development of procedures for describing the representation of prose in memory. These procedures were applied {{to the study of the}} relationships that develop among text units as a result of reading expository prose. The development of text representation in memory is seen as an interacting process between prior knowledge and newly encountered information. In order to describe this process, subjects were asked to rate how easy it would be to form sentences using pairs of nouns or propositions from each of four passages. Two groups of subjects rated the nouns or propositions without reading the passages, and two other groups of subjects rated the nouns or propositions after reading each passage. The prior knowledge structures <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> the ratings of the without reading groups were compared to the after reading structures. Nonparametric procedures and multidimensional scaling were used to analyze the rating data. Monte Carlo techniques were used to evaluate the significance of the obtained statistics. The results of the analyses indicated that the prior knowledge structures predicted the after reading structures quite well although some dissimilarities were observed. Additionally, the organization of propositions was found to correspond to an organization based on a preposited theoretical model of prose representation. The theoretical model was tested by relating the obtained ratings to a matrix representing the predicted ordering of propositions. To validate the procedures, free <b>recall</b> data were <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> an additional group of subjects. In general, an agreement was found between structures <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> analyzing the <b>recall</b> data and structures based on the ratings. The free recall data also provided additional evidence for the validity of the theoretical model. It was concluded that relatedness as measured by ratings or by distance in multidimensional space is a reasonably good description of the representation of prose in memory...|$|R

40|$|This study reports {{various types}} of oral {{corrective}} feedback in relation to learner uptake in an English class for young learners. It unfolds types of teacher’s oral corrective feedback and their distribution in classroom interaction and learner uptake following {{the different types of}} oral feedback. This study employed a qualitative research design, embracing the characteristics of a case study. The data were collected by means of approximately 9 hours audio and video recording to capture types of teacher’s oral corrective feedback and learner uptake in the classroom interaction which were then transcribed and coded by using the categorization from Lyster&Ranta (1997) and Ellis (2009). The data were also <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> stimulated <b>recall</b> interview one week after the observation finished. The first finding reveals that the teacher employed seven types of oral corrective feedback: recast, elicitation, clarification request, explicit correction, repetition, metalinguistic feedback, and paralinguistic signal. In this case, the teacher’s choice to give oral corrective feedback was led by three motives: the teacher’s perception of the benefit of correction for language learning, the teacher’s professional concern, and the teacher’s intention to avoid fossilization. It is also revealed that in employing different types of oral corrective feedback, the teacher put several aspects into her consideration such as learners’ proficiency, learners’ types of spoken error, and learning objectives. The distribution of oral corrective feedback in the interaction shows that recast was the most preferred strategy even though it resulted in the least frequency of learners’ uptake. The second finding reveals that the learners responded to the teacher’s oral corrective feedback with uptake or topic continuation. The learner uptake in the form of self-repair, peer-repair, repetition and incorporation were identified as repair while the learner uptake in the form of same error, different error, partial error, hesitation and acknowledgement were identified as need-repair. The distribution of learner uptake following different types of oral corrective feedback shows that elicitation, clarification request, repetition, metalinguistic feedback and paralinguistic signal repair resulted in a higher number of learner uptake comparing to recast and explicit correction. It is also noteworthy that elicitation and repetition led to the highest number of repair. The results imply that the types of oral corrective feedback utilized by the teacher influence the types of learner uptake. In this case, output prompting feedback strategies are more successful in encouraging learner uptake and learner generated repair than input providing feedback strategies.

5000|$|Her {{role as an}} Arian {{is noted}} by Sozomen. [...] "We have now seen what events transpired in the churches {{during the reign of}} Constantine. On his death the {{doctrine}} which had been set forth at Nicaea, was subjected to renewed examination. Although this doctrine was not universally approved, no one, during the life of Constantine, had dared to reject it openly. At his death, however, many renounced this opinion, especially those who had previously been suspected of treachery. Of all these Eusebius and Theognis, bishops of the province of Bithynia, did everything in their power to give predominance to the tenets of Arius. They believed that this object would be easily accomplished, if the return of Athanasius from exile could be prevented, and by giving the government of the Egyptian churches to a bishop of like opinion with them. They found an efficient coadjutor in the presbyter who had <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> Constantine the <b>recall</b> of Arius. He was held in high esteem by the emperor Constantius, on account of the service he had rendered in delivering to him the testament of his father; since he was trusted, he boldly seized the opportunities, until he became an intimate of the emperor’s wife, and of the powerful eunuchs of the women’s sleeping apartments. At this period Eusebius the eunuch, chief chamberlain was appointed to superintend the concerns of the royal household, and being zealously attached to Arianism, he induced the empress and many of the persons belonging to the court to adopt the same sentiments. Hence disputations concerning doctrines again became prevalent, both in private and in public, and revilings and animosities were renewed. This state of things was in accordance with the views of Theognis and his partisans." ...|$|R
