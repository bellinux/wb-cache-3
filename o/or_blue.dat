5|$|A {{total of}} 51 {{proposals}} were submitted {{and added to}} an online poll in July. Two finalist designs were presented to the Provo City Council in September, featuring a stylized mountain against a white <b>or</b> <b>blue</b> field. On January 6, 2015, the Provo City Council unanimously selected the city's new flag, a new design that incorporated the city's new logo (adopted in 2012).|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} very {{sophisticated}} and effective predators of marine mammals. Thirty-two cetacean {{species have been}} recorded as prey, from observing orcas' feeding activity, examining the stomach contents of dead orcas, and seeing scars on the bodies of surviving prey animals. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such as minke whales, gray whales, and rarely sperm whales <b>or</b> <b>blue</b> whales.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Entoloma, the fungus is {{classified}} in the subgenus Leptonia, section Cyanula because of its overall habit, clampless hyphae, and abundant granules of pigment. Noordeloos and Gates place it in the stirps (a grouping of related species within a genus) Austroprunicolor, characterized by mushrooms with a violaceous pink <b>or</b> <b>blue</b> cap that contrasts with a pallid, whitish, polished stipe.|$|E
50|$|Azanus jesous, the African babul <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> topaz-spotted <b>blue,</b> {{is a small}} {{butterfly}} {{found in}} India and Africa that belongs to the lycaenids <b>or</b> <b>blues</b> family.|$|R
50|$|Azanus ubaldus, {{the bright}} babul blue, desert babul <b>blue,</b> <b>or</b> velvet-spotted <b>blue,</b> {{is a small}} {{butterfly}} found in India, the Middle East and Africa that belongs to the lycaenids <b>or</b> <b>blues</b> family.|$|R
50|$|This {{proof is}} still called blue copy, digital blue copy to prototype, <b>or</b> <b>blues</b> plotter.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, he was still running a coven, which was known as Nostos <b>or</b> <b>Blue</b> Circle. He died at his home on September 20, 2001. He was survived by his wife, son, and various grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Cora then {{appointed}} a woman named Anaar, or April Niino, to be the new Grandmaster of the Feri tradition in summer 2003. The tradition itself survived, with various publications appearing that discussed the practice of magic from a Feri perspective.|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry or Masonry {{consists}} of fraternal organisations that trace their origins {{to the local}} fraternities of stonemasons, which {{from the end of}} the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. These are the degrees offered by Craft (<b>or</b> <b>Blue</b> Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees.|$|E
5|$|Gauze is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black <b>or</b> <b>blue</b> cottons or striped pink and green fabric {{that had been}} made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.|$|E
50|$|Jamides elioti is a {{butterfly}} of the lycaenids <b>or</b> <b>blues</b> family. It {{is found in}} Sulawesi.|$|R
50|$|Jamides limes is a {{butterfly}} of the lycaenids <b>or</b> <b>blues</b> family. It is found on Borneo.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} <b>blue,</b> <b>or</b> white with <b>blue</b> <b>or</b> purple stripes, in racemes on upright stems.|$|R
5|$|In {{visible and}} {{near-infrared}} light, the rings have a reddish color, except the halo ring, which is neutral <b>or</b> <b>blue</b> in color. The {{size of the}} dust in the rings varies, but the cross-sectional area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 μm in all rings except the halo. The halo ring is probably dominated by submicrometre dust. The total mass of the ring system (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly known, but is probably {{in the range of}} 1011to 1016kg. The age of the ring system is not known, but it may have existed since the formation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Krishna is {{represented}} in the Indian traditions in many ways, but with some common features. His iconography typically depicts him with black, dark, <b>or</b> <b>blue</b> skin, like Vishnu. However, ancient and medieval reliefs and stone-based arts depict him in the natural color of the material out {{of which he is}} formed, both in India and in southeast Asia. In some texts, his skin is poetically described as the color of Jambul (Jamun, a purple-colored fruit).|$|E
5|$|Magnum XL-200 {{has three}} white-and-black trains. Each train has red, black <b>or</b> <b>blue</b> {{striping}} at the front. Each train has six cars; riders are arranged two-across in three rows {{for a total}} of 36 riders per train. Magnum was the first coaster in which Arrow Dynamics used its Hypercoaster trains, which were subsequently installed on dozens of other new rides. Riders are secured by a single lap bar and a seat belt.|$|E

5|$|Spores are thin-walled, smooth, and {{ellipsoidal}} or oval in shape. Viewed with a microscope, {{they appear}} translucent (hyaline), and stain red <b>or</b> <b>blue</b> with Melzer's reagent (in amyloid). Their dimensions are typically 7–10 by 5–7µm; the spores contain a single large oil droplet. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, two- to four-spored, and 25–30 by 5–7µm. The presence of sterile cells called pleurocystidia (large cells {{found on the}} gill face in some mushrooms) is uncommon; specimens may contain few or abundant cheilocystidia (large sterile cells found on the gill edge) that are club-shaped, thin-walled and 39–87.5 by 8.5–16µm in size.|$|E
5|$|The ferric {{chloride}} test {{is a traditional}} colorimetric test for phenols, which uses a 1% iron(III) chloride solution that has been neutralised with sodium hydroxide until a slight precipitate of FeO(OH) is formed. The mixture is filtered before use. The organic substance is dissolved in water, methanol or ethanol, then the neutralised iron(III) chloride solution is added—a transient or permanent coloration (usually purple, green <b>or</b> <b>blue)</b> indicates {{the presence of a}} phenol or enol.|$|E
5|$|The first 28 {{issues were}} 166 pages long. The page count dropped to 134 with the April 1954 issue and stayed at that length for the {{remainder}} of the run. The cover layout initially strongly resembled that of Other Worlds but was changed with the fifth issue, June 1951, to have a white background banner for the title. This format was retained for the rest of the magazine's life, with occasional slight variations such as using a different color for the banner background. The spine also changed from a colored spine with pale lettering, which was similar to the spine style used by Other Worlds, to a white spine with red <b>or</b> <b>blue</b> lettering.|$|E

5|$|The line shares tracks {{with the}} Green Line from L'Enfant Plaza northward to Fort Totten. It {{is a quick}} link between {{downtown}} Washington and National Airport, and shares nearly all of its track with either the Green <b>or</b> <b>Blue</b> Line. The Yellow Line has only two stations that are not shared by any other lines (Eisenhower Avenue and Huntington), and only two sections of track that are not shared by any other lines – the section {{at the south end}} of the line, and the section between the Pentagon and L'Enfant Plaza stations, crossing the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|The menu at the Whopper Bar {{features}} {{as many as}} 10 variants on the Whopper, including the Western Whopper, the Texas Double Whopper and the Angry Whopper. Additionally, a customization section allows the customer to have a personalized Whopper made with ingredients such as jalapeño peppers, steak sauce <b>or</b> <b>blue</b> cheese. The open station differs from the company's usual kitchen model {{in that it is}} in plain sight of the customer instead of being located in the back-end of the store. The intent of the design is to add a sense of showmanship to the concept.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Lemmings {{also has}} 20 two-player levels. This {{took advantage of}} the Amiga's ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari's ability to support a mouse and a joystick simultaneously. Each player is presented with their own view of the same map (on a vertically split screen), can only give orders to their own lemmings (green <b>or</b> <b>blue),</b> and had their own base. The goal is to get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one's own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.|$|E

5|$|Within the Maluridae, {{it is one}} of 12 {{species in}} its genus, Malurus. It is closely related to the Australian white-winged fairywren, and the white-shouldered fairywren of New Guinea. Termed the bicoloured wrens by ornithologist Richard Schodde, these three species are notable for their lack of head {{patterns}} and ear tufts, and one-coloured black <b>or</b> <b>blue</b> plumage with contrasting shoulder or wing colour; they replace each other geographically across northern Australia and New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue allow {{players to}} trade Pokémon between two {{cartridges}} via a Game Link Cable. This method of trading {{must be done}} to fully complete the Pokédex since certain Pokémon will only evolve upon being traded and each of the two games have version-exclusive Pokémon. The Link Cable also makes it possible to battle another player's Pokémon team. When playing Red <b>or</b> <b>Blue</b> on a Game Boy Advance or SP, the standard GBA/SP link cable will not work; players must use the Nintendo Universal Game Link Cable instead. Moreover, the English versions of the games are incompatible with their Japanese counterparts, and such trades will corrupt the save files, as the games use different languages and therefore character sets.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of the six}} {{missing women}} and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, {{within a week of}} midterm or final exams; all of the victims were wearing slacks <b>or</b> <b>blue</b> jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E
