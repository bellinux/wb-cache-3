5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E
5|$|Although {{best known}} for their joint {{work on behalf of}} women's suffrage, Stanton and Anthony first joined the temperance movement. Together, they were {{instrumental}} in founding the short-lived Woman's State Temperance Society (1852–1853). During her presidency of the organization, Stanton scandalized many supporters by suggesting that drunkenness be made sufficient cause for divorce. But the relationship between the women's suffrage movement and the temperance movement was hardly accidental. The two movements had common interests, with women's suffrage filling the role <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> and prohibition becoming the effect. Later, in state after state, once women gained the right to vote, they could press for various political measures to reduce drunkenness, perceived to be largely a problem involving the male sex. Thus, the two movements became frequently allied.|$|E

Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and look forward to the next few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E

Physical locales of Akihabara like the Radio Kaikan building can be spotted in the game. According to Chiyomaru Shikura, who headed the planning of Steins;Gate, Akihabara was chosen because it is an easy place for acquiring hardware parts, which makes it the ideal place for people interested in inventing and tinkering with things. The notion of time and time traveling are the main themes of the game.

There are scenes of daily life, complete with the full panorama of samsara (the endless cycle of birth and death). The encasement base of the Borobudur temple was dissembled to reveal the hidden foot, and the reliefs were photographed by Casijan Chepas in 1890. It is these photographs that are displayed in Borobudur Museum (Karmawibhangga Museum), located just several hundred meters north of the temple. During the restoration, the foot encasement was reinstalled, covering the Karmawibhangga reliefs. Today, only {{the southeast corner of}} the hidden foot is revealed and visible for visitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between {{external and internal}} environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> and effect between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics, for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or holocoenotic system as it was once called. This {{is known as the}} dialectical approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or umwelt). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the Buddhist {{doctrine}} of rebirth, the previous existences of Koṇḍañña are described in Buddhist texts. They repeatedly show a theme of Koṇḍañña having displayed religious inclinations in previous rebirths, many of which involve experiences with previous rebirths of the Buddha and his other leading disciplines. This is a common theme among the leading disciples, {{all of whom had}} many encounters with the future Gautama Buddha in previous lives, and is consistent with the Buddhist concepts <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> and effect and karma. In Pali language Theravada literature, Koṇḍañña is said to have begun striving for enlightenment in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, the 13th Buddha. The son of a wealthy householder at Hamsavati, Koṇḍañña saw the monk who was the first disciple of Padmuttara Buddha. Koṇḍañña's previous rebirth bestowed on the Buddha and the sangha and wished that he was to be the first disciple of a future Buddha. Padumuttara is said to have prophesied the fulfilment of this in the era of Gautama Buddha, 1000 aeons into the future. After the passing of Padmuttara Buddha, Koṇḍañña constructed a jewelled chamber inside the cetiya in which the relics were stored and also made an offering of jewel festoons. The Apadana offers a variant on this reincarnation. It states that Koṇḍañña {{was the first person to}} offer a meal to Padumuttara and became a deva in the Tusita world. It further says and that during the time of Vipassī Buddha, Koṇḍañña was a householder named Mahakala who offered the Buddha the first fruits of his field in their nine stages of production. The Mahavastu gives another account explaining the origin of Koṇḍañña's vow to attain arahanthood in his final rebirth. This account asserts that he was a potter at Rajagaha in a previous existence. A Paccekabuddha who was suffering from biliousness sought shelter in the potter's hut and was cured. In time, several more Paccekabuddhas came to visit the hut to inquire about their colleagues health status. The potter asked which of them had realised the dharma first, to which the patient answered in the affirmative. Thereupon the potter made his vow.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was (1) to compare levels of {{accuracy}} regarding the categorization <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death between non-contrast post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) and the final forensic report as well as between autopsy and the final forensic report, and (2) to assess levels of confidence regarding the categorization <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death after non-contrast PMCT and after autopsy. This prospective study was conducted over a 5 month period during which 221 cases were admitted to our institute for forensic investigations. Whole-body PMCT and forensic autopsy were performed in every case. Of these, 101 cases were included in the final study population. Inclusion criteria were: (1) age > 18 years, (2) presence of {{at least one of the}} two principal investigators at the time of admission. One radiologist and one forensic pathologist independently read all PMCT datasets using a report template. <b>Cause</b> <b>of</b> death category and confidence levels were determined by consensus. Forensic autopsy was performed by two forensic pathologists; both unblinded to imaging results. Both post-imaging and post-autopsy <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death categorization were compared against the final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death, as stated in the forensic expert report, which included findings from histology and/or toxicology. Accuracy <b>of</b> post-imaging <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death categorization in reference to the final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death category was substantial (82 %, 83 / 101 cases, Kappa 0. 752). Accuracy <b>of</b> post-autopsy <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death categorization in reference to the final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death category was near perfect (89 %, 90 / 101 cases, Kappa 0. 852). Post-imaging sensitivity and specificity regarding the categorization <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death were 82 % and 97 %, respectively. Post-autopsy sensitivity and specificity regarding the categorization <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death were 89 % and 98 %, respectively. There was a high consistency between the accuracy <b>of</b> post-imaging <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death categorization and post-imaging levels of confidence. There was less consistency between accuracy <b>of</b> post-autopsy <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death categorization and post-autopsy levels of confidence. In this study categorization <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death based on non-contrast enhanced PMCT alone, and on PMCT and macroscopic autopsy together, proved to be consistent with the final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death-category as determined based on all available information including PMCT, autopsy, and (if available) histology and/or toxicology in more than 82 % and 89 % of all cases, respectively. There was higher consistency between levels of confidence and accuracy <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death categorization was higher post-imaging than post-autopsy. These results underline the fact that the diagnostic potential of PMCT goes beyond the assessment of trauma cases...|$|R

This study examines relationships <b>of</b> multiple <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death {{as a function of}} factors available on the death certificate (demographics of decedent, place of death, type of certifier, disposal method, whether an autopsy was performed, and year of death). Methods Data from 326, 332 Minnesota death certificates from 1990 – 1998 are examined. Underlying and non-underlying <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death are examined (based on record axis codes) as well as demographic and death-related covariates. Associations between covariates and prevalence <b>of</b> multiple <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death and conditional probability of underlying compared to non-underlying <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death are examined. The occurrence of ischemic heart disease or diabetes as underlying causes are specifically examined. Results Both the probability <b>of</b> multiple <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death and the proportion <b>of</b> underlying <b>cause</b> compared to non-underlying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death are associated with demographic characteristics of the deceased and other non-medical conditions related to filing death certificate such as place of death. Conclusions Multiple <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death data provide a potentially useful way of looking for inaccuracies in reporting <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death. Differences across demographics in the proportion <b>of</b> time a <b>cause</b> is selected as underlying compared to non-underlying exist and can potentially provide useful information about the overall impact <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death in different populations. </p...|$|R
