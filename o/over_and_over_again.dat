Villoria called the world engaging, and its replay value very high, as players can play the story <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> with a different origin. Juba agreed, as did Yin-Poole, who added that the way companions react to the player's decisions, as well as the six origin stories, significantly expand the game's longevity.|$|E
5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests {{from more than one}} publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must be kept in mind when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E

The Lithuanian Army was ordered not to resist and to extend friendly greetings; its air force was ordered to remain on the ground. The Soviets came in great numbers clogging Lithuanian roads. They had an obvious intention to show power and intimidate any resistance. Writer Ignas Šeinius claimed that he observed the same squadron of Soviet planes making the same flight <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> to create an impression of much larger Soviet Air Forces.|$|E

Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, the world is trapped in a time loop, and only one woman, named Pam (Carrie Hamilton), seems to know. Each day the events that happen differ slightly. A bank robbery is committed <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> until finally the eventual bombing of the building is prevented. Somehow, Mulder and Scully are trapped {{in the middle of}} it all.|$|E

40|$|The views {{expressed}} herein {{are those of}} the authors and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis or the Federal Reserve System. The theme of this article is that competition, here modeled as the movement of goods between two areas, reduces resistance to new technology and, hence, leads to increased technology adoption and wealth. The article develops a model in which the extension of markets leads to reductions in activities that block new technologies. Why build a model that has a new role for competition in creating wealth? As an empirical matter, the introduction of markets brings tremendous increases in wealth. (See, for example, Rosenberg and Birdzell 1986.) This has been observed <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> is <b>again</b> being witnessed, for example, in Southeast China. However, there is still plenty of uncertainty among economists as to why competition, or the extension of markets, has been so successfu...|$|R
5|$|A {{subdivision}} rule takes a tiling of {{the plane}} by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a tile type. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that {{are made up of}} polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called subdivision complexes for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> to get a sequence of tilings.|$|E
5|$|Kingston had to {{genuinely}} slap Matt Smith {{several times}} in a scene because {{it was difficult to}} fake. Kingston recalled that after a few takes, Smith got red cheeked and grew frustrated at having to do the sequence <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> The Oval Office set was constructed at Upper Boat Studios in South Wales. Because the production crew had access to several pictures and plans of the real office, they were able to replicate it in almost every detail. The main problem for building the set was the plastering; the crew normally plaster one wall at a time for normal rooms, but because the Oval Office was round, they had to do the entire set at once. The American-style diner scene when the companions reunite with the Doctor in this episode is actually located in Cardiff Bay. The Laurel and Hardy film The Flying Deuces, in which the Doctor intruded, was done by Smith dancing in front of greenscreen.|$|E

Welshie is killed in a show of force to force their obedience. While Melllvar forces the cast to perform his fan script, Bender, Leela and Fry escape in the Planet Express Ship. Fry convinces the crew to attack Melllvar to save the actors, but Melllvar destroys the ship's engine as he drags it back to the planet.|$|E

"I am {{forced to}} {{believe there is a}} present danger of {{socialism}} never before so imminent in America in so dangerous a form, because never before imminent in so well organized a form. The danger lies in the obtaining control of the trades-unions by the socialists." [...] And the capitalist employers, instead of giving heed to the warnings, are perfecting their strike-breaking organization and combining more strongly than ever for a general assault upon that dearest of all things to the trades-unions--the closed shop. In so far as this assault succeeds, by just that much will the capitalist class shorten its lease of life.

NME said, [...] "In days when the pop song {{has been reduced to}} the reiteration of catch-phrases, Matt Johnson flexes a rare literary flair. More importantly he has the command of music's immense possibilities to carry them through without self-indulgence. Ignore this LP if you must, but you'll be ignoring one of the year's rare heart-stopping moments." [...] Melody Maker said, [...] "As you return to Soul Mining again and again, there will be times when you discover it was the last thing you really wanted to do. It will sound mawkish, almost absurd, like a voice crying wolf <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> ... Then <b>again,</b> there'll be times when it will sound obscenely close to the bone, as if Johnson were invading and defiling your most private thoughts and emotions ... In other words, you'll use Soul Mining as a barometer to your day and if that's the principal function of great pop, then surely Soul Mining is great pop." ...|$|R

25|$|The word waswās in waswāsi l-ḫannās {{means the}} one who whispers <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> and waswasa means to whisper into someone's heart an evil {{suggestion}} <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> {{in such a way}} or ways that {{the one who}} is being inspired may not feel that the whisperer is whispering an evil suggestion into his heart. Waswasa by itself suggests repetition just as zalzala contains the meaning of repetitive movement. Since man is not tempted by just one attempt but effort has to be made <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> to seduce and tempt him, such an attempt is called waswasa and the tempter waswās. As for the word ḫannās, it is derived from ḫunus, which means to hide after appearing and to retreat after coming into view. Since ḫannās is the intensive form, it would imply the one who behaves thus very frequently. Thus when once he fails in his attempt to whisper evil, he withdraws, then he again returns to make the second and the third and the next attempt <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

At the same moment he heard a cry of warning, and was {{simultaneously}} struck a heavy blow which stretched him on the ground beside the bear. It flashed through his mind that his assailant was the female bear. He had heard from the Ostjaks that the best plan, if attacked by an enraged bear, was to sham death, and he therefore lay without moving a muscle as he was struck down. He heard the twang of Luka's bow, and Jack's sharp barking close to his ear. Then with a deep angry growl the bear left him and rushed towards the tent. Godfrey at once sprang to his feet. He had not brought his spear {{with him as he}} crawled out, but he sprang to the fire and dragged out a brand. Luka had discharged another arrow, and Jack was harassing the bear by snapping at its hind-legs. In terror {{for the safety of the}} canoe rather than that of Luka, who could, he knew, well defend himself, Godfrey leapt forward and struck the bear across the nose with the brand. With a roar of fury it turned upon him, but as it did so it exposed its side to Luka, who discharged another arrow behind its shoulder. It rolled <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> but <b>again</b> gained its feet. The pause, however, had given Luka time to emerge from under the boat with his spear in his hand, and running up he thrust it right through the body, <b>and</b> the bear fell <b>over</b> dead.

25|$|This {{technique}} {{is much more}} efficient than the naïve brute-force search algorithm, which considers all 648=248= 281,474,976,710,656 possible blind placements of eight queens, and then filters these to remove all placements that place two queens either on the same square (leaving only 64!/56!= 178,462,987,637,760 possible placements) or in mutually attacking positions. This very poor algorithm will, among other things, produce the same results <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> in all the different permutations of the assignments of the eight queens, as well as repeating the same computations <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>again</b> for the different sub-sets of each solution.
