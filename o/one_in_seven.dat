5|$|The annual {{incidence}} in Canada of genital herpes due to HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection {{is not known}} (for a review of HSV-1/HSV-2 prevalence and incidence studies worldwide, see Smith and Robinson 2002). As many as <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> Canadians aged 14 to 59 may be infected with herpes simplex type 2 virus and more than 90 per cent of them may be unaware of their status, a new study suggests. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} about 1,640,000 HSV-2 seroconversions occur yearly (730,000 men and 910,000 women, or 8.4 per 1,000 persons).|$|E
5|$|There {{were about}} 578,424 {{sheltered}} and unsheltered homeless {{persons in the}} U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program. In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns {{at some point during}} the year, and most cases were not chronic. According to a 2014 report by the Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty today, up from <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Bears defense vastly {{improved}} {{in comparison to}} the previous two seasons; after allowing the two most points in franchise history in 2013 (478) and 2014 (442), the 2015 defense allowed 397, which ranked 20th in the league. The defense gained 26 places in the pass defense category to end the season fourth in the ranking. While the unit also allowed only 225 passing yards per game, the number is skewed due to opposing offenses' frequency to run the ball; Bears opponents passed 512, the fourth-least in the NFL. Yardage-wise, the defense allowed an average of 345.1, gaining 16 spots to finish 14th. Statistically, the Bears allowed 7.5 yards per pass and a 62.9 completion percentage, 20th- and 14th-ranked in the league, respectively. The pass defense also allowed a passer rating of 99.2 passer rating (26th), 31 touchdowns (25th), while recording only eight interceptions, the second-least in the NFL. In total, the Bears forced only 17 turnovers (28th-ranked), failing to record <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> games, and twice in only two games. In the red zone, the Bears allowed 27 touchdowns and 14 field goals on 45 attempts (60 percent), which ranked 21st in the league. Meanwhile, the pass rush recorded 35 sacks (22nd in the NFL), 20 of which occurred in the last seven games of the year, the seventh-most in the league.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, the Royal African Company was inaugurated, {{receiving}} from King Charles {{a monopoly}} {{of the trade}} to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean. From the outset, slavery was {{the basis of the}} British Empire in the West Indies. Until the abolition of its slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all slaves transported across the Atlantic. To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as James Island, Accra and Bunce Island. In the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25% in 1650 to around 80% in 1780, and in the Thirteen Colonies from 10% to 40% over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies). For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western British cities as Bristol and Liverpool, which formed the third corner of the triangular trade with Africa and the Americas. For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average mortality rate during the Middle Passage was <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>seven.</b>|$|E

2500|$|It {{is still}} {{discussed}} among scholars of the Ancient Near East {{whether or not}} there is clear evidence for a seven-year cycle in Ugaritic texts. It is also debated how the biblical seventh fallow year would fit in with, for example Assyrian practice of a four-year cycle and crop rotation, and whether the <b>one</b> year <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> was an extra fallow year. Jehuda Felix suggests [...] that the land may have been farmed only 3 years <b>in</b> <b>seven.</b> Borowski (1987) takes the fallow year as <b>one</b> year <b>in</b> <b>seven.</b>|$|R

25|$|Rutherford stated at the {{convention}} that he was aware he had made many mistakes. By mid-1919, about <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> Bible Students had left rather than accept his leadership, {{and as many as}} seventy-five percent by 1928, resulting in the formation of various Bible Student groups such as the Stand Fast Movement, the Layman's Home Missionary Movement, the Dawn Bible Students Association, the Pastoral Bible Institute, the Elijah Voice Movement, and the Eagle Society. The splinter groups that were independent of the Watch Tower Society remained relatively small. In 1931, the group under Rutherford's leadership became known as Jehovah's witnesses.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{evidence}} for the effectiveness of large-scale vaccination campaigns is well established. Vaccination campaigns helped eradicate smallpox, which once killed as many as <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> children in Europe, and have nearly eradicated polio. As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, {{a major cause of}} bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988. It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections.|$|E
25|$|In May 1918, Rutherford {{and seven}} other Watch Tower {{directors}} and officers were arrested on charges of sedition under the Espionage Act. On June 21, 1918, they were sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. Rutherford feared his opponents would {{gain control of the}} Society in his absence, but on January 2, 1919, he learned he had been re-elected president at the Pittsburgh convention the day before. However, by mid-1919 about <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> Bible Students had chosen to leave rather than accept Rutherford's leadership, forming groups such as The Stand Fast Movement, Paul Johnson Movement, Dawn Bible Students Association, Pastoral Bible Institute of Brooklyn, Elijah Voice Movement and Eagle Society.|$|E

25|$|Dundee has {{a higher}} {{proportion}} of university students – <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> of the population – than any other town in Europe, except Heidelberg. The 14.2% come from all around the world to attend the local universities and colleges. Dundee is a major attraction for Northern Irish students who make up 5% of the total student population. The city's universities are believed to hold the highest percentage of Northern Irish students outside of Northern Ireland and have a big impact on the local economy and culture. However, this has declined in recent years due to the increase of tuition fees for students elsewhere in the UK. Dundee also has a lot of students from abroad, mostly from the Republic of Ireland and other EU countries but with an increasing number from countries from the Far East and Nigeria.|$|E
25|$|According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, {{the number}} of (full-time equivalent) {{researchers}} rose from 711 to 736 per million inhabitants between 2009 and 2010.

One in four (26%) Iranian researchers is a woman, which {{is close to the}} world average (28%). In 2008, half of researchers were employed in academia (51.5%), one-third in the government sector (33.6%) and just under <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> in the business sector (15.0%). Within the business sector, 22% of researchers were women in 2013, the same proportion as in Ireland, Israel, Italy and Norway. The number of firms declaring research activities more than doubled between 2006 and 2011, from 30 935 to 64 642. The increasingly tough sanctions regime oriented the Iranian economy towards the domestic market and, by erecting barriers to foreign imports, encouraged knowledge-based enterprises to localize production.|$|E
