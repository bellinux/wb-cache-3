5|$|Parts {{can be made}} by hot {{pressing}} from four commercial grades of h-BN. Grade HBN contains a boron oxide binder; it is usable up to 550–850°C in <b>oxidizing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and up to 1600°C in vacuum, but due to the boron oxide content is sensitive to water. Grade HBR uses a calcium borate binder and is usable at 1600°C. Grades HBC and HBT contain no binder and can be used up to 3000°C.|$|E
5|$|Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is {{the most}} widely used polymorph. It is a good {{lubricant}} at both low and high temperatures (up to 900°C, even in an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>atmosphere).</b> h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in cosmetics, paints, dental cements, and pencil leads.|$|E

25|$|At present, it {{is still}} {{believed}} that molecular oxygen {{was not a significant}} fraction of Earth's atmosphere until after photosynthetic life forms evolved and began to produce it in large quantities as a byproduct of their metabolism. This radical shift from a chemically inert to an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> caused an ecological crisis, sometimes called the oxygen catastrophe. At first, oxygen would have quickly combined with other elements in Earth's crust, primarily iron, removing it from the atmosphere. After the supply of oxidizable surfaces ran out, oxygen would have begun to accumulate in the atmosphere, and the modern high-oxygen atmosphere would have developed. Evidence for this lies in older rocks that contain massive banded iron formations that were laid down as iron oxides.|$|E

2500|$|Scientists {{start the}} search for fossil {{evidence}} of plants with indirect evidence for their presence, the evidence of photosynthesis in the geological record. [...] The evidence for photosynthesis in the rock record is varied, but primary evidence comes from around 3000 Ma, in rock records and fossil evidence of cyanobacteria, photosynthesizing prokaryotic organisms. [...] Cyanobacteria use water as a reducing agent, producing atmospheric oxygen as a byproduct, and they thereby profoundly changed the early reducing atmosphere of the earth to one in which modern aerobic organisms eventually evolved. [...] This oxygen liberated by cyanobacteria then oxidized dissolved iron in the oceans, the iron precipitated {{out of the sea}} water, and fell to the ocean floor to form sedimentary layers of oxidized iron called Banded Iron Formations (BIFs). [...] These BIFs are part of the geological record of evidence for the evolutionary history of plants by identifying when photosynthesis originated. [...] This also provides deep time constraints upon when enough oxygen could have been available in the atmosphere to produce the ultraviolet blocking stratospheric ozone layer. [...] The oxygen concentration in the ancient atmosphere subsequently rose, acting as a poison for anaerobic organisms, and resulting in a highly <b>oxidizing</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> and opening up niches on land for occupation by aerobic organisms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on our {{background}} {{in the field of}} nonlinear electrical properties of SnO 2 -based varistors, we have been observing the influence of microstructural heterogeneities, e. g., the precipitate phase at triple points of the grain boundary region. In this study, we have prepared a SnO 2 -based varistor system with excess precipitates at triple points in the grain boundary region in order to discuss their influence on the system’s non-ohmic properties, including thermal treatment at <b>oxidizing</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> Our results indicate that an excessive amount of such precipitates may be deleterious to the non-ohmic properties because they may create adjacent regions at grain boundaries with lower concentrations of segregated metal atoms, thus increasing the presence of a non-active potential barrier and increasing leakage current paths. Under these circumstances, the effect of thermal treatment in <b>oxidizing</b> <b>atmospheres</b> is to decrease the leakage current density instead of increasing the nonlinear coefficient...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on self-{{validation}} and in-situ validation methods of thermometry between 1000 ºC and about 1800 ºC. An operative approach of reliable self-validating contact thermometry sensors and the implementation of traceable measurement methods for the measurement of temperatures up to about 1800 °C in <b>oxidizing</b> <b>atmospheres</b> will be presented. Miniature fixed points filled with high purity Au (1064. 18 °C), Pd (1553. 4 °C) and Pt (1769 °C) have been constructed and assembled with type B thermocouples {{to be used as}} traceable references in <b>oxidizing</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> The use of electrical noise thermometry as an additional method for realization of the self-validation principle was applied. Combined thermocouple-noise temperature sensors have been constructed to allow long-term determination of thermocouple drift. Electrical noise thermometry is a primary method to measure temperatures without drift effects even over long periods of time. An uncertainty of noise temperatures measured of 0. 1 % has been achieved which is sufficient to determine and correct for thermocouple drifts in industrial use...|$|R
