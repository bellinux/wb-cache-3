5|$|Highway89 was {{established}} in 1937 {{as a result of}} the rerouting of Highway9 between Orangeville and Highway27. In 1963, the route was extended west to Palmerston and east to Highway400.

However, environmental protest over the chosen route through the Holland Marsh resulted in the cancellation <b>of</b> <b>plans</b> in 1986. In 1997, the section between Highway400 and Highway11 was decommissioned. The most recent change to the route took place in 2003, when the section of Highway89 between Palmerston and Harriston was renumbered as part of Highway23, creating a shared terminus at a junction with Highway9.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} conceptual {{tools for}} the analysis <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour. These are, firstly, a model <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> systems as learning systems, and then three dimensions <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour, each described by defining a pair of dichotomous concepts at their far ends: 'blueprint' versus 'process' modes of planning; 'rational-deductive' decision-making versus 'disjointed incrementalism'; 'normative' versus 'functional' <b>planning.</b> Each <b>of</b> these concepts is discussed in detail, and some indicators {{for the analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour are suggested. Finally, a more complex model is constructed which combines the three dimensions. Elements of this model are firstly {{the level at which}} planning is conducted within a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> systems, and secondly, the 'planning sub-structure', that is the technology-image reflecting the nature <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> problems and available planning technologies. From this model one can derive a number of researchable hypotheses about planning behaviour. ...|$|R
