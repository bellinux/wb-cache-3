40|$|Consideration {{is given}} to the static force-free {{equilibrium}} of a magnetic field in which all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> force connect without knotting between parallel planes. The field is formed by continuous deformation from an initial uniform field, and is conventiently described in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scalar function psi, which is the stream function for the incompressible wrapping and interweaving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> force. Local compression and expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> force is described in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scalar function Phi. Equilibrium in the field requires satisfaction of two independent equations which cannot be accomplished without <b>the</b> full freedom <b>of</b> both psi and Phi. It is shown that discontinuities in <b>the</b> torsional characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> occur when psi is predetermined by an arbitrary pattern.

5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips to move out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold {{on the underside of the}} weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
5|$|Camp's new {{scrimmage}} rules {{revolutionized the}} game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined with the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{classified}} as a BY Draconis variable because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move into and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> sight as it rotates. Measurement of this rotational modulation suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11.2days, which {{is less than half}} of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to starspots and other short-term magnetic activity. Photometry has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing differential rotation i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high latitude. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days. The axial tilt of Epsilon Eridani toward the line of sight from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24° to 72°.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to {{him to be a}} disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.|$|E
5|$|HMS Canopus was an 84-gun third rate ship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the British Royal Navy. She had {{previously}} {{served with the}} French Navy as the Tonnant-class Franklin, but was captured after {{less than a year}} in service by the British fleet under Rear Admiral Horatio Nelson at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Having served for less than six months for the French from her completion in March 1798 to her capture in August that year, she would eventually serve for 89 years for the British.|$|E

Nassau was the third ship in the group of four, behind Rheinland and ahead of Westfalen; Posen was the squadron's flagship. When the German fleet reorganized into a nighttime cruising formation, the order of the ships was inadvertently reversed, and so Nassau was the second ship in the line, astern of Westfalen.|$|E

5|$|On 11 October {{the weather}} cleared, and {{spotting}} two sails to the south, Countess took Ethalion to investigate. The ships were Amelia and a ship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> Warren's squadron, who having received Sylphs warning on 23 September, was sailing north {{in an attempt}} to intercept the French. Warren's squadron of three ships of the line and the razee frigate HMS Magnanime had been joined the day before by two additional frigates stationed at Lough Swilly; HMS Melampus under Captain Graham Moore and HMS Doris under Captain Lord Ranelagh. Warren attached Melampus to his squadron and detached Doris to scout along the Irish coast and warn the British garrisons, especially along the coast of County Donegal and the North-West of Ireland region generally. Doris was also to scout along part of the coast of the West of Ireland region, further south, where the previous French landing had been effected at Killala.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the thirty}} years from 1880 onwards, rule changes were {{incrementally}} {{introduced into the}} game, including the adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> scrimmage, scoring that began to resemble the modern version, and the down and yardage structure. Popular personalities of the era included player-coach Joe Wright Sr., {{one of the best}} all around Canadian athletes {{at the turn of the}} century. One major outstanding issue within the CRU at the time was the role of professional versus amateur players; this dispute caused the Argonauts to withdraw from the league in 1903 and eventually led to the establishment of a new league, The Big Four or Interprovincial Rugby Football League. Alongside the professionalism dispute, there was serious disagreement over the adoption of the Burnside rules, with Ontario, Quebec, and the intercollegiate league often not in alignment. Amongst other critical innovations, the Burnside rules reduced the number of men per side to 12 and introduced the ten yards in three downs structure that is central to the modern game.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is a first-person shooter where players {{control the}} player {{character}} mostly from a first-person perspective. The combat features mechanics {{such as an}} evasive dodge roll and a cover {{system in which the}} gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to strategically aim without taking damage and be more aware of the surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles {{as long as they can}} reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. By doing so, the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies.

Kaiser did see action during the Seven Weeks' War two years later, during which she took part in the Battle of Lissa as the flagship of Anton von Petz, commander of the Austrian 2nd Division. Kaiser engaged several Italian ironclads simultaneously, rammed oneand damaged anotherwith gunfire.
