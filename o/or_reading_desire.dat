5000|$|The CPU {{communicates}} {{with the}} VDC through an 8-bit bus. A pin {{controlled by the}} CPU separates this bus into two [...] "ports", a control port and a data port. To write <b>or</b> <b>read</b> a byte of video memory, the CPU first has to write two bytes on the VDC's control port to the VDC's internal address register. Next, the CPU performs the actual write <b>or</b> <b>read</b> on the VDC's data port. As a data byte is written <b>or</b> <b>read,</b> the TMS9918 automatically increments the internal address register. This auto-increment feature accelerates writes and reads of blocks of data. The control port {{is also used to}} access various internal registers.|$|R
