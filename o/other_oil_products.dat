He found that the existing NYMEX floor traders didn’t have the mathematical skills necessary to trade options, so the Exchange offered financial inducements to get members of the American Stock Exchange’s options traders to come over and trade options on petroleum futures. Under Treat’s leadership, NYMEX also began to research the potential for trading natural gas and electricity, but focused first on natural gas. Product quality of natural gas was not an issue in that market, but the delivery point was a more difficult choice.|$|E

Since the Philippines dominated the international trade market of coconut products, it could exercise dominant market power in the world trade, by integrating the domestic sector. However, the industrial policies were not effective. Results of an econometric analysis show that the Philippines did not gain the market power despite the heavy investment in the coconut sector.

Razmatra se Glumčeva značajna uloga u koordiniranju cjelokupne propagandne djelatnosti tvornice i oblikovanju njezina modernoga vizualnog identiteta te doprinos oglašavanju prehrambene industrije u Hrvatskoj tijekom međuratnog razdoblja. On {{the basis}} of archival records, {{correspondence}} and preserved sketches, posters and other material, the paper analyses the broad and intense collaboration of graphic artist and graphic and stage designer Sergije Glumac with the First Croatian Oil Factory (est. 1916) owned by the prominent Jewish family Aleksander. During the 1930 s, Glumac designed the Factory’s distinct visual identity and coordinated its entire advertising activities – from product placement by means of intense advertising to designing exhibition spaces and organizing displays at important commercial exhibitions (Zagreb Fair, Ljubljana Fair). The modernity and purity of visual expression, message structuring and construction of connotative meanings distinguished his creations from the design which accompanied <b>other</b> <b>oil</b> <b>products</b> (e. g. Riviera, Meinl) advertised in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia during the interwar period. Glumac was familiar with international models (Réne Clarke) and successfully reinterpreted the conventional motifs used in oil-related advertising (e. g. oil pouring). His designs varied from stylized sketches with elements of avant-garde tendencies and existing modern posters to conventional solutions focused on skilful, realistic drawing and accentuated colour. He applied different marketing techniques {{in the creation of}} a product’s image, emphasized oil quality, its health advantages and good value for money. Glumac’s graphic design and his coordination of an intense several-month-long advertising campaign entitled “Cooking with oil” realized in 1934 in various forms (from conventional advertising to cinema ads and personalized approach) bear witness to the broad range of his activities and his significant contribution to Croatian food industry advertising during the interwar period...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research project was to quantify the emission of VOCs during the transport of mineral <b>oil</b> <b>products</b> by means of rail tank cars. The aim was furthermore to develop appropriate measures {{on the basis of}} the results in order to reduce or avoid emissions. At present approximately 1. 2 thousand tons of VOC are annually emitted due to the railway transport of motor fuel. This corresponds to a share of about 1 / 40 of the total actual NMVOC-emissions from transport of motor fuel although in Germany approximately 1 / 3 of the transports are carried out by railway. <b>Other</b> mineral <b>oil</b> <b>products</b> are not relevant for VOC-emissions. A combination of several technical, organisational and logistic measures would enable to further reduce the actual emissions. The following measures for the mitigation and reduction of emissions would be possible: (1) Consequent implementation of the 'best practice'. (2) Improvement of the efficiency of the exhaust air cleaning during inside cleaning of rail tank cars. (3) Reduction of remaining liquid during emptying procedures. (4) Filling by means of bottom loading. (5) Furnishing of rail tank cars with overpressure deflation junction and corresponding adaptation of filling stations and modification of the top-loading procedure (connection to the overpressure deflation junction before opening of the man hole cover). (6) Improvement of the efficiency of the vapour recycling installation. The measures (1) and (2) are recommended on the basis of a technical-economic-ecologic evaluation.
