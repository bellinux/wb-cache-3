5|$|Growth {{was much}} slower in the east, and the modest {{extensions}} <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> were {{separated from the}} much larger extensions in the west by the marshy open area of Moorfields adjacent to the wall {{on the north side}} which discouraged development in that direction.|$|E
5|$|The north façade {{has three}} bays {{separated}} by windows and features a loggia, typical of early 17th-century houses, {{with a central}} arched entrance to accommodate coaches. The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched Dutch gable, which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche or James I. There are small obelisks at {{either side of the}} gable. Thorpe originally intended the main entrance of the house to be <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side,</b> building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house.|$|E
5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> of the mountain, it {{has the advantage of}} giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E

5|$|A station {{house is}} located above both platforms, {{containing}} a crossover, waiting area and fare control. The single street staircase outside of fare control {{goes down to}} West Road by the intersection of Noel Road next to the Rockaway-bound platform. This platform also has a set of exit-only turnstiles leading directly to this staircase so riders exiting the station <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> {{do not have to}} go through the station house. The station house is heated, while the platforms feature passenger-activated heaters; these heaters, and the doors separating the station house and staircases, were not originally part of the station. The station house used to have 1950s-era signage at its front entrance reading, but now only has modern MTA entrance signs.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} side of the altar are two retablos. The larger altar on {{the right side}} {{currently}} houses the image of St. Francis Xavier as preacher on the topmost level. On the middle level of the same retablo are images of Saint Vincent Ferrer in the center, and Saint Augustine and Saint Monica on the left and right niches, respectively. The lowest level contains images of the Nuestra Señora de la Consolacion in the center, Saint Anne to the right and Saint Thérèse of Lisieux (originally St Joachim) on the left. The smaller altar has two levels of baroque and neoclassical style, respectively, with images of the crucified Christ on the lower level and the Holy Infant on the upper. The tomb of Father Aquilino Bon and other Recollect priests who served Loboc are also <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> of the church. The remains of Jesuit priest Alonso de Humanes were formerly interred in this area before the transfer of his remains to San Ignacio in Intramuros. An apocryphal account tells of a fire in a former Loboc church stopping at the foot of Humanes' tomb; this story spread across the people of the Loboc and nearby towns, which drew pilgrims to light candles in memory of Humanes.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, TV Mania {{made up of}} Nick Rhodes and ex-Duran Duran guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, {{released}} Bored with Prozac and the Internet?. Throughout the 1990s, Rhodes worked <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> {{project with}} Cuccurullo. To support {{the launch of the}} project, Rhodes had an exhibition of his photography, BEI INCUBI (Beautiful Nightmares), at The Vinyl Factory in Chelsea, London on 7 March.|$|E

50|$|The station had {{a single}} platform, a brick station {{building}} which included the stationmaster's house, and a single siding serving coal drops (now converted into garages) behind the station. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>siding,</b> camping coaches were stationed in later years. A passing loop was never added because of the extensive works it would have required. A small goods yard with a warehouse and a two-ton crane was situated {{a short distance away}} from the station towards Whitby.|$|R
5000|$|... "Spit on a Stranger" [...] {{has been}} covered by various artists. Alternative {{versions}} include one from progressive bluegrass band Nickel Creek <b>on</b> 2002's <b>This</b> <b>Side,</b> and another recorded by singer-songwriter Kathryn Williams on 2004's Relations.|$|R
25|$|To {{the east}} is Nether Beck, flowing {{down to the}} Lake through its long valley. On the other side are the long {{southern}} slopes of Red Pike. The southern slopes of Middle Fell fall to the shore of Wastwater, claiming a long section of the northern shore between Nether Beck Bridge and the Greendale road junction. Goat Gill and Smithy Beck provide further drainage <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} observed are congenital obstructive lesions {{of the left}} side of the heart, leading to reduced flow <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> of the heart. This includes bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta. More than 50% of the cardiovascular malformations of individuals with Turner syndrome in one study were bicuspid aortic valves or coarctation of the aorta (usually preductal), alone or in combination.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Palladianism of the West front, the East front is austere in its neoclassicism. It projects from the flanking pavilions, which <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> of the house are partially screened by planting. The fenestration which is concentrated on the broad bay at {{the centre of the}} facade provides the essential rhythm and relief. Above the second floor, a balustrade not only hides the roof, but unites the projecting bay with its flanking bays.|$|E
50|$|Rainforests {{are located}} <b>on</b> <b>this</b> western <b>side</b> of St. Croix {{due to the}} {{topography}} and 1,400 foot peaks and the tradewinds. This rainforest climate is unique to the Frederiksted side of St. Croix.|$|R

25|$|Brown How bears a large {{circular}} hide or windshelter, whilst Whinlatter Top {{itself has}} only a modest cairn. The Lake District views are poor, except for the close-ups of Hopegill Head and Grisedale Pike across the pass, showing their full craggy glory <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side.</b> Through Whinlatter Pass {{there is also a}} sight of the Helvellyn range and Skiddaw group. This is made up for by the northward views to the Solway Firth and the Scottish mountains beyond, best viewed from the westerly peak, Brown How.|$|E
25|$|By {{the age of}} 16 Gamani was 'vigorous, renowned, {{intelligent}} and a hero in majesty and might', if a little wayward. Determined to expel the invading king of Rajarata, Gamani levied an army from around Rohana and declared his intention to regain the north to his father. The king forbade this stating that 'the land <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> of the river is enough'; the resulting exchange between father and son saw Gamani being dubbed 'Duttha Gamani', his friends fleeing to Malaya, and he himself being incarcerated in a royal prison.|$|E
25|$|In the Chapel of the Crucifixion, the Roman {{brick wall}} {{is visible in}} the niches. The wooden {{crucifix}} on the altar is from the 15th century. On the left wall is a Descent of the Holy Ghost (1790) by Pietro Labruzi. On the right side is the low relief Cardinal Consalvi presents to Pope Pius VII the five provinces restored to the Holy See (1824) made by the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. The bust is a portrait of Cardinal Agostino Rivarola. The final niche <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> has a statue of St. Evasius (Sant'Evasio) (1727) by Francesco Moderati.|$|E

6000|$|On a {{side track}} stood a freight-car, {{from which the}} {{customary}} men in silk caps were pulling the freight, and standing it about loosely on the platform. The car was detached from the parent train, which had left it not only orphaned <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>siding,</b> but apparently disabled; for Gaites heard the men talking about not having cut it out a minute too soon. One of them called, in at the broad low door, to some one inside, [...] "All out?" [...] and a voice from far within responded, [...] "Case here, yet; I can't handle it alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those are distinctions {{which we}} hardly {{understand}} <b>on</b> <b>this</b> thick-headed <b>side</b> of the water. But demagogues, democrats, demonstrations, and Demosthenic oratory are all equally odious to John Eustace. For {{a young man}} he's about the best Tory I know." ...|$|R
25|$|The story then {{shifts to}} Susannah {{coming through the}} magic door to an {{alternate}} 1980s New York, where Gary Hart is president. Susannah throws away Roland's gun (which does not function <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> of the door), rejecting {{the life of a}} gunslinger, and starts a new life with alternate versions of Eddie and Jake, who in this world are brothers with the surname Toren. They have only very vague memories of their previous journey with Susannah, whose own memories of Mid-World are already beginning to fade. It is implied that an alternate version of Oy, the billy-bumbler, will also join them.|$|E
25|$|Aphrodite {{starts off}} the line-up {{of the gods}} <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side,</b> and since one has to imagine the frieze as continuous, she {{is to be found}} next to her lover Ares, who concludes the east frieze. The goddess of love pulls a lance out of a dead Giant. Next to her, her mother, the Titan Dione, is fighting, as well as her small son, Eros. The next two figures are uncertain. They are most likely the twins Castor and Pollux. Castor is being grabbed from behind by a Giant who bites him in the arm, whereupon his brother hastens to his assistance.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{vegetation}} {{is preserved}} {{in many parts}} of the district because of the unsuitability of steep land for cultivation. The district is at a natural geographic and climatic boundary. It is the southern limit for mangroves (Avicennia resinifera) <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> of the North Island of New Zealand, the southern limit for the coastal tree taraire (Beilschmiedia taraire), and the mountains are the furthest north for many New Zealand alpine plants (Ranunculus insignis, Ourisia caespitosa etc.). A remnant sea-level stand of an alpine southern beech (Nothofagus solandri) exists at the head of Ohiwa Harbour, a drowned Ice Ages valley system.|$|E
50|$|Peixateries velles (The old fish market). On {{the south}} side there were the meat market, while on the North side there were the fish market. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> later <b>side,</b> the stone-made waiter where the fish was sold is still conserved.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} sidings also {{exist on the}} NHRR. At Buckingham Valley, a small siding that once served the Buckingham Valley Trolley Association is {{presently}} used as a Repair-in-progress, or RIP-track. At Wycombe, the team track once used for less-than-carload deliveries is utilized as car storage {{for a number of}} NHRR's out-of-service passenger cars. At Grenoble, another siding created by severing the southern switch of a passing <b>siding</b> is present. <b>This</b> <b>siding</b> once held a number of pieces of equipment that were eventually scrapped. Today only passenger car 1542 remains <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>siding</b> as it was flipped over onto its side by vandals. At Ivyland, exists another RIP-track, typically used for storing MoW equipment. The final siding on the railroad is in Warminster {{on the north side of}} the Street Road crossing. <b>This</b> <b>siding</b> is used for short-term storage of interchange freight equipment and storing the diesel locomotive assigned to freight service when not in use.|$|R
25|$|Major {{sections}} of the city include the central business district, called The Loop, and the North, the South, and West Sides. The three sides of the city are represented on the Flag of Chicago by three horizontal white stripes. The North Side is the most densely populated residential section of the city, and many high-rises are located <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> of the city along the lakefront. The South Side is the largest section of the city, encompassing roughly 60% of the city's land area. The South Side contains the University of Chicago {{and most of the}} facilities of the Port of Chicago.|$|E
25|$|Ethene, however, has no {{permanent}} dipole. The attractive forces between polyethylene chains arise from weak van der Waals forces. Molecules {{can be thought}} of as being surrounded by a cloud of negative electrons. As two polymer chains approach, their electron clouds repel one another. This has the effect of lowering the electron density on one side of a polymer chain, creating a slight positive dipole <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side.</b> This charge is enough to attract the second polymer chain. Van der Waals forces are quite weak, however, so polyethylene can have a lower melting temperature compared to other polymers.|$|E
25|$|The {{front door}} {{is located on}} the {{southwest}} well of the building, and is of vertical tongue and groove construction, measuring six feet, two inches tall by two feet, ten inches wide. To the west of the door are four horizontal two-over-three sash windows, each window measuring eight inches tall by ten inches wide. The gable has enclosed eaves and reaches eleven feet in height. The first addition increased the length of this side of the structure by almost fourteen feet, and includes two casement windows with two-over-two sash <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>side</b> of the building. Each of the windows is ten inches tall by eight inches wide.|$|E
