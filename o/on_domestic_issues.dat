5|$|Clinton won the 1992 presidential {{election}} (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (0 electoral votes), who ran {{as an independent}} on a platform that focused <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues.</b> Bush's steep decline in public approval was {{a significant part of}} Clinton's success. Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress, the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|Truman cooperated {{closely with}} the Republican leaders on foreign policy, though he fought them bitterly <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues.</b> The power of the labor unions was {{significantly}} curtailed by the Taft–Hartley Act, which was enacted over Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of a tax cut bill in 1948. The parties did cooperate on some issues; Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, making the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the Vice President.|$|E

It was moderated by Judy Woodruff, and was {{a joint venture between}} IPTV and AARP. Obama rejected PBS's invitation, and Gravel and Kucinich were excluded from the debate because they did not have at least one paid staff member or office space in Iowa.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom was {{responsible}} for foreign affairs and defence of the federation, whilst the states continued {{to be responsible for}} their domestic policies. Even so, the British Resident General would give advice <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues,</b> and the states were bound by treaty to follow that advice. The federation had Kuala Lumpur, which was then part of Selangor, as its capital. The first FMS Resident General was Sir Frank Swettenham.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower, an internationalist {{allied with}} the Dewey wing, was drafted as a GOP {{candidate}} by {{a small group of}} Republicans led by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. in order that he challenge Taft on foreign policy issues. The two men were not far apart <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues.</b> Eisenhower's victory broke a twenty-year Democratic lock on the White House. Eisenhower did not try to roll back the New Deal, but he did expand the Social Security system and built the Interstate Highway System.|$|E

25|$|He {{also began}} to follow new policies, {{pursuing}} independent defence and foreign policies and distancing Australia from its traditional ties to Britain. But he continued to support Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, a position he had reluctantly inherited from Holt, which became increasingly unpopular after 1968. <b>On</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues,</b> he favoured centralist policies {{at the expense of}} the states, which alienated powerful Liberal state leaders like Sir Henry Bolte of Victoria and Bob Askin of New South Wales. He also fostered an independent Australian film industry and increased government funding for the arts.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for {{military}} activity {{of any kind}} {{during the reign of}} Senusret II is non-existent. Senusret instead appears to have focused <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues,</b> particularly the irrigation of the Faiyum. This multi-generational project aimed to convert the Faiyum oasis into a productive swath of farmland. Senusret eventually placed his pyramid at the site of el-Lahun, near the junction of the Nile and the Fayuum's major irrigation canal, the Bahr Yussef. He reigned only fifteen years, which is evidenced by the incomplete nature of many of his constructions. His son Senusret III succeeded him.|$|E
25|$|Incumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton was ineligible {{to serve}} a third term due to term {{limitations}} in the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution, and Vice President Gore was able to secure the Democratic nomination with relative ease. Bush {{was seen as the}} early favorite for the Republican nomination and, despite a contentious primary battle with Senator John McCain and other candidates, secured the nomination by Super Tuesday. Bush chose former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his running mate, while Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his. Both major party candidates focused primarily <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues,</b> such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. Clinton and Gore often did not campaign together, a deliberate decision resulting from the Lewinsky sex scandal two years prior.|$|E

25|$|By 1967, {{there were}} nine Polish Americans in Congress {{including}} four from the Chicago area. The three best known were Democrats who specialized in foreign policy, taxes and environmentalism. Clement J. Zablocki of Milwaukee served 1949–83, and became chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee from 1977 {{until his death in}} 1983; although liberal <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues,</b> he was a hawk regarding the Vietnam War. Dan Rostenkowski served 1959–95, and became chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, which writes the tax laws. His father was an influential alderman and party leader from the center of Polonia on the Northwest side of Chicago. Even more influential has been John Dingell of Detroit, who was first elected to Congress in 1955 and is still there (with the second longest tenure on record). A liberal Democrat known for hard-hitting investigations, Dingell has been a major voice in economic, energy, medical and environmental issues. His father John D. Dingell, Sr. held the same seat in Congress from 1933 to 1955. He was the son of Marie and Joseph A. Dzieglewicz, Polish immigrants.|$|E
25|$|Chamberlain's {{eventual}} successor, Winston Churchill, was First Lord of the Admiralty {{during the}} Norwegian Campaign. Originally elected in 1900 as a Conservative MP, {{he had become}} a Liberal Home Secretary and was then First Lord of the Admiralty during World War I. After the failure of the Gallipoli campaign he had been forced to take a more junior post, and then removed from government altogether by the Conservatives before becoming Minister of Munitions under David Lloyd George. After the war, Churchill had served as a Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, before entering the political wilderness. His past views and actions <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues,</b> most notably his very active exertions to break the 1926 United Kingdom general strike, did not make him a natural associate of the Labour Movement. He had vigorously urged various policies outside the political mainstream; when he had first warned against the rise of Germany and argued strongly for rearmament, he had largely been ignored. He had argued against appeasement, even at the height of its popularity.|$|E
500|$|Keating {{followed}} {{the path of}} former Norfolk District Attorney Bill Delahunt to Congress, winning election in 2010 to represent the 10th district. In 2012, after redistricting combined his district with that of fellow incumbent Stephen Lynch, Keating chose {{to run in the}} [...] "incumbent-free" [...] 9th district, where he was elected to a second term. As of the 115th Congress (2017–2018), Keating sits on the House Homeland Security Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee. Much of his work has focused <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues</b> central to his district, such as the fishing industry and nuclear safety.|$|E

500|$|With polls {{released}} on October 6 showing Roosevelt well ahead, Willkie began to sound an isolationist theme, accusing Roosevelt {{of being a}} warmonger. Many of Willkie's speeches to that point had been <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues,</b> {{but he had been}} advised by Martin, Hamilton, and other advisors that the war was the issue the voters really cared about. Willkie began to argue that Roosevelt would not keep the U.S. out of war, but that he would. He was given room to make this argument by the United Kingdom's increasing success in the Battle of Britain, as it was clear a German invasion was not imminent. The polls showed voters responding positively to this new tack, and Willkie kept on this course {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Roosevelt reacted by scheduling five speeches for the final days, in which he proposed to rebut Willkie's [...] "falsifications". The president stated, [...] "I have said again and again and again that your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars." [...] Willkie was prone to ad lib remarks, which sometimes led to gaffes: addressing steelworkers, he pledged to appoint a new Secretary of Labor, [...] "and it will not be a woman either". This allusion to Secretary Frances Perkins, the only woman to hold a cabinet position in American history to that point, did not aid him among female voters.|$|E
500|$|Financial {{problems}} caused Breckinridge to leave William and Mary after {{the spring semester}} in 1784. Because of his studies earlier in the year, he {{had no time to}} campaign for reelection to the House of Delegates, so he asked his brother Joseph and his cousin John Preston to campaign on his behalf. Initially, his prospects seemed favorable, but he was beaten by future Virginia Congressman George Hancock. After the defeat, voters from Montgomery County [...] where Breckinridge had previously been a surveyor [...] chose him to represent them in the House. He was appointed to the prestigious committees on Propositions and Grievances, Courts of Justice, Religion, and Investigation of the Land Offices. His fellow committee members included Henry Tazewell, Carter Henry Harrison, Edward Carrington, Spencer Roane, John Marshall, Richard Bland Lee, and Wilson Cary Nicholas. Inspired by his legislative service, he spent the summer between legislative sessions studying to become a lawyer. The legislative session focused <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues</b> like whether Virginia should establish a tax to benefit religion in the state. Breckinridge was not associated with any denomination, and his writings indicate that he was opposed to such a tax. Instead, he and James Madison secured approval of a religious liberty bill first proposed by Thomas Jefferson over five years earlier. The legislature rose on January 7, 1785, and Breckinridge was admitted to the bar later that year, beginning practice in Charlottesville.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet Union, {{then led}} by Joseph Stalin, became an enemy in the Cold War. Truman oversaw the Berlin Airlift of 1948 and the {{creation}} of NATO in 1949 but was unable to stop Communists from taking over China, and survived unharmed from an assassination attempt in 1950. When communist North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, he sent U.S. troops and gained UN approval for the Korean War. After initial successes in Korea, however, the UN forces were [...] thrown back [...] by Chinese intervention, and the conflict was stalemated throughout the final years of Truman's presidency. [...] <b>On</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues,</b> bills endorsed by Truman often faced opposition from a conservative Congress dominated by the Southern legislators, but his administration was able to successfully guide the American economy through the post-war economic challenges. Truman maintained that civil rights were a moral priority, and in 1948 submitted the first comprehensive civil rights legislation and issued Executive Orders to start racial integration in the military and federal agencies. Allegations were raised of corruption in the Truman administration, linked to certain cabinet members and senior White House staff; this became a central campaign issue in the 1952 presidential election, and helped account for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower's electoral victory. Scholars, starting in 1962, ranked Truman's presidency as [...] "near great"; since then he has been ranked between 5th and 9th in historical rankings of U.S. Presidents.|$|E

2500|$|The Conservatives were re-elected in 1955 and 1959 {{with larger}} majorities. Conservative Prime Ministers Churchill, Sir Anthony Eden, Harold Macmillan and Sir Alec Douglas-Home {{promoted}} relatively liberal trade regulations and less state involvement throughout the 1950s and early-1960s. The Suez Crisis of 1956 was a humiliating defeat for Prime Minister Eden, but his successor, Macmillan; minimised {{the damage and}} focused attention <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>issues</b> and prosperity.

2500|$|Following {{the death}} of Lenin, the Soviet Union was enmeshed in a {{struggle}} for succession that pitted Trotsky and his policy of [...] "world revolution" [...] against Stalin and his policy of [...] "socialism in one country."
