50|$|A higher <b>{{steering}}</b> <b>ratio</b> {{means that}} the steering wheel is turned more to get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn the steering wheel. A lower <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> {{means that the}} steering wheel is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the steering wheel. Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher <b>steering</b> <b>ratio,</b> which will make the steering wheel easier to turn. If a truck had a low <b>steering</b> <b>ratio,</b> it would be very hard to turn the steering wheel. In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The steering wheel is therefore harder to turn.|$|R

50|$|The <b>{{steering}}</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{the ratio}} of the number of degrees of turn of the steering wheel to the number of degrees the wheel(s) turn as a result. In motorcycles, delta tricycles and bicycles, the <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> is always 1:1, because the steering wheel is fixed to the front wheel. A <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> of x:y means that a turn of the steering wheel x degree(s) causes the wheel(s) to turn y degree(s). In most passenger cars, the ratio is between 12:1 and 20:1. For example, if one complete turn of the steering wheel, 360 degrees, causes the wheels to turn 24 degrees, the ratio is then 360:24 = 15:1.|$|R
50|$|The {{cam track}} {{is not a}} regular helix but varies in pitch angle and depth. The {{variation}} in <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> between straight ahead and full lock results from the variance in pitch angle of the track.

To investigate {{the interaction of}} the vehicle and steering system a validated, especially tailored simulation model was developed. Some meaningful vehicle and steering system parameters are altered to show the influence on steering wheel torque, steering feel and understeer. The results underline the importance of an accurate steering system model. Identified measures to improve the centre feel and steering response were a stiffer torsion bar, a higher cornering stiffness or a lower <b>overall</b> <b>steering</b> <b>ratio.</b> The steering response, however, suffers when the centre feel is improved by a higher trail.

40|$|Abstract. To {{introduce}} {{a new type of}} electric power steering system, the structure and working principle of the system were introduced, and the models of the car, the tire and the steering system were established. The assist characteristic of the power steering and the ideal <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> were also designed and optimized. At last, the simulation tests were carried out. The double planetary wheel mechanism is the most important component of the system. With this mechanism, the system synthesizes the force or motion from the steering wheel and the motor. So the power steering and a small <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> can be provided at a low speed, and the <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> can be changed initiatively at a medium or high speed. What’s more, the steering ability still exists when there is a fault in the system. The simulation results show this steering system can effectively improve the steering portability, low-speed sensitivity, and the vehicle handling stability...|$|R

40|$|Sensitivity {{analysis}} methods are investigated for the optimal design of multibody systems. In order {{to overcome the}} shortcomings inherent in existing methods, a "mixed" method is developed. The beneficial features of the finite difference and the direct differentiation methods, and equations of motion in the joint coordinates are employed in this method. As a realistic application of the sensitivity analysis, a Four-Wheel-Steering vehicle with complete suspension systems and comprehensive analytical tire model is implemented. This model keeps full nonlinearity in the governing equations of motion for accuracy, and it is simulated using an existing general-purpose multibody dynamics simulation package. However, by using the transient dynamic analysis of the nonlinear model, optimal design parameters are dependent on driving scenarios. Therefore, the transient behavior {{of the system is}} represented by a series of steady state configurations. Hence, a steady state analysis procedure which finds a steady state configuration from an arbitrary initial condition is developed. By using the steady state analysis and the sensitivity analysis, the optimal <b>steering</b> <b>ratios</b> between the angles of the front and the rear wheels are obtained over various driving conditions. A steering control strategy is developed for the vehicle simulation to follow a prescribed path. Finally, the simulation results using the optimal <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> are compared against the results of the conventional two-wheel steering and the <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> based on the linear bicycle model...|$|R

40|$|The vehicle {{stability}} {{has become}} more and more important with the vehicle speed increasing. To improve the vehicle stability, two active steer technologies, four-wheel-steer and steer-by-wire, have been developed. Both of four-wheel-steer and steer-by-wire can improve the vehicle handling performance through the rear wheel angle and the variable <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> respectively. Thee linear two-degree-of-freedom vehicle model is used to express the vehicle dynamics. Firstly, a new rear wheel angle formula is computed to reduce the steady sideslip angle to zero. It is proved that the steer system with four-wheel-steer will always be stable regardless of the vehicle parameters. Secondly, according to the steady steering sensitivity gain, the <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> formulas of front-wheel-steer and four-wheel-steer are Computed to keep the steady steering sensitivity gain to be the constant. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods...|$|R
50|$|In {{a parking}} situation, the {{computer}} varies the ratio {{so that the}} steering wheel needs fewer than two full turns to move the wheels lock to lock. As vehicle speeds increase, the <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> increases, so it takes larger movements of the steering wheel to move the wheels and that lessens the usually increasing vehicle response resulting from increased speed.|$|R
50|$|This {{system should}} not be {{confused}} with variable assist power steering, which varies steering assist torque, not <b>steering</b> <b>ratios,</b> nor with systems where the gear ratio is only varied as a function of steering angle.
