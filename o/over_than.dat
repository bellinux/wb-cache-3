25|$|Although Lanying was sorrowful {{about her}} father’s death, she began {{working at the}} age of 60 after the Culture Revolution. She found that the {{dislocation}} density of existing gallium arsenide was very large due to gravity and not good enough to use, so she decided to make the experiment in artificial satellites. This was a dangerous experiment because the melting point of gallium arsenide is 1238 Celsius degrees. However, she finished successfully and became the first person in the world who had made this experiment successfully. Because of this work in gallium arsenide, the government in China named a gallium arsenide company(Chinese: 中科稼英) after her in 2001.

2500|$|Mortaza {{enhanced}} {{his reputation}} on Bangladesh's inaugural tour of England, {{and was the}} team's leading bowler, although his team lost the two-match Test series 2–0.
