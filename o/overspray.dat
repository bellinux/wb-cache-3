30|$|The {{consequence}} is that amphibians can {{be exposed to}} glyphosate-based herbicides throughout much of their annual activity cycle. This can be manifested as follows: Adult breeding migration to ponds across fields in spring can coincide with <b>overspraying,</b> thus affecting the breeding population. Similarly, later in spring or summer, adults can be affected by applications when they cross field during the return from the pond to the summer habitats. Likewise, freshly metamorphosed juveniles often emerge in masses after summer rains and can be <b>oversprayed</b> during emigration [5]. Moreover, eggs and larval stages can be exposed to glyphosate-based herbicides due to surface water runoff and drift during larval development from early spring to summer [8],[12].|$|R
30|$|Many of the glyphosate-based {{herbicide}} formulations available {{have been}} shown to stress amphibians [8]. Acute toxic, chronic and delayed effects at environmentally relevant and sublethal concentrations {{have been shown}} [8]. All amphibian life stages can suffer from glyphosate-based herbicides, with direct <b>overspraying</b> of migrating or resting terrestrial life stages (i.e. adults and juveniles) being a major threat [5],[8]. Rapid mortal effects on aquatic larval stages have been demonstrated, mainly within the first 24  h after contamination [4]. Therefore, the relatively fast adsorption behaviour of glyphosate and its surfactants on soil and sediment, as well as the observed fast microbial degradation, cannot prevent acute toxic effects [4],[8]. We suggest that direct contact of individuals with formulations (e.g. <b>overspraying</b> of adults and juveniles; first peak concentrations in breeding sites, for instance, after the first heavy rainfalls) is most relevant.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{disadvantages}} to the gas atomisation spray forming process. The most significant disadvantage is the relatively low process yield with typical losses of ~30%. Losses occur because of <b>overspray</b> (droplets missing the emerging billet), splashing of material from the billet surface, and material ‘bouncing’ off the semi-solid top surface. Many operators of the spray forming process now use a particle injector system to re-inject the <b>overspray</b> powder, and thus recycle material {{that would otherwise be}} lost, or sell the <b>overspray</b> powder as a product in its own right. The second major disadvantage is one of process control. As it is essentially a free-forming process with many interdependent variables, it has proved difficult to predict the shape, porosity or deposition rate for a given alloy. Much of the control is based on operator experience and empirical relationships. It is partly the process complexity and lack of robust process control that has prevented the widespread commercialisation of this process. Some developments using feed-back control have proved successful in improving the variations in billet diameter and improving yield in specific systems but these have yet to find widespread implementation.|$|E

Johnsongrass, together with Canada thistle, represents Indiana’s most serious noxious weed invader where the need for control is mandated by law. Combined target-directed laboratory and greenhouse studies identified a new candidate herbicide, Outrider, which when combined with a new additive designated TR-IV gives eradication of Johnsongrass when applied to plants after less than 20 inches (70 cm) of growth or regrowth following mowing. The combination does not harm <b>oversprayed</b> established fescue or bluegrass. Based on limited implementation activities (two years experience), the recommendation is as a spot treatment.

5000|$|The {{spray angle}} diverges or converges {{with respect to}} the {{vertical}} axis. As illustrated in the figure below, the spray angle tends to collapse or diverge with increasing distance from the orifice. Spray coverage varies with spray angle. The theoretical coverage, C, of spray patterns at various distances may be calculated with the equation below for spray angles less than 180 degrees. The spray angle is assumed to remain constant throughout the entire spray distance. Liquids more viscous than water form smaller spray angles, or solid streams, depending upon nozzle capacity, spray pressure, and viscosity. Liquids with surface tensions lower than water produce wider spray angles than those listed for water. Spray angles are typically measured using optical or mechanical methods. The optical methods include shadowgraphy, extinction tomography, and Mie Imaging. [...] Sprays angles are important in coating applications to prevent <b>overspraying</b> of the coated materials, in combustion engines to prevent wetting of the cylinder walls, and in fire sprinklers to provide adequate coverage of the protected property.|$|R
40|$|To the Editor: Detection of {{morphine}} at low concen-trations in urine {{is very important}} to laboratories that use thin-layer chro-matography (TLC) as a major screen-ing procedure and to those that use hydrolysis followed by TLC for analy-sis of the drug. It is also important when TLC is used in conjunction with an immunoassay as an initial screen-ing procedure. Detection of free morphine by TLC very often depends on the experience that a technician has had in interpret-ing chromatography plates. Even ex-perienced technicians can miss con-centrations of 0. 5 to 1. 5 mg/liter if a plate has been <b>oversprayed</b> or other-wise altered by any one of the many “lab accidents ” that almost every toxi-cology lab has experienced with TLC plates. We find transmitted high-intensity light to be indispensable for the visu-alization {{of morphine}}. It is used rou-tinely for every plate and is especially useful for hydrolyzed samples. We hold the plates about six inches from the light source so that light shines through the layer. We find the proce-dure to be most effective when the layer is on top.

This procedure has saved countless hours of confirmation time; it is reli-able and is sensitive to at least 0. 5 rng of free morphine per liter...|$|R
40|$|Various {{factors have}} {{lead to a}} number of poor {{performing}} runway seals in recent years. If airport-specific functional requirements are not addressed and taken into account during the seal design and construction process, then the result will not be suited to sustained aircraft operations. Based on experiences at Weipa and Prominent Hill airports, a number of key lessons can be learnt and applied to future airport sealing projects, including: Binder application and aggregate spread rates must be set during a seal trial and the trial must be considered {{to be a part of}} the design process and must include the designer; The use of 14 mm and 10 mm sized seals, with sanded-emulsion <b>oversprays,</b> should be adopted in preference over smaller (5 mm and 7 mm) sized seals to minimise the risk of aggregate stripping and binder flushing; Sealing works should not be attempted at night and there should be no requirement to perform multiple seal layers in a single shift; The spraying operation must be curtailed to ensure that an appropriate level of seal rolling is performed each work shift; Where the client’s representative retains the authority for setting or approving binder application and aggregate spread rates, it is unreasonable to expect the contractor to retain the risk for defects resulting from inappropriate binder and aggregate rate selection. The resurfacing of Cocos Island airport is considered to be a fine example of an airport sprayed seal. The excellent outcome can be attributed to a collaborative approach between the designer’s and contractor’s technical specialists during a thorough seal trial process, that catered specifically for the various areas of differing surface and traffic conditions...|$|R

Quality assurance was performed in eight VL endemic districts in Bihar State, India, in 2014. Residual dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was sampled from walls using Bostik tape discs, and DDT concentrations [grams of active ingredient per square meter (g ai/m 2) ] were determined using HPLC.

Vector densities were measured: pre-IRS and 1 and 3 mo post-IRS. Insecticide susceptibility to 4 % DDT and 0. 05 % deltamethrin WHO-impregnated papers was determined with wild-caught sand flies. The majority (329 of 360, 91. 3 %) of pre-IRS samples had residual DDT concentrations of < 0. 1 g ai/m 2.
