5|$|More recent {{research}} has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices; blindfold chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> has led to much {{recent research}}. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> in chess. Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere {{are more likely to have}} been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to general population, chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Taub, {{using his}} {{experience}} as a plastic surgeon, gains Kenny's and his father's trust and frequently clashes with House on the diagnosis. House believes Kenny is suffering juvenile rheumatoid arthritis while Taub believes it is merely the side effects of increased intracranial pressure. By persuading Kenny's father not to follow House's treatment and by attempting to kick him off the case, House fires Taub, only to have his decision reversed by Cuddy. Ultimately both House and Taub are proven wrong when Thirteen realizes Kenny is suffering Lyme disease, with the telltale rash hidden by his hair. Incensed by Taub's actions, House begins to dig into his life, and gets him to confess that he resigned his old position as a plastic surgeon because he was discovered having a secret affair with his nurse. He signed a non-compete agreement with his former partners in exchange for their keeping quiet about the affair, effectively blackballing him out of his area <b>of</b> <b>expertise.</b>|$|E

The 'Northern Pindus Management Body', together with the local forest service, is responsible for regulating human activities and maintaining the ecological value of the protected area.

5|$|The Dixie Mission had {{consequences}} for individuals, {{and for the}} nation. Many participants were accused of being communists, such as John Davies and John Service.

This did not spare Service from termination at the State Department. He appealed this decision and ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in his favor. Davies was exiled from China, his field <b>of</b> <b>expertise,</b> by Hurley. Then he was hounded from a position in Russia to an inconsequential post in South America. Davies resigned that position and began manufacturing furniture. Hurley accused Colonel David Barrett of sabotaging his diplomacy with the KMT and the CPC.

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 100 p. An experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of task complexity and variability <b>of</b> perceived <b>expertise</b> on the pattern of communication in decision-making groups. It was hypothesized that groups would tend to use a relatively centralized communication structure when performing simple tasks and a relatively decentralized structure while performing more complex tasks. It was also hypothesized that groups with high variability in perceived <b>expertise</b> <b>of</b> group members would develop a centralized structure, whereas groups with low variability in perceived <b>expertise</b> <b>of</b> group members would tend to develop a decentralized structure of communication. In addition, the effect of task complexity on the emergence of communication structure was expected to depend on the level <b>of</b> perceived <b>expertise</b> variability. Specifically, differences in the degree of centralization between simple and complex tasks under conditions <b>of</b> high perceived <b>expertise</b> variability were expected to be much less pronounced than differences in the degree of centralization between simple and complex tasks under conditions <b>of</b> low perceived <b>expertise</b> variability. These predictions were tested using a 2 (low variability <b>of</b> perceived <b>expertise</b> versus high variability <b>of</b> perceived <b>expertise)</b> x 2 (low-task complexity versus high-task complexity) factorial design. Task complexity was varied between groups by administering a task that allowed the manipulation of goals, pathways to these goals, and the information processing requirements inherent in the task. Perceived expertise variability was manipulated by providing false feedback to group members to create either the perception of highly discrepant task expertise among members, in the high-variability condition, or the perception <b>of</b> near-equal <b>expertise</b> among members, in the low-variability condition. As predicted, results communication in groups in low-task complexity conditions tended to be more centralized than communication in high-task complexity conditions. Also, communication in groups in high perceived expertise variability conditions tended to be more centralized than communication in low perceived expertise variability conditions. However, the anticipated Task Complexity x Variability <b>of</b> Perceived <b>Expertise</b> interaction, with the effect of task complexity on the emergence of communication structure expected to depend on the level <b>of</b> perceived <b>expertise</b> variability, was not supported...|$|R

5|$|There is an {{extensive}} scientific literature on chess psychology. Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability {{lies at the}} core <b>of</b> <b>expertise.</b> In his doctoral thesis, Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position. According to de Groot, this perception, made possible by years of practice and study, {{is more important than}} the sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about half a dozen positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the journal}} Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago {{writes that the}} Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an {{obstacle}} to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, {{since the publication of}} the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack <b>of</b> <b>expertise</b> and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.|$|E
