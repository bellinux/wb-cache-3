40|$|Retroreflective {{pavement}} markings enhance {{road safety}} by increasing visibility of roadway delineation for road users. In most countries, authorities responsible for road safety {{do not have}} performance intervention criteria and standards, and rely on fixed-time interval maintenance programs. This practice is undergoing change via the introduction of mobile retroreflectivity <b>recording</b> <b>units.</b> The focus {{of this study is}} to investigate the use of standard mobile retroreflectivity <b>recording</b> <b>units</b> and to analyse the observed retroreflectivity data to evaluate the state of pavement markings under investigation. The centreline pavement marking retrorefl/ectivity data collected by Queensland Department of Main Roads using the ECODYN mobile retroreflectivity <b>recording</b> <b>unit</b> are analysed to determine how the factors such as pavement surface type and traffic environment relate to retroreflectivity performance. It has been found that the mobile retroreflectivity <b>recording</b> <b>unit</b> with in-built processing capabilities can be implemented for identifying the requirements of maintenance programs, as well as to relate the observed retroreflectivity with other factors such as pavement surface type and traffic environment. The observed data indicated that there is a disparity between urban and rural roads of southeast Queensland in terms of centreline pavement marking retroreflectivity qualities. Asphalt surfaces, common in urban environments, were found to have average retroreflectivity over 200 mcd/m 2 /lux, whereas sprayed seal surfaces, common in rural environments, averaged below 170 mcd/m 2 /lux. About one-third of the roads used in the analysis fell below the generally accepted minimum threshold of 150 mcd/m 2 /lux at the time of observation...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} importance of systematically <b>recording</b> <b>occupational</b> histories of patients admitted to an internal medicine unit of a university hospital. Detailed information on current and past employment was obtained with questionnaires and in personal interviews from 200 inpatients over a 12 -month period. Twenty-one patients (10. 5 %) were considered to have a "primary illness" (condition causing hospital admission) probably (4. 5 %) or possibly (6 %) related to their current or previous occupation. From the 786 primary and secondary illness and medical antecedents diagnosed for the 200 patients examined, 70 illnesses of 55 patients were considered probably or possibly related to current or previous occupation. This pilot study emphasizes the need for accurate <b>occupational</b> <b>records</b> for patients in an internal medicine ward. This task is best performed by an appropriately trained occupational physician...|$|R
40|$|This thesis has {{analyzed}} {{the relationship between}} the punitive turn and the crime policies of the Green party (Miljöpartiet de Gröna) and the Sweden democrats (Sverigedemokraterna) to answer the research question; what influence the punitive turn has had on the parties policies. The choice of method has fallen on a quantitative content-analysis with a qualitative complementarity and qualitative facilitation. From an account of the punitive turn has a word-list with <b>recording</b> <b>units</b> been created, of those <b>recording</b> <b>units</b> has a computer-search been made of the two parties most recent official documents which accounts for the parties holistic politics; MP´s Partyprogramme from 2013, and SD´s Principleprogramme from 2011. The result of the qualitative complementarity shows; a greater frequency of <b>recording</b> <b>units</b> for MP than for SD. The analysis of the qualitative facilitation-result shows; a lesser direct influence of the punitive turn for MP than for SD. The result and analysis are discussed regarding whether the research question has been answered, and no such conclusion is considered to be made by the researcher, instead are the result and analysis open for interpretation of the reader...|$|R
