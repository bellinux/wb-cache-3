5|$|Cannibal is {{the debut}} {{extended}} play (EP) by American recording artist Kesha, released on November 19, 2010. The EP is a follow-up companion to her debut album, Animal. Originally, the record {{was thought to}} be released as a deluxe edition of Animal, but was instead sold and released as both an EP and a deluxe edition of Animal. Kesha worked with a variety of producers and writers such as executive producer Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Ammo, Max Martin, Bangladesh and others. Musically, the songs on Cannibal are of the dance-pop genre, with some songs incorporating elements of electro and electropop in their production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of Auto-Tune and vocoders is prominent. Lyrically, the songs on Cannibal speak of ignoring judgement <b>or</b> <b>hate</b> and experiences based on love and heartbreak.|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. [...] Freddie W. of RPGFan, while calling the album [...] "pretty good" [...] overall, said {{that several of}} the tracks including [...] "Zeal Palace" [...] and [...] "Warlock Battle" [...] were [...] "absolutely horrible" [...] due to the [...] "disgustingly bad" [...] distorted guitars.

He concluded, however, that he could not seem to [...] "connect" [...] with the album, and that the CD was [...] "very much down to personal taste — a love <b>or</b> <b>hate</b> arrangement".|$|E
500|$|... "Homer's Enemy" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, {{directed}} by Jim Reardon and executive produced by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein.

500|$|The film {{received}} generally positive {{reviews in}} Brazil.

[...] EMI India met with the CSF, apologising for the album's release, and recalled all copies, with no plans for a reissue. On October 11, 2006, it was announced all stocks had been destroyed. The track, alongside the album's controversial Larry Carroll painted cover art and provocative lyrics, were the specific reasons for EMI India's decision. Araya had expected [...] "Jihad"'s treatment {{of the events of}} 9/11 to create a backlash in America, however it failed to materialise. This was in part, he believes, because of peoples' view that the song was merely [...] "Slayer being Slayer".
