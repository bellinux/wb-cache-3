5|$|His past {{experience}} and the credibility derived from his time in Japan brought him a large clientele of <b>opulent</b> locals, posing in traditional attire for official portraits. Other images, from Buddhas to landscapes and buildings, were sold from master albums in Burma and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's <b>opulent</b> lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster House, an <b>opulent</b> government-owned period {{house in}} London, was rented (at £20,000 per day) for {{interior}} scenes of Buckingham Palace. The 1936 Accession Council at St. James's Palace, where George VI swore an oath, was filmed in the Livery Hall of Drapers' Hall. The room, ornate and vast, met the occasion: the daunting {{nature of the}} new King's responsibilities was shown by surrounding him with rich detail, flags and royal portraiture.|$|E
5|$|Later {{many other}} Sicilian {{towns and cities}} which had been either little damaged or {{completely}} untouched by the quake, such as Palermo, were also transformed by the Baroque style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital to be as <b>opulent</b> as that in the second city. In Palermo the , began in 1566, {{was one of many}} in the city to be redecorated inside in the 18th century in the Baroque style, with coloured marbles.|$|E
5|$|No {{one took}} over as {{paramount}} chief upon Atangana's death. His <b>opulent</b> palace went unoccupied and fell into ruins. However, traditional Cameroonian chieftaincies were re-established on 11 July 1977 by Decree #77/609, and by the 1990s, Cameroonian ethnic groups had rejuvenated these dormant traditions. Atangana's daughter Marie-Thérèse became the new Ewondo paramount chief. In December 2000, she began the renovation of his palace at Efoulan, Yaoundé, a project that would cost an estimated 150,000,000 francsCFA.|$|E
5|$|Production {{was led by}} West himself, {{alongside}} a variety of high-profile record producers including Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink and DJ Frank E. Noted by critics for its maximalist aesthetic, <b>opulent</b> production quality, and dichotomous themes, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates aspects of West's previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, and explores such issues as consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream.|$|E
5|$|After {{some initial}} resistance, the Duke yields to Süß's {{request for the}} repeal of the law prohibiting Jews from living in Württemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city. Süß enables them to enrich {{themselves}} {{at the expense of the}} populace. The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his excessively <b>opulent</b> lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, warning that, “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{was known}} for his extravagant tastes and <b>opulent</b> lifestyle, as well as his {{possession}} of a large library. He had a son, Henry, {{who was one of the}} hostages demanded by Longchamp in 1190. Another son was Hugh, who became chancellor for King Philip II of France. Both Henry and Hugh were the sons of the bishop's long term mistress, Alice de Percy. Alice may have been the mother of two more of the bishop's sons, William, archdeacon of Northumberland, and Burchard, archdeacon of Durham and treasurer of York. He had a number of other mistresses but Alice was the most public, so much so that it caused a scandal, and closely resembled a marriage.|$|E
5|$|NYU houses {{approximately}} 11,000 {{undergraduate and}} graduate residents, and had the seventh-largest university housing system in the U.S. as of 2007, {{and one of the}} largest among private schools. NYU's undergraduate housing system consists of more than 20 residence halls. Uniquely, many of NYU's residence halls are converted apartment complexes or old hotels. In general, NYU residence halls receive favorable ratings, and some are <b>opulent.</b> Many rooms are spacious and contain amenities considered rare for individual college residence hall rooms, such as kitchens, lavatories, living rooms and common areas. The university operates its own transit system to transport its students by bus to its campus.|$|E

While learning to navigate through Parisian society, Barbara remains in love with her husband but Roger has no thoughts at all for his young bride other than mere fondness.|$|E
5|$|The Foster–Payne House is a {{historic}} house at 25 Belmont Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Built in 1878, the two-story multi-gabled house is distinguished by its clapboarded and exterior woodwork and <b>opulent</b> parlors in the interior. The property also has a matching carriagehouse with gable roof and cupola. The house was originally constructed and owned by Theodore Waters Foster, but it was sold to George W. Payne in 1882. The Foster–Payne House is architecturally significant as a well-designed and well-preserved late 19th century suburban residence. It {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{arrangement of}} the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor presiding in his <b>opulent</b> box; senators and equestrians watching from the advantageous seats reserved for them; women seated at a remove from the action; slaves given the worst places, and everybody else packed in-between. The crowd could call for an outcome by booing or cheering, but the emperor had the final say. Spectacles could quickly become sites {{of social and political}} protest, and emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest, most notoriously at the Nika riots in the year 532, when troops under Justinian slaughtered thousands.|$|E
5|$|Transformed, Chapman's Arsenal claimed {{their first}} {{national}} trophy, the FA Cup, in 1930. Two League Championships followed, in 1930–31 and 1932–33. Chapman also presided over multiple off the pitch changes: white sleeves and shirt numbers {{were added to}} the kit; a Tube station was named after the club; and the first of two <b>opulent,</b> Art Deco stands was completed, with some of the first floodlights in English football. Suddenly, {{in the middle of the}} 1933–34 season, Chapman died of pneumonia. His work was left to Joe Shaw and George Allison, who saw out a hat-trick with the 1933–34 and 1934–35 titles, and then won the 1936 FA Cup and 1937–38 title.|$|E
5|$|Aged 76, {{he faced}} various ailments, and {{although}} exhibiting continued energy, he felt isolated and lonely. He often entertained celebrities, such as Michael Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, and the Spice Girls, and befriended ultra-rich businessmen, like Harry Oppenheimer of Anglo-American {{as well as}} Queen Elizabeth II on her March 1995 state visit to South Africa, resulting in strong criticism from ANC anti-capitalists. Despite his <b>opulent</b> surroundings, Mandela lived simply, donating {{a third of his}} R 552,000 annual income to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, which he had founded in 1995. Although dismantling press censorship, speaking out in favour of freedom of the press, and befriending many journalists, Mandela was critical of much of the country's media, noting that it was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle-class whites and believing that it focused too heavily on scaremongering about crime.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} of its development, Sicilian Baroque still lacked the freedom of style that it was later to acquire. Giovanni Battista Vaccarini was the leading Sicilian {{architect}} during this period. He arrived on the island in 1730 bringing with him a fusion of the concepts of Bernini and Borromini, and introduced to the island's architecture a unified movement and a play of curves, {{which would have been}} unacceptable in Rome itself. However, his works are considered of lesser quality than that which was to come. Notable works which date from this period are the 18th century wings of the Palazzo Biscari at Catania; and Vaccarini's church of Santa Agata, also in Catania. On this building Vaccarini quite clearly copied the capitals from Guarino Guarini's Architettura Civile. It is this frequent copying of established designs that causes the architecture from this period, while <b>opulent,</b> also to be disciplined and almost reined in. Vaccarini's style was to dominate Catania for the next decades.|$|E
5|$|Between 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, {{film and}} stage {{productions}} appeared. The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. It {{has long been}} said that a Hollywood adaptation was first suggested by the entertainer Harpo Marx, who had seen a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy. Directed by Robert Z. Leonard and written {{in collaboration with the}} English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original. Filmed in a studio and in black and white, the story's setting was relocated to the 1830s with <b>opulent</b> costume designs.|$|E
5|$|Carr Hill House was {{the largest}} estate in the village; a {{freehold}} mansion house on Carr Hill Lane. The date of building is unknown, {{but it does not}} appear on an enclosure map of 1766, suggesting it was built after that date. There is strong evidence that it was once a lunatic asylum; in 1770 an advertisement in a local newspaper declared:LUNATICKSCarr's Hill House on Gateshead Fell To The Public We beg Leave to inform the Public that we have opened the above HOUSE pleasantly situated about a mile distant from Newcastle, which we have fitted up in an elegant manner, with every Accommodation for the reception of LUNATICKS in genteel or <b>opulent</b> circumstances: in this House Persons entrusted to our Care shall be treated with the utmost Attention and Humanity. The terms are reasonable. R. Lambert, W. Keenlyside, H Gibson, R. Stoddard (surgeons to the Infirmary), Newcastle 1767.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept {{that there should be a}} large <b>opulent</b> hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E
25|$|Collectively {{known as}} gungjung eumsik during the pre-modern era, the foods {{of the royal}} palace were {{reflective}} of the <b>opulent</b> nature of the past rulers of the Korean peninsula. This nature is evidenced in examples {{as far back as}} the Silla kingdom, where a man-made lake (Anapji Lake, located in Gyeongju), was created with multiple pavilions and halls for the sole purpose of <b>opulent</b> banquets, and a spring fed channel, Poseokjeong, was created for the singular purpose of setting wine cups afloat while they wrote poems.|$|E
25|$|Technology permitting, Robert Denning would happily {{return to}} the nineteenth century. Since he can't, he devotes himself to re-creating– with {{international}} mixes of <b>opulent</b> furniture– the sumptuous interiors of his favorite era, using damask, silks, and taffetas.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rise}} of state-subsidised theatre and avant-garde plays from the mid-1950s onwards, Beaumont's genre of <b>opulent</b> {{productions}} of safe repertoire started to seem conventional. He recognised this by serving {{on the board of}} the new National Theatre during the last decade of his life.|$|E
25|$|Cyfarthfa, {{the former}} {{home of the}} ironmaster William Crawshay II, an <b>opulent</b> mock-castle, is now a museum.

25|$|The <b>opulent</b> Penobscot {{is one of}} many {{buildings}} in Detroit that features architectural sculpture by Corrado Parducci. The ornamentation includes American Indian motifs, particularly in the entrance archway and in metalwork found in the lobby. At night, the building's upper floors are lit in floodlight fashion, topped with a red sphere.|$|E
25|$|The hotel's Main Lobby was {{dramatic}} and <b>opulent</b> with {{green and gold}} decorations, carrying the theme through its carpets and drapes. It was furbished with marble throughout: floors, statues and a desk. Accents included brass fixtures and spittoons. There were over-sized, upholstered chairs, as well as shorter ones for women and children.|$|E
25|$|Bristol and Providence began a {{tradition}} of luxury travel on Narragansett Bay that would remain a popular attraction to travellers for the next fifty years.

25|$|In the 1950s, Daimler {{tried to}} widen its appeal {{with a line}} of smaller cars {{at one end and}} <b>opulent</b> show cars at the other, stopped making Lanchesters, had a highly publicised removal of their {{chairman}} from the board, and developed and sold a sports car and a high-performance luxury saloon and limousine.|$|E
25|$|Despite its Miami setting, much of {{the film}} was {{actually}} shot in Los Angeles, as the Miami Tourist board was afraid that the film would deter tourism with its depiction of {{the state as a}} haven for drugs and gangsters. Tony's <b>opulent</b> Miami mansion was portrayed by El Fureidis, a Roman-styled mansion in Santa Barbara, California.|$|E
25|$|The novel {{served as}} the basis for a film {{directed}} by Luchino Visconti. Starring Burt Lancaster, Visconti's film {{has been described as a}} fresco of Sicilian life because of its <b>opulent</b> recreation of life. The saturated colours, cinematography, and Visconti's renowned attention to detail all helped make it the winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|Every wall, {{window and}} ceiling was {{decorated}} in ornate style, with soaring pillars, wood panelling and elaborate stucco featuring gambolling cherubs. Its grand saloon used 50 types of marble {{to create a}} magnificent bar-top, archways, an enormous fireplace and soaring pillars, which in turn supported the <b>opulent</b> part-gilded beamed ceiling. Even the chimney and walls were faced with marble.|$|E
25|$|The {{deal was}} done and the A's were gone. In early 1955, two trucks backed up to the stadium and packed the {{artifacts}} from the Elephant Room for removal to Kansas City. Carpenter graciously encouraged Mr. Mack to continue using his <b>opulent</b> tower office in the stadium that now bore his name, which he did almost daily until his death some 13 months later.|$|E
25|$|In {{a number}} of his short stories and sketches, Caragiale makes use of another {{particularly}} Junimist theme, and investigates the glamorous but superficial impact of modernization on high society. In one sketch, a couple of ladies dine in an <b>opulent</b> salon, while cursing their maid, gossiping, and showing interest in vulgar subjects. The characters in these writings tend to resemble each other, evidencing the generic traits of the well-to-do.|$|E
25|$|In the 20's, No Man's Land. an unincorporated {{area to the}} north, {{experienced}} a period of tremendous exhuberance. The Spanish Court, one of the nation's earliest automobile-centered shopping developments, was constructed in No Man's Land. Building began on such private clubs as the Miralago Ballroom, an early Art Deco building designed by George Fred Keck, which opened in 1929. Teatro del Lago, an <b>opulent</b> movie house, opened in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Achaemenid {{architectural}} heritage, {{beginning with}} {{the expansion of the}} empire around 550 B.C.E., was a period of artistic growth that left an extraordinary architectural legacy ranging from Cyrus the Great's solemn tomb in Pasargadae to the splendid structures of the <b>opulent</b> city of Persepolis. With the advent of the second Persian Empire, the Sassanid dynasty (224–624 C.E.), revived Achaemenid tradition by construction of temples dedicated to fire, and monumental palaces.|$|E
25|$|Barnum built four mansions in Bridgeport, Connecticut: Iranistan, Lindencroft, Waldemere, and Marina. Iranistan was {{the most}} notable: a fanciful and <b>opulent</b> Moorish Revival splendor {{designed}} by Leopold Eidlitz with domes, spires and lacy fretwork, inspired by the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, England. This mansion was built 1848 but burned down in 1857. The Marina Mansion was demolished by the University of Bridgeport {{in order to build}} their cafeteria.|$|E
25|$|Belli's sacred music {{includes}} psalm settings, Magnificats, Sacrae cantiones (sacred songs, {{similar to}} madrigali spirituali, but in Belli's case {{for up to}} 10 voices), and a lost book of masses. Stylistically these are both contrapuntal, {{in the manner of}} Palestrina, and occasionally polychoral, in the manner of the Venetian School, though without the <b>opulent</b> use of instrumental color and echo effects characteristic of the music of the Venetians.|$|E
25|$|Daimler and Lanchester (there {{were no more}} BSA cars) {{struggled}} {{after the}} War, producing too many models with short runs and limited production, and frequently selling too few of each model, while Jaguar seemed {{to know what the}} public wanted and expanded rapidly. Daimler produced heavy, staid, large and small luxury cars with a stuffy, if sometimes <b>opulent</b> image. Jaguar produced lower quality cars at a remarkably low price, designed for enthusiasts.|$|E
