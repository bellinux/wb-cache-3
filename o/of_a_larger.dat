5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata is {{classified}} in the subgenus Amanita of the genus Amanita, according to the systems proposed by Cornelis Bas (1969), and Rolf Singer (1986). It was one of 49 Amanita species included in a 1998 molecular phylogenetic analysis intended to help clarify natural groups and phylogenetic relationships within the genus. In the cladogram, A.rubrovolvata is on a branch next to a cluster of species including A.pantherina var. lutea, A.gemmata, A.farinosa, and A.sinensis. These results were comparable to those published in later phylogenetic analyses (1999, 2004, 2010) that have included A.rubrovolata as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> dataset.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness.
