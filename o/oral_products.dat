The questionnaire comprised close- and open-ended questions designed to collect information on the housewives’ socio-econmic background, oral hygiene habits, and selection criteria for <b>oral</b> hygiene <b>products.</b> Results: A total of 340 housewives participated in this study. Most (59 %) of them had attended secondary school and only 4 % had attained tertiary education level. Nearly all (99. 7 %) of the housewives brushed their teeth with a toothbrush daily and most (82 %) brushed twice a day.

40|$|AbstractGovernments that procure {{pharmaceutical}} products from an Essential Medicine List (EML) bear special {{responsibility for the}} quality of these products. In this article we examine the possibility of developing a pharmaceutical product quality risk assessment scheme for use by government procurement officials. We use the Chinese EML as a basis, and US recall data is examined as it is publically available. This is justified as the article is only concerned with inherent product quality risks. After establishing a link between Chinese essential medicines and those available in the US, we examine US recall data to separate product specific recalls. We conclude that, in addition to existing manufacturing based risks, there are two other product specific risks that stand out from all others, degradation and dissolution failure. Methodology for relative product risk for degradation is needed to be developed and further work is required to better understand dissolution failures which largely occur with modified-release solid <b>oral</b> <b>products.</b> We conclude that a product specific quality risk profile would be enhanced by including a risk assessment for degradation for all products, {{and in the case of}} solid <b>oral</b> <b>products,</b> dissolution...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of multi-resistant bacteria {{is of great}} concern in hospital environments and society and it is therefore becoming increasingly important to develop new treatment strategies.

40|$|Abstract 11 Chlorhexidine is an {{effective}} antiseptic used widely in disinfecting products (hand soap), <b>oral</b> <b>products</b> (mouthwash), and {{is known to have}} potential applications in the textile industry. Chlorhexidine has been studied extensively through a biological and biochemical lens, showing evidence that it attacks the semipermeable membrane in bacterial cells. Although extremely lethal to bacterial cells, the present understanding of the exact mode of action of chlorhexidine is incomplete. A biophysical approach has been taken to investigate the potential location of chlorhexidine in the lipid bilayer. Deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance was used to characterize the molecular arrangement of mixed phospholipid/drug formulations. Powder spectra were analyzed using the de-Pake-ing technique, a method capable of extracting both the orientation distribution and the anisotropy distribution functions simultaneously. The results from samples of protonated phospholipids mixed with deuterium-labelled chlorhexidine are compared to those from samples of deuterate...|$|E
