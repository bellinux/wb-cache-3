40|$|In {{carrying}} out the study the author set out to develop knowledge of the statutory and design requirements for converting a 77 foot cruising yacht into an <b>offshore</b> <b>sail</b> training vessel operating, under the United Kingdom flag. The paper that follows discusses the suitability of the yacht for its proposed use, describes the design development process undertaken, identifies the main regulatory issues and proposes essential modifications required for the yacht to be operated safely offshore. To assess the yacht’s general suitability for sail training purposes a preconversion evaluation was undertaken to establish initial stability characteristics, accommodation requirements, likely cost considerations, appropriate tankage capacities, estimated speed, range, confirmation of the installed power requirement and suitability of the existing sail plan. For calculation of the data presented in the paper various analytical methods were employed based {{on a combination of}} first principles engineering methodologies and those defined by the regulatory authorities. Having established the suitability of the vessel for the intended purpose detailed analysis was undertaken to assess compliance with the main regulatory requirements for intact stability, damage stability and structural safety of the yacht which also included analysis of the rig engineering. The findings of the study concluded that with the reconfiguration of the interior and addition of watertight bulkheads/doors the vessel would be suitable for use as an <b>offshore</b> <b>sail</b> training yacht. However, as the investigation was conducted with data and drawings supplied from the builder and without viewing the yacht it was recommended that a full pre-purchase survey and inclining experiment be conducted. The objective of the survey being to confirm the yacht’s overall condition and assess its investment potential, with the inclining experiment being conducted to confirm that the results obtained from the inclining test were in line with those presented in the paper. Having assessed the evidence discussed in the paper it would then be the decision of the prospective owner/operator to further assess the commercial viability of the conversion and operational aspects of running the yacht for sail training purposes...|$|R

40|$|Sailing is a {{sport and}} {{activity}} {{that takes a}} long time both to learn and to master, as much of its competence-based knowledge is acquired through experience. Experience-based learning is very important, time-intensive, and the factors for success are often tacit and hidden. Should these success factors become explicit and salient, learning would occur faster and produce obvious competitive advantages. This research was conducted by embedding on-going research results into two competitive sailing teams racing in different classes, one offshore keelboat racing with a crew of eight, and a one-design Star-class racing yacht with a crew of two. The data collection consisted of observations, interviews, and video recordings. The results were also verified with the crews to catch biases in the analysis process. A jibe, a specific but common maneuver was analyzed from the perspective of Common Ground within Joint Activity. Maneuvering a competitive <b>offshore</b> <b>sail</b> racer or a previously Olympic Star-class yacht are tasks that fulfill the requirements for Joint Activity. A high level of Common Ground is required for the effective coordination needed in order to perform at a high level and maintain the safety of the crew and equipment. Breakdowns in the coordination of maneuvers were observed, although they must be recorded on video for higher analysis reliability. To achieve greater validity, more and different maneuvers should be considered within the analysis. By better understanding the factors for success, sail racing teams can more quickly gain competence and thus competitive advantages. The research analyzes the teamwork found in sailing from the perspective of Joint Activity and Common Ground and provides insight into how to achieve performance improvements more efficiently...|$|R
