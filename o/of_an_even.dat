5|$|Irish or English Irish – In England, the Irish is {{standardized}} by the NFRS as an {{equilateral triangle}} of white {{with a side}} that begins at the chest, or between the front legs, and where the point ends mid length. In the United States and elsewhere, clubs like the AFRMA distinguish this marking as the English Irish and allow for another standardized Irish in which the rat may have white <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> or symmetrical nature anywhere along its underside.|$|E
5|$|Knap of Howar Neolithic {{farmstead}} {{is probably}} the oldest preserved house in northern Europe. Situated {{on the island of}} Papa Westray (which may have been combined with nearby Westray in the early Neolithic), the farmstead consists of two adjacent rounded rectangular thick-walled buildings with low doorways linked by a passageway. This structure was inhabited for 900 years from 3700 BC but was evidently built on the site <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> older settlement. Unstan ware pottery pieces were found on the site, which was only discovered in the 1920s when this part of the coastline was exposed by gales and tides.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 1943, Haruna again left Truk as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> larger force—five battleships, three fleet carriers, eight heavy cruisers, three light cruisers and {{numerous}} destroyers—in response to American raids on Wake Island. When no contact was made the force returned to Truk on 26 October 1943. On 16 December 1943, {{she arrived at}} Sasebo for refits and inland-sea training.|$|E

5|$|The Apple {{retail store}} opened on Regent Street on 20 November 2004. At the time, {{this was the}} first such store in Europe, with the others being in the United States and Japan. It was the largest Apple store {{worldwide}} until the opening <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> larger store in Covent Garden in August 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Sweet Track {{was used}} only for about ten years; rising water levels may have engulfed it, and {{therefore}} curtailed its use. The variety of objects found alongside the track suggest {{that it was in}} daily use as part of the farming life of the community. Since its discovery, it has been determined that parts of the Sweet Track were built along the route <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> earlier track, the Post Track, which was constructed thirty years earlier in 3838 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{coaches are}} {{primarily}} hauled by MPI MPXpress series locomotives. The current model, the 4000-horsepower MP40PH-3C, {{is more powerful}} that their predecessors, the EMD F59PH. They are capable of pulling or pushing trains of 12 coaches instead of 10. More than 60 of these locomotives have been ordered since their introduction in 2006, with a further 16 types <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> more powerful model, the MP54AC, to enter service in coming years. Opposite the locomotive, trains are bookended by cab cars, which are coaches with driver controls incorporated into them. While most of them closely resemble ordinary coaches, GO Transit began upgrading their rail fleet with newly designed, more crashworthy cab cars {{in the summer of}} 2015, incorporating an improved visibility, safety features and comfort for train crews.|$|E

25|$|Recall {{that the}} square <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number is even and {{the square of}} an odd number is odd. So if {{the square of the}} {{hypotenuse}} is even the hypotenuse is even as well.|$|E
25|$|The present {{church was}} built in 1819, after the {{previous}} one was destroyed during British occupation of the island in the early 1810s. There is evidence in the foundations <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> older church. Anholt has a tradition for building houses that include materials from flotsam.|$|E
25|$|As the Euler {{class for}} an even sphere {{corresponds}} to 2 ∈ H2n(S2n, Z), {{we can use the}} fact that the Euler class of a Whitney sum of two bundles is just the cup product of the Euler class of the two bundles to see that there are no non-trivial subbundles of the tangent bundle <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> sphere.|$|E

25|$|Trockenbeerenauslese wines ("dry berries selection") {{are made}} from grapes <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> higher {{potential}} alcohol level, generally reachable only {{with the help of}} Botrytis. The grapes used for Trockenbeerenauslese have reached an even more raisin-like state than those used for Beerenauslese. Due to the high concentration of sugar in the raisin-like grape, these wines can only be made in a sweet style and make extremely sweet, concentrated and usually quite expensive wines.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} century AD, Theon of Alexandria {{produced}} an edition of Euclid which was so widely used that it became the only surviving source until François Peyrard's 1808 discovery at the Vatican of a manuscript not derived from Theon's. This manuscript, the Heiberg manuscript, is from a Byzantine workshop around 900 and {{is the basis of}} modern editions. Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29 is a tiny fragment <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> older manuscript, but only contains the statement of one proposition.|$|E

25|$|Crookston is {{surrounded}} by a defensive ring-ditch that dates back to the 12th century when Sir Robert de Croc, who also gave his name to the village of Crookston, built a timber and earth castle. Remains of a chapel founded by de Croc in 1180 have been uncovered. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> earlier fortification on the same site has also been found. The lands of Crookston were bought by Sir Alan Stewart in 1330, and passed to Sir John Stewart of Darnley, in 1361. The Darnley Stewarts replaced the early castle with the present stone structure around 1400.|$|E
25|$|In addition, an {{emergence}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> smaller version occurred, {{referred to}} as the Toy Australian Shepherd, with adult males weighing 12–15 pounds (5.5–7kg) and all dogs falling under a 14-inch height at the withers. Many breeders and owners of Australian Shepherds consider the Mini and Toy to be separate breeds; others consider them to be down-sized versions of the same breed. While the Mini size can be attained through selective breeding of small Australian Shepherds, the Toy size is typically a result of cross breeding with other toy breeds. ASCA and AKC consider both variants to be separate breeds.|$|E
25|$|Another {{solution}} would be to use a single screen, but break it up into a pattern of closely spaced colored phosphors instead <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> coating of white. Three receivers would be used, each sending its output to a separate electron gun, aimed at its colored phosphor. Although obvious, this solution was not practical. The electron guns used in monochrome televisions had limited resolution, and if one wanted to retain the resolution of existing monochrome displays, the guns would {{have to focus on}} individual dots three times smaller. This was beyond {{the state of the art}} at the time.|$|E
