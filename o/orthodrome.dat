50|$|A great circle, {{also known}} as an <b>orthodrome,</b> of a sphere is the {{intersection}} of the sphere and a plane that passes through the center point of the sphere. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on any given sphere. Any diameter of any great circle coincides with a diameter of the sphere, and therefore all great circles have the same center and circumference as each other. This special case of a circle of a sphere is in opposition to a small circle, that is, {{the intersection of the}} sphere and a plane that does not pass through the center. Every circle in Euclidean 3-space is a great circle of exactly one sphere.|$|E
5000|$|The heading {{indicator}} works using a gyroscope, tied by an erection mechanism to the aircraft yawing plane, i. e. the plane {{defined by the}} longitudinal and the lateral axis of the aircraft. As such, any configuration of the aircraft yawing plane that does not match the local Earth horizontal results in an indication error. The {{heading indicator}} is arranged such that the gyro axis is used to drive the display, which consists of a circular compass card calibrated in degrees. The gyroscope is spun either electrically, or using filtered air flow from a suction pump (sometimes a pressure pump in high altitude aircraft) driven from the aircraft's engine. Because the Earth rotates (ω, 15° per hour, apparent drift), and because of small accumulated errors caused by imperfect balancing of the gyro, the heading indicator will drift over time (real drift), and must be reset using a magnetic compass periodically. [...] The apparent drift is predicted by ω sin Latitude and will thus be greatest over the poles. To counter for the effect of Earth rate drift a latitude nut can be set (on the ground only) which induces a (hopefully equal and opposite) real wander in the gyroscope. Otherwise {{it would be necessary}} to manually realign the direction indicator once each ten to fifteen minutes during routine in-flight checks. Failure to do this is a common source of navigation errors among new pilots. Another sort of apparent drift exists in the form of transport wander, caused by the aircraft movement and the convergence of the meridian lines towards the poles. It equals the course change along a great circle (<b>orthodrome)</b> flight path.|$|E
40|$|Othodrome, {{also known}} as great circle and loxodrome, which is also called a rhumb line, are two {{characteristic}} curves on a sphere model of the Earth. Their visualisation and discrepancies between them vary according to distance between departure and arrival point, their latitude and the azimuth of the curves. In diploma thesis, <b>orthodrome</b> and loxodrome were studied under different conditions and were compared with geodesic and loxodrome on an ellipsoidal model of the Earth. <b>Orthodrome</b> and loxodrome are also plotted and studied in different map projections: Mercator projection, Gnomonic projection, Lambert conformal conic projection and Transverse Mercator projection. The visualisation of the curves in projection vary according to values of all type of distortion in specific projection as well. Especially for Slovenia's scales of topographic maps, we determined in what scale {{the discrepancy between the}} <b>orthodrome</b> and loxodrome is noted on a map. We were solving the problem in three different-sized areas: in Slovenia, Europe and the whole world. We also cover the subject on the usability of loxodrome in practice, since nowadays the GNSS technology is widely used and real-time determination of big number of <b>orthodrome</b> or geodesic waypoints is enabled...|$|E

40|$|Bird {{migration}} and orientation at high latitudes are {{of special interest}} because of the difficulties associated with different compass systems in polar areas {{and because of the}} considerable differences between flight routes conforming to loxodromes (rhumblines) or <b>orthodromes</b> (great circle routes). Regular and widespread east-north-east migration of birds from the northern tundra of Siberia towards North America across the Arctic Ocean (without landmark influences) were recorded by ship-based tracking radar studies in July and August. Field observations indicated that waders, including species such as Phalaropusfulicarius and Calidris melanotos, dominated, but also terns and skuas may have been involved. Analysis of flight directions in relation to the wind showed that these movements are not caused by wind drift. Assuming possible orientation principles based on celestial or geomagnetic cues, different flight trajectories across the Arctic Ocean were calculated: geographical loxodromes, sun compass routes, magnetic loxodromes and magnetoclinic routes. The probabilities of these four alternatives are evaluated on the basis of both the availability of required orientation cues and the predicted flight paths. This evaluation supports orientation along sun compass routes. Because of the longitudinal time displacement sun compass routes show gradually changing compass courses in close agreement with <b>orthodromes.</b> It is suggested that an important migration link between Siberia and North American stopover sites 1000 - 2500 km apart across the Arctic Ocean has evolved based on sun compass orientation along orthodrome-like routes...|$|R

After electrical cardioversion, the 12 -lead surface ECG revealed sinus rhythm with ventricular preexcitation and negative delta waves in leads II, III, and aVF, indicating Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with a posteroseptal acces-sory pathway (Figure 2). The distinctly negative delta wave in lead II pointed to an accessory pathway within a coronary sinus diverticulum. This finding {{was confirmed by}} contrast media injection into the coronary sinus (Figure 3). In the electrophysiological study, <b>orthodrome</b> atrioventricular-reentrant tachycardia was easily inducible, and the earliest ventricular activation during sinus rhythm was mapped and found to be within the coronary sinus diverticulum. Using an irrigated-tip radiofrequency catheter, the accessory pathway was easily ablated at {{the neck of the}} diverticulum. Accessory pathways in this location tend to have a very rapid atrioven-tricular conduction, putting these patients at risk of sudden death during atrial fibrillation; such pathways, therefore, should be ablated. ...|$|E
40|$|Flight {{directions}} of birds migrating at high geographic and magnetic latitudes {{can be used}} to test bird orientation by celestial or geomagnetic compass systems under polar conditions. Migration patterns of arctic shorebirds, revealed by tracking radar studies during an icebreaker expedition along the Northwest Passage in 1999, support predicted sun compass trajectories but cannot be reconciled with orientation along either geographic or magnetic loxodromes (rhumb lines). Sun compass routes are similar to <b>orthodromes</b> (great circle routes) at high latitudes, showing changing geographic courses as the birds traverse longitudes and their internal clock gets out of phase with local time. These routes bring the shorebirds from high arctic Canada to the east coast of North America, from which they make transoceanic flights to South America. The observations are also consistent with a migration link between Siberia and the Beaufort Sea region by way of sun compass routes across the Arctic Ocean...|$|R

The analysis indicated that the evolution of migratory links among arctic shorebirds is constrained not by distance as such but by distance across ecological barriers, possibly because of the complex adaptations required for barrier crossing and extensive detour migration (and {{in a few cases}} because barrier distances exceed the birds' theoretical flight range capacity). A particularly pronounced barrier effect of the Arctic Ocean, as apparent from a sharp decline in migratory connectivity between the opposite sides of the Arctic Ocean, may reflect a crucial importance of favourable entry and exit conditions for successfully occupying different sectors of the tundra breeding area by shorebirds from winter regions situated at widely different total distances in both the southern and northern hemispheres...|$|E

The exciting and braking components of the synaptic transmission in the induction and supporting the prolonged potency have been studied. It has been shown, that {{in the base of}} the prolonged potency VPSP lies the increase of the postsynaptic sensitivity to the AMPA-agonist of receptors of the quick exciting synaptic transmission, and the decrease of braking is not the factor, ensuring the support of the prolonged potency. For induction of the potency, necessary is not only the activation of the NMDA receptors, relating to the glutamate, but also to the metabothropic glutamate receptors, as well as the definite level of releasing the postsynaptic neuron. The combination of the intracellular depolarization of the neuron with synaptic stimulation brings to the induction of potency without blocking the brake at the condition, that the pair stimulation with frequency near to frequency of teta-rhythm has been used.

40|$|The {{permanent}} growth of air traffic volume, being a main contributor to economic growth, is reaching {{the limits of}} what current Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems are capable to handle. Fundamental changes in ATM operations are required {{to cope with the}} expected increase in the next decades. On one hand, the bottleneck of centralized control of air space operations has been identified as a core limitation, and the two large development programmes for the future ATM systems, which are underway in Europe and North America, SESAR and NextGen, both envision a much stronger inclusion of all ATM stakeholders, from the airport operators to the individual pilot, into decision making processes, thus decentralizing ATM coordination effort. A fundamental requirement and key enabler of this relocation and sharing of control is the availability of all information necessary for making subsystem-level decisions that enhance the flow in the ATM supersystem, i. e., the decentralized availability of static and dynamic ATM data. The traditional ATM information distribution systems on the other hand are currently undergoing a paradigm change as well, being mainly determined by a transition from paper-based, product-oriented to data-based, concept-oriented operations. The development of the Aeronautical Information Exchange Model version 5 (AIXM 5) has pioneered this movement, enabling the Aeronautical Information domain to be the first of the ATM data domains to implement the paradigm shift. The integration of the Aeronautical Information domain with the various other ATM data domains is supported by the definition of a superordinate model system of constitutive information concepts, in which basic concepts such as space and time, are modeled in a generic, yet ATM-specific way. Such models of aeronautical spatiality and temporal dependency of aeronautical processes are presented and discussed in this thesis as AIXM 5 concepts. Both these topics, the required reorganization of information distribution systems and the explicit modeling of ATM data domain information including generic models for basic information aspects, are in the scope of the SWIM concept: the approach to System Wide Information Management in the future ATM system envisioned in SESAR and NextGen. SWIM defines a high-level distributed system model for information exchange between ATM stakeholder subsystems acting as Providers or Users of information. Among the specified SWIM core communication services is publish/subscribe, a communication paradigm closely related to event-based interaction models, in which Providers can publish event notifications, and a notification service component, which inherently decouples the communicating parties, is solely responsible for mediating the notifications to affected Users who have previously expressed interest in some sort of event notifications by registering a subscription with the service. While various subscription and event models have been proposed in the literature and have been implemented in publish/subscribe systems, none exists that provides the means to subscribe to, and efficiently disseminate, event notifiations based on spatial and temporal aspects. In this thesis, such a subscription model for spatial and temporal aspects of event notifications for publish/subscribe systems is presented. It is derived from an initial analysis of the specific requirements of the Aeronautical Information domain with respect to spatial data and the implications from Aeronautical Information processes for a model of temporal data, and is intended to provide SWIM Users with the means to subscribe to notifications for events affecting the trajectory of a (planned or currently conducted) flight. The subscription model is based on two basic types of filters, of which subscriptions are composed and which are used in the notification service nodes for routing decisions: spatial filters and interval filters. These filter types are formally introduced, and required operations (notification matching and filter relationships) are defined. The `` 2. 5 -dimensional'' aeronautical spatial model requires the adjustment of algorithms from the field of Computational Geometry to work with geometries, in which different interpolation methods for lines are used, accounting for different types of flight paths common in air navigation, namely loxodrome (rhumb line) and <b>orthodrome</b> (great circle track) routes. Past research in distributed content-based publish/subscribe systems has yielded advanced routing algorithms that exploit equality and inclusion relations of subscriptions to reduce filter handling overhead in the distributed nodes of the notification service. In the given context though, these traditional approaches are uneffective due to lack of appropriate subscription relationships because the 4 D trajectories of two different flights never assume the same spacetime nor is one trajectory's spacetime covered by another trajectory's one. Nevertheless, their spacetime may be close enough such that the flights are affected by the same events, in which case the respective subscriptions could be united, thus reducing filter handling overhead throughout the distributed nodes of the system. The main challenge of such an approach of merging similar subscriptions is to decide if filters are ``similar enough'' to be merged. The problem of (imperfectly) merging filters is based on a trade-off between filtering quality and filter numbers, and a formal approach to describing filter similarity and filtering quality is required to sensibly balance this trade-off. Such a formal discussion is presented in this thesis, and heuristical algorithms are proposed that integrate with merging-based routing algorithms. The proposed approaches are based on quantitatively estimating the reduction of filtering quality involved in creating a filter merger. This merger quality estimation takes into account simple filter metrics (size and distance) defined for this purpose, and returns the estimation as numeric value. By defining a merger quality threshold value, the trade-off of reduction (of the number of filters) against precision (filtering quality) can be easily adjusted as required by the application by means of a single numeric value. The proposed size-based and distance-based approaches to merger quality estimation were evaluated in filter merging experiments, and the results show that an approach based on normalized filter distance outperforms the others with respect to achieved filtering quality. Furthermore, the impact of other factors such as filter and notification size, distance and distribution characteristics (clustered or uniformly distributed) as well as filter and notification numbers was examined, and it is found that higher filter and notification density in the filter space, which is the representation of similar interests of Users and event hotspots, generally allows for better filtering quality when applying imperfect filter merging. Algorithms for the filter handling operations of a broker node in a distributed publish/subscribe system are presented that employ filter merging aiming to increase system scalability by reducing routing table size and filter forwarding overhead at the cost of unnecessarily forwarded notifications that result from the reduction of filtering quality. The scalability benefits of the approach are evaluated, firstly, by formally describing the effects of the presented filter handling scheme and investigating the propagation of the effects throughout the broker network, and secondly, in experiments using realistic flight subscriptions derived by extrapolating real historic flight data. The analysis of the results shows that very specific conditions have to be met for the overall approach to reduce subscription forwarding overhead more than increase notification forwarding overhead compared to a simple routing approach. Nevertheless, statements are derived on the conditions for filter and notification characteristics that must be met for the approaches to be effective...|$|E
