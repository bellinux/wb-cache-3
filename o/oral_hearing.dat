5|$|When the {{government}} seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, {{the government}} provide the person notice, {{an opportunity to}} be heard at an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing,</b> and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits. The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest. For example, in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009), the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2011, it was {{confirmed}} that the Westfield Shopping Centre had been in detailed talks with West Ham for naming rights of the new Olympic stadium which could be called the Westfield Stadium. West Ham announced plans to move from the Boleyn Ground from the 2014–15 season. In August 2011, an independent investigation initiated by the Olympic Park Legacy Company upheld the decision to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. On 29 June 2011, however, Tottenham announced that they were returning to the High Court again to fight the decision to award West Ham the stadium, in an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing,</b> to try and overturn the original high court appeal being rejected. On 25 August 2011, Tottenham and Leyton Orient were in fact granted a judicial review by the High Court into the Olympic Stadium bidding process. On 11 October 2011, the deal to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium collapsed over concerns of legal pressure, with the government deciding that the stadium will stay in public ownership. Six days later, Tottenham and Leyton Orient announced they had ended their legal challenge after the deal collapsed.|$|E
25|$|Liverpool had {{elections}} {{three years}} out of four, with one third of councillors elected in each election. The Liverpool councillors did appeal – bringing in {{the argument that the}} extraordinary audit had not notified the councillors of their right for an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> to put their case before making a finding of wilful misconduct. The Court of Appeal agreed that an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> ought to have been allowed, but that the subsequent High Court hearing had cured that deficiency. The councillors then appealed to the House of Lords which unanimously rejected the appeal on 12 March 1987, ruling that the auditor's procedure was fair and not prejudiced against the council. The total surcharge to be paid by 47 current and former councillors (two had died in the meantime) amounted to £333,000.|$|E

25|$|In addition, a {{fair hearing}} may also include the rights to legal representation, to {{cross-examine}} witnesses, and to be given reasons for a decision; and a presumption in favour of an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing.</b> An applicant claiming a breach of the fair hearing requirement has {{to prove that he}} or she suffered substantial injustice since {{there is no such thing}} in law as a technical breach of natural justice. The requirements of fair hearing depend on the circumstances of the case such as the nature of the inquiry, the rules governing the tribunal, and the subject matter being dealt with.|$|E

25|$|For {{a hearing}} to be fair, {{the person who}} will be {{affected}} by the hearing's outcome must be given sufficient notice to allow him or her to adequately prepare his or her case; he or she must be entitled to know what evidence has been produced against him or her; and that there must be a proper opportunity to contest, contradict or correct any evidence, state one's case and raise relevant matters before the court. In addition, a fair hearing may also include the rights to legal representation, to cross-examine witnesses, and to be given reasons for a decision; and a presumption in favour of an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} final appellate courts internationally, {{there is no}} {{automatic}} right of appeal to the Supreme Court of New Zealand. All appeals are first required to apply to the Court for leave to appeal. This is granted or declined based on a number of factors listed in the Supreme Court Act, with the overarching principle being that it must be necessary in the interests of justice for the Court to hear the appeal. Leave applications are normally determined by any two judges of the court based on the written submission of the parties without an oral hearing; however, the judges hearing the application can decide to hold an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> if they wish.|$|E
25|$|Magee {{involved}} {{himself in}} a dispute with the Friends of St Colman's Cathedral, a local conservationist group in Cobh which organised an effective and professional opposition to the Bishop's plans to re-order the interior of Cobh Cathedral, plans similar to previous re-orderings in Killarney, Cork and Limerick cathedrals. In an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> conducted by An Bord Pleanála, the Irish Planning Board, it emerged that irregularities had occurred in the planning application that were traced to Cobh Town Council which accommodated the Bishop's plans to modify the Victorian interior designed by E W Pugin and George Ashlin. On 2 June 2006, when Bishop Magee was in Lourdes, An Bord Pleanála directed Cobh Town Council to refuse the Bishop's application.|$|E

500|$|In January 2016, Morgan appealed {{against the}} Ministry of Justice after it {{decided not to}} {{downgrade}} his prisoner status {{from that of a}} Category A prisoner, as well as challenging the Parole Board for refusing to allow him an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing.</b> A hearing at the High Court on 26 January was told that under the terms of his sentence, Morgan would be eligible for parole from February, but had continued to maintain his innocence throughout his time in prison, claiming to be in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation where he could not qualify for release without admitting his guilt. Rejecting Morgan's case, Justice William Davis suggested that Morgan had not [...] "addressed his offending behaviour" [...] and was [...] "in effect in the same position as in December 1995, when he murdered his victim".|$|E
500|$|The parties made submissions, {{and there}} was an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> on 1 December 2006. All parties {{accepted}} that the relevant test to be applied was the test set out in the High Court case of DPP (Nauru) v Fowler, which sets out two preconditions for a retrial; the first requiring that the admissible evidence presented at trial be [...] "sufficiently cogent" [...] to support a conviction, the second requiring consideration of circumstances that would make it unjust to put the accused through a retrial. However this case had an unusual feature, namely that the evidence that the prosecution would seek to use at a retrial had not been available at the original trial, through no fault of the prosecution, since although the interviews had been taken at that time they had not been published. Ultimately all parties agreed that all evidence, not just evidence submitted in the original trial, should be considered when applying {{the first part of the}} Fowler test.|$|E
2500|$|However, this {{requirement}} {{does not necessarily}} mean the decision-maker has to meet the complainant face to face – [...] "Natural justice does not generally demand orality". It has been suggested that an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> will almost be as good as useless if the affected person has no prior knowledge of the case. In Lloyd v. McMahon (1987), an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> did not make a difference to the facts on which the case was based. Giving judgment in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, Lord Justice Harry Woolf held that an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> may not always be the [...] "very pith of the administration of natural justice". It has also been suggested that an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> is only required if issues concerning deprivations of legal rights or legally protected interests arise.|$|E

2500|$|The Court of Appeal, when {{considering}} {{an application for}} appeal, may decide based on the paper documents or refer the case to an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing,</b> something often done when {{it is apparent that}} a refusal of the written case will lead the applicant to send a second, oral application.

2500|$|If the Board of Directors of the {{co-operative}} cannot {{resolve the}} member issue, {{which is a}} cause for possible termination of occupancy rights, it can pass a motion to send the member a notice to appear requiring the member to attend at a Board meeting at which the termination (eviction) of that member's occupancy [...] will be considered. If the Board votes to terminate an occupancy (evict), the member has a right of appeal to the membership as a whole. In order to enforce the eviction, the Board must bring an application to a judge of the Superior Court, on which occasion the member {{has the opportunity to}} present his/her case to the judge; the judge considers whether the eviction process was conducted fairly and in accordance with due process, and has a residual discretion to refuse the eviction should the judge consider it fair to do so, notwithstanding the decision of the Board. Sometimes this hearing is conducted like a trial, with oral evidence from both sides, while at other times it is conducted based only on written documents submitted to the court; the practice varies from judge-to-judge and courthouse to courthouse, and there is no consensus on the proper procedure or what right a member has to be heard. This process is different from evictions of rental tenants, which proceed in Ontario before a specialized tribunal and in which the tenant is always entitled to an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing.</b> The standard of deference that judges should show to the decisions of Boards is a controversial and unresolved issue in the law, with various cases taking seemingly inconsistent positions on the issue. As of 2012 new provincial legislation in Ontario will allow housing co-operatives to apply to a special tribunal to obtain a [...] "writ of possession" [...] to evict a member from their unit.|$|E
