5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> for their infectivity.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 2007, an American Greetings Christmas card {{sent to the}} Chronicle, postmarked 1990 in Eureka had {{recently}} been discovered in their photo files by editorial assistant Daniel King. Inside the envelope, with the card, was a photocopy of two U.S. Postal keys on a magnet keychain. The handwriting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> resembles Zodiac's print, but was declared inauthentic by forensic document examiner Lloyd Cunningham. However, not all Zodiac experts agree with Cunningham's analysis. There is no return address <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> nor is his crossed-circle signature to be found. The card itself is unmarked. The Chronicle turned over all the material to the Vallejo Police Department for further analysis.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{significant}} aspects of defense witnessed in V. acadica {{that are different}} from nest defense practices in other Vespula wasps. Firstly, workers hover {{in a manner similar}} to workers of Vespula consobrina while defining the colony during excavations.

The first clinical reports date from 1870, but the virus appears to have evolved in the mid-16th century. Over sixty complete genomes of this virus had been sequenced by 2010.|$|E

25|$|Santa Claus {{received}} some attention in 1961 when several advertisements {{appeared in the}} 1961 issue of Popular Mechanics, an American magazine devoted to science and technology. The advertisements offered remailing services where Christmas cards and letters would be remailed from Santa Claus, Arizona, {{at a cost of}} $.25 plus the postage for the remailing. The remailing service would result in a United States Postal Service postmark <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> reading Santa Claus, Arizona, something desirable around the annual Christmas holiday.|$|E
25|$|Malina {{claimed she}} had been robbed, and her {{identity}} papers were later sent to her address. Police claimed that a DNA analysis proved that the parcel had been posted by Malina herself. She gave the parcel to the police only two days after receiving it because of a national holiday. She had licked the stamp {{in an attempt to}} fix it back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> after the police had asked her to turn over the entire package. It was later pointed out {{that at the time of}} posting the pack she was in hospital. In the hospital, Malina was treated for internal bleeding, which police authorities ascertain occurred before the claimed attack.|$|E
25|$|The count {{that took}} place on {{election}} night gave Flood a one-vote lead. On March 18, the Westchester County Board of Elections recounted the votes, giving Malloy a one-vote lead. Turning to two unopened absentee ballots, the board found that one was for Flood, resulting in a tie. The other absentee ballot was not opened as the name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> did not match any names on the voter-registration list. Susan B. Morton, who had registered to vote as Susan Brenner Morton, stepped forward three days later and demanded that her vote for Malloy be counted. For several months afterward, various suits, motions, and appeals were filed in state courts. On October 20, the Court of Appeals, New York State's highest court, denied requests by Malloy and Morton, leaving the election in a tie. To comply with state law, the village had to use random lots to decide the winner.|$|E

25|$|A {{black light}} {{may also be}} formed by simply using a UV filter coating such as Wood's glass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> of a common {{incandescent}} bulb. This was the method {{that was used to}} create the very first black light sources. Although incandescent black light bulbs are a cheaper alternative to fluorescent tubes, they are exceptionally inefficient at producing UV light since most of the light emitted by the filament is visible light which must be blocked. Due to its black body spectrum, an incandescent light radiates less than 0.1% of its energy as UV light. Incandescent UV bulbs, due to the necessary absorption of the visible light, become very hot during use. This heat is, in fact, encouraged in such bulbs, since a hotter filament increases the proportion of UVA in the black-body radiation emitted. This high running-temperature drastically reduces the life of the lamp, however, from a typical 1000 hours to around 100 hours.|$|E

500|$|According to {{research}} by the Marine Corps' History and Museum Division, the name [...] "America's Battalion" [...] originated in the mid-1980s when LtCol Charles Krulak was the battalion's commanding officer.

According to Krulak, at one point a friend of his sent him a letter addressed to the [...] "Commanding Officer, America's Battalion". With nothing else <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope,</b> the United States Postal Service still managed to deliver the letter properly.
