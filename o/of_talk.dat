5|$|The SIII's Li-ion 2,100mAh {{battery is}} said to have a 790-hour standby time or 11hours <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> time on 3G, {{compared}} to 900hours in standby and 21hours <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> time on 2G. Built into the battery is near field communication (NFC) connectivity, which allows users to share map directions and YouTube videos quickly using Wi-Fi Direct (through Android Beam), and perform non-touch payments at shops that employ specially equipped NFC cash registers. The battery can be wirelessly charged using a special charging pad (sold separately) that utilizes magnetic resonance to produce a magnetic field through which electricity could be transferred.|$|E

5|$|Following Michael VIII Palaiologos' reconquest of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantine Empire {{was left}} in a grave position. There was plenty <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> among the Latin states of the Greek {{mainland}} and other regions of retaking Constantinople for the Latin Empire whilst to the north the main threat came from Serbian expansion into the Balkans by king Stefan Uroš I. What was once a strong frontier under the Komnenian dynasty at the Danube river now threatened Constantinople itself.|$|E

5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms <b>of</b> <b>Talk</b> (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life, social interaction, the social construction of self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E
5|$|Other {{similarities}} include {{engaging in}} the suspense the speaker is attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside {{the knowledge that the}} performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E

Two days later, they were reexposed tothe stressor. Compared with individuals in the no-talk condition, those in the talk alone and validate conditions had {{a lower level of}} intrusive thoughts in the 2 -day interim, and they had lower perceived stress when reexposed to the stressor. The effects <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> and validation on perceived stress appeared to be mediated by lowered intrusions.

These findings uggest that alking about acute stressors can facilitate adjustment to stressors through cognitive resolution. A timely utterance gave that thought relief, and I again am stron...|$|R
