The projects mostly covered infrastructural development, and included construction of a racing track, power plants and petrol stations. In November 1994, the CDC opened a tender to build a casino near Sihanoukville and proposals submitted by three companies were shortlisted; Ariston Berhad from Malaysia, Unicentral Corporation from Singapore and Hyatt International from the US. Ariston's proposal was valued at USD 1.3 billion, and included bringing a luxury cruise ship with casino to Cambodia, {{to be used to}} accommodate tourists until the Sihanoukville resort was built. Before the tender was even concluded, Ariston's ship was brought to Phnom Penh in early December. The Tourism Minister, Veng Sereyvuth suspected that there was backroom dealing activities between CDC and Ariston, who were nevertheless awarded the contract, which Ranariddh signed in January 1995.|$|E

5|$|Filming moved {{once again}} in January 2011 to the Druid Hills {{quadrant}} of Atlanta, which contains {{the headquarters of the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The restricted nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CDC</b> campus meant that producers were only allowed to shoot exterior scenes of the area, as well as within the parking garage and reception area for the CDC's museum onsite. Principal photography then proceeded into Atlanta's central business district and Decatur, before advancing to London, Geneva, and lastly San Francisco, California, in the ensuing month. The San Francisco Film Commission charged filmmakers $300 per day for production within the city limits. In the North Beach and Potrero Hill sections of the city, production designer Howard Cummings scattered trash and discarded clothing on the ground to depict the rapid decline of civilization. For the Civic Center set, over 2,000 extras were sought for in background roles; actors who were a part of the Screen Actors Guild were paid $139 per day, while nonunion workers received $64 per day for their work. Other filming locations were established at Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, and Candlestick Park; it cost $60,000 to rent the football stadium for six days.|$|E
5|$|The group {{discovers that}} the generator's fuel {{reserves}} are near exhausted; when empty, the facility will enter a self-destruct mode by design to eradicate all the infectious diseases stored there. Jenner seals the building, refusing to allow Rick's group to leave, but promises that the high-impulse thermobaric weapon designed {{to destroy the}} facility will mean their deaths will be quick. Rick's group tries in vain to have Jenner open the doors, and Rick eventually convinces him {{to allow them to}} at least try to overcome the tragedy rather than be forced to die. Two of Rick's group, Jacqui (Jeryl Prescott Sales) and Andrea (Laurie Holden), choose to stay behind, but Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) refuses to leave without Andrea and stays as well. As Rick departs, Jenner whispers something to him. Shortly thereafter, Andrea has a change of heart, not wishing to see Dale die, and the two escape the building moments before its destruction.

DIRECTIONS <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> DEVELOPMENT <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> KIEV MUNICIPAL CONSULTATIVE DIAGNOSTIC CENTERS IN NEW ECONOMIC CONDITIONS V. V. Kravchenko Shupyk National Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education Abstract Background Improving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outpatient care is an urgent problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> health care system in Ukraine. Objective: to determine <b>the</b> problems <b>of</b> organizing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Consultative and Diagnostic Centers (CDCs) in Kiev, to consider <b>the</b> foreign experience <b>of</b> forming a partnership {{between the state and the}} private sector in health care and to determine <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CDCs.</b> Materials and methods. Priority directions for <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> communal <b>CDCs</b> in <b>the</b> current economic conditions were substantiated using the system approach and analysis method, as well as the information-analytical method. The information base for their formation were <b>the</b> scientific works <b>of</b> Ukrainan and foreign specialists in public-private partnership (PPP) and management, as well as <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> own studies. Sociological survey of 437 patients and 411 physicians of communal CDCs and an expert assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization and prospects for further development of communal CDCs (by 21 highly qualified specialists in the organization and management of public health) were conducted in 2017 in Kiev. Results It is established that the population and physicians are dissatisfied with <b>the</b> existing organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CDC's</b> work. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expert evaluation also demonstrated <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a number of organizational problems in <b>the</b> <b>CDCs.</b> It is determined that <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CDCs</b> depends on financing and management, <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> public-private partnership. <b>The</b> necessity <b>of</b> reorganizing and improving <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CDCs</b> is substantiated. Conclusions Formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CDCs</b> on <b>the</b> principles <b>of</b> public-private partnership and <b>the</b> preparation <b>of</b> modern managers for <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CDCs</b> are <b>the</b> priority directions <b>of</b> development of communal CDCs in current conditions.

25|$|The United States Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{performed}} {{indoor air}} quality testing for formaldehyde {{in some of the}} units. On February 14, 2008, the CDC announced that potentially hazardous levels of formaldehyde were found in many of the travel trailers and manufactured homes provided by the agency. The CDC's preliminary evaluation of a scientifically established random sample of 519 travel trailers and manufactured homes tested between December 21, 2007, and January 23, 2008 (2+ years after manufacture), showed average levels of formaldehyde in all units of about 0.077 parts per million (ppm). Long-term exposure to levels in this range can be linked to an increased risk of cancer and, at levels above this range, there can also be a risk of respiratory illness. These levels are higher than expected in indoor air, where levels are commonly in the range of 0.01–0.02 ppm, and are higher than the Agency for Toxic Substance Disease Registry (ATSDR, division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CDC)</b> Minimal Risk Level (MRL) of 0.008 ppm.

30|$|A {{series of}} carbide-derived carbons (CDCs) with {{different}} surface oxygen contents were prepared from TiC powder by chlorination {{and followed by}} HNO 3 oxidation. <b>The</b> <b>CDCs</b> were characterized systematically {{by a variety of}} means such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultimate analysis, energy dispersive spectroscopy, N 2 adsorption, and transmission electron microscopy. CO 2 adsorption measurements showed that the oxidation process led to an increase in CO 2 adsorption capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porous carbons. Structural characterizations indicated that <b>the</b> adsorbability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CDCs</b> is not directly associated with its microporosity and specific surface area. As evidenced by elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy, <b>the</b> adsorbability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CDCs</b> has a linear correlation with their surface oxygen content. The adsorption mechanism was studied using quantum chemical calculation. It is found that <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> O atoms into the carbon surface facilitates the hydrogen bonding interactions between the carbon surface and CO 2 molecules. This new finding demonstrated that not only the basic N-containing groups but also the acidic O-containing groups can enhance the CO 2 adsorbability of porous carbon, thus providing a new approach to design porous materials with superior CO 2 adsorption capacity.|$|R
