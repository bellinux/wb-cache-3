5|$|Kinne's appeal, {{rather than}} {{overturning}} her sentence, lengthened it.

5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E

5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of Kiarostami's cinematic {{style is}} that he is able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.|$|E
5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
5|$|Maria Theresa was {{not just}} {{critical}} of Marie Antoinette. She disliked Leopold's reserve and often blamed him for being cold. She criticised Maria Carolina for her political activities, Ferdinand for his lack of organisation, and Maria Amalia for her poor French and haughtiness. The only child she did not constantly scold was Maria Christina, who enjoyed her mother's complete confidence, though she failed to please her mother in <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> – she did not produce any surviving children.|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>aspect</b> of the Carolinian {{method of}} {{estimating}} longitude on inter-island sailings is to visualize the target island relative to a second reference island's alignment with a succession of selected stars, points of the star compass. It is a refined system of dead reckoning whereby the navigator constantly synthesizes his position relative to the reference island's location in his mental model. The most remarkable {{thing is that the}} reference island (lu pongank) may be over the horizon, unseen, even imaginary.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of France, the U.S. Army studied the reasons behind the {{effectiveness}} of the German campaign against the French and British forces. <b>One</b> <b>aspect</b> that was highlighted by this study was the use of self propelled artillery; however, by 1941, there was little available in the U.S. Army's arsenal {{that could be used in}} such a role. The Army had a number of M1897A5 guns, sufficient for the mass-production for such a weapon, and the M3 half-track was coming into production. After some debate, the Army decided to place M1897A5 guns on the M3 half-track chassis, which was designated the T12 GMC. The M1897A5 gun was originally adapted for the M3 chassis by placing it in a welded box riveted to the chassis behind the driver's compartment. It was accepted by the Army on 31 October 1941.|$|E

In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. <b>One</b> <b>aspect</b> of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E

Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they decided whether to reuse existing sounds or update them. The result {{was a combination of}} audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. <b>One</b> <b>aspect</b> of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt the timing and delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players could listen to their own music in-game.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{reaction to}} this latest turn of events was varied and greatly colored by national interests. The British were unwilling to defend Madagascar's sovereignty for fear that the French might retaliate and fail to recognize the British claim to certain protectorates of its own. All official British engagement with Madagascar was henceforth transacted through the French resident, but these communiques were not officially recognized by Ranavalona and her court. The United States and Germany, on the other hand, continued to deal directly with the queen's government as the rightful authority in Madagascar. This discrepancy forced a reinterpretation of <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of the treaty, resulting in the queen's authority over internal affairs being maintained.|$|E

The Science window faces a window due to Willet on the north wall with scenes from Genesis, symbolizing harmony between the Christian story of the Creation and the modern means of understanding it.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. <b>One</b> <b>aspect</b> of territorial defense involves identifying {{the proximity of the}} threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine the proximity of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} the Danelaw by West Saxon kings had united England in a single kingdom for the first time, {{enabling}} kings from Æthelstan onwards {{to see themselves as}} heirs of the Carolingian emperors; the regulation of monasteries by a uniform Benedictine rule was designed to unite the kingdom ideologically and enhance royal prestige. The monks depended on the king {{in a way that the}} local ealdormen did not, so their loyalty could be trusted and they could act as a counterbalance to powerful local families. The Regularis Concordia required that psalms be said for the king and the queen in monasteries several times a day, and specified that royal consent must be obtained for the election of abbots. The reformers aimed to enhance the Christian character of kingship, and <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of this was to raise the status of the queen; Edgar's last wife, Ælfthryth, was the first king's consort to regularly witness charters as regina.|$|E
