500|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{composition}} and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that [...] "I know <b>only</b> <b>too</b> <b>well</b> how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing." [...] By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word [...] "Victorian" [...] had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) {{was one of the few}} 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Candaules was {{exhibited}} Etty, needled by repeated {{attacks from}} the press on his supposed tastelessness, indecency and lack of creativity, decided to produce an explicitly moral piece. The result was his 1832 The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, which was {{seen by many as}} a renunciation of his earlier, more openly sensual works. Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from 1832 onwards made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. Despite this he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by many, long after his death in 1849; as late as 1882 Vanity Fair was able to comment that [...] "I know <b>only</b> <b>too</b> <b>well</b> how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather.

[...] Nevertheless, the music press awarded the song an [...] "anthem-of-a-generation" [...] status, placing Cobain as a reluctant spokesman for Generation X.

"John Carpenter, whose small-budget science-fiction epic Dark Star {{was widely}} acclaimed, has turned his inventive {{imagination}} to the thriller {{for his first}} solo directional effort.

But the chance was too good to be lost; he sacrificed his oratorical longings on the altar of party purpose, and limited his speech to a mere statement of his motion. Off flew on the wings of Hansom a youthful member, more trusty than the trusted Undy, to the abode of the now couchant Treasury Argus. Morpheus had claimed him all for his own. He was lying in true enjoyment, with his tired limbs stretched between the unaccustomed sheets, and snoring with free and sonorous nose, restrained by the contiguity of no Speaker's elbow. But even in his deepest slumber the quick wheels of the bounding cab struck upon the tympanum of his anxious ear. He roused himself as does a noble watch-dog when the 'suspicious tread of theft' approaches. The hurry of the jaded horse, the sudden stop, the maddened furious knock, all told a tale which his well-trained ear <b>only</b> knew <b>too</b> <b>well.</b> He sat up for a moment, listening in his bed, stretched himself with one involuntary yawn, and then stood upright on the floor.

Records of this man indicate that his sole interest was to sow the seeds of dissent between Roman Catholics, who by this time had grown to significant proportions, and Protestants. He succeeded in this goal <b>only</b> <b>too</b> <b>well</b> for a full year. During 1868 {{there were a number of}} violent disturbances and rioting created by this man who described himself as a [...] "renegade Roman Catholic". In his lectures to the public [...] "pretending to expose the religious practices of the Roman Catholic Church", he became a master at whipping up a crowd into a frenzy. Newspaper reports of the time told of his common practice of waving a revolver in the air in [...] "a most threatening manner". On one occasion he incited a riot of such proportions that Fr. Daley, the parish priest of St. Peter's, took to the roof of the church to defend it. A man was shot. The parish priest was tried but eventually acquitted at the Quarter Sessions. Following this incident, the community began to settle down and Murphy chose to extend his political activities elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|Sharpe's London Magazine, believing [...] "despite {{reports to}} the contrary" [...] that [...] " [...] woman could have written such a work", warned its readers, {{especially}} ladies, against reading The Tenant. While acknowledging [...] "the powerful interest of the story", [...] "the talent with which it is written" [...] and an [...] "excellent moral", it argued that [...] "like the fatal melody of the Syren's [...] song, its very perfections render it more dangerous, and therefore more carefully to be avoided." [...] In Sharpe's opinion, the novel's [...] "evils which render the work unfit for perusal" [...] arose from [...] "a perverted taste and an absence of mental refinement in the writer, together with a total ignorance of the usages of good society". It argues that the scenes of debauchery [...] "are described with a disgustingly truthful minuteness, which shows the writer to be <b>only</b> <b>too</b> <b>well</b> acquainted with the revolting details of such evil revelry" [...] and considers it a final [...] "proof of the unreadableness of these volumes". Helen's belief in Universal salvation was also castigated: [...] "The dangerous tendency of such a belief most be apparent to any one who gives the subject a moment's consideration; and it becomes scarcely necessary, in order to convince our readers of the madness of trusting to such a forced distortion of the Divine attribute of mercy, to add that this doctrine is alike repugnant to Scripture, and in direct opposition {{to the teaching of}} the Anglican Church".|$|E
2500|$|The French {{arrived at}} on 2 February 1802 at Le Cap with the Haitian {{commander}} Henri Christophe being ordered by Leclerc {{to turn over}} the city to the French. When Christophe refused, the French assaulted Le Cap and the Haitians set the city afire rather than surrender it. Leclerc sent Toussaint letters promising him: [...] "Have no worries about your personal fortune. It will be safeguarded for you, since it has been <b>only</b> <b>too</b> <b>well</b> earned by your own efforts. Do not worry about the liberty of your fellow citizens". When Toussaint still failed to appear at Le Cap, Leclerc issued a proclamation on 17 February 1802: [...] "General Toussaint and General Christophe are outlawed; all citizens are ordered to hunt them down, and treat them as rebels against the French Republic". Captain Marcus Rainsford, a British Army officer who visited St. Domingue observed the training of the Haitian Army, writing: [...] "At a whistle, a whole brigade ran three or four hundred yards, and then, separating, threw themselves flat on the ground, changing to their backs and sides, and all the time keeping up a strong fire until recalled…This movement is executed with such facility and precision as totally to prevent cavalry from charging them in bushy and hilly country". In a letter to Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Toussaint outlined his plans for defeating the French: [...] "Do not forget, while waiting for the rainy reason which will rid us of our foes, that we have no other resource than destruction and fire. Bear in mind that the soil bathed with our sweet must not furnish our enemies with the smallest sustenance. Tear up the roads with shot; throw corpses and horses into all the foundations, burn and annihilate everything in order that those who have come to reduce us to slavery may have before their eyes the image of the hell which they deserve". Dessalines never received the letter as he already taken to the field, evaded a French column sent to capture him and stormed Léogane. The Haitians burned down Leogane and killed all of the French with the Trinidadian historian C. L. R. James writing of Dessalines's actions at Leogane: [...] "Men, women and children, indeed all the whites who came into his hands, he massacred. And forbidding burial, he left stacks of corpses rotting in the sun to strike terror into the French detachments as they toiled behind his flying columns". The French, who been expecting the Haitians to happily go back to being their slaves as they believed it was natural for blacks to be the slaves of whites were stunned to learn how much the Haitians hated them for wanting to reduce them back to a life in chains. A visibly shocked General Pamphile de Lacroix after seeing the ruins of Leogane wrote: [...] "They heaped up bodies" [...] which [...] "still had their attitudes; they were bent over, their hands outstretched and beseeching; the ice of death had not effaced the look on their faces".|$|E
