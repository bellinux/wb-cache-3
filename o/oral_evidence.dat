25|$|The Act {{also changed}} the court rules on the {{submission}} of evidence. The Civil Justice Review {{found that many}} cases which {{could easily have been}} settled before the hearings in court were not, primarily because there was no way of assessing the strength of the other side's arguments and their evidence. The Civil Justice Review suggested that forcing parties to provide evidence and witness statements to the other side before the case came to court would make this assessment easier, and would lead to the parties settling their case before it came to court if one side was at an obvious disadvantage. This suggestion was accepted, and included in the Act, which says that each party must produce written statements of any <b>oral</b> <b>evidence</b> they intend to present in court, and that these statements should be given to the other party before the case comes to court. Any party who fails to comply with this may be refused leave to present this <b>oral</b> <b>evidence</b> in court. A similar system had been used in the Chancery Division, Admiralty Court and Commercial Court since 1986.|$|E

40|$|In the {{research}} of contemporary historical episodes, a researcher is often faced with the dilemma of too little supporting literature or inaccessible documentary evidence. In the study of recent state political history in Queensland, which has suffered through a dearth of academic discourse, this dilemma is acute. Fortunately, a recent surge of interview-based research projects has created some extensive <b>oral</b> history <b>evidence</b> pertaining to the contemporary political period. The Queensland Speaks (www. QueenslandSpeaks. com. au) project represents the most ambitious study among this burgeoning data collection. The interviews, accessible through the project website, provide first-hand source material upon which my PhD research relies. As {{a member of the}} project’s researching and interviewing team, I have actively participated in generating additional <b>oral</b> history <b>evidence</b> to further support my own research. Such activity brings into sharp focus just what interview data can – and sometimes cannot – provide that is not typically covered by the available literature. This paper highlights the utility of <b>oral</b> history <b>evidence</b> gained through selective subject interviews addressing the shortfall in (and sometimes outweighing) the established literature and available documentary sources of Queensland’s contemporary political era...|$|R

25|$|In Hennedige Oliver v. Singapore Dental Council (2007), the High Court {{held that}} members of the Disciplinary Committee ("DC") of the Council had not acted in a biased manner towards Hennedige even though they had interjected a number of times during Hennedige's testimony, and had treated the person who had lodged a {{complaint}} against Hennedige gently but had cross-examined Hennedige robustly and strongly challenged his evidence. This was because the members of the DC were entitled to seek clarifications from Hennedige. Furthermore, his evidence covered much wider ground than the complainant's, and part of Hennedige's <b>oral</b> <b>evidence</b> at the inquiry did not feature in his written explanation. The nature of the Hennedige's answers at the inquiry warranted the additional questions, and he must have expected his peers in the DC to question him thoroughly on his many assertions.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} be heard in answer to charges before an {{unbiased}} tribunal is illustrated in the Singapore case Tan Boon Chee David v. Medical Council of Singapore (1980). During a disciplinary hearing, council members were either not conscientious about their attendance or did not attend the whole course of proceedings. This meant they did not hear all the <b>oral</b> <b>evidence</b> and submissions. The High Court held that this had substantially prejudiced the appellant and constituted a fundamental breach of natural justice. On the other hand, mere absence from a hearing does not necessarily lead to undue prejudice. It was held in Re Teo Choo Hong (1995) that the function of a lay member of a lawyers' disciplinary committee was to observe and not cast a vote or make a judgment. Thus, the appellant had not suffered undue prejudice.|$|E
25|$|The {{delay in}} {{finalising}} {{the form of}} the Commission and its membership was caused by disputes within the government and parliament. The Secretary of State for the Colonies expressed doubts about an inquiry related to Nyasaland alone, and governor Armitage was opposed to any form of Commission, particularly one containing any member of parliament. Despite strong parliamentary pressure for its members' involvement, the cabinet decided on 17 March 1959 that the inquiry would be carried out by a Commission of three and a presiding judge: the government announced its composition on 24 March. The commission was to inquire into and report on the recent disturbances in Nyasaland and the events leading up to them. They arrived in the protectorate on 11 April and spent five weeks there, a week in Southern Rhodesia and four days in London. They took evidence from 455 individual witnesses and 1,300 witnesses in groups. The Nyasaland government presented many documents to the Commission and later gave it <b>oral</b> <b>evidence.</b> Although Devlin had been a Conservative supporter and the other commissioners were Conservatives party members, the Commission went about its work in a way that concerned the Nyasaland government, which had hoped that its declaration of the State of Emergency and the subsequent actions of the police and troops would be vindicated.|$|E

Despite its support by the press, however, the report failed to demonstrate any definitive link, [...] "merely drawing inferences from... often highly speculative accounts in the press rather than independent first-hand research."

2500|$|The {{committee}} met on 25 June {{and decided}} on [...] "wider consultations" [...] {{with the government}} officials and the public. The panel invited public comments and called representatives of various ministries for recording evidence. The meeting was headed by senior Congress MP Satyavrat Chaturvedi. Law Secretary B A Agarwal was summoned to clarify various matters. The committee met again on 19 July 2012. The director of the CBI aired his views in the meeting. He {{made it clear that}} the CBI is open to changes in the Lokpal bill that strengthen the agency's autonomy by enhancing the proposed Lokpal's role in key appointments like those of director, head of prosecution and lawyers who represent CBI. He also mentioned in the meeting that the Lokpal should be given a significant say in appointing the director of the prosecution wing instead of the process being controlled by the law ministry as is currently the procedure, the persistent criticism about CBI's investigations being throttled by political directives could be addressed as well. He opposed making the prosecution or the anti-corruption wings subservient to the Lokpal. The select committee had in its earlier sittings examined senior law officials who agreed with the members that the prescription for lokayuktas under Article 253 that refers to fulfilment of international obligations – in this case the UN convention against corruption – might not be feasible. Recourse to international treaties to frame a law that impact the federal structure is not within the ambit of the law. The Select committee referred the Bill for Public Suggestions in July 2012.

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, some courts {{attempted}} ad hoc accommodations {{to address the}} anxieties of child witnesses in relation to testifying before defendants. Screens or CCTV technology are a common feature of child sexual assault trials today; children in the early 1980s were typically forced into direct visual contact with the accused abuser while in court. SRA allegations in the courts catalyzed a broad agenda of research {{into the nature of}} children's testimony and the reliability of their <b>oral</b> <b>evidence</b> in court. Ultimately in SRA cases, the coercive techniques used by believing district attorneys, therapists and police officers were critical in establishing, and often resolving, SRA cases. In courts, when juries were able to see recordings or transcripts of interviews with children, the alleged abusers were acquitted. The reaction by successful prosecutors, spread throughout conventions and conferences on SRA, was to destroy, or fail to take notes of the interviews in the first place. One group of researchers concluded that children usually lack the sufficient amount of [...] "explicit knowledge" [...] of satanic ritual abuse to fabricate all of the details of an SRA claim on their own. However, the same researchers also concluded that children usually have the sufficient amount of general knowledge of [...] "violence and the occult" [...] to [...] "serve as a starting point from which ritual claims could develop." ...|$|E

40|$|Conventional land {{registration}} systems have served to underpin particular forms of land tenure since ancient Babylon and perhaps before that. However, {{there are a}} number of tenure forms which are ill served by the systems that have evolved from these early systems. For example, 1 billion people live in slums in urban areas where tenure systems often draw on both customary and western tenure practices and some 300 million First Peoples live in different countries around the world. Insecure tenure is a major issue for these communities and often result in conflicts and tensions when they try and defend their rights. Nowadays, we have the technology to capture oral tradition and <b>oral</b> history <b>evidence.</b> However, the courts in Canada have struggled to handle evidence which draws on stories that incorporate myth, legend and fact. The common law itself has had to evolve in order to adjudicate Aboriginal land claims fairly and so recognize the unique, sui generis, nature of these rights. A number of Canadian cases in the last twenty years have also developed guiding principles for how oral tradition and <b>oral</b> history <b>evidence</b> should be presented and examined. This in turn provides guidance on how this type of data should be stored and documented.
