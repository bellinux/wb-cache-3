5|$|In 1954, the <b>original</b> <b>part</b> of State Route 24 was {{replaced}} by U.S. Route 40 Alternate, which continued south on U.S. 99W from Woodland to Davis and southeast on U.S. 395 to Reno, Nevada to join U.S. 40 at both ends. A direct route from Marysville south to Sacramento {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1949 as Route 232, and later became part of a rerouted State Route 24. The U.S. 40 Alternate designation was short-lived, and was mostly replaced by State Route 70 in the 1964 renumbering. Southwest of Marysville, former U.S. 40 Alternate instead became State Route 113, and SR 70 ran south along former State Route 24 (Route 232) to a point north of Sacramento, where the new State Route 99 came in from the northwest and continued south. Despite SR 70 always ending at State Route 99, it was once signed along State Route 99 (El Centro Road, Garden Highway, and the Jibboom Street Bridge) to Sacramento.|$|E

The lack of visible damage supports his theory that the beard was a later addition.|$|E

50|$|The <b>original</b> <b>parts</b> the Italian {{collector}} assembled for 2459 {{were mostly}} engine parts, unfortunately he couldn't find a type 61 engine {{or any other}} parts from 2459 so he substituted a type 60 engine of a different capacity, and included an original cylinder head, lower crankcase and sump, cam covers, and transaxle tower (also known as a differential case), which included the cast numbers for the <b>original</b> birdcage <b>parts</b> used to verify the <b>parts</b> as <b>original</b> type 60. Frank Tralli of Modena, Italy rebuilt the engine to original birdcage specifications from both these <b>original</b> <b>parts</b> and other parts manufactured according to the original drawings. He then Dyno'd the engine for racing {{which can be found}} in the Maserati Tipo 61-2459 Dyno Report.|$|R
25|$|Electroplating is {{a common}} surface-treatment technique. It {{involves}} bonding {{a thin layer of}} another metal such as gold, silver, chromium or zinc {{to the surface of the}} product by hydrolysis. It is used to reduce corrosion, create abrasion resistance and improve the product's aesthetic appearance. Plating can even change the properties of the <b>original</b> <b>part</b> including conductivity, heat dissipation or structural integrity. There are four main electroplating methods to ensure proper coating and cost effectiveness per product: mass plating, rack plating, continuous plating and line plating.|$|E

Nowadays, it is used exclusively by EasyJet with check-in counters B20–B29 and has been refurbished in recent years. The airside consists of three jet bridges {{as well as several}} walk-boarding aircraft stands located at Pier 3a, an extension that was opened in 2005.|$|E
