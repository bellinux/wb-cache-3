5|$|A tea shop {{is a small}} {{restaurant}} that serves soft drinks and light meals, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sedate atmosphere. Customers may eat a cream tea or a Devonshire tea, served from a china set, and a scone with jam and clotted cream.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{women wear}} bikinis when they {{vacation}} abroad or in Goa without the family. Despite the conservative ideas prevalent in India, bikinis {{have become more}} popular. In summer, when women take up swimming, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> public space, a lot of tankinis, shorts and single-piece swimsuits are sold. The maximum sales for bikinis happen in the winter, the honeymoon season.|$|E
5|$|The palazzo is now {{the largest}} museum complex in Florence. The {{principal}} palazzo block, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> building of this design known as the corps de logis, is 32,000 square metres. It is divided into several principal galleries or museums detailed below.|$|E

5|$|In mid-December, as Totti began regaining form post-injury, {{he started}} playing more regularly, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{creative}} {{role as an}} attacking midfielder. On 12 December, he set up Daniele De Rossi's opening goal in a 1–1 home draw against eventual league champions Juventus, although Totti missed a second-half penalty during the match. He provided several more assists that season, notably for Dani Osvaldo's goal in Roma's 3–1 win over Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo on 18 December 2011, and also set up De Rossi's goal against Catania at the Massimino stadium. Playing in a deeper position on the pitch, the Roma talisman did not seek to score goals as often, opting rather to play more of a supporting role by bridging the gap between attack and midfield, using his presence, leadership and experience in games to offer some much needed depth to the team.|$|E
5|$|James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor {{created the}} {{original}} stage design for Double Dare. The {{design for the}} original series' set {{was inspired by a}} 1980s Italian postmodern design and architecture group known as the Memphis Group. Glass brick walls and yellow and pink, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> checkerboard pattern, were prominent aspects of the set design. Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the direction for the set to look like a natatorium (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a bathroom. All the original Double Dare music was composed by Edd Kalehoff.|$|E
5|$|Palladio {{would often}} model his villa {{elevations}} on Roman temple facades. The temple influence, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cruciform design, {{later became a}} trademark of his work. Palladian villas are usually built with three floors: a rusticated basement or ground floor, containing the service and minor rooms. Above this, the piano nobile accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps, containing the principal reception and bedrooms, and above it is a low mezzanine floor with secondary bedrooms and accommodation. The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.|$|E
50|$|Ci {{most often}} express {{feelings}} of desire, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> adopted persona, {{but the greatest}} exponents of the form (such as Li Houzhu and Su Shi) used it to address {{a wide range of}} topics.|$|R

5|$|Shades of Deep Purple was reissued {{many times}} {{all over the}} world, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> set with the two {{following}} albums recorded by the Mk. I line-up. Besides the original issues, the most significant version of the album is the Remastered CD edition released in 2000 by EMI, which contains as bonus tracks previously unreleased recordings from the first demos in April 1968 and from TV show appearances. All the songs were digitally remastered and restored by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios in London, cutting off the sound effects used as transitions in the original edition.|$|E

All the songs were digitally remastered by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios in London. Other notable re-releases of the album include a white vinyl collector's edition issued in 2015 for a Record Store Day.|$|E
5|$|While the Victor {{was never}} {{permanently}} based with any units stationed overseas, temporary deployments were frequently conducted, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ceremonial capacity or {{to participate in}} training exercises and competitions. Victor squadrons were dispatched on several extended deployments to the Far East, and short term deployments to Canada were also conducted for training purposes. At one point during the early 1960s, South Africa showed considerable interest in the acquisition of several bomber-configured Victors; in the end, the Victor would not serve with any other operator other than the RAF.|$|E

5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at the Second Coming of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E
5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The term Regency {{architecture}} refers {{primarily to}} {{buildings of the}} early 19th century, when GeorgeIV was still Prince Regent, and also to later buildings of the Victorian period which were designed in the same style. It follows closely on from the neo-classical Georgian style of architecture, adding an elegance and lightness of touch. Many buildings in the Regency style have a white painted stucco facade and an entryway to the main front door—usually coloured black—framed by two columns. Regency houses were typically built as terraces or crescents, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> setting of trees and shrubs. Elegant wrought iron balconies and bow windows were also fashionable. An instigator of this style was John Nash, whose most notable work in Bristol is Blaise Hamlet, a complex of small cottages surrounding a green. It was built around 1811, for the retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford, who owned Blaise Castle House. The cottages are now owned by the National Trust.|$|E

5000|$|The word apanage {{is still}} used in French figuratively, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-historic sense: [...] "to have appanage over something" [...] is used, <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ironic and {{negative}} sense, to claim exclusive possession over something. For example, [...] "cows have appanage over prions." ...|$|R
500|$|The term [...] "Congolese Genocide" [...] is <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{unrelated}} {{sense to}} refer to the mass-murder and rape committed in the eastern Congo {{in the aftermath of the}} Rwandan Genocide (and the ensuing Second Congo War) between 1998 and 2003.|$|R
5|$|While the inceptive noir, Stranger on the Third Floor, was a B picture {{directed}} by a virtual unknown, {{many of the}} films noir still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with The Maltese Falcon (1941), John Huston followed with Key Largo (1948) and The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), Strangers on a Train (1951) and The Wrong Man (1956). Otto Preminger's success with Laura (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss 20th Century-Fox presentation. Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more <b>often</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include Fallen Angel (1945), Whirlpool (1949), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) (all for Fox) and Angel Face (1952). A half-decade after Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend, Billy Wilder made Sunset Boulevard (1950) and Ace in the Hole (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. In a Lonely Place (1950) was Nicholas Ray's breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, They Live by Night (1948) and On Dangerous Ground (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.|$|E
