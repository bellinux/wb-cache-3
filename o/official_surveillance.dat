According to the peak journalists' organisation, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA), two recent Australian court cases 'despite their welcome outcome for our members, clearly demonstrate Australia's patchy and disparate journalist shields fail to do their job' (MEAA, 2014 a). Journalists' recent court experiences exposed particular shield law inadequacies, including curious omissions or ambiguities in legislative drafting (Fernandez, 2014 c, p. 131); the 'unusual difficulty' that a case may present (Hancock Prospecting No 2, 2014, para 7); the absence of definitive statutory protection in three jurisdictions-Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory (Fernandez, 2014 b, p. 26); and the absence of uniform shield laws where such law is available (Fernandez, 2014 b, pp. 26 - 28). This {{article examines}} the following key findings of a national survey of practising journalists: (a) participants' general profile; (b) familiarity with shield laws; (c) perceptions of shield law effectiveness and coverage; (d) perceptions of story outcomes when relying on confidential sources; and (e) concerns about <b>official</b> <b>surveillance</b> and enforcement. The conclusion briefly considers the significance and limitations of this research; future research directions; some reform and training directions; and notes that the considerable efforts to secure shield laws in Australia might be jeopardised without better training of journalists about the laws themselves and how surveillance technologies and powers might compromise source confidentiality.

We show in this paper a number of problems with the use of regional currency-basket based divergence indicators. First, at a technical level, such indicators involve tracking regional exchange rates against a moving currency basket and can obscure underlying movements in bilateral exchange rates. Second, currency baskets generally treat currencies asymmetrically leading to difficulties interpreting the derived measures of divergence. Third, intra-regional exchange rate monitoring can lead to potentially serious N- 1 or anchor problems. Some of thes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The HIV burden {{estimate}} for India {{has a very}} wide plausibility range. A recent population-based study in a south Indian district demonstrated that the official method used in India to estimate HIV burden in the population, which directly extrapolates annual sentinel surveillance data from large public sector antenatal and sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics, led to a 2 – 3 times higher estimate than that based on population-based data. Methods We assessed the generalisability of the reasons found in the Guntur study for overestimation of HIV by the <b>official</b> sentinel <b>surveillance</b> based method: addition of substantial unnecessary HIV estimates from STI clinics, the common practice of referral of HIV positive/suspect patients by private practitioners to public hospitals, and a preferential use of public hospitals by lower socioeconomic strata. We derived conservative correction factors for the sentinel surveillance data and titrated these to the four major HIV states in India (Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu), and examined {{the impact on the}} overall HIV {{estimate for}} India. Results HIV data from STI clinics are not used elsewhere in the world as a component of HIV burden estimation in generalised epidemics, and the Guntur study verified that this was unnecessary. The referral of HIV positive/suspect patients from the private to the public sector is a widespread phenomenon in India, which is likely causing an upward distortion in HIV estimates from sentinel surveillance in other parts of India as well. Analysis of data from the nationwide Reproductive and Child Health Survey revealed that lower socioeconomic strata were over-represented among women seeking antenatal care at public hospitals in all major south Indian states, similar to the trend seen in the Guntur study. Application of conservative correction factors derived from the Guntur study reduced the 2005 <b>official</b> sentinel <b>surveillance</b> based HIV estimate of 3. 7 million 15 – 49 years old persons in the four major states to 1. 5 – 2. 0 million, which would drop the official total estimate of 5. 2 million 15 – 49 years old persons with HIV in India to 3 – 3. 5 million. Conclusion Plausible and cautious extrapolation of the trends seen in a recent large and rigorous population-based study of HIV in a south Indian district suggests that India is likely grossly overestimating its HIV burden with the current <b>official</b> sentinel <b>surveillance</b> based method. This method needs revision. </p...|$|R

RESULTS: The highest overall mortality rate (2. 3 per 100, 000) was observed in 2009. Pregnant women constituted the highest risk group (mortality rate 18. 0 per 100, 000). Following vaccination of high-risk groups, the rate reduced sharply but peaked again in 2012. It subsequently decreased, albeit more gradually.

The probability and predictive value of how social systems deal with epidemics can be conceptually and empirically studied by monitoring social media data for formulating risk-informed decisions in improving preparedness and response to epidemics. ILI (influenza-like illness) surveillance by monitoring social media data offers opportunity to provide early warning signs for improving public health interventions.

40|$|In all European Union member states, Salmonella {{monitoring}} in poultry flocks is obligatory. In these monitoring programmes, {{a limited}} number of pooled faeces and/or dust samples are collected to determine whether Salmonella is present in the flocks or not. Whether these limited sampling protocols are sufficiently sensitive to detect expected low within-flock prevalences of an intermittently shed pathogen is not yet clear. In this study, a comparison is made between different sampling procedures for the assessment of the between- and within-flock prevalence of Salmonella in laying hens. In total, 19 farms were sampled. Using a comparable sampling methodology as in the <b>official</b> <b>surveillance</b> programmes, Salmonella could not be detected in any of the flocks. After transportation of the hens to the laboratory and subsequent analysis of cloacal swabs and caecal contents, Salmonella Enteritidis was detected in laying hens from five of 19 farms. The observed within-flock prevalence ranged from 1 % to 14 %. Based on the results of this study, it can be expected that, depending on the sampling procedure, different estimates of the prevalence of Salmonella can be obtained and the proportion of Salmonella infected flocks is underestimated {{based on the results of}} the official monitoring programme...|$|E

For the 2 diseases under <b>official</b> <b>surveillance</b> (FMD and brucellosis) our results were similar to official data, although we found significantly higher brucellosis levels in 2 districts and widespread ignorance about FMD vaccination status. The seroprevalence for BT virus was 23 %, and seropositive animals were widespread suggesting endemicity, despite the disease not having being previously reported. We found a few seropositives for EHDV and PPRV, which may suggest that these diseases are also present in Kazakhstan. An hierarchical model showed that seroprevalence to FMD and BT viruses were clustered at the farm/village level, rather than at a larger spatial scale. This was unexpected for FMD, which is subject to vaccination policies which vary at the raion (county) level. </p...|$|E
