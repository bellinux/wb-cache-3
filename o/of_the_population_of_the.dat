5|$|A {{large part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern states {{believed}} that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and {{although there was no}} evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Contact between English and {{immigrant}} languages {{has given rise}} to new accents and dialects. For instance, <b>the</b> variety <b>of</b> English spoken by Poles in Manchester is distinct both from typical Polish-accented English and from Mancunian. At a local level, <b>the</b> diversity <b>of</b> immigrant communities means that some languages that are extremely rare in {{the country as a whole}} have strongholds in Northern towns: Pashto is spoken natively by 0.08% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> England but 0.7% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Bradford, while Cantonese is <b>the</b> first language <b>of</b> 0.4% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Manchester compared to 0.08% nationally.|$|R
5|$|A {{significant}} {{but small}} percentage of people have employment {{in the oil industry}} owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities, such as Inverness, Dingwall, Alness and Invergordon, which is why only 14% of households in the zone own no car. 10.4% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zone are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which soak up much of the tourist income that the town generates.|$|E
5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and initiated the devastating plagues that {{swept through the}} native populations of the Americas. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality. Maya written histories suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area {{the same year that}} it arrived in central Mexico. Among the most deadly diseases were the aforementioned smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33–50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maya highlands perished.|$|E

5|$|After the Norman Conquest in 1066, feudal {{rule was}} {{established}} in Dorset and {{the bulk of the}} land was divided between the Crown and ecclesiastical institutions. The Normans consolidated their control over the area by constructing castles at Corfe, Wareham and Dorchester {{in the early part of}} the 12th century. Over the next 200 years Dorset's population grew substantially and additional land was enclosed for farming to provide the extra food required. The wool trade, the quarrying of Purbeck Marble and the busy ports of Weymouth, Melcombe Regis, Lyme Regis and Bridport brought prosperity to the county. However, Dorset was devastated by the bubonic plague in 1348 which arrived in Melcombe Regis on a ship from Gascony. The disease, more commonly known as the Black Death, created an epidemic that spread rapidly and wiped out a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues confronting the delegates was that of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the states {{at the time of}} the Convention.

Slaves comprised approximately one-fifth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> states; and apart from northernmost New England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived throughout all regions of the country. The majority of the slaves (more than 90%), however, lived in the South, where approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2 families). The entire agrarian economy of the South was based on slave labor, and the Southern delegates to the Convention were unwilling to accept any proposals that they believed would threaten the institution.|$|E
