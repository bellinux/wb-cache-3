5|$|All German {{officers}} {{were required to}} obtain official permission to marry; however, this was usually a bureaucratic formality. When Lent decided to marry Elizabeth Petersen, his admirer from Hamburg whom he had met <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> date, his case was more complicated. 'Elisabeth Petersen' was in fact Helene (Lena) Senokosnikova, born in Moscow in April 1914. She had been afraid to reveal her true identity, since Russians were not popular in the Third Reich, but after a thorough investigation into her background and racial ancestry, she received her German citizenship on 15 March 1941. They were married on 10 September 1941 in Wellingsbüttel, Hamburg. The marriage produced two daughters. Christina was born on 6 June 1942; the second, Helma, was born on 6 October 1944, shortly after her father's fatal crash.|$|E

5|$|On 14 February 1942, seeking {{reprisal}} {{for their}} great loss and also retaliation against retreating {{soldiers from the}} 44th Indian Brigade who had fired from Alexandra Hospital, 3 groups of Japanese soldiers went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> rampage and entered the hospital from the rear bayoneting everyone they found, {{regardless of whether they}} were soldiers, patients and medical staff. They killed a British officer, Lieutenant W.E.J. Weston, who was carrying a white flag to meet them. Even a young patient, Corporal Holden, who was lying on an operating table was not spared. About 200 defenceless souls were massacred. Some managed to escape death by falling to the floor and pretending to be dead.|$|E

Theodore explains that, although he and Amy (Amy Adams) dated briefly in college, they are only good friends, and that Amy is married. Theodore and Samantha's intimacy grows through a verbal sexual encounter.

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Air Force, Barr {{remained}} in Mildura with his wife, Dorothy (Dot). They had met <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> date in 1938 and been married {{only a few}} weeks when Nicky joined the RAAF. During the war she was told on three occasions that her husband was dead. The couple had two sons, born in 1945 and 1947. Barr's injuries prevented him from returning to a rugby career, and he took up yachting as a sport. He also briefly assisted fellow No.3 Squadron veteran Bobby Gibbes in an airline venture in New Guinea, before going into business as a company manager and director with civil engineering and pharmaceutical firms. Barr rejoined the RAAF on 20March 1951 as a pilot in the active Citizen Air Force (CAF), with the acting rank of wing commander. On 15April 1953, he transferred to the CAF reserve. A member of the Royal Air Forces Escaping Society, Barr began travelling to Italy with his wife on a regular basis in the late 1950s to seek out and offer assistance to those who had helped him during his wartime escape attempts.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} {{significant}} awnings {{in the ancient world}} was the velarium, the massive complex of retractable shade structures that could be deployed above the seating areas of the Roman Colosseum.

40|$|Abstract. Security-aware {{embedded}} devices which {{are likely to}} operate in hostile environments need protection against physical attacks. For the RSA public-key algorithm, protected versions of the Montgomery pow-ering ladder have gained popularity as countermeasures for such attacks. In this paper, we present a general fault attack against RSA implemen-tations which use the Montgomery powering ladder. In a first step, we discuss under which realistic fault assumptions our observation {{can be used to}} attack basic implementations. In a second step, we extend our attack to a scenario, where the message is blinded {{at the beginning of the}} exponentiation algorithm. To the best of our knowledge this is the first fault attack <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blinded</b> Montgomery powering ladder...|$|R

40|$|Zirconia as a {{restoration}} dental material are gaining attention {{because of their}} high mechanical properties and good biocompatibility. Therefore, investigation of the flexural strength of zirconia is of great interest. For this purpose, Weibull statistics for description of the material reliability are frequently used. The aim of this work was to present <b>a</b> <b>blinded</b> data set to two independent statisticians for two parallel statistical analyses {{in order to find}} an optimal statistical approach for analysis of in-vitro measured flexural strength data of zirconia materials. A prospectively planned independent blinded statistical analysis implementing three quality control actions “blinded data set”, “independent statistical analyses” and “parallel manuscript writing” was designed. Statistical analysis paths taken by both biostatisticians differed. They arrived at complementary results. The major difference was caused by two alternative distributional assumptions (Weibull/Normal) and alternative fitting methods (LS/ML). The parallel statistical analysis and manuscript writing approach <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blinded</b> data set greatly supported our choice of statistical methods for analysis of flexural strength results of zirconia materials...|$|R
