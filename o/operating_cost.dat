5|$|A third {{approach}} achieves some of {{the output}} benefits of tracking, with a lesser penalty in terms of land area, capital and <b>operating</b> <b>cost.</b> This involves tracking the sun in one dimension – in its daily journey across the sky – but not adjusting for the seasons. The angle of the axis is normally horizontal, though some, such as the solar park at Nellis Airforce Base, which have a 20° tilt, incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation – effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt.|$|E
5|$|Airline {{customers}} were uninterested in the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and a <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> lower than any 767 stretch. Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, {{adding to the}} heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new clean–sheet design, which became the 777 twinjet. The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.|$|E

As a result, the 767's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used computer-aided design for {{over a third of}} the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4billion.|$|E
5|$|The hall cost NOK134.6 million, {{of which}} NOK88.5 million was {{grants from the}} government. The hall opened on 6 May 1993, with a show {{televised}} on national television and with 5,000 guests. It was the 29th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway, and the world's largest cavern hall for public use. At the time of opening, the venue was estimated to incur an <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> of NOK3 to 4 four million, and an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million. To finance this, the state established a fund similar to other Olympic venues, but the fund only received NOK1 million, {{and the rest of}} the operating costs would have to be taken by the municipality. The venue is owned through Gjøvik Olympiske Anlegg, originally owned 70% by Gjøvik Municipality and 30% by Lillehammer Olympiapark, but later taken entirely over by the municipality.|$|E
5|$|By 1988, {{building}} costs had increased from NOK 88 to 131 million.

In 1990, the airport company was forced to refinance, and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was refinanced, and the obligations transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county. However, by 1991, passenger numbers were above 20,000, three quarters coming from charter traffic. On 1January 1996, Fagernes Airport was nationalized, along with 25 other regional airports, and put {{under the control of the}} Norwegian Airport Authority (now Avinor). Following the closure of Geilo Airport, Dagali in 2003, Fagernes experienced an increase in charter traffic.|$|E

However, its use is currently limited, {{because of the}} high capital and <b>operating</b> <b>costs.</b> In this paper, the development of MBR for wastewater treatment and reuse in China were reviewed, and the cost analysis were also discussed. Two types of costs are considered, capital <b>costs</b> and <b>operating</b> <b>costs.</b> Capital costs include the fixed costs and the membrane units costs. For ceramic, submerged and side-stream MBRs, the membrane costs is amount to 59 % - 68 %, 36 % - 52 % and 20. 5 % of the total capital <b>costs,</b> respectively. <b>Operating</b> <b>costs</b> comprise energy consumption, membrane replacement, chemicals, wastewater and sludge disposal, plant maintenance and repairs. Energy consumption and the overall costs associated with membrane module replacement are dominant components of the total operation costs. Operation costs of submerged MBR is only 63 % of side-stream MBR, because submerged MBR has a low energy consumption. The dominant components of <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> for ceramic MBR and side-stream MBR are energy consumption costs.
