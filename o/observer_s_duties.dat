That part provides a historical framework of the evolving law in broker disclosure and the broker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>duty</b> to third persons, concentrating mainly on California law. Part II discusses the broker disclosure statute and the downfall of its narrow interpretation. Part III discusses the common-law balancing test, and the benefits of its application to the Coldwell Banker case and other cases like it. Finally, Part IV concludes that the court in Coldwell Banker erred by taking a narrow interpretation of the statute to establish the broker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>duty</b> to third persons, and that it should instead have used the common-law balancing test to establish duty...|$|R

40|$|The recent Supreme Court {{decision}} invalidating state abortion statutes, the much-publicized Michigan psychosurgery decision, {{the growing}} number of right to treatment cases, and the issuance of federal guidelines protecting minors and other legally incompetent participants in federally funded sterilization programs have prompted a reconsideration of the personal rights of patients within the physician-patient-state relationship. Recent malpractice cases reveal an innovative trend in tort law expanding the physician 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>duty</b> to disclose information to a patient in order to obtain that patient 2 ̆ 7 s informed consent. This article will discuss several of the complex issues associated with the physician-patient relationship: how courts define the physician 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>duty</b> to disclose under the present law, when informed consent is required; when an adult is deemed incompetent by the state to give such consent, and what special considerations arise as incidents of minority...|$|R

40|$|A lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s {{erroneous}} {{disclosure of}} damaging information to an adversary is {{a variation on}} the broader question of whether a lawyer should ever take advantage of an adversary lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s blunder.

All of the other purported justifications for covering up for an adversary lawyer, to the prejudice of one 2 ̆ 7 s own client, are simply excuses for what George Bernard Shaw would call a conspiracy of professionals against the laity.
