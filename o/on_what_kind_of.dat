5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a color associated with {{the rich and the}} privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of the color) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper amaranth.|$|E

40|$|A {{challenge}} {{has been}} put forth that the software engineering community organize to advance its scientific maturity through benchmarking. It has been further asserted that requirements engineering is ripe for activity in this area. The position {{of this paper is}} that while there are very likely benefits to be gained from movement in this direction, implications from the multidisciplinary nature of requirements warrant very careful consideration if value is in fact to be achieved. The challenges provided are both intellectual and practical. First, the complexity of the various socio-technical goals of requirements complicates the definition of clear and useful but testable performance measures. Second, the fact that the most interesting performance measures involve the behavior of humans places non-trivial constraints not only <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> data can be gathered practically in the service of this goal, but <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> research activities may be undertaken ethically. These issues are illustrated with examples from the author's experience, and a way forward is proposed...|$|R

Due to the rise in property values in Park Slope, the neighborhood experienced a boundary rebranding, in which real-estate agents coalesced Fort Greene into Bedford-Stuyvesant; South Slope, Prospect Heights, Windsor Terrace, Gowanus, Greenwood Heights, and Boerum Hill into part of greater Park Slope.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Robert Enright {{from the}} University of Wisconsin–Madison founded the International Forgiveness Institute and is {{considered}} the initiator of forgiveness studies. He developed a 20-Step Process Model of Forgiveness. Recent work has focused <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> person {{is more likely to}} be forgiving. A longitudinal study showed that people who were generally more neurotic, angry, and hostile in life were less likely to forgive another person even after a long time had passed. Specifically, these people were more likely to still avoid their transgressor and want to enact revenge upon them two and a half years after the transgression.|$|E

There are female {{characters}} such as Judi Dench's M, and Camille Montes, a Bolivian intelligence agent who teams up with Bond in Quantum of Solace, who are not romantic interests of Bond, and hence not strictly Bond girls.

25|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of green roofs {{is that the}} initial cost of installing a green roof can be double that of a normal roof. Depending <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> green roof it is, the maintenance costs could be higher, but some types of green roof {{have little or no}} ongoing cost. Some kinds of green roofs also place higher demands on the waterproofing system of the structure, both because water is retained on the roof and due to the possibility of roots penetrating the waterproof membrane. Another disadvantage is that the wildlife they attract may include pest insects which could easily infiltrate a residential building through open windows.|$|E
25|$|The trading emporium of Jenné {{was subject}} to the Moroccan pashalik of Timbuktu, named for the city where the Moroccan expeditionary force governed from.

There are no details <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> troops were present when the mansa first began marching toward it, but once the governor was alerted, he sent word to Timbuktu for reinforcements. In response, Pasha Ammar sent a force headed by Qa’id al-Mustafa al-Fil and Qa’id Ali bin Abd Allah al-Tilimsani, which included arquebusiers.|$|E
25|$|The Syrian Cultural Caravan has the {{political}} aim to re-establish {{the complexity of}} the Syrian conflict. It provides the public with another narrative, counterweighting the simplified stories of bombings, attacks and terrorism found in the media. The work of artists is, according to Leila Shahid in La Marseilleise, a universal language to express the Syrian people’s suffering. It gives the opportunity for artists of the caravan to contribute in their own way to raise awareness and engage the public, {{while at the same time}} reflecting <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> change art can bring. They do not wish to offer a blueprint, unidimensional solution to the conflict but rather they open up the space for dialogue by creating a platform of exchange.|$|E

Kelly initially thought Becky {{would not be able}} to adopt because of her criminal record, but the society pointed out that the storyline would highlight the fact that adoption is possible for previous offenders, with Kelly stating: [...] "They said the two main things they look for are stability in a family and a lot of back-up at home, which Becky and Steve have with Roy, Hayley and Liz."

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] was {{produced}} by Vincent Joliet and directed by Joe Pytka and depicts, {{from the point of}} view of a bird in flight, many references to Beatles songs, such as [...] "Penny Lane", [...] "Paperback Writer", [...] "A Day in the Life", [...] "Eleanor Rigby", [...] "Helter Skelter", [...] "Piggies", [...] "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill", [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", [...] "Doctor Robert", and [...] "The Fool on The Hill". Between 80 and 100 allusions to the Beatles' story, music and lyrics in the video have been estimated. Although the bird can be heard at the beginning of the video, it is never seen. Neil Aspinall (Apple Records executive at the time) said that this was because no-one could agree <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> bird it should be. Pytka had to send his ideas to McCartney, Harrison and Starr, as well as Ono, to make sure they all agreed before he could proceed with the filming of the video. Derek Taylor (ex-Apple Records executive) sent a two-page letter to Pytka confirming that he could proceed, and personally encouraged and supported Pytka's ideas. The video was filmed in as many authentic locations as possible: Penny Lane was made by Pytka's art department to look as it was in the 1950s, and other locations filmed were The Liver Building, and Liverpool Docks (as a reference to Lennon's father Alfred Lennon).|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, {{who plays}} Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his {{character}} was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed {{due to the}} end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not [...] "want to reveal where [...] and why" [...] in this film. Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, [...] "You've got to kind of choose your roster [...] depending <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fight you want to have." [...] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear {{at the very end of}} the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, [...] " [...] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [...] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie." [...] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross [...] "was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix." [...] Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.|$|E
