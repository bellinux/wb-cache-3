5|$|After {{rendering}} non-combat {{service in}} the Spanish–American War, Morrow graduated from the University of Cincinnati Law School in 1902 and opened his practice in Lexington, Kentucky. He {{made a name for}} himself almost immediately by securing the acquittal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> who had been charged with murder based on an extorted confession and perjured testimony. He was appointed U.S. District Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky by President William Howard Taft in 1910 and served until he was removed from office in 1913 by President Woodrow Wilson. In 1915, he ran for governor against his good friend, Augustus O. Stanley. Stanley won the election by 471 votes, making the 1915 contest the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history.|$|E
5|$|Although Evans {{had led the}} {{kidnapping}} and torture <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> while leader of the Dallas Klan, as Imperial Wizard he publicly discouraged vigilante actions, fearing that they would hinder his attempts to gain political influence. In 1923, Evans presided over the largest Klan gathering in history, attended by over 200,000, and endorsed several successful candidates in 1924 elections. He moved the Klan's headquarters from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., and organized a march of 30,000 members—the largest march in the organization's history—on Pennsylvania Avenue. Evans' efforts notwithstanding, the Klan was buffeted by damaging publicity in the early 1920s, partially because of leadership struggles between Evans and his rivals, which hindered his political efforts. In the 1930s, the Great Depression significantly decreased the Klan's income, prompting Evans {{to work for a}} construction company to supplement his pay. He resigned his position with the Klan in 1939, after disavowing anti-Catholicism. He was succeeded by his chief of staff, James A. Colescott. The next year, Evans faced accusations of involvement in a government corruption scandal in Georgia; he was fined $15,000 after legal proceedings.|$|E

25|$|Although lynchings {{have become}} rare {{following}} the Civil Rights Movement and changing social mores, some have occurred. In 1981, two Klan members in Alabama randomly selected a 19-year-old black man, Michael Donald, and murdered him, to retaliate for a jury's acquittal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> accused of murdering a police officer. The Klansmen were caught, prosecuted, and convicted. A $7 million judgment {{in a civil}} suit against the Klan bankrupted the local subgroup, the United Klans of America.|$|E
25|$|In Genesee County on August 4, 2010, it was {{announced}} that a string of stabbings that date back to May 2010 was the work of one man and a multi-jurisdictional task force was set up to investigate. The next week on August 9, 2010 police in Leesburg connected three hammer attacks against black men there via their victims' descriptions of the suspect, video surveillance footage of the attacks that matches his description and vehicle, and the similar mode of operation.

25|$|In July 1919, whites, {{including}} uniformed {{sailors and}} soldiers, attacked blacks in Washington during Red Summer, when violence {{broke out in}} cities across the country. The catalyst in Washington was the rumored arrest <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> for rape; in four days of mob violence, white men randomly beat black people on the street, and pulled others off streetcars for attacks. When police refused to intervene, the black population fought back. Troops tried to restore order as the city closed saloons and theaters, but a summer rainstorm had a more dampening effect. A total of 15 people were killed: 10 whites, including two police officers; and five blacks. Fifty people were seriously wounded and another 100 less severely wounded. The NAACP protested to President Wilson.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E
25|$|I {{am happy}} {{to be able to}} inform you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E

25|$|Two of {{the most}} violent episodes {{occurred}} in Washington, D.C. and Chicago. In Washington, D.C., white men, many in military uniforms, responded to the rumored arrest <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> for rape with four days of mob violence, rioting and beatings of random black people on the street. When police refused to intervene, the black population fought back. When the violence ended, ten whites were dead, including two police officers, and 5 blacks. Some 150 people had been the victims of attacks. The rioting in Chicago started on July 27. Chicago's beaches along Lake Michigan were segregated in practice, if not by law. A black youth who drifted into the area customarily reserved for whites was stoned and drowned. Blacks responded violently when the police refused to take action. Violence between mobs and gangs lasted 13 days. The resulting 38 fatalities included 23 blacks and 15 whites. Injuries numbered 537 injured, and 1,000 black families were left homeless. Some 50 people were reported dead. Unofficial numbers were much higher. Hundreds of mostly black homes and businesses on the South Side were destroyed by mobs, and a militia force of several thousand was called in to restore order.|$|E
25|$|In December 1931, Salisbury was {{the site}} of a lynching <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man.</b> Members of a 300-man white mob dragged Matthew Williams, accused of murdering his white {{employer}} and wounded while being captured, from his hospital bed. They threw Williams from a third-floor window to the crowd below, where he was stabbed, tied to a truck and dragged three blocks to the county court house. There they hanged him from a tree, before he had any chance of a trial. The mob paraded his body through the black part of Salisbury for intimidation, and mutilated and burned him. It was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882. No one was prosecuted for Williams' murder, as was typical in lynchings. As of 2007, there was no commemoration of the extrajudicial murder. The Equal Justice Initiative, based in Montgomery, Alabama, published an updated compilation of lynchings in 2015. Director Bryan Stephenson is leading the effort to establish a museum and memorial to these crimes, and encourages counties to establish their own memorials. He believes that the history of slavery and lynchings has influenced the continued over-incarceration of blacks and punitive sentencing.|$|E
500|$|On 9 September 1985, a {{month before}} Blakelock's murder, the Handsworth Riots {{occurred}} in Birmingham, after the arrest <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> for a traffic offence; two people were killed. On 28 September, a black woman, Dorothy [...] "Cherry" [...] Groce (1948–2011), was accidentally shot by police while they searched her home in Brixton looking for her son, Michael Groce, who was wanted on suspicion of robbery and firearms offences.|$|E
25|$|Welch, Cox, and {{two older}} accomplices, Arthur Haley and Hubert Rowell were indicted on several charges {{of civil rights}} {{violations}} involving the burning of the Macedonian Baptist Church and other racially-charged crimes. Haley and Rowell were also charged with burning a Hispanic migrant camp in Manning, SC, burning <b>a</b> car <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>Manning</b> resident, and illegally possessing firearms. The federal indictment said that Haley selected the Macedonian Baptist Church as the arson target and Rowell instructed Cox and Welch on how to set the fire. All four defendants pleaded guilty to the charges. They received federal prison sentences ranging from 12 to 21.5 years.|$|R

500|$|Several songs {{have been}} {{produced}} {{in response to the}} Jena Six case. John Mellencamp released a song and video called [...] "Jena", with lyrics such as [...] "Jena, take your nooses down" [...] which gained considerable media attention, and which Mellencamp described as a [...] "condemnation of racism." [...] The video juxtaposes images of Jena, the high school, and the tree with video from the 1960s, including civil rights marchers and police beatings. Video of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King speaking and an image <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> in shackles are also included in the video. The song and video led to Jena's mayor, Murphy R. McMillan, issuing a statement rebutting the accusations he believed were expressed and implied in the video. An episode of the Salt-N-Pepa Show on VH1 was filmed at the Jena rally. Bomani Armah released a song called [...] "Jena 6".|$|E
500|$|Both legal teams, in {{planning}} their trial strategy, considered {{the implications of}} trying a white man based on the testimony <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> {{in front of an}} early 1900s Georgia jury. Jeffrey Melnick, author of Black-Jewish Relations on Trial: Leo Frank and Jim Conley in the New South, writes that the defense tried to picture Conley as [...] "a new kind of African Americananarchic, degraded, and dangerous." [...] Dorsey, however, pictured Conley as [...] "a familiar type" [...] of [...] "old negro", like a minstrel or plantation worker. [...] Dorsey's strategy played on prejudices of the white 1900s Georgia observers, i.e., that a black man could not have been intelligent enough to make up a complicated story. The prosecution argued that Conley's statement explaining {{the immediate aftermath of the}} murder was true, that Frank was the murderer, and that Frank had dictated the murder notes to Conley in an effort to pin the crime on Newt Lee, the night watchman.|$|E
500|$|Most music historians {{date the}} writing of [...] "The Bourgeois Blues" [...] to Lead Belly's June 1937 trip to Washington, DC, when he was invited by the folklorist Alan Lomax to record for the Library of Congress's folk music collection.

Lomax, in some versions of the story described as an unnamed [...] "white friend", offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the Supreme Court Building. The next morning, Lead Belly awoke to Lomax arguing with his landlord about the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> with the landlord threatening to call the police.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the war, nearly 21 million people lived in the North {{compared}} to 9 million in the South. While the North's population was almost entirely white, the South had an enormous number of black slaves and people of color. [...] While the latter were free, becoming a soldier was seen as the prerogative of white men only. Many Southerners were terrified at the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> with a gun. Excluding old men and boys, the white males available for Confederate service were less than two million. [...] There was also the additional burden that the near four million black slaves had to be heavily policed as there was no trust between the owner and [...] "owned". The North had vastly greater industrial capacity, built nearly all of the locomotives, steamships, and industrial machinery and had a much larger and more integrated railroad system. Nearly all of the munitions facilities were in the North, while critical ingredients for gunpowder were in very short supply in the South.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1930s, {{representatives from}} Lancashire County Cricket Club twice {{approached}} Constantine {{with a view}} to him joining the club—his time in Nelson meant that he qualified to play for Lancashire, having lived in the county for the required time. There was a precedent for such a course, as the Australian Ted McDonald had joined Lancashire after playing as Nelson's professional in the 1920s. In the case of Constantine nothing happened, as members of the Lancashire Board and, later, players in the team opposed the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> playing for the county. In any case Constantine preferred league cricket to what he perceived was the negativity and dullness of county cricket. He found the standard of play very high, stating: [...] "Never in my life have I played harder than in Lancashire." [...] In his history of West Indies cricket, Michael Manley writes that league cricket at this time was intense and unrelenting, but: [...] "it was in this special atmosphere of League cricket that Constantine was supreme." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a view of a Carey's {{personal}} family album. As the pages open, the camera zooms to one particular photograph, of her young mother facing a wall, with her back turned. As the picture comes into full view, it turns into actual footage. Her mother turns around in anguish, as her own mother begins shouting at her and calling her a disgrace to the family. This {{is due to the fact}} that she is pregnant with the child <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> with whom she wants to move out with. As she goes to leave the home, her mother grabs her arm and rips off a [...] "charmbracelet" [...] from her wrist. As she picks it up off the floor, she tells her mother she hates her and leaves in a taxi. From the clothing and scenery, it is notable that the scenes depicted are happening in the late 1960s, prior to Carey's birth. As the song starts playing, the video focuses on Carey, walking down the street in New York City. As she continues singing and walking down the street, the camera aims to the sky, which is darkened with cloud while light starts to peer through.|$|E
