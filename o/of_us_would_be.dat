25|$|Dr Oliver, I was told, … had a liking and a ′flair′ for the {{invention}} of simple appliances, with which observations and experiments could {{be made on the}} human subject. Dr Oliver had invented a small instrument with which he claimed to be able to measure, through the unbroken skin, the diameter of a living artery, such as the radial artery at the wrist. He appears to have used his family in his experiments, and a young son {{was the subject of a}} series, in which Dr Oliver measured the diameter of the radial artery, and observed the effect upon it of injecting extracts of various animal glands under the skin. … We may picture, then, Professor Schafer, in the old physiological laboratory at University College, … finishing an experiment of some kind, in which he was recording the arterial blood pressure of an anaesthetised dog. … To him enters Dr Oliver, with the story of the experiments on his boy, and, in particular, with the statement that injection under the skin of a glycerin extract from calf’s suprarenal gland was followed by a definite narrowing of the radial artery. Professor Schafer is said to have been entirely sceptical, and to have attributed the observation to self-delusion. … He can hardly be blamed, I think; knowing even what we now know about the action of this extract, which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> prepared to believe that injecting it under a boy’s skin would cause his radial artery to become measurably more slender? Dr Oliver, however, is persistent; he … suggests that, at least, it will do no harm to inject into the circulation, through a vein, a little of the suprarenal extract, which he produces from his pocket. So Professor Schafer makes the injection, expecting a triumphant demonstration of nothing, and finds himself standing ′like some watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims into his ken,′ watching the mercury rise in the manometer with amazing rapidity and to an astounding height.|$|E
500|$|In the 1860s and 1870s ever larger {{forces were}} assembled. Bernard Shaw, {{in his role}} as a music critic, commented, [...] "The stale wonderment which the great chorus never fails to elicit has already been exhausted"; he later wrote, [...] "Why, instead of wasting huge sums on the multitudinous {{dullness}} of a Handel Festival does not somebody set up a thoroughly rehearsed and exhaustively studied performance of the Messiah in St James's Hall with a chorus of twenty capable artists? Most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> glad to hear the work seriously performed once before we die." [...] The employment of huge forces necessitated considerable augmentation of the orchestral parts. Many admirers of Handel believed that the composer would have made such additions, had [...] the appropriate instruments been available in his day. Shaw argued, largely unheeded, that [...] "the composer may be spared from his friends, and the function of writing or selecting 'additional orchestral accompaniments' exercised with due discretion." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs from}} the band's third album, Vitalogy, were premiered during this tour. The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't think any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if we should just go home, or if we should attend the services. I still have some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it}} was probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour. I decided I would play those next two weeks and then I'd never have to play again." ...|$|E

500|$|The film won awards {{from the}} National Board of Review of Motion Pictures for Best Film and Best Director, and Bale {{received}} a special citation for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor, the first National Board award bestowed {{on a child}} actor. At the 60th Academy Awards, Empire of the Sun was nominated for Art Direction, Cinematography, Editing, Original Music Score, Costume Design (Bob Ringwood), and Sound (Robert Knudson, Don Digirolamo, John Boyd and Tony Dawe). It did not convert any of the nominations into awards. Allen Daviau, who was nominated as cinematographer, publicly complained, [...] "I can't second-guess the Academy, but I feel very sorry that I get nominations and Steven doesn't. It's his vision that makes it all come together, and if Steven wasn't making these films, none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> here." [...] The film won awards for cinematography, sound design, and music score at the 42nd British Academy Film Awards. The nominations included production design, costume design, and adapted screenplay. Spielberg was honored by his work from the Directors Guild of America, while the American Society of Cinematographers honored Allen Daviau. Empire of the Sun was nominated for Best Motion Picture (Drama) and Original Score at the 45th Golden Globe Awards. John Williams earned a Grammy Award nomination.|$|E

2500|$|The movie Saaz was {{supposedly}} based on Lata and Asha's rivalry. Asha {{said about the}} movie– [...] "To have two women in long plaits, {{take a couple of}} incidents and exaggerate them into a 3-hour film is such a waste of time." [...] In the last few years, Asha and Lata have often been seen in public, enjoying each other's company. In an interview with The Times of India, Asha once said– [...] "I remember, sometimes both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> at a function and some industry types would ignore me and interact only with her, as if to prove their loyalty.

2500|$|This {{approach}} earned {{praise from}} two influential intellectual {{figures of the}} Romanian diaspora, critics Monica Lovinescu and Virgil Ierunca, whose letter to the author read: [...] "the distances you take from your own background are of most-rare authenticity and tact. You accomplish a radical break, being {{at the same time}} participative, negating things only after you have understood them, being dissociated from both roles of judge and defense counsel." [...] Cioroianu also notes: [...] "He is not the only son of (relatively) well-known communists; but {{he is one of the}} few to have reached the level of detachment needed in order to X-ray, in a cold and precise way, a political system. Does this seem easy to you? I do not know how many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> capable of introspecting with such lucidity our own parents' utopias, phantasms and disappointments". The historian opposes Tismăneanu's approach to that of Petre Roman, Romania-s first post-1989 Premier, whose attempts at discussing the public image of his father, the communist politico Valter Roman, are argued by Cioroianu to have [...] "failed".|$|E
2500|$|On June 26, 1985, King was arrested, {{along with}} his mother and his sister Bernice, while taking part in an anti-apartheid protest at the Embassy of South Africa in Washington, D.C. On January 7, 1986 Martin Luther King III and his sisters were arrested for [...] "disorderly conduct" [...] by {{officers}} deployed to a Winn Dixie supermarket, which had been the subject of some protesting since September of the previous year. On June 9, 1986 he announced his candidacy for the Fulton County Commission, becoming the first of his father's immediate family to become involved in politics. Alongside Kerry Kennedy, King opposed the death penalty in 1989, stating [...] "If we believed in {{an eye for an eye}} and a tooth for a tooth, most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> without eyes and without teeth." [...] In 1990, He apologized to all homosexuals for mentioning that [...] "something may be wrong" [...] with them during a meeting with some middle school students, both meeting with some gay-rights leaders to hear their concerns and referring to his remarks as [...] "uninformed and insensitive".|$|E
