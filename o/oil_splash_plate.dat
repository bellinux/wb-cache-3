40|$|The use of <b>splash</b> <b>plates</b> and dual {{impinging}} liquid jets {{are common}} methods for fuel atomization, but {{the combination of}} these methods has not been explored. The goal of this experiment is to analyze how <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> position and orientation affect the spray geometry for this combined method. The spray patterns are observed for a single jet against a <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> and two orientations of dual impinging jets against a <b>splash</b> <b>plate.</b> For all three cases, the spray patterns are analyzed for various <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> angles between 30 and 60 degrees relative to the jet centerline. For the dual impinging jets, the <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> is tested in multiple positions relative the two jets’ unimpeded impingement point. The characteristics of the spray patterns are then analyzed using high speed video. The most desirable spray characteristics occur when the <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> is at least two jet diameters lower than the unimpeded impingement point and at an angle between 45 and 60 degrees. The spray has a clear spreading angle and minimum back-spray when the sheet formed by the jets is coincidental with the orientation axis for the splash plat...|$|R

40|$|The <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> slurry {{spreader}} is inexpensive and robust {{but it is}} not environmentally friendly. It releases most of the ammonia (NH 3) in slurry, emits strong odours and distributes the remaining nutrients unevenly. The object of this report is to identify improvements to {{slurry spreader}}s that may eliminate these shortcomings. Several gases are released during and after slurry spreading. NH 3 contributes to acidification of the environment and is emitted almost entirely from agriculture. Over 30 % of European NH 3 emissions come from slurry spreading. The Gothenberg agreement (UNECE, 1999) requires a reduction in national NH 3 emission to 8 % below 1990 levels. Emission of this gas from band, TF (trailing foot) and injector slurry spreaders is 40, 40 and 20 % respectively of that from conventional <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> machines. A switch to spreaders with lower emissions would provide sufficient reduction to satisfy the Gothenberg objective. Odour from livestock units gives rise to many complaints but {{there is little evidence that}} it is a health hazard. Emission of the vapours from slurry spreaders is in the order; (<b>splash</b> <b>plate)</b> >(band) > (TF and injector). Other gases (methane and nitrous oxide) are released primarily after injection. Infection of humans by slurry-borne organisms is not common. In general the differences between spreaders in regard to pathogens are not significant but this conclusion may not apply in all cases. Slurry nutrients amount to 40 % of the N and 65 % of the P required in agriculture. Several commercial and experimental methods exist to measure slurry nutrient content. Field application using a <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> and vacuum tanker gives highly variable distribution. Any of the other spreaders reviewed here combined with a fixed displacement pump achieve more uniform application. Accurate spreading reduces the need for excess application so losses to water from soil are reduced. This conforms to the Water Framework Directive. Deep injection and incorporation can reduce loss of P from slurry but other spreading methods will not normally reduce the risk of P loss at spreading time. The proposed tanker consists of a closed tank with running gear fit for road and field conditions. A TF spreader is fitted at the back. The slurry is handled by a fixed displacement pump which fills the tank or empties it through the spreader. The pump must be protected from obstacles so an intake filter or chopper filter should be included. This slurry spreader would reduce emission of NH 3 and odour and increase the recycling of slurry nutrients to crops. It is more expensive than <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> machines but if widely adopted it could be an economical solution to the UNECE requirement to reduce NH 3 emissions. Alternatives to improving spreaders exist. These include digesting slurry, and reducing emissions from livestock housing and slurry storage. With the exception of digestion these offer poor prospects of success especially in relation to odour reduction and exploitation of slurry nutrients.

40|$|Thermal {{energy flow}} within the piston {{of an air}} cooled engine was {{investigated}} by measuring the heat flux in the engine cylinder liner {{in the region of}} travel of the piston rings. Engine sump oil temperature and oil viscosity were varied to change the piston ring heat flow by altering the oil film between the cylinder wall and piston ring. Engine load was varied to change heat flow into the piston. Also, the crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>splash</b> cooling of the piston was varied to change heat flow leaving the piston. When sump oil temperature was reduced, more heat flowed to the cooler sump. Changes in oil viscosity had little effect on the cylinder wall heat flow but increased cylinder wall temperature due to an increase in frictional heating with lower oil viscosity. It was thus determined that this change in heat flow was due to the change in sump oil temperature and was not due to a change in oil film characteristics. A decrease in engine load decreased the average temperature and heat flux in the cylinder wall. The largest decrease in heat flux was on the exhaust side of the engine where the largest fraction of cylinder heat is convected to the external airflow. It was found that the change in heat flux caused by the decrease in engine load was likely due to a change in the piston ring pack heat flow. For changes in the crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>splash</b> cooling of the piston, there were only small changes in average temperature and no changes in the heat flux. Although the piston was still believed to lose heat to the crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>splash,</b> its percentage of piston heat loss was too small to affect piston ring pack heat flow. Superposition was evaluated for sump oil temperature and engine load as well as sump oil temperature and oil viscosity. In both cases, significant error was found with the linear superposition assumption. Linear superposition was assumed not to hold for these complex heat flows...|$|R

40|$|Water spray {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to icing of ships and maritime structures. The small size of the droplets in the water spray causes them to easily cool down and freeze to the different structures. Icing can hamper operations on both ships and other maritime structures due to blockage of equipment and slippery deck areas. Besides, if icing occurs on a small ship it is even possible that the increased mass causes the ship to become top heavy, with risk of capsize. De-icing can be costly, dangerous and often both. A better understanding of the spray water forming process can be used to design new structures for minimal ice forming. Reducing the icing on existing structures is also possible by small modifications or optimizing the sailing routes for ships. This in turn can lead to lower operating costs and down-time. In this research the objective was to validate the model of Aalbers en Poen (2015) for the prediction of spray water, in particular the prediction of the droplet mass median diameter. In this model it is assumed that the process of a wave running up against the bow of a ship is comparable to the penetration of water by a wedge. Such a process generates a jet which in turn is expected to breakup in a similar fashion as a jet from a <b>splash</b> <b>plate</b> nozzle. Aalbers and Poen use wave mechanics to determine the immersion velocity of the ship and the dead rise angle between the water and the ship. This information can be used to predict the jet root thickness and the jet velocity with the model of Faltinsen (2002). Both parameters are used as the input for a modified model of Adams (1997) to predict the droplet mass median diameter. Simmons (1977) proposed a distribution that can depict the droplet-size/volume-fraction independent of the spray mechanism. Therefore Aalbers and Poen assumed that this distribution can be applied to their problem. For the validation and verification process tests, for this thesis, have been conducted in the concept basin of MARIN. In the tests a wave was used to produce run-up against a wall to create spray. The waves used had the maximum height possible in the basin and were just feasible to check the model of Aalbers and Poen as intended. This size is significantly larger than that of e. g the <b>splash</b> <b>plates</b> in the original models but still not at full (ship) scale. The tests were performed to study the breakup process and in particular the size and distribution of the formed droplets. An algorithm was developed to extract this data from high-speed recordings of the event. The observed breakup process was different from the process assumed in the model of Adams. Nevertheless, the observed and predicted values for the droplet mass median diameter and jet velocity agree reasonably well. The distribution of Simmons was shown to be applicable. The test setup could not fully verify the usage of Faltinsen's theory because the jet root thickness could not be quantified. However, the observations showed that the assumption of Aalbers and Poen to use Faltinsens's theory is promising. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
