5|$|After World War II {{work on the}} {{synthesis}} <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. George William Gray, a prominent researcher <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed {{a better understanding of}} how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book Molecular Structure and the Properties <b>of</b> <b>Liquid</b> Crystals became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the University of Cincinnati and later at Kent State University. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world’s top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{dielectric}} constant measurement setup {{has been developed}} to measure {{dielectric constant}} <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> using AT 89 C 55 WD microcontroller.

A dedicated AT 89 C 55 WD (8 -bit) based microcontroller and its associated peripherals are employed for the hardware.

5|$|Anisotropy <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> {{crystals}} is {{a property}} not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> crystals behave more differentially {{than those of}} ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and {{is so strong that}} usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.|$|E
40|$|Gastric {{emptying}} <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> and solids {{was evaluated}} in ten dogs with gastric fistula {{before and after}} either truncal vagotomy, antrectomy, or pyloroplasty. In subsequent operations, the vagotomy group underwent either antrectomy or pyloroplasty, and the antrectomy and pyloroplasty groups were vagotomized. Vagotomy significantly inhibited the emptying <b>of</b> both <b>liquids</b> and solids (p less than 0. 001) when the pyloric antrum was intact. When the antropyloric mechanism was removed by antrectomy, the effect of vagotomy was to accelerate the emptying <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> (p less than 0. 05) but to impair the emptying of solids (p less than 0. 001). When the pylorus was destroyed by pyloroplasty, vagotomy markedly accelerated the emptying <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> but {{had little effect on}} the emptying of solids. Neither antrectomy nor pyloroplasty had any significant effect on the emptying of solids. Pyloroplasty caused minor acceleration <b>of</b> emptying <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> while antrectomy had no effect...|$|R

50|$|The {{expansion}} <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> {{is usually}} measured in a container. When a liquid expands in a vessel, the vessel expands {{along with the}} liquid. Hence the observed increase in volume <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> level is not actual increase in its volume. The expansion <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> relative to the container is called as Apparent Expansion. the actual expansion <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> is called Real (or) Absolute expansion.The ratio of apparent increase in volume <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> per unit rise of temperature to the original volume is called as coefficient of apparent expansion.|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the gaseous and the solid states, the liquid state {{does not have a}} simple model that could be developed into a quantitative theory. A central issue in the understanding <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> is to estimate the energy state <b>of</b> <b>liquids.</b> Here, on the basis of our recent studies on crystal melting, we show that the energy sate <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> may be reasonably approximated by the energy and volume of a vacancy. Consequently, estimation <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> state energy is significantly simplified comparing with previous methods that inevitably invoke many-body interactions. Accordingly, a possible equation for the state for liquids is proposed. On this basis, it seems that a simple model for liquids is in sight...|$|R
