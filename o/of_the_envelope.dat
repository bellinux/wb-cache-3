25|$|In a {{conventional}} lamp, the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses {{on the inner}} surface of the glass envelope, darkening it. For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope.</b> When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> and blackening just that portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope.</b> An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064.

This interference is called auto correlation in a symmetric interferometer (both arms have the same reflectivity), or cross-correlation in the common case.

Photomultipliers are still commonly used wherever low levels of light must be detected.|$|E

25|$|The core grows hotter and denser as it gains {{material}} from fusion of hydrogen {{at the base}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope.</b> In all massive stars, electron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to halt collapse by itself, so as each major element is consumed in the center, progressively heavier elements ignite, temporarily halting collapse.

25|$|The {{halogen lamp}} reduces uneven {{evaporation}} of the filament and eliminates darkening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> by filling the lamp with a halogen gas at low pressure, {{rather than an}} inert gas. The halogen cycle increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten {{from the inside of}} the bulb back onto the filament. The halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space. Fiber-optic lamps for optical microscopy is one typical application.|$|E
