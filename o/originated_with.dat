5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes.

Her books Plant Anatomy and Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts {{for more than half}} a century.|$|E
5|$|Gumbo z'herbes {{may have}} <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> the French, Germans, or West Africans.

The meatless dish also bears striking resemblance to a dish often eaten in Germany on Maundy Thursday. German Catholics, obeying the Lenten rules, often served a stew made of seven different greens on this date.|$|E

The ACLU supported many of the Communists during their appeals (although most of the initiative <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> local ACLU affiliates, not the national headquarters) but most convictions were upheld. The two California affiliates, in particular, felt the national ACLU headquarters was not supporting civil liberties strongly enough, and they initiated more cold war cases than the national headquarters did.|$|E
5|$|The idea of To {{directing}} an English-language film <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> ARP co-founders Michèle and Laurent Pétin, who had Alain Delon in {{mind for}} the lead role. In 2006, after Delon turned down the role, the Pétins recommended Hallyday, who was cast in the lead role after meeting with To in early 2008. Principal photography began in November 2008, and concluded in February 2009; filming took place on locations in Hong Kong and Macau, with a crew mainly based in Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|The show's premise <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> creator Shonda Rhimes, {{who serves}} as an {{executive}} producer, along with Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, and Allan Heinberg.

5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that {{had taken over the}} foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric is said to have done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci {{suggested to}} Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign, a new gold coin equal to one pound {{that was to}} be struck, would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, gold coins were struck for circulation, rather than as bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume {{on the history of the}} sovereign coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, and that the idea might not even have come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time and that the story <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> Pistrucci, whom he deemed an unreliable witness on his own past.|$|E

5|$|An {{account of}} the war by the Byzantine Theophylact Simocatta sentimentalises the reasons behind the conflict, {{claiming}} it <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> Alboin's vain courting and subsequent kidnapping of Cunimund's daughter Rosamund, that Alboin proceeded then to marry. The tale is treated with scepticism by Walter Goffart, who observes that it conflicts with the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, where she was captured only {{after the death of}} her father. The Gepids obtained the support of the Emperor in exchange for a promise to cede him the region of Sirmium, the seat of the Gepid kings. Thus in 565 or 566 Justinian's successor Justin II sent his son-in-law Baduarius as magister militum (field commander) to lead a Byzantine army against Alboin in support of Cunimund, ending in the Lombards' complete defeat.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E
5|$|Charley <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> a large {{swirl of}} clouds which parted {{off of the}} west coast of Africa on August 9. Lacking deep {{convection}} or a well defined center, the wave continued west-northwestward without developing. Ten days later, on August 19, satellite images indicated the disturbance was beginning to rotate cyclonically over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. A reconnaissance aircraft flew into the system the next day. While strong winds were recorded, no circulation center was present. The following morning, a second flight reported that a center had formed, and the disturbance was designated a tropical depression. Initially, the center was disorganized. However, convection over the depression blossomed, mostly concentrated over the northern semicircle. During the evening of August 21, the system was named Tropical Storm Charley.|$|E

5|$|Development of Burning Rangers started around November 1996, {{after the}} release of Sonic Team's {{previous}} game Christmas Nights (a Christmas-themed demo for Nights into Dreams...). The concept <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> the idea of rescuing people as opposed to killing them, which was an element that producer Yuji Naka felt was too common in contemporary video games. The development team of 31 (out of Sonic Team's staff of about 50) was directed by Naoto Ohshima, the director and lead designer Takao Miyoshi. The rest of the team consisted of three game planners, six programmers, eighteen designers, and two sound producers, most of whom had worked on Nights into Dreams....|$|E
5|$|Grey's Anatomy is an American {{television}} medical {{drama that}} debuted on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal on March 27, 2005. While creating the show, producers put {{an emphasis on}} the casting process. The series has aired for thirteen seasons, and focuses on the fictional lives of surgical interns and residents, as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, while trying to maintain personal lives. The show's premise <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> Shonda Rhimes, who serves as an executive producer, along with Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, and Allan Heinberg. It is primarily filmed in Los Angeles, California.|$|E
5|$|Hindu natal astrology <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> Hellenistic astrology by the 3rd century BCE, though {{incorporating}} the Hindu lunar mansions. The {{names of the}} signs (e.g. Greek 'Krios' for Aries, Hindi 'Kriya'), the planets (e.g. Greek 'Helios' for Sun, astrological Hindi 'Heli'), and astrological terms (e.g. Greek 'apoklima' and 'sunaphe' for declination and planetary conjunction, Hindi 'apoklima' and 'sunapha' respectively) in Varaha Mihira's texts are considered conclusive evidence of a Greek origin for Hindu astrology. The Indian techniques {{may also have been}} augmented with some of the Babylonian techniques.|$|E

5|$|House (also called House, M.D.) is an American {{television}} medical {{drama that}} originally {{ran on the}} Fox network for eight seasons, from November 16, 2004 to May 21, 2012. The series' main character is Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an unconventional, misanthropic medical genius who, despite his dependence on pain medication, leads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton–Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The series' premise <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> Paul Attanasio, while David Shore, who is credited as creator, was primarily responsible for the conception of the title character. The series' executive producers included Shore, Attanasio, Attanasio's business partner Katie Jacobs, and film director Bryan Singer. It was filmed largely in Century City.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Pink Floyd {{bought a}} three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began {{converting}} the building into {{a recording studio}} and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing {{an image of the}} ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.|$|E
5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial <b>originated</b> <b>with</b> the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something {{to be looked at}} and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial should be on the road in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.|$|E
