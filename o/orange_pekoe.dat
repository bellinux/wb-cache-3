500|$|Black tea: The {{tea leaves}} {{are allowed to}} {{completely}} oxidize. Black tea is first withered to induce protein breakdown and reduce water content (68-77% of original). The leaves then undergo a process known in the industry as [...] "disruption" [...] or [...] "leaf maceration", which through bruising or cutting disrupts leaf cell structures, releasing the leaf juices and enzymes that activate oxidation. The oxidation process takes between 45–90 minutes to 3 hours and is done at high humidity between 20-30 degrees Celsius, transforming much of the catechins of the leaves into complex tannin. Orthodox processed black teas are further graded according to the post-production leaf quality by the <b>Orange</b> <b>Pekoe</b> system, while crush, tear, curl (CTC) teas use a different grading system. Orthodox tea leaves are heavily rolled either by hand or mechanically on a cylindrical rolling table or a rotorvane. The rolling table consists of a ridged table-top moving in an eccentric manner to a large hopper of tea leaves, of which the leaves are pressed down onto the table-top. The process produces a mixture of whole and broken leaves, and particles which are then sorted, oxidized, and dried. The rotovane consisted of an auger pushing withered tea leaves through a vane cylinder [...] which crushes and evenly cuts the leaves. Crush, tear, curl is a production method developed by William McKercher in 1930 which uses machines with contra-rotating rotors with surfaces patterning that cut and tear the leaves producing a product popular for use in tea bags. The rotovane to often use to precut the withered tea prior to the CTC and to create broken orthodox processed black tea.|$|E

50|$|From {{a musical}} family, classically trained in {{childhood}} as a violinist and vocalist, he organised his London singing lessons {{to coincide with}} attending rock and R&B gigs at the Marquee Club. He began playing career in 1971 with Jug-Folk band Totem. He joined Decameron in 1973 following the release of their debut album 'Say Hello to the Band', initially as bassist, vocalist and fiddle player but later as a guitarist. On Decameron's demise in 1976 he opened the Millstream Recording Studio in Cheltenham. He joined <b>Pekoe</b> <b>Orange</b> in 1978 but shortly after that auditioned for Steve Hackett's new touring band, which he subsequently joined, recording the studio albums Spectral Mornings and Defector. Millstream Recording Studio was the first customer for an SL 4000 A Series Solid State Logic console (serial number 4KA010). In 1980 Cadbury and Decameron lyricist Dave Bell formed the jingle company Orijingles and a retro pub band The Teenage Idols to showcase their songwriting talents, and in 1983 teamed up with former Manfred Mann singer Mike d'Abo to form society party band Mike d'Abo's Mighty Quintet, still performing today. Also joined international party band Top Catz as guitarist and MD. Following Millstream’s closure in 1989, he branched out into voiceover work, photographic modelling and acting, dying in an episode of the BBC's Dalziel and Pascoe. He continues to write with Pete Hicks and Dave Bell {{as well as in}} his own right, occasionally performing solo. He has recorded and performed with numerous artists, including The Manfreds, Steve Ashley, Marcus Foster, The Dave Harper Band and many others.|$|R
60|$|Father did a {{very brave}} thing, though he {{probably}} will never get the Carnegie medal for it. Instead of timidly asking the lofty waitress's advice, he boldly plunged in and ordered two kinds of sandwiches, cinnamon toast, and, because he liked the name, <b>orange</b> <b>pekoe.</b> He rather held his breath, but apparently the waitress took him quite seriously, and {{some time in the}} course of the afternoon actually brought him what he had asked for.|$|E
60|$|Her great {{lesson was}} {{the art of}} taking tea. He found, surprisedly, that they weren't really going to endanger their clothes by rolling on park grass. Instead, she {{led him to a}} tea-room behind a candy-shop on Tottenham Court Road, a low room with white wicker chairs, colored tiles set in the wall, and green Sedji-ware jugs with {{irregular}} bunches of white roses. A waitress with wild-rose cheeks and a busy step brought <b>Orange</b> <b>Pekoe</b> and lemon for her, Ceylon and Russian Caravan tea and a jug of clotted cream for him, with a pile of cinnamon buns.|$|E
60|$|And, sure enough, {{about the}} hour of noon on the {{following}} day, Jimson might have been observed ascending the river-side road that goes from Padwick to Great Haverham, carrying in one hand a basket of provisions, and under the other arm a leather case containing (it is to be conjectured) the score of <b>Orange</b> <b>Pekoe.</b> It was October weather; the stone-grey sky was full of larks, the leaden mirror of the Thames brightened with autumnal foliage, and the fallen leaves of the chestnuts chirped under the composer's footing. There is no {{time of the year}} in England more courageous; and Jimson, though he was not without his troubles, whistled as he went.|$|E
6000|$|Margaret Carter was continuing: [...] "I don't {{mind the}} bad taste a bit, but I was hungry after {{motoring}} all day, almost, and I did want a decent tea. If {{you could see}} that horrid Victorian drawing-room at Miss Severance's you could stand even sticky kitties--in a picture. I don't care about the interior decoration as long as Marky's little interior gets decorated decently. But this tea is simply terrible. <b>Orange</b> <b>pekoe!</b> Why, even Miss Severance's horrid Ceylon is better than this, and she does give you cream, instead of this milk of magnesia or soapy water or whatever the beastly stuff is. And to have to drink it out of these horrid thick cups--like toothbrush mugs. I'm sure I'll find a chewed-up old toothbrush when I get to the bottom." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was used}} to New York restaurants, and to quite {{expensive}} hotels, for {{at least once a}} year, on his birthday, Mr. Pilkings took him to lunch at the Waldorf. While he had apparently been devoting himself to arranging the tables his cunning old brain had determined to order tea and French pastry. Apparently the Tea Shoppe was neutral. There was no French pastry on the bill, but, instead, such curious edibles as cinnamon toast, cream cheese, walnut sandwiches, Martha Washington muffins. Nor was the tea problem so easy as it had seemed. To Father there were only two kinds of tea--the kind you got for a nickel at the Automat, and the kind that Mother privately consumed. But here he had to choose intelligently among <b>orange</b> <b>pekoe,</b> oolong, Ceylon, and English-breakfast teas.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was one of}} {{this same}} new and [...] "fittest" [...] species who had already {{relieved}} poor Mr. McAlery Willett of his fortune. Mr. Willett was a trusting soul who had never known {{how to take care}} of himself or his money, people said, and now that he had lost it they blamed him. Some had been saved enough for him and Nancy to live on in the old house, with careful economy. It was Nancy who managed the economy, who accomplished remarkable things with a sum they would have deemed poverty in former days. Her mother had died while I was at Cambridge. Reverses did not subdue Mr. Willett's spirits, and the fascination modern [...] "business" [...] had for him seemed to grow in proportion to the misfortunes it had caused him. He moved into a tiny office in the Durrett Building, where he appeared every morning about half-past ten to occupy himself with heaven knows what short cuts to wealth, with prospectuses of companies in Mexico or Central America or some other distant place: once, I remember, it was a tea, company in which he tried to interest his friends, to raise in the South a product he maintained would surpass <b>Orange</b> <b>Pekoe.</b> In the afternoon between three and four he would turn up at the Boyne Club, as well groomed, as spruce as ever, generally with a flower in his buttonhole. He never forgot that he was a gentleman, and he had a gentleman's notions of the fitness of things, and it was against his principles to use, a gentleman's club for the furtherance of his various enterprises.|$|E
6000|$|Between the {{possibility}} of being hanged in all innocence, and the certainty of a public and merited disgrace, no gentleman of spirit could long hesitate. After three gulps of that hot, snuffy, and muddy beverage, that passes on the streets of London for a decoction of the coffee berry, Gideon's mind was made up. He would do without the police. He must face {{the other side of the}} dilemma, and be Robert Skill in earnest. What would Robert Skill have done? How does a gentleman dispose of a dead body, honestly come by? He remembered the inimitable story of the hunchback; reviewed its course, and dismissed it for a worthless guide. It was impossible to prop a corpse on the corner of Tottenham Court Road without arousing fatal curiosity in the bosoms of the passers-by; as for lowering it down a London chimney, the physical obstacles were insurmountable. To get it on board a train and drop it out, or on the top of an omnibus and drop it off, were equally out of the question. To get it on a yacht and drop it overboard, was more conceivable; but for a man of moderate means it seemed extravagant. The hire of the yacht was in itself a consideration; the subsequent support of the whole crew (which seemed a necessary consequence) was simply not to be thought of. His uncle and the houseboat here occurred in very luminous colours to his mind. A musical composer (say, of the name of Jimson) might very well suffer, like Hogarth's musician before him, from the disturbances of London. He might very well be pressed for time to finish an opera--say the comic opera Orange Pekoe--Orange Pekoe, music by Jimson--"this young maëstro, one of the most promising of our recent English school"--vigorous entrance of the drums, etc.--the whole character of Jimson and his music arose in bulk before the mind of Gideon. What more likely than Jimson's arrival with a grand piano (say, at Padwick), and his residence in a houseboat alone with the unfinished score of <b>Orange</b> <b>Pekoe?</b> His subsequent disappearance, leaving nothing behind but an empty piano case, it might be more difficult to account for. And yet even that was susceptible of explanation. For, suppose Jimson had gone mad over a fugal passage, and had thereupon destroyed the accomplice of his infamy, and plunged into the welcome river? What end, on the whole, more probable for a modern musician? ...|$|E
