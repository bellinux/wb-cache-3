Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, z, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for {{life as we know it}}, because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.|$|E

5|$|Palaeobotanists study ancient {{plants in}} the fossil record to provide {{information}} about the evolutionary history of plants. Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>are</b> thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede is the Solar System's largest {{moon and}} the Solar System's only known moon with a magnetosphere, {{but this does not}} shield it from cosmic {{radiation}} to a noteworthy degree, because it is overshadowed by Jupiter's magnetic field. Ganymede receives about 0.08Sv (8rem) of radiation per day. Callisto is farther from Jupiter's strong radiation belt and subject to only 0.0001Sv (0.01rem) a day. For comparison, the average amount of radiation taken on Earth by a living organism is about 0.0024Sv per year; the highest natural radiation levels <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> recorded around Ramsar hot springs at about 0.26Sv per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{time frame}} of the Solar System's {{formation}} has been determined using radiometric dating. Scientists estimate that the Solar System is 4.6billion years old. The oldest known mineral grains <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> approximately 4.4billion years old. Rocks this old are rare, as Earth's surface is constantly being reshaped by erosion, volcanism, and plate tectonics. To estimate {{the age of the}} Solar System, scientists use meteorites, which were formed during the early condensation of the solar nebula. Almost all meteorites (see the Canyon Diablo meteorite) are found to have an age of 4.6billion years, suggesting that the Solar System must be at least this old.|$|E
5|$|A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature (or {{physical}} feature), a body {{of liquid}} {{on the surface of}} a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, {{a body of}} water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.|$|E

5|$|Extinction is the {{disappearance}} of an entire species. Extinction is not an unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction. Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> now extinct, and extinction {{appears to be the}} ultimate fate of all species. These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life, although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events. The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, during which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct, is the most well-known, but the earlier Permian–Triassic extinction event was even more severe, with approximately 96% of all marine species driven to extinction. The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day extinction rates are 100–1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century. Human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event; global warming may further accelerate it in the future.|$|E
5|$|The United States Forest Service made {{it their}} highest {{priority}} {{fire at the}} time because of the threat to local communities and its proximity to Yosemite National Park. Though Giant Sequoia trees, {{some of the biggest}} and oldest living things <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>are</b> very fire-tolerant and need fire to reproduce, concerns rose as the fire approached them. Park officials set sprinklers to help protect nearby Sequoia trees, but the sprinklers were later removed and careful low-intensity prescribed burns were used. Parts of the National Forest are used for grazing, and the blaze impacted 6 of 14 grazing allotments located within the fire perimeter where displaced cattle were scattered over a wide area. Smoke from the fire caused unhealthy air conditions in Reno, Nevada, and the Lake Tahoe area {{during the first week of}} the fire, forcing the cancellation of several outdoor events. School children were sent home due to smoky conditions as well. From Yosemite to the San Joaquin Valley, air quality reached unhealthy levels several times according to the National Weather Service. Berkeley Tuolumne Camp, a family camp operated by the city of Berkeley, established in 1922, was burned to the ground. Nearby Camp Tawonga suffered some damage, including the loss of three buildings. Camp Mather, operated by the city of San Francisco, suffered minor damage, as did the San Jose Camp run by the city of San Jose.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history {{of life on}} Earth traces the processes by which living and fossil organisms evolved since life appeared on the planet, until the present. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years (Ga) ago and {{there is evidence that}} life appeared as early as 4.1 Ga. The similarities among all present-day organisms indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all known species have diverged through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.9 million are estimated to have been named and 1.6 million documented in a central database to date. More recently, in May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the first}} billion years of Earth's history, life {{appeared}} in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In {{the history of the}} Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. Over 99% of all species that ever lived <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>are</b> extinct. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described. Over 7.4 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, the world has about 200 sovereign states.|$|E
