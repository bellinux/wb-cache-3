Her mother attempted to subdue these, which would have been viewed as unseemly in a woman; according to Lucy Aikin's memoir, what resulted was [...] "a double portion of bashfulness and maidenly reserve" [...] in Barbauld's character. Barbauld was never quite comfortable with her identity as a woman and always believed that she {{failed to live up to}} the ideal of womanhood; much of her writing would center around issues central to women and her [...] "outsider" [...] perspective allowed her to question many of the traditional assumptions about femininity during the eighteenth century.|$|E

[...] On 5 September 1847 he left Paris to join {{her for the first time}} in Wierzchownia. They spent several happy months together, but financial obligations required his presence in France. The Revolution of 1848 began one week after his return. Back in Wierzchownia, Hańska lost 80,000 francs due to a granary fire, and her time was consumed with three lawsuits. These complications, and Balzac's constant debt, meant that their finances were unstable, and she hesitated anew at the idea of marriage. In any case, a wedding would be impossible without approval from the Tsar, which he did not grant until spring of 1850. On 2 July 1849 Russian authorities responding to Balzac's request in December 1847 to marry Hańska stated that he could do so, but that Hańska could not keep her land.|$|E
