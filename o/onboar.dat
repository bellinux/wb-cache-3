40|$|A new {{methodology}} for testing high frequency analog/RF cores in a mixed-signal System-on-Chip (SoC) environment using an embedded tester core is presented. The proposed test method provides {{a solution to}} the problem of bandwidth limitation associated with I/O transmission paths and eliminates the need for an advanced ex-ternal Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) to interact with the embedded tester. The design of the tester is based primarily on a digital level solution, except for a Track and Hold (T/H) circuit and a few CMOS switches, so as to offer the scalability ad-vantages of a soft core description. In the proposed test method, low frequency waveforms are generated by an exter-nal Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) and then upconverted from low to high frequency through an on-chip modulator to excite fast analog circuits. The high fre-quency response waveforms on the other hand, are down converted from high to low frequency via subsampling techniques and then sent to an external controller for test result evaluation. In this method all high speed operations are performed <b>onboar...</b>|$|E
40|$|In last years, the European Union, Member States and the {{automotive}} industry have concentrated their efforts on improving road safety [1][2]. Avoiding accidents due to human errors {{is one of the}} main objectives of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). European traffic accidents figures show a very large number of collisions between pedestrians and vehicles. Every year, more than 200, 000 pedestrians are injured, with over 6, 000 killed. In spite of the incredibly high number of victims, the protection of pedestrians has received little attention by the research community [3]. The projects that have dealt with this problem are quite recent, as has been pointed out at the Fifth Framework Programme [1]. The algorithm proposed in this paper, relies on the information provided by computer vision for the development of a pedestrian protection system [4]. The use of visual information is a promising approach to cope with the different appearances of pedestrians and changes of illumination in a cluttered environment. Although other sensors as lasers or radars can detect pedestrians, vision is the unique that can comprehend their motion and predict their movements. An active contour model is used to segment pedestrians from images taken by an <b>onboar...</b>|$|E
40|$|Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC) and Alliant Techsystems (ATK) {{conducted}} a firing test of five 120 mm Mortar Munition projectiles that were instrumented with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) diagnostics fuze. The DFuze {{is equipped with}} onboard magnetometers, accelerometers, rate sensors, and yawsondes which are onboard the projectile {{for the purpose of}} collecting angular motion and acceleration data. From the telemetered sensor data, ARDEC and ATK were able to quantify and update the projectile aerodynamics via the ARDEC Aeroballistics Divisionâ€™s six degree of freedom simulation, TELA. Since TELA has embedded subroutines that model yawsondes, accelerometers, rate sensors and magnetometers, an accurate and robust match of the sensor data can be accomplished. In addition, biases and scale factors can be extracted {{in order to determine the}} effects of the gun launch on the sensors. These biases and scale factors can then be introduced into the projectile guidance and navigation systems for modeling the errors from the sensors. In the trajectory reconstruction effort, meteorological data such as wind magnitude, wind direction, atmospheric pressure and temperature as a function of altitude, wind tunnel aerodynamics, projectile mass properties, gun launch initial conditions, firing test data and test time, sun azimuth and elevation and the gun longitude and latitude were all incorporated into the six degree of freedom simulation to insure that the match would simulate the most accurate conditions at the time of the test firings.
