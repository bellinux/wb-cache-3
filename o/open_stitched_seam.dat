40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The major {{purposes}} of the research were {{to determine whether there}} were significant differences in breaking strength and elongation of the following types of seams in a polyester double-knit fabric: 1. <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with threads of (a) mercerized cotton, (b) core-spun polyester/cotton, and (c) bonded nylon monocord. 2. <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with (a) a narrow zigzag stitch, (b) a lockstitch made while stretching the fabric, and (c) an elastic straight <b>stitch.</b> 3. <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> (a) parallel to the wales and (b) parallel to the courses. 4. <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with settings of (a) 9 stitches per inch, (b) 12 stitches per inch, and (c) 15 stitches per inch. Results indicated that the polyester/cotton core-spun thread produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than mercerized cotton thread for all comparable sets of specimens. Seams constructed with polyester/cotton core-spun thread also tended to exhibit greater seam breaking strength and elongation than those seamed with bonded nylon monocord thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible seams than did mercerized cotton thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than either of the other <b>stitch</b> types. Most <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean seam breaking strength and elongation than comparable <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with the zigzag stitch, <b>Stitch</b> length affected <b>seam</b> breaking strength and elongation to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch. For most comparable sets of zigzag specimens, increases in the number of stitches per inch were accompanied by increases in seam breaking strength and elongation. With the lockstitch, those differences which were significant indicated that the shorter stitches were related to greater breaking strength and elongation. Seams parallel to the courses were related to greater seam breaking strength and elongation than seams parallel to the wales...|$|R

40|$|Mining Couture' {{emerges from}} Barber Swindells' (Claire Barber and Steve Swindells collaboration) {{commission}} at the Leicester County Council Snibston Discovery Museum, UK, {{as part of}} the Transform regeneration programme. Throughout the commission Barber Swindells worked across the Snibston site where links to other collections were established including those at the National Coalmining Museum in Wakefield. By juxtaposing the fabrics and material processes of coal-mining and fashion, and their respective site-specific and non-site specific natures, the project reveals the rich collisions between contrary worlds. This is further explored by situating functionally ambiguous and ephemeral artefacts within the hard and utilitarian landscape of industrial production. The arrangement, moreover, provided the context for reframing metaphorical relationships between coal-mining and fashion; between the macro-scale of the geological seam, managed and exploited for its material resources (through engineering operations) and the micro-scale of the <b>stitched</b> <b>seam,</b> whose tightness, looseness, slackness (or frayed condition) affords varied natures of the fashioned garment.

40|$|Based on the {{principle}} that a body to be obtained by sewing the material to provide resistance and the like in the stitching assembly, the experimental study of which developed resistance is compared with the resistance materials to effectively assembled by the assembly line. The experimental values resistance for assemblies were obtained in the testing for resistance to sliding stitch ASTM D 434 using Tinius Olsen HK 5 T test type machine. The assembly strength was determined for warp knitted fabric and satin charmeuse, made of poly-filamentary wires and mono-filament polyester and polyamide. Resistance assembling {{is one of the major}} determinants of the quality of the stitching. It is defined as "the tensile strength or friction. " Tenacity <b>stitching</b> <b>seam</b> rupture is the force recorded at its weakest point. Seam abrasion resistance is the number of cycles required friction mesh destruction of seam. It can be said that the strength of the used assembly, the seam 301 is achieved by, in most of the cases, lower resistance knitted studied. In these cases, the primary findings presented, it is clear that the assembly is not appropriate in terms of reliability and maintainability of the product. Such a situation requires a first step to change the type (class) of stitch used. Another way to remedy the deficiencies could be using a sewing thread with a lower finesse or strength in grain, especially in the upper loop of wire used in the study-specific. ...|$|R
