40|$|Contour-parallel {{tool paths}} for {{machining}} milling features are formed by linking the offsets. Determination of links between offsets and the sequence {{in which the}} offsets should be traversed is a major problem. Results of efforts to link tool paths from academic researchers and developers of commercial computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems have shortcomings which include {{the fact that the}} linking strategies (a) are not based on clear geometric principles, (b) are not optimal, (c) do not consider technological factors such as the amount of slotting, <b>overmilling,</b> mode of cutting, and (d) are either not gouge-free or use tool retractions to avoid gouging. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper presents a linking algorithm which employs segments on the Voronoi diagram as links. The technological factors, hitherto ignored in previous research are considered and their optimality is ensured by employing guidelines which were mostly developed through observations of tool paths generated from a general test bed. Multiple solutions obtained after pruning out unfeasible solutions can be evaluated by users using geometrical (total tool path length) and technological (amount of <b>overmilling,</b> slotting, etc.) considerations or a combination of the criteria. The implementation of the algorithm is tested by generating tool paths for two two-and-a-half-dimensional (21 / 2 D) milled features. When compared with those obtained from some commercial CAM systems, they are shorter by 5 to 31 per cent...|$|E
