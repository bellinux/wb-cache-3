5|$|Alexander Wynne, {{author of}} The Origin of Buddhist Meditation, observes that formless {{meditation}} and elemental meditation might have {{originated in the}} Upanishadic tradition. The earliest reference to meditation is in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, {{one of the oldest}} Upanishads. Chandogya Upanishad describes the five kinds of vital energies (prana). Concepts used later in many yoga traditions such as internal sound and veins (nadis) are also described in the Upanishad. Taittiriya Upanishad defines yoga as the mastery <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> senses.|$|E

25|$|A neuroscientific {{explanation}} {{claims that}} intruder hallucinations arise {{due to a}} functional disturbance in the multisensory processing <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> self at the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). During sleep paralysis there is a desynchrony between motor-execution and feedback from limbs (proprioception) which results in massive deafferentation (conflicting efferent and afferent neural conduction).|$|E
25|$|The Hindu {{tradition}} of Brahmacharya places great emphasis on abstinence {{as a way}} of harnessing the energy <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> mind towards the goal of spiritual realization. In males, the semen (Vīrya) is considered sacred, and its preservation (except when used for procreation) and conversion into higher life-energy (Ojas) is considered essential for the development of enhanced intellectual and spiritual capacities.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic Church understands {{human beings}} to consist <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> mind, the {{physical}} and the non-physical (or soul perhaps), and that the two are inextricably linked. Humans are capable of discerning the difference {{between good and evil}} because they have a conscience. There are many manifestations of the good that we can pursue. Some, like procreation, are common to other animals, while others, like the pursuit of truth, are inclinations peculiar to the capacities of human beings.|$|E
25|$|Higher Mind is {{the realm}} of Truth-thought. It can hold {{a wide range of}} {{knowledge}} in one vision and an integral whole. It receives illumination from the Illumined Mind, and is not dependent on the limited knowledge of the senses. It is also capable of transforming the lower realms <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> mind, effectuating change sof habit and life.

Besides drawing on the insights of post-freudians, such as D.W.

25|$|The Orthodox Church {{believes}} {{death and}} the separation <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> soul to be unnatural—a result of the Fall of Man. They also hold that the congregation of the Church comprises both {{the living and the}} dead. All persons currently in heaven are considered to be saints, whether their names are known or not. There are, however, those saints of distinction whom God has revealed as particularly good examples. When a saint is revealed and ultimately recognized by {{a large portion of the}} Church a service of official recognition (glorification) is celebrated.|$|E
25|$|Humankind, {{according}} to Upadhyaya, had four hierarchically organized attributes of body, mind, intellect and soul which corresponded to four universal objectives, kama (desire or satisfaction), artha (wealth), dharma (moral duties) and moksha (total liberation or 'salvation'). While none could be ignored, dharma is the 'basic', and moksha the 'ultimate' objective of humankind and society.

25|$|Gender-specific theory {{developed}} in the Malleus Maleficarum laid the foundations for widespread consensus in early modern Germany on the evil nature of women as witches.

It was perceived as intuitive and all-accepted so that very few authors saw the need to explain why women are witches. Those who did, attributed female witchery to the weakness <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> mind (the old medieval explanation) and a few to female sexuality.|$|E
