30|$|Identification fails if some <b>other</b> <b>factor,</b> <b>that</b> {{we are not}} considering, {{determines the}} level of attitudes and the {{differences}} in income and amenities in the region.

The idea is that, if our estimation {{of the effect of}} attitudes on income and amenities is the result of some <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> produces lower income, we should estimate similar effects on this placebo group. We find that attitudes towards immigrants are of importance for the refugees, but they have no effect on the quality of life or income of immigrants from developed countries.|$|R

5|$|The {{electron}} transport pathways {{produced by}} these alternative NADH and ubiquinone oxidases have lower ATP yields than the full pathway. The advantages {{produced by a}} shortened pathway are not entirely clear. However, the alternative oxidase is produced in response to stresses such as cold, reactive oxygen species, and infection by pathogens, as well as <b>other</b> <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> inhibit the full electron transport chain. Alternative pathways might, therefore, enhance an organisms' resistance to injury, by reducing oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|A riot {{occurred}} on 4 June 1968, precipitated by the serving of allegedly contaminated food to prisoners the previous evening. <b>Other</b> <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> contributed were the rudimentary and deplorable state of sanitation and personal cleanliness facilities, tougher sentencing introduced with the Parole Act of 1964, and the overcrowding. When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing {{to go back}} to work, they assembled themselves in the exercise yards. The prison superintendent Mr Thorpe negotiated with two deputations of prisoners. As well as better food, they demanded single cells and the dismissal of specific wardens.|$|E
5|$|In 1510, a Portuguese fleet under Afonso de Albuquerque, sent by King Manuel I of Portugal, wrested {{the region}} of Goa from Sultan Yusuf Adil Shah of Bijapur. In 1534, the Diocese of Goa was established. Soon missionaries were sent to Goa, which led to {{conversion}} of a sizeable population to Roman Catholicism. The bulk of Christian settlers came in three major migration waves towards South Canara. These migrations occurred in periods of great unrest: the Goa Inquisition occurred from 1560 onwards; the Portuguese–Adil Shahi wars were between 1570–79; and the Portuguese–Maratha wars occurred between 1667–83 and 1737–40. <b>Other</b> <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> led to mass migrations were disease epidemics, famines, natural calamities, overpopulation, poor living conditions, heavy tax burdens, and social discrimination by the Portuguese.|$|E

5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> {{broaden the}} main {{sequence}} band on the HR diagram include {{uncertainty in the}} distance to stars {{and the presence of}} unresolved binary stars that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy main sequence because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity. Variations in chemical composition caused by the initial abundances, the star's evolutionary status, interaction with a close companion, rapid rotation, or a magnetic field can all slightly change a main-sequence star's HR diagram position, {{to name just a few}} factors. As an example, there are metal-poor stars (with a very low abundance of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium) that lie just below the main sequence and are known as subdwarfs. These stars are fusing hydrogen in their cores and so they mark the lower edge of main sequence fuzziness caused by variance in chemical composition.|$|E

5|$|The voyage {{from the}} United Kingdom took {{approximately}} {{three weeks and}} on 7 November 1942 Awatea arrived at its assigned station off the coast near the harbour of Algiers. At 10:15pm No. 6 Commando took to their landing craft. The launch did not go smoothly. From the outset they were hampered by the inexperience of the crews lowering the landing craft {{into the water and}} this, along with <b>other</b> <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> arose later including poor weather, breakdowns and navigational errors meant that the majority of No. 6 Commando's landing craft missed the rendezvous with the motor launch that was to guide them to the landing beaches. As a result, many landed at the wrong spot and the schedule was ruined. In the end the first landings took place at 3:00am on 8 November, two hours later than planned, while the last wave came ashore in broad daylight at 6:30am.|$|E
5|$|All bovids mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. <b>Other</b> <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E
