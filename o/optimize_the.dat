5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek to <b>optimize</b> <b>the</b> {{capture of}} solar energy {{in order to}} <b>optimize</b> <b>the</b> productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E

30|$|Shape {{quality was}} {{improved}} by <b>optimizing</b> <b>the</b> emulsion flux {{of the process}} cooling and multi-zone cooling [62]. The steel-sticking phenomenon caused by the bad shape of the strip head was avoided by <b>optimizing</b> <b>the</b> roll-bending force [63]. Shape control difficulty was reduced by <b>optimizing</b> <b>the</b> strip elongation rate of the temper mill [64]. The shape quality, mechanical properties, and surface roughness of a strip rolled by a cold rolling mill were guaranteed by <b>optimizing</b> <b>the</b> rolling force and tension [65]. Comprehensive improvement of strip shape and surface quality could also be realized by <b>optimizing</b> <b>the</b> rolling force, strip elongation rate, and tension [66]. Under the premise of ensuring good strip shape, the flux, concentration, and temperature of <b>the</b> emulsion were <b>optimized</b> to prevent slipping and thermal scratching between the strip and rolls [67]. As a result, the cleaning degree of the strip surface is improved, and the emulsion consumption is reduced.|$|R

One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to <b>optimize</b> <b>the</b> power range of the engine.|$|E
