5|$|The American Red Cross ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> while {{responding}} {{to the effects of}} Juan and the mid-Atlantic flooding, following the previous responses to hurricanes Elena and Gloria, as well as flooding in Puerto Rico; this prompted an emergency fundraising appeal. The agency had provided about $8million worth of assistance to families in southern Louisiana. Along the Apalachicola Bay, the series of hurricane strikes severely damaged the local oyster industry, leaving hundreds of oystermen out of work. The high waves caused by Juan prompted the United States Minerals Management Service to recommend increased inspections on older rigs and improve evacuation plans. Hurricane Juan was one in a series of hurricanes that struck Louisiana coast over many years that contributed to the loss of the coastal wetlands.|$|E

5|$|The first ship of the class, Reşadiye, {{was ordered}} on 8 June 1911. Work stopped in 1912 {{following}} {{the start of}} the First Balkan War due to the probability that the Ottoman government would run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b> Work resumed in May 1913 following the conclusion of the conflict. The second ship, Fatih Sultan Mehmed, was ordered on 29 April 1914 in response to the Greek order for Vasilefs Konstantinos in early 1914.

Any non-government private expenses or debts would not necessarily have become public. In a letter to Liliuokalani in June, the King stated they were already in danger of running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to complete the trip, and that money was owed to Italy {{for the education of}} the young men who had been entrusted to Moreno. The many awards and decorations he bestowed during the trip cost the kingdom more money.|$|E
5|$|Barkley gets {{a police}} permit to raid the Buyers Club, but {{can do nothing}} but give Woodroof a fine. In 1987, the FDA changes its {{regulations}} such that any unapproved drug is also illegal. As the Club runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds,</b> Rayon, who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon died after being taken to the hospital. Dr. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she is linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug to be ineffective against HIV. She refuses to comply and insists {{that she would have}} to be fired.|$|E

5|$|Argentine Sergio Rinland {{designed}} the team's final cars around Judd engines, except for 1991 when Yamaha powered the cars. In the 1992 season the cars (which were updated {{versions of the}} 1991 car) rarely qualified for races. Hill gave the team its final finish, at the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he crossed the finish line 11th and last, four laps behind the winner, Ayrton Senna. After {{the end of that}} race the team ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> and collapsed. Middlebridge Group Limited had been unable to continue making repayments against the £6million ultimately provided by Landhurst Leasing, which went into administration. The Serious Fraud Office investigated the case. Landhurst's managing directors were found guilty of corruption and imprisoned, having accepted bribes for further loans to Middlebridge. It was one of four teams to leave Formula One that year. (cf March Engineering, Fondmetal and Andrea Moda Formula). Although there was talk of reviving the team for the following year, its assets passed to Landhurst Leasing and were auctioned by the company's receivers in 1993. Among these was the team's old factory in Chessington, which was acquired by Yamaha Motor Sports and used to house Activa Technology Limited, a company manufacturing composite components for race and road cars run by Herbie Blash. The factory was bought by the Carlin DPR GP2 motor racing team in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Filming was {{suspended}} several times as Welles ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> {{and left for}} acting jobs, accounted in detail in MacLiammóir's published memoir Put Money in Thy Purse. The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a drop-out of sound at every quiet moment. Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith, restored Othello in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing Angelo Francesco Lavagnino's original musical score, which was originally inaudible, and adding ambient stereo sound effects, which {{were not in the}} original film. The restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America.|$|E
25|$|Foote {{was destined}} for the law, but {{certainly}} not by nature. In his chambers at the Inner Temple, and in the Grecian Coffee House nearby, he came to know something of lawyers if not of law, and was afterwards able to jest at the jargon and to mimic the mannerisms of the bar, and to satirize the Latitats of the other branch of the profession with particular success. Though he never applied himself to his studies at the Inner Temple, he well applied himself to spending money and living as a bon vivant which led to him quickly running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|E

While many research studies support positive findings in restorative justice, continuing studies are still needed.|$|R
25|$|Construction {{began on}} Old Main in 1873 and was {{completed}} by 1875 in the Second Empire architectural style. Built with local brick and sandstone, Old Main serves as the university's signature building. The building has remained on campus despite its recommended removal in the 1925 master plan from the architects of Jamieson and Spearl. This plan included destruction of all existing campus buildings and reconstruction in the Collegiate Gothic style. Several buildings were built in this style near the core of campus, including the Vol Walker Hall, Engineering Hall, Chemistry Building, Agriculture Building, and Home Economics Building. The plan ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> and was never completed, leading to a somewhat haphazard arrangement of buildings after the 1930s.|$|E

The president wants the barangay elections to be held at October, but the winners' terms shall only be until May 2013 where the barangay elections will be held concurrently with the 2013 general election. In the Senate, Juan Miguel Zubiri filed a bill that will postponed the elections until October 2012, with Enrile prioritizing it.|$|E

In 1720, when they were unable to repay their debts, Arab creditors broke into the synagogue, set it on fire, and destroyed their homes. The Jews fled the city and over the next century, any Jew dressed in Ashkenazi garb was a target of attack. Some of the Ashkenazi Jews who remained began to dress like Sephardi Jews. One known example is Rabbi Abraham Gershon of Kitov.|$|E
