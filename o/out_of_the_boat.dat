5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? sold well at {{secular and}} Christian stores. Its {{popularity}} in the United Kingdom grew in 2003, when the impending Iraq War boosted sales of religious literature in the country. That March, it was the seventh-bestselling religious book in the UK, behind Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life, John Ortberg's If You Want to Walk on Water, You've Got to Get <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boat</b> and Eugene H. Peterson's The Message. What's So Amazing About Grace? is Yancey's best-known book, having sold more than 15million copies by 2006. Initially, the book was especially popular among baby boomers.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>boats</b> used to {{transport}} coal were short and narrow, and each contained {{a row of}} boxes used for carrying coal. [...] Each box had a base of two halves, hinged and held closed with chains. [...] These boxes would be lifted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> positioned by crane over a bunker or cart and emptied by releasing the chains on the base. [...] This design helped keep the canal competitive, as it increased {{the speed with which}} loading and unloading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> could be performed.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} they got to the beach, Kalaniʻōpuʻu's two {{youngest}} sons, who had been following their father believing they were being invited to visit the ship again with the ruler, began to climb into the boats that were waiting at the shore. Kānekapōlei shouted to them to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and pleaded with her husband to stop. The ruler then realized that Cook and his men were not asking him to visit the ship, but forcing him. At this point he stopped and sat down.|$|E
500|$|The next day, {{the family}} convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. [...] After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him {{she has been}} alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had {{forgotten}} {{what it felt like}} to have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles to the back of the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving the aforementioned book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks approvingly if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she [...] "passes away". After she succeeds in getting things moving again, she owns up to faking the heart attack as it was the only means to get their attention. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss, then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time.

Gillette {{is believed to have}} struck Brown over the head with a tennis racket, as the result of which she fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and drowned. Gillette returned alone, and gave varying explanations for what had occurred. Brown's body was found the next day, and Gillette was arrested in the nearby town of Inlet. The defense at trial attempted to explain that Grace was perplexed and at a point just jumped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> and into the water. Gillette testified, [...] "We talked a little more, then she got up and jumped in the water, just jumped in." ...|$|E

2500|$|Butler's crew {{included}} Michael Chapman as camera operator. When {{they arrived}} on Martha's Vineyard, Butler showed Spielberg {{how he could}} brace a handheld Panaflex camera and take the roll <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> rocking on the waves with his knees instead of using a 400-lb. gimbal. Spielberg embraced the idea. [...] "About 90% of the shots on the boat were handheld," [...] Butler says. [...] "Michael was intrigued by the idea and {{was very good at}} it. We did things that we probably wouldn't have tried without the lightweight camera. Michael even climbed the mast and shot from the top straight down. We also put him in a small boat." ...|$|E
60|$|Seeing {{that the}} people were getting excited, and knowing that order must be preserved, if the work that lay before them was to be done speedily and without accident, the captain sprang into the rigging, ordered the women and {{children}} to go below, and assured the male passengers that if any of them showed a disposition to be obstinate or unruly they also should be ordered below. This had the desired effect. Order was at once restored, and the captain then called for volunteers from among <b>the</b> stoutest <b>of</b> those on board to go into the chains, and lift {{the women and children}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|R

Rollo and Carlos then went inside the enclosure, and, going up some steps placed there for the purpose, they mounted their horses. Very soon the machine began to revolve, and they were whirled round and round twenty times with the greatest rapidity. <b>The</b> arms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine, too, were long, so that the circle which the horses and the vessels described was quite large, and the whole twenty revolutions made quite a considerable ride.|$|R
2500|$|The {{submarine}} {{was removed}} from the water at the end of 1994 to allow ASC to further complete the fitting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and perform repairs to the hull. Although sea trials resumed in early 1995, Collins did not dive again until 9 June, when it was decided that the status of the combat system drop was sufficient to allow further underwater tests of the submarine. The tests went without difficulty until the next day, when the anchor cable snapped in poor weather, forcing Collins to return to port. When approaching the ASC wharf, a programming problem with the propulsion switchboard caused the main motor to cut out. Collins drifted into the wharf, hitting the construction facility's shiplift at [...] The backup motor then belatedly engaged, causing the submarine to collide with , the ship assigned to assist in the submarine's sea trials.

2500|$|Cornell {{moved to}} the semifinals of the Grand {{challenge}} cup by defeating Leander. In its second race against Trinity Hall from Cambridge, things did not go well for Courtney’s crew.

At the quarter mile, they had {{a third of a}} boat length lead and increased it to a half a length at the half-mile mark. Trinity surged {{and by the time the}} boats reached the mile mark, they had passed Cornell. Shortly after Trinity took the lead, a sudden collapse occurred in the Cornell boat. The blades of the oars went flying, Hager (No. 3) and Fennell (No. 5) missed the water with their oars and almost fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> Trinity continued the last [...] to victory by seven lengths. [...] Fennell had caught a crab and the handle of his oar struck his side, inflicting injury including bruising his groin. Despite the pain, he continued to row even though he showed signs of exhaustion. After the race, Fennell was placed in doctors' care. Trinity Hall would go on and win the Cup that year.|$|E
2500|$|McLean {{was born}} in Sydney, Australia, the son of John Donald McLean, colonial {{treasurer}} of Queensland, Australia. He went to England where was educated at Eton College and made his first appearance at Henley in the Eton eight winning the Ladies' Challenge Plate in 1882. He went on to New College, Oxford where he rowed in the Oxford crew in the Boat Race five times between 1883 and 1887, winning the 1883 and 1885 races. He won the University Pairs for New College in 1885 and also Silver Goblets at Henley with his brother, Hector McLean. In 1886 the McLean brothers were beaten in {{the final of the}} Silver Goblets by Stanley Muttlebury and Fraser Churchill. McLean was Australia in December 1886 when he played a match for Geelong Cricket Club and then in India at the start of 1887, but returned in time to take part in his fifth boat race. During the race McLean's oar broke. Oxford were behind at Barnes Railway Bridge, but Cambridge moved into rougher water too far over to the Surrey bank and Oxford were expecting to push through when the disaster struck. Guy Nickalls, then in his first Boat Race, recorded [...] "Then, 'Ducker' McLean broke his oar off short at the button. With the station in our favour and him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> we could have won even then, but 'Ducker' funked the oncoming penny steamers and, instead of jumping overboard as he should have done, we had to lug his now useless body along, to lose the finish." [...] At Henley the McLeans were again runners up in Silver Goblets to Muttlebury and Charles Theodore Barclay.|$|E
