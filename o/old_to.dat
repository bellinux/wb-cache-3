5|$|In 1851, about {{a century}} before the cantata got its BWV number, it was {{published}} as No. 7 in {{the first volume of}} the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe. In the New Bach Edition the cantata was included in Series I, Volume 29, Kantaten zum Johannisfest (Cantatas for St. John's Day). Calmus and Breitkopf & Härtel published performance scores. The Breitkopf score translates the cantata's title as Lord Christ of <b>old</b> <b>to</b> Jordan came.|$|E

The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Josephine spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.|$|E

5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is too <b>old</b> <b>to</b> be retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed {{the ending of the}} American version to be more optimistic.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} Cicero, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence conveyed by Cicero to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the Turkish government. Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be too <b>old</b> <b>to</b> be of much value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which {{he wrote a book}} to address rumors and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with a war crime.|$|E
5|$|Although Ethel made {{a return}} visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America {{after his arrival}} in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British {{government}} indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and by then he felt too <b>old</b> <b>to</b> make the journey. The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades.|$|E

5|$|At the 1860 convention, Payne {{denounced the}} right of secession, and during the Civil War that began the next year, he was a staunch {{supporter}} of the Union. Although {{he was not an}} abolitionist, he opposed the further extension of slavery. During the war, Payne used some of his wealth to help equip Ohio regiments. He was 50 years old when the war began, too <b>old</b> <b>to</b> volunteer himself, but two of his sons served in the Union Army with his blessing. After the war, Payne continued his political activity, leading the Ohio delegation to the 1872 Democratic National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Horace Greeley. He campaigned on Greeley's behalf, raising his own political profile in the process. In 1874, Payne ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives from Ohio's 20th district, and was elected with a 2500-vote majority over the incumbent Republican, Richard C. Parsons.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} April, Himmler ordered Berger {{to obtain}} 20,000 new {{recruits}} for the Waffen-SS {{by the end of}} May. With Hitler's authorisation, the recruitment quotas were lifted by the Wehrmacht, allowing Berger an essentially free hand for a limited time. He did not disappoint, misleading the new recruits as to the length of their service obligation, and signing up 22,361 new troops by 29 May, many of whom were only 18 years <b>old.</b> <b>To</b> meet Himmler's target, Berger had also called up eligible members of the Allgemeine SS and intensified efforts to recruit western Europeans. The latter initiative proved disappointing, with only 2,000 of the total coming from that source. A total of 400 Finnish combat veterans also volunteered to join the Waffen-SS in this period, and they were sent to join the SS-Division-Wiking.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Navy {{decided that}} Nevada was too <b>old</b> <b>to</b> be retained, so they {{assigned}} {{it to be a}} target ship in the atomic experiments at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 (Operation Crossroads). The ship was hit by the blast from the first atomic bomb, Able, and was left heavily damaged and radioactive. Unfit for further service, Nevada was decommissioned on 29 August 1946 and sunk for naval gunfire practice on 31 July 1948.|$|E

5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina was too <b>old</b> <b>to</b> live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music.|$|E
5|$|Connected {{protected}} areas {{are important for}} the conservation of slow lorises because these primates are not adapted to travel long distances on the ground.

Sanctuaries and rescue facilities are available to provide both temporary and lifelong care for confiscated slow lorises. Zoo populations of some species have not bred much and have grown too <b>old</b> <b>to</b> reproduce, although the pygmy slow loris is doing well at some facilities, such as the San Diego Zoo.|$|E

While often compared to Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnymen by the media, the band commented that those bands are too <b>old</b> <b>to</b> {{have a major impact}} on their musical style. Upon Editors' first appearances in the British music scene, they were also heavily compared to American indie band Interpol.|$|E
