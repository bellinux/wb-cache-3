Fifty-seven churches to be erected with half-crowns, forty-two parsonage houses to be repaired with shillings, seven-and-twenty organs to be built with halfpence, twelve hundred children to be brought up on postage stamps. Not that a half-crown, shilling, halfpenny, or postage stamp, would be particularly acceptable from Mr Boffin, but that it is so obvious he is the man to make up the deficiency. And then the charities, my Christian brother! And mostly in difficulties, yet mostly lavish, too, in the expensive articles of print and paper. Large fat private double letter, sealed with ducal coronet. 'Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire. My Dear Sir,--Having consented to preside at the forthcoming Annual Dinner of the Family Party Fund, and feeling deeply impressed with the immense usefulness of that noble Institution and the great importance of its being supported by a List of Stewards that shall prove to the public the interest taken in it by popular and distinguished men, I have undertaken to ask you to become a Steward on that occasion. Soliciting your favourable reply before the 14th instant, I am, My Dear Sir, Your faithful Servant, LINSEED. P.S. The Steward's fee is limited to three Guineas.' Friendly this, {{on the part of the}} Duke of Linseed (and thoughtful in the postscript), only lithographed by the hundred and presenting but a pale individuality of an address to Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, in quite another hand.

And those benevolent noblemen very kindly point out that if Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, should wish to present two or more purses, it will not be inconsistent with the design of the estimable lady in the West of England, provided each purse be coupled with the name of some member of his honoured and respected family.|$|E

Methods: Primary and secondary targets of besifloxacin were evaluated by: (i) mutant selection experi-ments; (ii) MIC testing of defined topoisomerase mutants; and (iii) inhibition and cleavable complex assays with purified S. pneumoniae and E. coli DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes. Results: Enzyme assays showed similar besifloxacin activity against S. pneumoniae gyrase and topoi-somerase IV, with IC 50 and CC 25 of 2. 5 and 1 mM, respectively. In contrast to ciprofloxacin and moxi-floxacin, besifloxacin was equally potent against both S. pneumoniae and E. coli gyrases. DNA gyrase was the primary target in all three species, with substitutions observed at positions 81, 83 and 87 in GyrA and 426 and 466 in GyrB (E. coli numbering). Topoisomerase IV was the secondary target. Notably, resistant mutants were not recovered at 4 -fold besifloxacin MICs for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus topoisomerase mutants were only obtained after serial passage in liquid medium.

40|$|Bacterial conjunctivitis, {{commonly}} known as pink eye, is demographically unbiased in its prevalence and {{can be caused by}} a variety of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Timely empiric treatment with a broad-spectrum anti-infective, such as a topical fluoroquinolone, is critical in preventing potentially irreversible ocular damage. However, the rise in ocular methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates and the patterns of fluoroquinolone resistance for patients with other ocular bacterial infections mandate the need for new agents targeted for <b>ocular</b> <b>use.</b> Besifloxacin, a novel broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, is approved for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. It has a uniquely balanced dual-targeting activity that inhibits both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and is associated with a lower incidence of resistance development. Besifloxacin is not marketed in other formulations, ensuring that its exposure is limited to bacterial populations in and around the eye. This specifically precludes any bacterial exposure to besifloxacin resulting from systemic use, which further reduces the likelihood of emergence of bacterial resistance. In vitro, besifloxacin has demonstrated equivalent or superior activity compared with other commonly used topical antibiotics. In clinical trials, besifloxacin has consistently demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with bacterial conjunctivitis. Besifloxacin is considered safe and is well tolerated with no observed contraindications...|$|E

40|$|Conventional eye drops {{can result}} in poor drug {{bioavailability}} due to the unique ocular anatomy and physiology. Ion-activated in situ gelling systems are able to crosslink with cations present in the tear fluid, therefore forming a gel on the ocular surface, which results in prolonged corneal contact time. The present study compared a number of anionic polysaccharides (gellan gum, xanthan gum, carrageenan and alginate) to an uncharged (HPMC) and a positively charged (chitosan) polymer system with emphasis on the gelling behaviour, rheological and textural properties, gel microstructure, contact angle and in vitro release characteristics. All systems exhibited physically entangled polymer networks that were able to disentangle upon shear stress and significantly prolonged the in vitro release of a model hydrophilic drug compared to a solution. While systems based on HPMC and chitosan showed no structural changes upon addition of cations, formulations based on gellan gum and carrageenan demonstrated a remarkable increase in viscosity, pseudoplasticity and hardness upon addition of Ca(2 +) and K(+) respectively. This renders them favourable for <b>ocular</b> <b>use</b> as they would gel once {{in contact with the}} cations of the tear fluid, thus reducing nasolacrimal drainage, but would thin upon shearing, preventing ocular irritation and therefore induced lacrimation...|$|E
40|$|Conjunctivitis, or {{inflammation}} of the conjunctiva, refers to {{a diverse group of}} ocular surface diseases of viral or bacterial origin that primarily affect the conjunctiva. In developed countries, the most common causative bacterial pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Most varieties of conjunctivitis are self-limiting; however, some cases can be extremely contagious or cause serious complications if left unchecked.

There are many structures of interest in the human eye that are within reach of a fluorescence-mode confocal microscope; this study assessed the feasibility of in vivo human ocular imaging. Safety analysis was undertaken to ensure that the laser light applied to the ocular surface structures constituted no threat to patient safety. A fibreoptic confocal imaging (FOCI) probe using an illumination wavelength of 488 nm was applied to the ocular surface of four volunteers after topical administration of sodium fluorescein. Stabilization of the probe on the ocular surface was difficult, but movement artefacts could be minimized to a satisfactory level in most subjects by a variety of procedures. High-quality images of conjunctival epithelial and goblet cells, lamina propria structures, accessory lacrimal glands, lacrimal ducts and superficial sclera were obtained. Lateral resolution was 1 – 1. 5 µm and axial resolution was approximately 30 µm; individual erythrocytes could be seen in conjunctival vessels. The rete ridges and intervening epithelial components, including the probable location of corneal limbal stem cells, could be viewed, although it was not possible to distinguish cell subgroups. The study showed that fluorescence-mode imaging of the ocular surface is a viable and promising tool for assessment of diseases and processes involving superficial ocular structures.

In this study, we assess the incidence of topical lubricant use as a surrogate marker for underlying OSD, in medically and surgically treated glaucoma patients. Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed for newly diagnosed glaucoma patients who were started on topical medications in 2007 and followed up over a 5 -year period. Primary outcome measure was the incidence of topical lubricant use in these patients and a subset of these patients who required glaucoma or cataract surgery during follow-up. Results: Charts of 505 newly diagnosed glaucoma patients with no prior history of <b>ocular</b> lubricant <b>use</b> were analyzed. Mean age was 63. 9 years (SD 11. 1), 42. 8 % were women.

Five-year incidence of lubricant use was 59 % in all glaucoma subjects; 54. 1 % of patients were on medical treatment and 74. 0 % of patients who underwent phacotrabeculectomy or trabeculectomy were started on lubricants, respectively (P= 0. 0011); 60. 4 % of glaucoma subjects who underwent phacoemulsification surgery were started on lubricants. Incidence of lubricant use increased from 17. 7 % preoperatively to 74. 0 % postoperatively in subjects who required trabeculectomy or phacotrabeculectomy. Incidence of lubricant use was similar in patients on one or multiple glaucoma medications, with the mean onset of lubricant use being 10 months after starting glaucoma medication in both groups.
