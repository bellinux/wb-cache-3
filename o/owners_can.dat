5|$|In 1982, Mayor Chirac {{introduced}} the motorcycle-mounted Motocrotte to remove dog faeces from Paris streets. The project was abandoned in 2002 {{for a new}} and better enforced local law, {{under the terms of}} which dog <b>owners</b> <b>can</b> be fined up to €500 for not removing their dog faeces. The air pollution in Paris, {{from the point of view}} of particulate matter (PM10), is the highest in France with 38µg/m³.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} crocodilian are traded as exotic pets. They are {{appealing}} when young, and pet-store <b>owners</b> <b>can</b> easily sell them, but crocodilians {{do not make}} good pets; they grow large and are both dangerous and expensive to keep. As they grow older, pet crocodilians are often abandoned by their owners, and feral populations of spectacled caimans exist in the United States and Cuba. Most countries have strict regulations for keeping these reptiles.|$|E
5000|$|Once a reexamination is ordered, a new {{examiner}} {{is assigned}} to the case, and the patent goes through another examination similar to the examination it received the first time around. If any claims are rejected {{in light of the}} new questions raised, then the patent <b>owner</b> <b>can</b> narrow or cancel those claims. The patent <b>owner</b> <b>can</b> also submit new claims, provided they are not broader than the claims in the original patent. If the examiner makes a rejection [...] "final", the patent <b>owner</b> <b>can</b> appeal the decision to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI) at the USPTO. The patent <b>owner</b> <b>can</b> file an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and even to the US Supreme Court, if permitted.|$|R

The amounts {{can end up}} being quite high once the process is well under way. [...] Even after foreclosure, in some jurisdictions the <b>owner</b> <b>can</b> still recover the property, by paying the amounts owed (plus additional interest/penalties/costs) within a specified time. Alternatively, the <b>owner</b> <b>can</b> file suit to have the sale set aside on grounds that the requirements were not followed (such as proper notice not given).|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from the}} single-player story, Undead Nightmare adds two {{multiplayer}} modes: Undead Overrun and Land Grab. The former is a horde mode in which {{up to four}} players cooperatively fight off waves of zombies. Players must open coffins between waves to replenish a countdown timer, which discourages players from camping in the same location. It is also designed so as to encourage cooperation such that players can revive each other if nearby. The other mode, Land Grab, is an additional game mode within the main game's multiplayer free roam and otherwise unconnected to the undead theme. In Land Grab, players attempt to secure seven areas across the game's environment. While players with the base game can join in Land Grab games, only Undead Nightmare <b>owners</b> <b>can</b> initiate them.|$|E
5|$|The game is turn-based. Each turn {{represents}} one week, and travelling between cities takes {{a number of}} turns depending on {{the proximity of the}} destination city. Many cities have a chocolate shop, where the player can sell his or her stock, and a market where ingredients can be purchased. Some specialty cacao beans can only be purchased from plantations in certain cities. Factories manufacturing chocolates produce a set amount of product every turn, as long as the required ingredients are in stock. During story mode, quests are given by non-player characters; these typically involve producing a particular volume and type of chocolate and delivering it to another non-player character, who is either traveling or can be found at a set location. Quest rewards {{take the form of a}} high price for the chocolates or a new recipe. Some encounters with characters give the player an opportunity to gamble a large amount of money on a dice roll. Market <b>owners</b> <b>can</b> be bartered with, though this carries the risk of them becoming irritated and raising prices rather than lowering them.|$|E

25|$|So far, {{there is}} no {{scholarly}} consensus yet about what the overall long-term effect will be of environmental pollution on the average rate of profit for industries. In some cases, if a resource is depleted (and therefore much more difficult and costly to obtain), the profit yield on producing the resource might fall, since people will only buy {{it up to a}} certain price point. In other cases, if an essential resource becomes scarce, its <b>owners</b> <b>can</b> drive up the price, and thus increase their profit rate, because demand remains strong.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide {{slavery is}} a {{criminal}} offense but slave <b>owners</b> <b>can</b> get very high returns for their risk. According to researcher Siddharth Kara, the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were $91.2 billion. That {{is second only to}} drug trafficking in terms of global criminal enterprises. The weighted average annual profits generated by a slave in 2007 was $3,175, with a low of an average $950 for bonded labour and $29,210 for a trafficked sex slave. Approximately 40% of slave profits each year are generated by trafficked sex slaves, representing slightly more than 4% of the world's 29 million slaves.|$|E

25|$|Many {{suppliers}} of insects for reptiles offer live bugs and worms. Monitor lizards are typically fed live insects {{and may not}} eat pre-killed ones. Amphibians typically require live insects—wild-caught, home-grown, or bought at a pet store—although some like axolotls can be fed chunks of meat. It's generally hard to convert reptiles and amphibians that eat insects to pre-killed prey, though some pet <b>owners</b> <b>can</b> feed dead insects by moving or dangling them. Bearded dragons can be fed dead crickets by hiding them in other food, dangling them with tongs, squirting them with water, or vibrating a bowl.|$|E
25|$|Canadian Eskimo Dogs need a {{very large}} amount of exercise. They cannot just be walked, they need higher {{intensity}} work, requiring more exercise than many dog <b>owners</b> <b>can</b> give. This need for work and stimulation makes them well-suited for dog sports, such as carting, mushing, and skijoring. They are very trainable and submissive, unlike many spitz breeds, as well as intelligent. The Canadian Eskimo Dog is best kept in a cold climate, and is prone to heatstroke. Its coat is fairly easy to care for most times of the year, needing brushing {{only one or two}} times a week. However, when it sheds (which happens once a year) it will need grooming every day.|$|E
25|$|This breed {{requires}} expert veterinary {{attention in}} areas such as birthing and dental care. Dental care is a must for these small dogs, whose jaw size makes for weaker teeth. Although daily brushing provides the best preventative measure, feeding a dental diet or using dental chews for dogs is an effective approach pet <b>owners</b> <b>can</b> take to help prevent and control accumulation of plaque and tartar to avoid consequences of severe periodontal disease. The best physical characteristics of dog food to contribute to cleaning a dog's teeth would be food that is large and dense, that way there is more time spent chewing which leads {{to the surface of the}} teeth being cleaned.|$|E
