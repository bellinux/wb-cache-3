2500|$|An early {{source of}} disillusionment with Britain's {{imperial}} policy was his realisation that, given more patient and skilful negotiation, the Boer War {{could have been}} avoided. His friend and biographer Basil Williams noticed his growing doubts about Britain's actions in South Africa while they were on campaign together: [...] "Both of us, who came out as hide-bound Tories, began to tend towards more liberal ideas, partly from the ... democratic company we were keeping, but chiefly, I think, from <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> on politics and life generally." ...|$|E

Essays, criticism, poems, short stories, reviews of noted books, characterizations of great writers, social studies, descriptive sketches and brief discussions, occupy the hour. [...] The only topics excluded... are those which touch the realm of politics or the domain of religion. [...] In our literary symposia controversy has no place. With all our freedom and variety of opinion, my colleagues will bear me witness, <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> have never degenerated into personality or rancor.

2500|$|In May 2008, a {{film version}} of the comic was in the {{scripting}} process, with Brian K. Vaughan writing and Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios President of Production, producing. Feige has said, [...] "In <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> with Brian, we {{wanted him to be}} the person to bring it to life. I think it won't be a precise story line of any , but certainly it will be most similar to the tone or origins of his structure in its initial run". A 2011 release was considered, as Feige had expected a finished script in early 2009. In April 2010, Peter Sollett emerged as the front runner to direct the movie. In May 2010, British screenwriter Drew Pearce, known for the TV series No Heroics, was reported to be writing the film for Marvel Studios. In July 2010, it was reported that filming would begin sometime between March - July 2011. On August 5, 2010, preliminary casting for the film began.|$|E
2500|$|As {{reported}} by the BBC, on 3 March 2004, CARICOM called for an independent inquiry into the departure of former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and says it will not send peacekeepers at this time. Patterson {{said there had been}} no indication during discussions with the U.S. and France that the plan which CARICOM had put forward prior to Aristide's departure was not acceptable. [...] "In respect of our partners we can only say this, at no time in <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> did they convey to us that the plan was unacceptable so long as president Aristide remained in office. Nor did they suggest to us anything of a nature pertaining to the conduct of President Aristide in office that would cause us to come to the judgment ourselves that he was unsuited to be the President of Ha√Øti," [...] Mr. Patterson said. The U.S. and France have been accused of using pressure on CARICOM to not make a formal UN request for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Aristide's removal.|$|E

60|$|Phil.--In {{reflecting}} upon <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> this morning, I cannot help being {{a little}} surprised at their nature; {{we have been talking}} only of geological systems, when a more natural subject for our conversation would have been these magnificent temples, and an inquiry into the race by whom they were raised and the gods to whom they wore dedicated. We are now treading on a spot which contains the bones of a highly civilised and powerful people; yet we are almost ignorant of the names they bore, and the period of their greatness is lost in the obscurity of time.|$|E

So long as we remember that we're only men, and don't take to fancying ourselves gods, really knowing good and evil, I reckon <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> won't do us or anyone much harm. So we'll have another whack at the origin of evil this evening, master." ...|$|E
60|$|Thinking {{backwards}} is {{not quite}} easy to define abstractedly; and, perhaps, the simplest method is to take some object, as plain as possible, and from it illustrate the two modes of thought: the right mode in which all real results have been rooted; the wrong mode, which is confusing all our current discussions, especially <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> about the relations of the sexes. Casting my eye round the room, I notice an object which is often mentioned in the higher and subtler of these debates about the sexes: I mean a poker. I will take a poker and think about it; first forwards and then backwards; and so, perhaps, show what I mean.|$|E

It has been the one apple of discord which has been thrown into the arena of <b>our</b> <b>discussions.</b> It is quite true we meet here with a great fund of goodwill on everybody's part, {{on the part of the}} Mother Country and on the part of the representatives of the self-governing Dominions--a great fund of goodwill which has been accumulated over a long period of time when each party to this great confederation has been free to pursue its own line of development unchecked and untrammelled by interference from the other.|$|E
60|$|We have {{a custom}} {{at our house}} which we call raking up the fire. That is to say, the last half hour before bedtime, we draw in, {{shoulder}} to shoulder, around the last brands and embers of our hearth, which we prick up and brighten, and dispose for a few farewell flickers and glimmers. This is a grand time for discussion. Then we talk over parties, if the young people {{have been out of}} an evening,--a book, if we have been reading one; we discuss and analyze characters,--give our views on all subjects, √¶sthetic, theological, and scientific, in a way most wonderful to hear; and, in fact, we sometimes get so engaged in <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> that every spark of the fire burns out, and we begin to feel ourselves shivering around the shoulders, before we can remember that it is bedtime.|$|E
