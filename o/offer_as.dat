5|$|Around 1262 or 1263, the Mamluk leader Baibars {{attempted}} {{an attack}} on Antioch, but the principality was saved by Mongol intervention.

In 1268 Baibars completely overran the rest of Antioch, ending the 170-year-old principality.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Clarke, {{who succeeded}} Farwell {{as the general}} manager of the Flyers, feuded with Lindros and his parents during his time with Philadelphia. Lindros sat out for the entire 2000–01 NHL season after rejecting a one-year, $8.5million <b>offer</b> <b>as</b> he demanded a trade from the Flyers. The Flyers traded him to the Rangers in 2001. After Lindros retired from the NHL, the Flyers {{inducted}} him into their team Hall of Fame, in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially hesitant {{to accept the}} <b>offer</b> <b>as</b> {{he felt that the}} audience would not want to see him as the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, he decided to take up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his complexion and nativity.|$|E

Uttanka rejected the <b>offer</b> <b>as</b> it was being offered by the hunter, an untouchable. This displeased Krishna who then appeared before Uttanka in his true form.|$|E
5|$|Rubin delayed in {{offering}} Kinkladze a contract extension, leading Anorthosis {{to make an}} attempt to re-sign him early in the pre-season, but Kinkladze rejected the <b>offer</b> <b>as</b> he wished to stay at Rubin.

5|$|When {{considering}} the project, Charles Cecil {{played the game}} again and noticed many issues, including pixilated backgrounds, FMV and audio were of poor quality, and he also felt some dialogue was out of place. He thought all these elements could be addressed and improved in a remastered edition, {{in which they could}} add a diary, hint system, and new artwork from Dave Gibbons, which they could <b>offer</b> <b>as</b> an interactive digital comic.|$|E

5|$|Christie {{urged the}} Navy Department to {{allocate}} a target ship for extensive field {{tests of the}} torpedo and exploder. The Chief of Naval Operations authorized {{the use of the}} obsolete destroyer , but placed so many restrictions on its use, Newport was forced to decline the <b>offer.</b> <b>As</b> a result, neither the Mark 6 exploder nor the Mark 14 torpedo ever underwent a live test, and their shortcomings would not become apparent until the outbreak of hostilities. It would be twenty months before the problems were corrected, over Christie's objections.|$|E

5|$|In May 1916 the Australian Government {{offered the}} British Army Council a sixth {{division}} of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), the Australian Army's main expeditionary force during World War I. This offer was an element {{of an attempt to}} establish an Australian and New Zealand Army, though the Australian Government acknowledged that forming a sixth division could cause difficulties in providing sufficient reinforcements to replace the AIF's casualties from December 1916. In such an event, the government proposed breaking up the division to reinforce the five others. The Army Council declined this <b>offer</b> <b>as</b> it preferred Australia to raise only as many units as it could reinforce.|$|E
5|$|Jogaila's Russian mother Uliana of Tver {{urged him}} to marry Sofia, {{daughter}} of Prince Dmitri of Moscow, who required him first to convert to Orthodoxy. That option, however, was unlikely to halt the crusades against Lithuania by the Teutonic Knights, who regarded Orthodox Christians as schismatics and little better than heathens. Jogaila chose therefore to accept a Polish proposal to become a Catholic and marry the eleven-year-old Queen Jadwiga of Poland. The nobles of Lesser Poland made this offer to Jogaila for many reasons. They wanted to neutralize the dangers posed by Lithuania itself and to secure the fertile territories of Galicia–Volhynia. The Polish nobles saw the <b>offer</b> <b>as</b> an opportunity for increasing their privileges and avoiding Austrian influence, brought by Jadwiga's previous fiancé William, Duke of Austria.|$|E
5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} {{what would have}} happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and <b>offer</b> <b>as</b> proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might not have been able to write what would become his greatest works.|$|E

From 2004 to 2006, ERT had selected high-profile artists internally and set up national finals to choose the song, while in 2007 it held a televised national final to choose both the song and performer. For the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest, ERT decided again to hold a televised national final after failing to secure a big name artist: As every other year since his first participation in the 2004 contest, ERT asked Sakis Rouvas to represent Greece {{but he did not}} accept. ERT officials had also approached Elli Kokkinou to represent Greece, but she declined the <b>offer</b> <b>as</b> she was pregnant.|$|E
5|$|The Ionians {{sought to}} defend Miletus by sea, leaving {{the defense of}} Miletus to the Milesians. The Ionian fleet {{gathered}} at the island of Lade, {{off the coast of}} Miletus. The Persians were uncertain of victory at Lade, so attempted to persuade some of the Ionian contingents to defect. Although this was unsuccessful at first, when the Persians finally attacked the Ionians, the Samian fleet accepted the Persian <b>offer.</b> <b>As</b> the Persian and Ionian fleets met, the Samians sailed away from the battle, causing the collapse of the Ionian battle line. Although the Chian contingent and a few other ships remained and fought bravely against the Persians, the battle was lost.|$|E
5|$|The League {{kicked off}} in September 1888, with Preston {{one of the}} 12 founder members. North End proved {{superior}} to their opponents, winning the title with several matches to spare. This allowed the club {{to concentrate on the}} FA Cup, which they duly won by defeating Wolverhampton Wanderers. In completing the League and Cup double Preston remained unbeaten for the entire season. The team, nicknamed the Invincibles, contained ten Scots, tempted south by the money on <b>offer</b> <b>as</b> professionalism was still banned in Scotland. Wishing for a grander gesture to celebrate his team's success than the League committee's suggestion of a flag bearing the club's name, Sudell convinced the League to spend 50 guineas on a trophy. However, despite being responsible for the creation of the trophy, Preston North End have not won it since.|$|E

5|$|The role of Rachel was {{originally}} offered to actresses Téa Leoni, the producer's first choice, and Courteney Cox, {{both of whom}} declined, Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth, and Cox in favor of playing Rachel's best friend Monica in Friends. A virtually unknown actress at the time who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms, Aniston auditioned {{for the role of}} Rachel after turning down an <b>offer</b> <b>as</b> a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. After acquiring the role and before Friends aired, Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom, Muddling Through, at the time, which was ultimately canceled and allowed Aniston to remain on Friends.|$|E

5|$|Together, Schmitt, Kutuzov and {{the other}} generals, with von Stiebar's advice on the local terrain, concocted a plan to {{encircle}} the French at Dürenstein. Russian commander Mikhail Miloradovich would approach Gazan's division from the east, supported by Pyotr Bagration's corps, and pin the French in place. Three additional columns, commanded by Dmitry Dokhturov (Doctorov), Maj. Gen. Strik and Schmitt, would outflank the French from {{the west and the}} north.
