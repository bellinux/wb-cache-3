5|$|Triton's {{rotation}} is tidally locked to be synchronous {{with its}} orbit around Neptune: it keeps one face oriented toward the planet at all times. Its equator is almost exactly aligned with its <b>orbital</b> <b>plane.</b> At the present time, Triton's rotational axis is about 40° from Neptune's <b>orbital</b> <b>plane,</b> and hence {{at some point}} during Neptune's year each pole points fairly close to the Sun, almost like the poles of Uranus. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun, resulting in seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight. Such changes were observed in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} lunar {{missions}} (Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 11) used a free return trajectory, keeping a flight path coplanar with the lunar orbit, {{which would allow}} a return to Earth in case the SM engine failed to make lunar orbit insertion.

40|$|Abstract. 41 RS CVn and BY Dra type {{binaries}} with reliable orbital {{and physical}} parameters {{have been found}} to rotate asynchronously with the orbital revolution. For this sample inclinations of the rotational axes, ir, of the primaries and the orbital inclinations, io, are independently determined to test the alignment between the equatorial and the <b>orbital</b> <b>planes.</b> The observed difference ∆i = |io − ir | measures a deviation from coplanarity of these planes. It turns out that most asynchronous systems prove to be misaligned, especially when the influence of the position angle is taken into account. Thus, the generally accepted assumption that rotational axes are perpendicular to <b>orbital</b> <b>planes</b> is not valid for asynchronous RS CVn and BY Dra type binaries. The influence of the position angle of the observer on the derived values of ∆i can be studied only by statistical methods. The distribution of the observed ∆i is compared wih the expected values of ∆i e for two cases: a) the rotational axes are randomly inclined to the <b>orbital</b> <b>planes,</b> and b) the rotational axes are perpendicular to the <b>orbital</b> <b>planes.</b> The best fit to our observed sample of asynchronous binaries is obtained for the case a), while for the synchronous RS CVn and BY Dra type binaries the rotational axes are perpendicular to their <b>orbital</b> <b>planes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's <b>orbital</b> <b>plane</b> than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its <b>orbital</b> <b>plane,</b> sunlight is incident at different angles {{at different times}} of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the <b>orbital</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E

5|$|The average {{distance}} between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4 billion kilometers (9AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68km/s, it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days (or about years), to finish one revolution around the Sun. The elliptical orbit of Saturn is inclined 2.48° {{relative to the}} <b>orbital</b> <b>plane</b> of the Earth. The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957AU, on average. The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in Jupiter's case).|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees {{relative}} to its <b>orbital</b> <b>plane,</b> {{which is similar}} to the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars, they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb. Mars passed an aphelion in March 2010 and its perihelion in March 2011. The next aphelion came in February 2012 and the next perihelion came in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Robert Harrington led {{a search}} to {{determine}} the real cause of the apparent irregularities. He calculated that any PlanetX would be at roughly three times the distance of Neptune from the Sun; its orbit would be highly eccentric, and strongly inclined to the ecliptic—the planet's orbit would be at roughly a 32-degree angle from the <b>orbital</b> <b>plane</b> of the other known planets. This hypothesis was met with a mixed reception. Noted PlanetX sceptic Brian G. Marsden of the Minor Planet Center pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by Le Verrier, and could easily be due to observational error.|$|E

40|$|This paper developes {{crosslink}} routing {{strategies for}} the Mobile Satellite System Iridium [1, 3, 6, 8]. Motorola's Iridium satellite constellation, based on the orbit design of Adams and Rider [2] is to provide mobile satellite service for hand-held personal telephones. The Iridium system will have 66 satellites in 6 <b>orbital</b> <b>planes</b> {{at an altitude of}} h = 780 km and a minimum elevation angle of q = 8. 2 degrees for an optimal satellite distribution around the globe. It will be a system with direct connections between satellites (Intersatellite Links ISLs). These connections can be established with Intra-Orbit ISLs and with Inter-Orbit ISLs. The problem of routing messages through the satellite network is complicated by the time-varying satellite system geometry.

5|$|The {{climate of}} a region depends {{on a number of}} factors, {{especially}} latitude. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its <b>orbital</b> <b>plane.</b> Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{streams of}} dust and gas each form their own {{distinct}} tail, pointing in slightly different directions. The tail of dust is {{left behind in the}} comet's orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved tail called the type II or dust tail. At the same time, the ion or type I tail, made of gases, always points directly away from the Sun because this gas is more strongly affected by the solar wind than is dust, following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory. On occasions - such as when the Earth passes through a comet's <b>orbital</b> <b>plane,</b> a tail pointing in the opposite direction to the ion and dust tails called the antitail may be seen.|$|E
5|$|This {{constellation}} forms {{part of the}} zodiac, {{and hence}} is intersected by the ecliptic. This circle across the celestial sphere forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the <b>orbital</b> <b>plane</b> of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually {{be found in the}} constellation Taurus during some part of each year. The galactic plane of the Milky Way intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the galactic anticenter is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga. Taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator, celestial equator, and ecliptic. A ring-like galactic structure known as Gould's Belt passes through the constellation.|$|E

5|$|Venus, with {{an orbit}} {{inclined}} by 3.4° {{relative to the}} Earth's, usually appears to pass under (or over) the Sun at inferior conjunction. A transit occurs when Venus reaches conjunction with the Sun at or near one of its nodes—the longitude where Venus passes through the Earth's <b>orbital</b> <b>plane</b> (the ecliptic)—and appears to pass directly across the Sun. Although the inclination between these two orbital planes is only 3.4°, Venus can be as far as 9.6° from the Sun when viewed from the Earth at inferior conjunction. Since the angular diameter of the Sun is about half a degree, Venus may appear to pass above or below the Sun by more than 18 solar diameters during an ordinary conjunction.|$|E
5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the <b>orbital</b> <b>plane</b> of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{computer}} models, {{the presence of}} the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes. This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the precession rate of the Earth's spin axis (that is, the precession motion of the ecliptic), thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the spin and precession of the planet's <b>orbital</b> <b>plane</b> relative to that of Jupiter. However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E
40|$|For single-lined spectroscopic {{binary stars}} (sbi), the mass ratio q = Msec=Mprim is {{calculated}} from the mass function f(m), which is determined from observations. For statistical investigations of the mass-ratio distribution, the term sin^ 3 i, that remains in the cubic equation from which q is solved, has to be dealt with. This paper compares the common practise of taking an average value for sin^ 3 i to a deconvolution scheme {{that takes into account}} the precise (expected) behaviour of P(sin^ 3 i) d sin^ 3 i. The behaviour of P(sin^ 3 i) d sin^ 3 i depends on how <b>orbital</b> <b>planes</b> of binary stars are oriented in space. For a random orientation of <b>orbital</b> <b>planes,</b> Pi(i) di = sini di. For the average value method, it is generally assumed that Pi(i) di = (4 /pi) sin^ 2 i di. For verication purposes, the deconvolution scheme is applied to an observed sample of double-lined spectroscopic binary systems (sbii), and to a synthetic sample of sbi systems, produced by a numerical model. In both cases, the scheme produces better results with the assumption that Pi(i) di = (4 /pi) sin^ 2 i di, rather than a purely random orientation of <b>orbital</b> <b>planes.</b> In the case of the synthetic sample of sbi systems, the deconvolution scheme does not produce better results than the method that assumes an average value for sin^ 3 i. Application of the deconvolution method to the double-lined spectroscopic binary systems in the Eighth Catalogue of the Orbital Elements of Spectroscopic Binary Stars, provides results which are compatible with the assumption that the <b>orbital</b> <b>planes</b> of these systems are oriented randomly in space...|$|R
