5|$|By {{the time}} of his 1922 {{re-election}} bid, Barkley was the ranking Democrat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> and Foreign Commerce Committee. In the election, he carried every First District county, including the Republican strongholds of Caldwell and Crittenden counties. Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K. Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a desire to become governor, may have motivated him to announce his candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics charged that this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.|$|E
5|$|Assigned male at birth, she {{was given}} the name Joshua Alcorn and raised in Ohio by a family {{affiliated}} with the Churches of Christ movement. At age 14, she came out as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy {{with the intention of}} convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She committed suicide by walking out in front of oncoming traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> 71 highway.|$|E

5|$|Blue Streak {{service on}} Route 41 began on September 8, 1970, {{traveling}} on local streets between Sand Point, Lake City and Northgate Mall, and proceeding onto Interstate 5 non-stop to Downtown Seattle. Blue Streak buses were given exclusive {{use of the}} Columbia and Cherry ramps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> 5 reversible express lanes, {{as well as a}} bus-only lane on 5th Avenue. Buses traveled primarily on 3rd Avenue through Downtown, heading northbound during morning inbound trips and southbound during afternoon outbound trips towards Northgate. Buses ran at a frequency of 7 to 15 minutes from 7a.m. to 7p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays. The trip between Northgate and downtown took an average of 15 minutes, and took near-full busloads on the first day. The 22 buses on Blue Streak service were initially colored red, but were later repainted blue to match the branding.|$|E
5|$|The {{regional}} transit agency, renamed to Sound Transit {{the following}} year, began operating its Sound Transit Express buses under contract with Community Transit in September 1999.

Sound Transit funded several capital projects to improve bus service <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> 5 corridor, including direct access ramps from HOV lanes to Lynnwood and Ash Way park and rides that opened in 2004 and 2005, respectively. In 2011, the existing Mountlake Terrace park and ride was expanded with an 890-stall parking garage and bus platforms in the median of I-5 connected by a pedestrian bridge.|$|E
5|$|In Berks County, {{snow and}} sleet along with very cold {{temperatures}} combined with some accidents {{and other aspects}} to cause a 50-mile backup on Interstate 78.

At 1:02 PM, a truck driver tells the Berks Communications Center about a seven-mile backup on the eastbound lanes of Interstate 78 near Hamburg. At 4:40 PM, a 911 caller asked to speak to the Berks Emergency Management Agency. The Berks Deputy Coordinator took the call. At 4:59 PM, The Berks Deputy Coordinator called the State Emergency Operations Center and was told the center learned of the backup at 4:33 PM. At 5:22 PM, Berks Emergency Management calls the state police at the Hamburg barracks but cannot get through, so he decided to drive there. At 6:08 PM, the Berks Emergency Management Deputy Coordinator finds that the Hamburg barracks is without power and phones.

40|$|In 1987, {{most states}} raised {{the speed limit}} from 55 to 65 mph on {{portions}} of their rural interstate highways. There was intense debate about the increase, and numerous evaluations were conducted afterwards. These evaluations share a common problem: they only measure the local effects of the change. But the change must be judged by its system-wide effects. In particular, the new 65 mph limit allowed the state highway patrols to shift their resources from speed enforcement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interstates</b> to other safety activities and other highways [...] a shift many highway patrol chiefs had argued for. If the chiefs were correct, the new allocation of patrol resources should lead {{to a reduction in}} statewide fatality rates. Similarly, the change to drive faster <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interstates</b> should attract drivers away from other, more dangerous roads, again generating system-wide consequences. This study measures these changes and obtains surprising results. We find that the 65 mph limit reduced statewide fatality rates by 3. 4 % to 5. 1 %, holding constant the effects of long-term trend, driving exposure, seat belt laws, and economic factors...|$|R

25|$|Automobile travel became {{important}} after 1910 when {{motor cars}} and trucks began to become common. Before that nearly all long distance travel was by railroad or stagecoach, with horse- or mule-drawn wagons hauling the freight. A key route was the Lincoln Highway, which was America's first transcontinental road for motorized vehicles, connecting New York City to San Francisco. The creation of the Lincoln Highway in 1913 was a major stimulus {{on the development of}} both industry and tourism in the state. Similar effects occurred in 1926 with the creation of Route 66. The last large addition to the state highway system was made by the California State Assembly in 1959, after which only minor changes have been made.

25|$|In early 1968, he was {{contacted}} {{by a friend}} from Chicago who said that Toyota wanted to establish a dealer network in the Southeast U.S. and {{wanted to talk to}} Jim Moran, who asked what a Toyota was. The company had been unsuccessful at breaking into the American market {{at the end of the}} 1950s and was trying again. Moran declined, but his friend was insistent that Moran drive one. According to Moran, he tested everything to see if it would break. While cruising at 55mph <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interstate,</b> Moran shifted into reverse, and the engine and transmission survived. Moran concluded that although Toyotas weren't as stylish or comfortable as domestic vehicles, they were well-built, reasonably priced, and destined to change the automotive business. On October 26, 1968 he entered into an agreement to distribute Toyota vehicles from the port in Jacksonville, Florida to the states of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North and South Carolina. His Southeast Toyota Distributors (SET) was founded that year and in 2006, distributed over 400,000 vehicles, 20% of all new Toyotas sold in the United States.|$|E

25|$|With {{the advent}} of interstate teams into the {{expanding}} VFL and its eventual re-badging and change to a national league in 1990, the state leagues would undertake {{steps to ensure that}} representative football would not be reserved solely for those players in the Australian Football League. State League Representative matches would allow those players participating in competitions that would be, in later years, categorised as second-tier leagues, to be selected for interstate duties. While State of Origin would continue for several more years with pre-dominantly AFL-listed players, this format would for many players, become the pinnacle of their football careers outside of playing in a premiership. For the most part during the ensuing years between the inception of State League and the end of Origin, it was the South Australian and Western Australian leagues championing the concept with the two leagues facing off many times. The other state leagues did take part in the concept, but on a far more limited basis. The Queensland, ACT and Tasmanian competitions featured on several occasions, the New South Wales league made scattered appearances while the Northern Territory was far less featured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>interstate</b> stage mainly due to their domestic league being played in {{a different part of the}} year.
