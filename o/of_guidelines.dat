40|$|AIMS: The European Society <b>of</b> Cardiology {{published}} <b>guidelines</b> for {{the management}} of stable angina in 1997, with the objective of promoting an evidence-based approach to the condition. This study focuses on the impact <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> compliant medical treatment on clinical outcome in patients with stable angina. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Euro Heart Survey of Stable Angina is a multicentre prospective observational study conducted between 2002 and 2003. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of stable angina by a cardiologist were enrolled and follow-up was conducted at 1 year. The primary outcome of interest was death or myocardial infarction (MI). The increasing intensity <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> compliant medical therapy was quantified by means of a simple treatment score based on the use <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> advocated therapies: antiplatelets, statins, and beta-blockers. A total of 3779 patients were included in the initial survey. Increasing intensity <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> compliant therapy at initial assessment was associated with a reduction in death and MI during follow-up in patients with angina and confirmed coronary disease (HR 0. 68; 95 % CI 0. 49 - 0. 95 per unit increase in treatment score). All cardiovascular events were also significantly reduced in this subgroup (HR 0. 82; 95 % CI 0. 69 - 0. 97). The benefits <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> compliant therapy were only observed in patients with objective evidence of coronary disease. CONCLUSION: Guideline compliant medical therapy improves clinical outcome in patients with stable angina and objective evidence of coronary disease...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Guidelines for {{occupational}} physicians are increasing in number. Their quality and content is varied {{and they may}} even provide conflicting recommendations. Earlier studies show that guidelines directed at professionals in occupational health use scientific evidence unsystematically or inadequately. This article assesses the <b>guidelines</b> <b>of</b> the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH). We selected a random sample <b>of</b> 29 <b>guidelines</b> from all those published by FIOH, which were assessed by four people individually using the AGREE instrument. The items were scored in six domains: scope and purpose <b>of</b> the <b>guideline,</b> stakeholder involvement, rigour <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> development, clarity and presentation, application, and editorial independence. Mean domain scores were calculated according to AGREE instructions. The guidelines presented their scope and purpose well; the mean domain score was 62 %. Their clarity and presentation was fairly good, mean domain score 47 %. The stakeholder involvement’s mean domain score was 33 %. The other domains scored low: applicability domain, 15 %, rigour <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> development, 9 %, and editorial independence, 7 % only. The rigour and reporting <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> development {{seems to be the}} main challenge for future guideline production in FIOH.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A good {{clinical}} guideline for integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine (ITCWM) {{should be}} established by multi-subject specialists, including clinical expert of ITCWM, traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and medical staff from different levels of health care organization, clinical and preclinical medicine researcher, statistician, clinical epidemiologist and economist, medical decision-maker and administrative expert. Establishment <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> should be abided by the following scientific procedure: association of ITCWM (AITCWM) or the branch of AITCWM decides the subject <b>of</b> clinical <b>guideline,</b> set up a team of special subject <b>of</b> clinical <b>guideline</b> (or decided by research project), evaluate literature systematically, prepare a draft manuscript, consult and appraise {{it in the same}} occupation, announce the content in the academic circle, collect feedback opinions and proposals and then make analysis, modify the clinical guideline, publish the clinical guideline, apply the clinical guideline, collect and appraise feedback opinions and proposals, modify and consummate the clinical guideline. In order to supply and consummate original guideline, scientific and renewed evidence should be emphasized on the basis of evidence-based medicine. The author also suggested insistence on the combination of disease and syndrome, syndrome being governed by disease, standardization of syndrome type, establishment of reasonable amount of syndrome types, standard and method of modifying the treatment. The user <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> should pay attention to both the principle and flexibility, and the author stressed that guideline was just a diagnosis and treatment reference to clinician, which should be used flexibly and not be imitated mechanically in practical application. The practicability <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> should be pay attention to so that the clinician can apply and manipulate the guideline easily. Meanwhile, the group <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> establishment has an obligation to train medical staff and to promote the practice <b>of</b> clinical <b>guideline.</b> Only in this way, the authority, standardization and applicability <b>of</b> clinical <b>guideline</b> on ITCWM can be ensured, and then the expected purpose <b>of</b> clinical <b>guideline</b> establishment can be attained...|$|R

40|$|Background: The uptake <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> {{recommendations}} in general practice can potentially {{be improved by}} designing implementation interventions that are tailored to prospectively identify barriers. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding {{the most effective and}} efficient approaches to tailoring. Our study provides an insight into the usefulness of tailored interventions to prospectively identified barriers affecting the uptake <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> recommendations for anxiety and depressive disorders experienced by general practitioners (GPs) in their local context. Methods. A qualitative study was conducted, in which 23 GPs gave informed consent and 14 finally participated. To explore the barriers affecting the uptake <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> recommendations, a face-to-face interview was conducted with each GP to generate a personalised list. In response to this list, interventions were tailored to remove the barriers experienced by the GPs. To examine the perceived usefulness of the tailored interventions, telephone interviews were conducted after one year and coded through thematic coding. The analysis was descriptive in nature. Results: The most frequently perceived barriers were: a lack of knowledge and skills, no agreement on guideline recommendations, negative outcome expectancy, low self-efficacy, no consensus with patients, and a lack of information about treatments provided by mental health professionals, together with waiting lists. The tailored interventions 'peer group supervision' and 'individualised telephone consultations' were perceived as useful by most GPs. Besides the tailored interventions, a perceived benefit of using a self-rating scale, measuring depressive and anxiety symptoms, and the idea of delivering better patient care, were supportive in the uptake <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> recommendations. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that tailoring interventions to prospectively identified barriers, affecting the uptake <b>of</b> <b>guideline</b> recommendations for anxiety and depressive disorders, as perceived by GPs, may enhance the implementation <b>of</b> these <b>guideline</b> recommendations. © 2013 Sinnema et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
