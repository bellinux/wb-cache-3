5|$|Mycena arcangeliana {{mushrooms}} leave a whitish spore print, {{while the}} spores are shaped like apple seeds and amyloid, {{meaning that they}} stain a dark colour in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The basidia are four-spored. They measure from between 7 and 8 micrometres(µm) by 4.5 and 5µm. There are a large number <b>of</b> <b>hyaline</b> cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} the gills) which are club-shaped or ovate. They have thin cell walls, and are covered in grain-like warts. The pleurocystidia (the cystidia on the face of the gill) are similar in appearance. The pileipellis is made up of wart-covered hyphae measuring between 2 and 4.5µm wide and up to 30µm long. The outermost layer of the stem is made up hyphae with short, cylindrical hairs. The hyphae have clamp connections.|$|E

Neither can this fluid be derived from the environment, for the turnover rate of water is orders of magnitude too slow (10). The low dry mass <b>of</b> the <b>hyaline</b> cap fluid, therefore, indicates that it is produced by syneresis accompanying the contraction of a gelated region somewhere within the cell...|$|R

25|$|A growth {{center is}} located in the head of each mandibular condyle before an {{individual}} reaches maturity. This growth center consists <b>of</b> <b>hyaline</b> cartilage underneath the periosteum on the articulating surface of the condyle. This is the last growth center of bone in the body and is multidirectional in its growth capacity, unlike a typical long bone. This area of cartilage within the bone grows in length by appositional growth as the individual grows to maturity. Over time, the cartilage is replaced by bone, using endochondral ossification. This mandibular growth center in the condyle allows the increased length of the mandible needed for the larger permanent teeth, {{as well as for the}} larger brain capacity of the adult. This growth of the mandible also influences the overall shape of the face, and thus is charted and referred to during orthodontic therapy. When an individual reaches full maturity, the growth center of bone within the condyle has disappeared.|$|E
25|$|In early 1963, Jacqueline {{was again}} pregnant, leading her to curtail her {{official}} duties. She {{spent most of}} the summer at a home {{she and her husband had}} rented on Squaw Island, near the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. On August 7, five weeks ahead of her scheduled Caesarean section, she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarean section at nearby Otis Air Force Base. His lungs were not fully developed, and he was transferred from Cape Cod to Boston Children's Hospital where he died <b>of</b> <b>hyaline</b> membrane disease two days after birth. Jacqueline had remained at Otis Air Force Base to recuperate after the Caesarean delivery; her husband went to Boston to be with their infant son, and was present at his death.

500|$|The {{color of}} the spore print is unknown. The spores are {{somewhat}} spindle-shaped, boletoid (long, lean, and fuse-shaped), with a pronounced suprahilar depression (a surface indentation formed where the spore {{was attached to the}} spore-bearing cells, the basidia), and typically measure 9.3–11.3 by 3.9–4.7µm. They are weakly pigmented, and their rough surfaces can be seen under scanning electron microscopy. The spores are inamyloid, meaning they will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia are 26.9–39.3 by 9.0–12.0µm, cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), and have four sterigmata (extensions that attach the spores). The [...] (cystidia on the gill face) are 57.4–92.6 by 9.4–17.4µm, spindle-shaped, moderately frequent, and extend beyond the surface of the hymenium. They have thin, hyaline walls, and are colored the same as the hymenium, without any crystals or encrustations. The [...] (cystidia on the gill edge), which measure 50.6–75.1 by 12.2–16.1µm, are more abundant than the cheilocystidia, but otherwise share the same characteristics.

500|$|Many other {{diseases}} of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. [...] Individuals with pre-renal kidney failure do not have damage to the kidneys, but as in individuals with HRS, have kidney dysfunction due to decreased {{blood flow to the}} kidneys. Also, similarly to HRS, pre-renal kidney failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration. In contrast to HRS, however, pre-renal kidney failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum creatinine and increased excretion of sodium. [...] Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney, and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis, because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure. [...] Because of the damage to the tubules, ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally resorb sodium from the urine. [...] As a result, ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing, as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS; however, this may not always be the case in cirrhotics. [...] Individuals with ATN also may have evidence <b>of</b> <b>hyaline</b> casts or muddy-brown casts in the urine on microscopy, whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of cellular material, as the kidneys have not been directly injured. [...] Some viral infections of the liver, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also lead to inflammation of the glomerulus of the kidney. [...] Other causes of kidney failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity (notably, the antibiotic gentamicin) or contrast nephropathy, caused by intravenous administration of contrast agents used for medical imaging tests.|$|E
2500|$|The pubic {{symphysis}} is a nonsynovial amphiarthrodial joint. The {{name comes}} from the Greek word [...] "symphysis", meaning [...] "growing together". The width of the pubic symphysis at the front is 3–5mm greater than its width at the back. This joint is connected by fibrocartilage and may contain a fluid-filled cavity; the center is avascular, possibly {{due to the nature}} of the compressive forces passing through this joint, which may lead to harmful vascular disease. The ends of both pubic bones are covered by a thin layer <b>of</b> <b>hyaline</b> cartilage attached to the fibrocartilage. The fibrocartilaginous disk is reinforced by a series of ligaments.

60|$|A leaf was {{cut open}} along the midrib, and the glands {{examined}} under a high power. It was then {{placed in a}} few drops of an infusion of raw meat. After 3 hrs. 20 m. there was no change, but when next examined after 23 hrs. 20 m., the outer cells of the glands contained, instead of limpid fluid, spherical masses of a granular substance, showing that matter had been absorbed from the infusion. That these glands secrete a fluid which dissolves or digests animal matter out of the bodies of the creatures which the leaves capture, is also highly probable from the analogy of Dionaea. If we may trust to the same analogy, the concave and inner portions of the two lobes probably close together by a slow movement, as soon as the glands have absorbed a slight amount of [page 326] already soluble animal matter. The included water would thus be pressed out, and the secretion consequently not be too much diluted to act. With respect to the quadrifid processes on the outer parts of the lobes, I was not able to decide whether they had been acted on by the infusion; for the lining of protoplasm was somewhat shrunk before they were immersed. Many of the points on the infolded rims also had their lining of protoplasm similarly shrunk, and contained spherical granules <b>of</b> <b>hyaline</b> matter.|$|E

Two bisected bladders, which had been previously left for 21 hrs. in the solution of gum (one part to 218 of water) without being affected, were irrigated with the solution of carbonate of ammonia; and both had their quadrifids modified in nearly {{the same manner as}} just described,--one after only 9 hrs., and the other after 24 hrs. Two bladders which appeared never to have caught any prey were punctured and placed in the solution; the quadrifids of one were examined after 17 hrs., and found slightly opaque; the quadrifids of the other, examined after 45 hrs., had their primordial utricles more or less shrunk with thickened yellowish specks, like those due to the action of nitrate of ammonia. Several uninjured bladders were left in the same solution, as well as a weaker solution of one part to 1750 of water, or 1 gr. to 4 oz.; and after two days the quadrifids were more or less opaque, with their contents finely granular; but whether the solution had entered by the orifice, or had been absorbed from the outside, I know not.|$|E
40|$|Treatment of {{the eggs}} of the sea urchin with a 1 M {{solution}} of glycerol at fertilization allows the recovery from this solution of the protein released from the cortical granules, including that which would normally give rise to the hyaline layer.

Quantitative measurements on the eggs of two Hawaiian species, Colobocentrotus atratus and Pseudoboletia indiana, which have the widest variation in the gel protein content, demonstrated that a proportionate amount of this material was released at fertilization in these species, which correlates with the thickness <b>of</b> the <b>hyaline</b> layer in the two cases. In addition, the calcium-insoluble fraction of Sakai can be extracted from these eggs after removal <b>of</b> the <b>hyaline</b> protein by glycerol, showing that this is a different material.

60|$|A leaf was {{cut open}} and examined, {{and the outer}} [page 327] cells of the glands were found to contain only limpid fluid. Some of the quadrifids {{included}} a few spherical granules, but several were transparent and empty, and their positions were marked. This leaf was now immersed in a little solution of one part of urea to 146 of water, or three grains to the ounce. After 3 hrs. 40 m. there was no change either in the glands or quadrifids; nor was there any certain change in the glands after 24 hrs.; so that, as far as one trial goes, urea does not act on {{them in the same}} manner as an infusion of raw meat. It was different with the quadrifids; for the lining of protoplasm, instead of presenting a uniform texture, was now slightly shrunk, and exhibited in many places minute, thickened, irregular, yellowish specks and ridges, exactly like those which appear within the quadrifids of Utricularia when treated with this same solution. Moreover, several of the quadrifids, which were before empty, now contained moderately sized or very small, more or less aggregated, globules of yellowish matter, as likewise occurs under the same circumstances with Utricularia. Some of the points on the infolded margins of the lobes were similarly affected; for their lining of protoplasm was a little shrunk and included yellowish specks; and those which were before empty now contained small spheres and irregular masses <b>of</b> <b>hyaline</b> matter, more or less aggregated; so that both the points on the margins and the quadrifids had absorbed matter from the solution in the course of 24 hrs.; but to this subject I shall recur. In another rather old leaf, to which nothing had been given, but which had been kept in foul water, some of the quadrifids contained aggregated translucent globules. These were not acted on by a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water; and this negative result [page 328] agrees with what I have observed under similar circumstances with Utricularia.|$|E
60|$|As to {{the cause}} of that {{extraordinary}} colour in the crow's eyes, one might say that it was merely the reflected red light of the level sun. We are familiar with the effect when polished and wet surfaces, such as glass, stone, and water, shine crimson in the light of a setting sun; but there is also the fact, which is not well known, that the eye may show its own hidden red--the crimson colour which is {{at the back of the}} retina and which is commonly supposed to be seen only with the ophthalmoscope. Nevertheless I find on inquiry among friends and acquaintances that there are instances of persons in which the iris when directly in front of the observer with the light behind him, always looks crimson, and in several of these cases the persons exhibiting this colour, or danger signal, as it may be called, were subject to brain trouble. It is curious to find that the crimson colour or light has also been observed in dogs: one friend has told me of a pet King Charles, a lively good-tempered little dog with brown eyes like any other dog, which yet when they looked up, into yours in a room always shone ruby-red instead <b>of</b> <b>hyaline</b> blue, or green, as is usually the case. From other friends I heard of many other cases: one was of a child, an infant in arms, whose eyes sometimes appeared crimson, another of a cat with yellow eyes which shone crimson-red in certain lights. Of human adults, I heard of two men great in the world of science, both dead now, in whose eyes the red light had been seen just before and during attacks of nervous breakdown. I heard also of four other persons, not distinguished in any way, two of them sisters, who showed the red light in the eyes: all of them suffered, from brain trouble and two of them ended their lives in asylums for the insane.|$|E
