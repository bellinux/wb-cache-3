50|$|<b>Overcranked</b> is an Australian punk, {{rock and}} metal music festival {{presented}} by Rave Magazine. It was first held in 2001. The 2007 edition occurred on 24 March at RNA Showgrounds in Brisbane.|$|R
50|$|The {{opposite}} of fast motion is slow motion. Cinematographers refer to fast motion as undercranking {{since it was}} originally achieved by cranking a handcranked camera slower than normal. <b>Overcranking</b> produces slow motion effects.|$|R
5000|$|For the {{purposes}} of making the above illustration readable a projection speed of 10 frames per second (frame/s) has been selected, in fact film is usually projected at 24 frame/s making the equivalent slow <b>overcranking</b> rare, but available on professional equipment.|$|R
50|$|Electronic {{video cameras}} {{do not have}} {{mechanical}} shutters and allow setting shutter speed directly in time units. Professional video cameras often allow selecting shutter speed in terms of shutter angle instead of time units, especially those {{that are capable of}} <b>overcranking</b> or undercranking.|$|R
50|$|Following {{a couple}} of festival appearances, {{at the end of}} 2004 Astriaal {{announced}} an extended break. The band returned to perform at Brisbane's <b>Overcranked</b> festival in April 2006, and followed up with a high-profile support of Arcturus in early 2007. Bassist Murtach left the band on completion of the tour.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{sustained}} {{activity on}} the live front, including another string of dates in New Zealand with 8 Foot Sativa in April, longtime guitarist Scott Lang left the group in late 2005 for professional reasons, relocating overseas to Hong Kong. Fans were surprised when Frankenbok appeared at Brisbane's <b>Overcranked</b> Festival in early 2006 with Adam B. Metal now occupying the second guitarist slot as well as supplying vocals.|$|R
50|$|Slow motion (commonly {{abbreviated}} as slo-mo or slow-mo) is {{an effect}} in film-making whereby time {{appears to be}} slowed down. It was introduced by George Melies, but then the Austrian priest named August Musger developed it and mmade it more well known.Typically this style is achieved when each film frame is captured at a rate much faster than it will be played back. When replayed at normal speed, time appears to be moving more slowly. A term for creating slow motion film is <b>overcranking</b> which refers to hand cranking an early camera {{at a faster rate}} than normal (i.e. faster than 24 frames per second). Slow motion can also be achieved by playing normally recorded footage at a slower speed. This technique is more often applied to video subjected to instant replay than to film. A third technique that is becoming common using current computer software post-processing (with programs like Twixtor) is to fabricate digitally interpolated frames to smoothly transition between the frames that were actually shot. Motion can be slowed further by combining techniques, interpolating between <b>overcranked</b> frames. The traditional method for achieving super-slow motion is through high-speed photography, a more sophisticated technique that uses specialized equipment to record fast phenomena, usually for scientific applications.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, {{their debut}} album Greetings & Salutations (Special Edition) was re-released on Dark Carnival with an {{additional}} eight bonus tracks recorded at the Bleach Club in Sydney in August 2001. Also around this time, Frankenbok opened for System of a Down, toured with Sydneysiders Psi.Kore, and appeared at the <b>Overcranked</b> Festival in Brisbane, Australia. [...] Despite regular touring and small-scale commercial success, vocalist Adam 'Hutch' Glynn left the band due to a falling out between band members and Glynn in November 2002 with recording time set for their follow-up to Loopholes...|$|R
50|$|With adjustments, {{issues of}} frame lines and {{sprocket}} holes were resolved with each incoming print, but hand cranked film speed {{was also a}} nagging issue. Renovare would capture each frame, but a film could have been undercranked and exposed only for twelve frames per second. Playback on today’s film projectors might require 18 or 24 frame/s. Everything would appear comically fast. The solution was to expose a frame or every other frame twice, thereby making the action appear realistic. The reverse was true as well, with <b>overcranked</b> exposures, and frames {{would have to be}} removed to avoid slow motion films.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second type}} of slow motion is {{achieved}} during post production. This is known as time-stretching or digital slow motion. This type of slow motion is achieved by inserting new frames in between frames that have actually been photographed. The effect is similar to <b>overcranking</b> as the actual motion occurs over a longer time. Since the necessary frames were never photographed, new frames must be fabricated. Sometimes the new frames are simply repeats of the preceding frames but more often they are created by interpolating between frames. (Often this interpolation is effectively a short dissolve between still frames). Many complicated algorithms exist that can track motion between frames and generate intermediate frames that scene. It is similar to half-speed, and is not true slow-motion, but merely longer display of each frame.|$|R
5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or <b>overcranked</b> to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA deep {{understanding}} of the transition between rubber and amorphous state characterized by a glass transition temperature, T-g, is still a source of discussions. In this work, we highlight the role of molecular simulation in revealing explicitly this temperature dependent behavior. By reporting the specific volume, the thermal expansion coefficient and the heat capacity versus the temperature, we actually show that the glass transition domain extends to a greater range of temperature, compared with experiments. This significant enlargement width {{is due to the}} fast cooling rate, and actually explains the difficulty to locate T-g. This result is the manifestation of an <b>overcranking</b> effect used by high-speed cameras to reveal slow-motion. Accordingly, atomistic simulation offers the significant opportunity to show that the transition from the rubber state to the glass phase should be detailed in terms of the degrees of freedom freeze.

500|$|The {{fight between}} Mulder and X was heavily edited by Fox's {{broadcast}} standards department. Despite {{the fact that}} most of the action was done by stunt doubles, Steven Williams was injured during the filming of the fight scene. The opening scene with the restaurant shooting was filmed mostly on two handheld cameras, with director R. W. Goodwin using a variety of short shots and rapid cuts to different perspectives. This was done to create a chaotic scene which would contrast with how the character of Thinnes' character Jeremiah Smith was presented—shots focused on him were filmed using a Steadicam to allow the character to seem [...] "rock steady". The film used was also <b>overcranked,</b> where the frame rate of the recording is much higher than that which will be played back, slowing down the footage when it is played at a normal frame rate. This gave a slow motion effect to Thinnes' movements, in order to aid the [...] "Godlike" [...] impression Goodwin wanted.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the most}} memorable aspects of the show that was {{developed}} during the first season was the transformation sequence that changed Diana Prince into her superheroine alter ego. [...] The sequence in the original specials employed a slow fade between two synchronized shots, both filmed with an <b>overcranked</b> camera to create a slow motion effect. A twirling Diana Prince's hair would fall loose as the shot transitioned to a twirling Wonder Woman holding her Diana clothes, which she would stow nearby in a closet or locker. (How she changes back to Diana is never shown, although presumably she must return to the location to retrieve her clothes.) To ensure both segments transitioned smoothly the camera was locked off (secured in place) while Carter's clothing, make-up, and hair was altered between identities, a process Carter said on a DVD commentary typically took about 45 minutes. The spinning transformation was later incorporated into the comics and into animated appearances such as Justice League Unlimited. (Prior to the series in which Carter starred, the transformation was depicted in the comics by way of Diana spinning her magic lasso around her body, with the lasso changing her clothes, or by simply changing at super-human speed.) ...|$|R
