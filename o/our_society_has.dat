A 1997 study by the Boston Consulting Group showed that participants of the study were most concerned about their privacy on the Internet compared to any other media. However, it is important to recall that these issues are not the only prevalent concerns <b>our</b> <b>society</b> <b>has.</b> Though some may call it a modern-day version of McCarthyism, another prevalent issue also remains members of our own society sending disconcerting emails to one another. It is for this reason in 2001 that for {{one of the}} first times ever the public demonstrated an approval of government intervention in their private lives.|$|E

Yates believed he was approached because the studio saw him fit to handle an [...] "edgy and emotional" [...] film with a [...] "political backstory", which some of his previous television projects including State of Play, Sex Traffic and The Girl in the Café demonstrated. Producer David Heyman supported Yates' comments about the film's political theme, stating that [...] " [...] is a political film, not with a capital P, but it's about teen rebellion and the abuse of power. David has made films in the UK about politics without being heavy handed." [...] On the film's political and social aspects, Emma Watson stated that [...] "somehow it talks about life after 7 July, the way people behave when they’re scared, the way truth is often denied {{and all the things}} <b>our</b> <b>society</b> <b>has</b> to face.

The cat suits that adorn the feline hybrid characters in this genre are firstly illustrating their connection to felines. On the ideological level, the costumes signify the attributes that <b>our</b> <b>society</b> <b>has</b> projected onto cats and that the characters embody." [...] In another post-modern thesis on sadomasochism in cinema Andrea Beckmann wrote, [...] "Cinematic SM is twisted into the non-consenting, violent realm of the unhinged that {{we know it is}} not. Fetishism is used as an excuse for a bit of titillatory semi-nudity, or to identify the villain – the man in black leather.

60|$|Now, I am not unaware how the {{productions}} of the Grub Street brotherhood have of late years fallen under many prejudices, nor {{how it has}} been the perpetual employment of two junior start-up societies to ridicule them and their authors as unworthy their established post in the commonwealth of wit and learning. Their own consciences will easily inform them whom I mean; nor has the world been so negligent a looker-on as not to observe the continual efforts made by the societies of Gresham and of Will's {64}, to edify a name and reputation upon the ruin of ours. And this is yet a more feeling grief to us, upon the regards of tenderness as well as of justice, when we reflect on their proceedings not only as unjust, but as ungrateful, undutiful, and unnatural. For how can it be forgot by the world or themselves, to say nothing of our own records, which are full and clear in the point, that they both are seminaries, not only of our planting, but our watering too. I am informed our two rivals have lately made an offer to enter into the lists with united forces and challenge us to a comparison of books, both as to weight and number. In return to which, with license from our president, I humbly offer two answers. First, we say the proposal is like that which Archimedes made upon a smaller affair {65a}, including an impossibility in the practice; for where can they find scales of capacity enough for the first, or an arithmetician of capacity enough for the second. Secondly, we are ready to accept the challenge, but with this condition, that a third indifferent person be assigned, to whose impartial judgment it shall be left to decide which society each book, treatise, or pamphlet do most properly belong to. This point, God knows, is very far from being fixed at present, for we are ready to produce a catalogue of some thousands which in all common justice ought to be entitled to our fraternity, but by the revolted and newfangled writers most perfidiously ascribed to the others. Upon all which we think it very unbecoming our prudence that the determination should be remitted to the authors themselves, when our adversaries by briguing and caballing have caused so universal a defection from us, that the greatest part of <b>our</b> <b>society</b> <b>has</b> already deserted to them, and our nearest friends begin to stand aloof, as if they were half ashamed to own us.|$|E

However, this model, based on intensive exploitation of natural resources, is now the source of the greatest threats to human health.

Here we examine the implications, for public health action, of adopting such an approach...|$|R
