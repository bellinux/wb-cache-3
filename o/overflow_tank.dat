25|$|Decay heat {{accidents}} are where the heat {{generated by the}} radioactive decay causes harm. In a large nuclear reactor, a {{loss of coolant accident}} can damage the core: for example, at Three Mile Island a recently shutdown (SCRAMed) PWR reactor was left for a length of time without cooling water. As a result, the nuclear fuel was damaged, and the core partially melted. The removal of the decay heat is a significant reactor safety concern, especially shortly after shutdown. Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents. The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, and the heat is often dissipated to an 'ultimate heat sink' which has a large capacity and requires no active power, though this method is typically used after decay heat has reduced to a very small value. The main cause of release of radioactivity in the Three Mile Island accident was a pilot-operated relief valve on the primary loop which stuck in the open position. This caused the <b>overflow</b> <b>tank</b> into which it drained to rupture and release large amounts of radioactive cooling water into the containment building.|$|E

The car was overheating and the <b>overflow</b> <b>tank</b> was venting steam. The car was inspected by the event officials and allowed to go back out. At the end of the driver change the coolant temperature was around 265, and with some hesitation the engine started. The second driver locked up the front wheels going into the corner after the first straight, and ended up stalling the engine. With a coolant temperature around 275 degrees, the engine would not restart. It cranked very slowly although the battery voltage was showing a full charge. After the Endurance course was closed, the now cooled down car was brought back to the paddock where it fired up immediately with no charging of the battery.|$|E

5000|$|Joseph Needham {{speculated that}} the {{introduction}} of the outflow clepsydra to China, perhaps from Mesopotamia, occurred {{as far back as the}} 2nd millennium, during the Shang Dynasty, and at the latest by the 1st millennium. By the beginning of the Han Dynasty, in 202, the outflow clepsydra was gradually replaced by the inflow clepsydra, which featured an indicator rod on a float. To compensate for the falling pressure head in the reservoir, which slowed timekeeping as the vessel filled, Zhang Heng added an extra tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Around 550 AD, Yin Gui was the first in China to write of the overflow or constant-level tank added to the series, which was later described in detail by the inventor Shen Kuo. Around 610, this design was trumped by two Sui Dynasty inventors, Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai, who were the first to create the balance clepsydra, with standard positions for the steelyard balance. Joseph Needham states that: ... balance clepsydra permitted the seasonal adjustment of the pressure head in the compensating tank by having standard positions for the counterweight graduated on the beam, and hence it could control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night. With this arrangement no <b>overflow</b> <b>tank</b> was required, and the two attendants were warned when the clepsydra needed refilling.|$|E
50|$|MIS Endurance Due to the {{problems}} in the VIR Endurance and in testing, a larger battery was added to the car for this event (14 amp-hour), and a second fan was installed on the radiator as well as a duct in front of the radiator. After about 7 laps by the first driver the downshift microswitch got stuck and held the pneumatic actuator in the down-shift position. The transmission ended up in first gear, and would not come out of first because the up-shift solenoid could not overcome the already actuated down-shift solenoid. At the end of the 10th lap, the coolant temperature was around 270F. At the final turn of the final lap, the checkered flag was displayed approximately 1 second before the car reached the official holding the flag (based on video slow-motion). The driver did not see the flag and continued around the course. Based on telemetry data, it is evident that there was a loss of oil pressure by about 90% while the coolant temperature was around 270 during this 11th lap. By the ½ way point of the 11th lap the engine began to misfire badly and the driver decided to pull over. At this point the <b>overflow</b> <b>tank</b> was still steaming. The driver was instructed by track workers to cut the engine, and the car was immediately towed away. After watching the video of the event, it was decided that the team leaders would make a compliant to the event organizers regarding the late flag. The whole situation was explained to one of the main organizers, and he informed them that missed flags occur constantly and they just can’t do anything about it. He went on say that if the driver was not given the 3-minute period stipulated in the rules to restart the engine and continue driving, that {{it may have been a}} mistake on their part, and he would talk to the event captain and see what could be done. After 10 minutes he returned to the paddock and explained that the event captain wanted us to return to the course with our second driver and attempt the second half of the event. He further explained that he and the track workers would later inspect the notes and any video evidence, and only if there was definitive proof that the driver was not offered his 3-minute restart period would they consider the second driver’s laps and give us point for the event. The car was immediately returned and the second driver entered the track. The second driver immediately noticed that the sound of the engine was off, and after the first slow section of the course shifted into 3rd gear for the remained of the first lap. At the start of the second lap, the car was passed, and upon pulling onto the course again the driver noticed an increase in the vibration from the engine. The driver then shifted into 4th gear to further reduce the engine RPM. Before the half-way point of the 2nd lap (right before the back sweeper) a loud bang was heard from the engine, and the car began shaking violently. The driver continued through the back sweeper and then pulled off the side of the course. Before being towed back, the driver was handed a small, oily chain by one of the track workers who believed that it came from our engine (which it did). Upon inspection there was a hole in the front bottom of the engine near the #1 cylinder.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For the {{development}} of real-time control systems of integrated urban wastewater systems (IUWS) fitting a model to measurement data is an important task. Generally, model complexity conflicts with computational demand. The problem increases when multi-criteria optimization is carried out. Therefore, {{in the case of}} IUWS modeling hydrological approaches are case dependant alternatives to full hydrodynamic descriptions. The study presents the results of a unique flow time test in a new IUWS in Luxembourg, a predominantly combined sewer system. During this test dry weather flow (DWF) was stored in several combined sewage <b>overflow</b> <b>tanks</b> (CSOT) for a certain time and discharged to the downstream wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in a particular temporal sequence to mimic combined sewage flow (CSF). Consequently, the analysis of the related inflow measurement at the WWTP allows for explicit flow time identification for each CSOT. For the integrated sewer network a non-linear hydrologic modeling approach is chosen as hydraulic description while pollution load modeling is based on a Lagrange based approach. Results show good matches for both mode...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} pulsatile {{pulmonary}} flow after the modified Fontan procedure was examined {{in a model}} that simulated the right heart. An inlet <b>overflow</b> <b>tank</b> (preload), axial pulsatile pump, Wind-Kessel model (afterload), and an outlet <b>overflow</b> <b>tank</b> were connected in series. The standard conditions were flow 2. 00 l/min with 12 mm Hg preload pressure, 3. 0 Wood units resistance, and an outlet <b>overflow</b> <b>tank</b> pressure at 6 mm Hg. The pump rate was set at 80 beats/min. The simulated pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary flow waves produced by this model closely resembled those obtained from patients who had undergone the modified Fontan procedure. All variables except the preload were fixed and changes in pulmonary flow were examined at preload pressures of 8, 12, 15, and 17 mm Hg. As the peak pulmonary arterial pressure increased so did pulmonary flow, until it was greater than during the non-pulsatile state. Because the afterload of this model was fixed, this result suggests {{that there was a}} concomitant decrease in resistance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel multi-objective evolutionary optimization approach for the active control of intermittent unsatisfactory discharges from combined sewer systems. The procedure proposed considers the unsteady flows {{and water quality}} in the sewers together with the wastewater treatment costs. The distinction between the portion of wastewater that receives full secondary treatment and the overall capacity of the wastewater treatment works (including storm <b>overflow</b> <b>tanks)</b> is addressed. Temporal and spatial variations in the concentrations of the primary contaminants are incorporated also. The formulation is different from previous approaches in the literature in {{that in addition to}} the wastewater treatment cost we consider at once the relative polluting effects of the various primary contaminants in wastewater. This is achieved by incorporating a measure of the overall pollution called the effluent quality index. The differences between two diametrically opposed control objectives are illustrated, i. e. the minimization of the pollution of the receiving water or, alternatively, the minimization of the wastewater treatment cost. Results are included for a realistic interceptor sewer system that show that the combination of a multi-objective genetic algorithm and a stormwater management model is effective.

40|$|Diesel {{fuel oil}} (DFO) spills at fueling {{platforms}} increase railroad operating costs by decreasing the locomotive miles traveled per gallon of DFO dispensed {{and increasing the}} cost of recovering and treating spilled DFO.

Fuel <b>tanks</b> occasionally <b>overflow</b> after the automatic shut-off mechanism on a nozzle is disabled to prevent subsequent inadvertent nozzle shut off. A hydraulic pressure surge analysis of two fueling yards suggests a correlation between the magnitude of these pressure fluctuations {{and the amount of}} DFO lost from fuel <b>tank</b> <b>overflows.</b> For example, at a fueling yard with a history of high DFO spillage, system pressure fluctuations are predicted to be large enough to trigger inadvertent shut off and potential fuel <b>tank</b> <b>overflow</b> following closure of one nozzle.
