25|$|Any {{family of}} sets that {{satisfies}} (2–4) is called a filter (an example: the complements to the finite sets, {{it is called the}} Fréchet filter and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U is called an ultrafilter (because you can add no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an ultrafilter is the {{family of sets}} containing a given element (in <b>our</b> <b>case,</b> say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and if we use it in our construction, we come back to the ordinary real numbers. Any ultrafilter containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, but the proof uses the axiom of choice. The existence of a nontrivial ultrafilter (the ultrafilter lemma) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.|$|E

PRESENTATION OF CASEWe reviewed the records and CT images of five patients with inguinal hernias containing a segment of the ureter. All of <b>our</b> <b>cases,</b> like most reported cases, featured obese adult males. <b>Our</b> <b>cases</b> had different outcomes, ranging from inadvertent injury of the displaced ureter to correction of the anomaly {{at the time of}} hernia repair. DISCUSSIONIn all of <b>our</b> <b>cases,</b> the affected ureter was displaced anteriorly from the psoas muscle by greater than 1 cm {{at the level of the}} L 4 vertebra on abdominal CT. This association has not been previously described. CONCLUSIONPre-operative diagnosis by CT can prevent injury to the ureter.
