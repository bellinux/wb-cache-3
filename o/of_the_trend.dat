5|$|The First Test was a {{continuation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> of English batsmen being largely unable {{to cope with}} Australia's pacemen. Hutton was the only Englishman to pass 50 in the MCC match, and at Trent Bridge only he and Compton managed this feat. Apart from Hardstaff, none of the remaining batsmen passed 25. Wisden's verdict was that England fought back very well, but that avoiding defeat was almost impossible after their poor batting on the first day. Bowes considered the defensive English bowling display worthy of a draw, and blamed the first innings batting for the failure to prevenet defeat. However, he believed the English tactics to be justified {{and should have been}} continued.|$|E
5|$|This form is {{very common}} in castles adapted for guns, found in Egypt, Italy, Scotland, and Spain, and {{elsewhere}} in between. Other types of port, though less common, were horizontal slits– allowing only lateral movement– and large square openings, which allowed greater movement. The use of guns for defence gave rise to artillery castles, {{such as that of}} Château de Ham in France. Defences against guns were not developed until a later stage. Ham is an example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> for new castles to dispense with earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations.|$|E
5|$|John Graham-Gilbert (1794–1866) {{was born}} in Glasgow {{and worked in the}} city from 1834, playing an {{important}} part in the professionalisation of painting there. Other figures to pursue their careers largely in portraiture and based in Glasgow included Daniel Macnee (1806–82). He moved to Edinburgh after his election of President of the Academy in 1876. Other major figures who worked in portraiture included Francis Grant, who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, Robert Scott Lauder (1803–69), William Quiller Orchardson (1832–1910) and John Pettie (1839–93). John Zephaniah Bell (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists of the later nineteenth century. Andrew Geddes (1783–1844) produced some landscapes, but also portraits before he finally moved to London in 1831. David Wilkie (1785–1841) worked mainly in London, and produced the flattering painting of the King George IV in Highland dress commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. He succeeded Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823 and would emerge {{of one of the most}} influential British artists of the century.|$|E

5|$|The {{craft of}} making reborn dolls {{began in the}} United States in the late 1990s. Reborning follows a long {{tradition}} of collectors, artists, and manufacturers restoring and enhancing dolls in order to portray more realism. The internet has allowed doll artists and collectors to create an online society focused on reborn dolls. In 2002, the first reborn was offered on eBay. This has expanded the reborn market allowing artists to open online stores which function figuratively as nurseries. The niche market for the dolls began with doll collectors who admired the superior lifelike accuracy of the doll. The market quickly reached those who wanted to use the doll as an emotional outlet, either to mother or for therapeutic purposes. Mass media coverage has helped to develop the phenomenon in other countries. Reborning enjoys popularity in the United Kingdom and Australia, but has also reached Canada, the rest of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Doll manufacturers have also taken advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> and sell supplies, tools, and accessories catering to reborn followers. This has allowed reborners to invent new techniques causing the dolls to become increasingly realistic over time. Magazines, books, organizations, and conventions dedicated to reborn dolls have been started {{as a result of this}} popularity.|$|E
5|$|From {{the mid-nineteenth}} century {{portrait}} painting declined as an art. This was {{partly due to the}} advent of photography, which could record the human face with greater ease. While grander commissions were still made, the miniature in particular, which had often been in an intimate locket or brooch, was largely replaced. David Octavius Hill (1802–70) originally took an interest in photography as a means of being able to record the figures of Great Disruption of 1843 for a composite painted portrait, but as part of Hill & Adamson {{he was one of the}} founding fathers of art photography. Just as portrait photography inherited many of the conventions of painting, photography also began to influence painting. From the 1840s John Watson Gordon's work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, as can be seen in his full-length portrait of Principal Lee (1847). Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included Francis Grant, who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, Robert Scott Lauder (1803–69), William Quiller Orchardson (1832–1910) and John Pettie (1839–93). John Zephaniah Bell (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists from the later nineteenth century. The most significant grouping in late nineteenth-century Scotland, the Glasgow Boys, mainly focused on landscape. They were influenced by the leading continental artists of the day and broke with Victorian convention. A number of artists identified with the group came to support themselves through portrait painting, including James Guthrie (1859–1930) and Belfast-born John Lavery (1856–1944).|$|E

25|$|Emigration {{from the}} region's {{depressed}} areas to northern Italy {{and the rest}} of Europe was very intense in the years between 1956 and 1971.

25|$|Within {{the school}} {{concerned}} with ideological differences, another theory seeks clarification in externalization of the Spanish case; instead of pointing to unique Spanish character of Carlism, it highlights general European patterns of change. With ultramontanism gaining upper hand over more conciliatory political incarnations of Catholicism after the First Vatican Council, {{and with the}} new approach made popular in the neighboring France by Louis Veuillot, the 1888 schism {{was nothing but a}} local Spanish manifestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trend.</b> Defining the nascent Integrism as religious particularism striving for hegemony, this theory enjoys rather limited popularity.|$|E

We conclude that in the medium-term, even in countries where material concerns strongly affect well-being, social trust is a powerful predictor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> SWB. However, in the short run the relationship between social trust and SWB does not hold and GDP stands out as the only significant correlate of SWB...|$|R

25|$|According to the Russian {{demographic}} publication Demoscope, {{the rising}} male death rate was a long-term trend from 1960 to 2005. The only significant reversion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> {{was caused by}} Mikhail Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign, but its effect was only temporary. According to the publication, the sharp rise of death rates in the early 1990s {{was caused by the}} exhaustion of the effect of the anti-alcohol campaign, while the market reforms were only of secondary importance. The authors also claimed the Lancet's study is flawed because it used the 1985 death rate as the base, while that was in fact the very maximum of the effect of the anti-alcohol campaign.|$|E
25|$|Lowell {{immediately}} embarked upon {{a series}} of reforms that were both academic and social in nature. Under his predecessor, Charles W.

That was a logical extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> in U.S. education that had modeled the university on the German system, including the German principle of student freedom in choosing courses. So dominant was Harvard's role in American education that all large American colleges and universities had adopted the elective system by 1904. It appealed to all student types, those intellectually curious and energetic {{as well as the}} lazy without intellectual ambition.|$|E

25|$|American Gothic is a {{painting}} by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a pitchfork-holding farmer and a younger woman {{in front of a}} house of Carpenter Gothic style, {{it is one of the}} most familiar images in 20th-century American art. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting, like Gertrude Stein and Christopher Morley, they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of Sherwood Anderson's 1919 Winesburg, Ohio, Sinclair Lewis' 1920 Main Street, and Carl Van Vechten's The Tattooed Countess in literature.

25|$|Arnold was {{an outspoken}} critic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> towards high levels of {{abstraction}} in mathematics {{during the middle of}} the last century. He had very strong opinions on how this approach—which was most popularly implemented by the Bourbaki school in France—initially had a negative impact on French mathematical education, and then later on that of other countries as well. Arnold was very interested in the history of mathematics. In an interview, he said he had learned much of what he knew about mathematics through the study of Felix Klein's book Development of Mathematics in the 19th Century —a book he often recommended to his students. He liked to study the classics, most notably the works of Huygens, Newton and Poincaré, and many times he reported to have found in their works ideas that had not been explored yet.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} of 1828 {{was a significant}} benchmark, marking the climax <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> toward broader voter eligibility and participation. Vermont had universal male suffrage since its entry into the Union, and Tennessee permitted suffrage {{for the vast majority}} of taxpayers. New Jersey, Maryland, and South Carolina all abolished property and tax-paying requirements between 1807 and 1810. States entering the Union after 1815 either had universal white male suffrage or a low taxpaying requirement. From 1815 to 1821, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York abolished all property requirements. In 1824, members of the Electoral College were still selected by six state legislatures. By 1828, presidential electors were chosen by popular vote in every state but Delaware and South Carolina. Nothing dramatized this democratic sentiment more than the {{election of}} Andrew Jackson. In addition, the 1828 election marked the decisive emergence of the West as a major political bloc and an end to the dominance of the original 13 states on national affairs.|$|E
