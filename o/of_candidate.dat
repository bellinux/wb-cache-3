In the wake of its success, Jaojoby performed at a political rally to an audience of 50,000 partisans <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> Marc Ravalomanana less than a month before the divisive 2001 presidential elections that nearly resulted in the secession of the island's coastal provinces. Jaojoby's 2004 follow-up album Malagasy, which {{was recorded}} in semi-live conditions on the island of Réunion in a small venue before an audience of the artist's friends, featured lyrics that sought to promote optimism and national reconciliation; the artist announced that he would not involve himself in national politics in the future. The same year he toured extensively in France, the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Jackson was speculated as a {{potential}} candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004, but declined to run and instead became one of Barack Obama's early supporters. He endorsed Howard Dean for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, joining Al Gore in saying Dean was the most likely candidate in the primary to beat Bush. The endorsement was a bitter blow to the hopes <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> Al Sharpton, who had hoped for endorsements from both Jackson and his father.|$|E
5|$|John Adams {{was running}} {{this time with}} Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina (the elder brother <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> Thomas Pinckney from the 1796 election). Hamilton now toured New England, again urging {{northern}} electors to hold firm for Pinckney in the renewed hope of making Pinckney president; and he again intrigued in South Carolina. Hamilton's ideas involved coaxing middle-state Federalists to assert their non-support for Adams {{if there was no}} support for Pinckney and writing to more of the modest supports of Adams concerning his supposed misconduct while president. Hamilton expected to see southern states such as the Carolinas cast their votes for Pinckney and Jefferson, and would result in the former being ahead of both Adams and Jefferson.|$|E

5|$|The M249 {{light machine}} gun (LMG), {{formerly}} designated the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) and formally written as Light Machine Gun, 5.56mm, M249, is the American adaptation of the Belgian FN Minimi, a {{light machine gun}} manufactured by the Belgian company FN Herstal (FN). The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC in South Carolina and is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective of a number <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> weapons to address the lack of automatic firepower in small units. The M249 provides infantry squads with {{the high rate of}} fire of a machine gun combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle.|$|E
5|$|The last {{experimental}} {{flight was}} flown in 1971, {{due to a}} lack <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> storms and a changeover in NOAA's fleet. More than a decade after the last modification experiment, Project Stormfury was officially canceled. Although a failure in its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes, Project Stormfury was not without merit. The observational data and storm lifecycle research generated by Stormfury helped improve meteorologists' ability to forecast the movement and intensity of future hurricanes.|$|E

At the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Stanislaw Ulam gave one of his students, Joan Hinton, an exam early, so she could leave to do war work. A few weeks later, Ulam received a letter from Hans Bethe, inviting him to join the project. Conant personally persuaded Kistiakowsky to join the project.|$|E
