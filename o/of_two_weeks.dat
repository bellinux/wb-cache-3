5|$|After {{arriving}} off Trondheim, Admiral Hipper successfully passed {{herself off}} as a British warship long enough to steam past the Norwegian coastal artillery batteries. The ship entered the harbor and docked shortly before 05:30 to debark the mountain troops. After the ground troops seized control of the coastal batteries, the ship left Trondheim, bound for Germany. She was escorted by Friedrich Eckoldt; she reached Wilhelmshaven on 12 April, and went into drydock. The dockyard workers discovered the ship had been damaged more severely by the collision with Glowworm than had previously been thought. Nevertheless, repairs were completed in the span <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this defeat, and with rumours circulating in Constantinople of his death, Theophilos's position was precarious. He abandoned the campaign and withdrew to Dorylaion, whence he soon departed for the imperial capital. Ancyra itself was left abandoned, and plundered by the Arab army on 27 July. Then the united Abbasid army marched unopposed to Amorion, which fell after a siege <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> Out of its entire population of some 70,000, only about half survived the brutal sack, to be sold as slaves. The fall {{of the city was}} one of the heaviest blows Byzantium suffered in the entire 9th century, both in material and symbolic terms. Fortunately for the Empire, news of a rebellion in the Caliphate forced al-Mu'tasim to withdraw soon after.|$|E

5|$|The 1954 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season resulted in over $750million in damage, {{the most of}} any season at the time. The season officially began on June15, and nine days later the first named storm developed. Hurricane Alice developed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved inland along the Rio Grande, producing significant precipitation and record flooding that killed 55people. Activity was slow until late August; only Barbara, a minimal tropical storm, developed in July. In the span <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> hurricanes Carol and Edna followed similar paths before both striking New England as major hurricanes. The latter became the costliest hurricane in Maine's history.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, there was once again intense media {{speculation}} about the Spaniard's future, and in June 2010, a €35million bid from Barcelona was rejected. The 2010–11 season {{turned out to be an}} extremely competitive one in the Premier League; even though Arsenal had lost five games before mid-season, they were jostling for pole position with Manchester United and Manchester City. Going into late February, Arsenal were still in contention for the quadruple, but within a span <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> they lost in the League Cup final, were eliminated by Barcelona in the Round of 16 of the Champions League, and defeated in the FA Cup quarter-final. Although Fàbregas did not play in the League Cup Final, it was his misplaced backheel pass during the second leg of the Champions League game against Barcelona that allowed them to level the aggregate score. Arsenal remained in contention for the league title until a series of draws in the final third of the season caused them to fall too far behind league leaders Manchester United; they ended the season fourth. The following season was once again marked by uncertainty. Barcelona made several bids for Fàbregas, while Nasri, Arsenal's star performer the previous campaign, was courted by Manchester City.|$|E

5|$|In early March, No. 6 Commando {{moved with}} the rest of the 1st Commando Brigade to Venray where they carried out rehearsals for Operation Plunder, the {{crossing}} of the Rhine. Over the course <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> training was undertaken at a creek near Wansum and on 23 March 1945 the assault took place, with the objective being the capture of the town of Wesel. No. 6 Commando went across in the second wave on board storm-boats crewed by engineers. They came under fire almost immediately and as a result of this, and several mechanical failures, a number of boats were sunk before they reached the landing site at Grav Islet, where the lead unit, No. 46 (Royal Marine) Commando had established a bridgehead. Ultimately the majority of the commandos made it to the form up point and No. 6 Commando passed through the marines' positions to lead the advance into the town from the north-east, marking the route as they went with white tape. Over the course of the next two days the commandos took control of the town and repelled a number of German counterattacks, before Wesel finally fell late on 25 March.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of their best league finish since 1997–98, Benfica negotiated a one-year extension to Camacho's contract, which had been set to expire on 30 June. As a condition to agreeing to stay, he wanted several problems related to the technical staff, training fields and signings to be solved. On 23 June, Camacho agreed to remain as manager, with Pepe Carcelén and Álvaro Magalhães assisting him. In his presentation, he confessed that the club's limited finances would {{make it harder to}} sign players; he also said that Benfica would give their best but did not expect to dethrone Porto. Benfica inquired after Helton, and Ricardo to compete with José Moreira for the goalkeeper position. Over the course <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> the club negotiated unsuccessfully with the latter and ultimately chose to stay with Moreira. The club also looked into strengthen their options at centre and at left-back, negotiating unsuccessfully with Ânderson Polga, Atouba and Júnior. Despite these failed negotiations, Benfica added Luisão, and re-signed Geovanni; both would be regular starters throughout the season.|$|E

5|$|Filming for The Proposal {{initiated}} in April 2008 in Rockport, Massachusetts. In the oncoming days leading to production, {{areas of the}} town were temporarily remodeled to represent Sitka, Alaska, the setting {{of most of the}} film. Principal photography officially began on April 9 at Bearskin Neck, where it continued over a period of 24 hours. Filming continued at the Motif Number One building on Bradley Wharf (April 14–16), the Haskins Building (April 15–18), and the central business district of Rockport (April 17). Principal photography relocated to Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts on April 22, where it resumed over an approximate period <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> In response, city officials accommodated the producers by renting out all publicly owned parking lots. Filming for The Proposal was shortly delayed after Bullock and her husband were involved in a car accident. The wedding scene was filmed in a three-story twentieth century Victorian home; photography took place at the residence for three weeks. In an interview with the New York Times, the owners of the home stated that Nelson Coates knocked on their door asking for leaves. Initially, the owners directed Coates to other residences in the area; however, they eventually gave the film's producer a tour of the house. Production occurred {{on the first floor of}} the home. Outside of the Cape Ann area, filming took place in Boston, Massachusetts at the State Street Bank Building and in Lower Manhattan in New York City. The Proposal contained 350 special effect shots, and some parts were edited using computer-generated imagery. The score to The Proposal was composed by Aaron Zigman, who recorded his score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage.|$|E
