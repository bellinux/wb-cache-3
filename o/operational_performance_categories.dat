Other than that, not many researchers do the research about the effect of TQM practises on <b>operational</b> <b>performance.</b> So the aims of this research are to identify the levels of TQM practises (leadership, customer focus, management of people, process improvement, strategic planning and use of information and analysis) for <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> and to determine the effect of TQM practises on <b>operational</b> <b>performance.</b> The indicators of <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> are productivity, quality and waste level. The collected data was analysed by using descriptive statistic, reliability, normality, Pearson Correlation, single mean t-test and regression analysis. As a result, only strategic planning and process improvement practises positively contribute to <b>operational</b> <b>performance.</b> For future researcher, they should do more research about <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> like increase the numbers of indicators for <b>operational</b> <b>performance.</b> Therefore, they can give more comprehensive understanding to colleagues and students about <b>operational</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} carried out to empirically examine {{managerial}} perceptions {{on the relationship between}} supply chain collaboration practice and <b>operational</b> <b>performance.</b> The framework suggests that collaborative practice is characterised by three distinct factors: (1) decision synchronisation, (2) information sharing, and (3) incentive alignment, which enable the chain members to effectively match supply with customer demand. An important {{question is whether or not}} collaborative practice leads to better <b>operational</b> <b>performance.</b> A survey research was employed to assess the relationship between collaborative practice and <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> of New Zealand companies. The survey results show significant positive impacts of key factors of collaborative practice on <b>operational</b> <b>performance.</b> The findings suggest that information sharing, decision synchronisation, and incentive alignment are important determinants of <b>operational</b> <b>performance.</b> This study demonstrates that the chain members need to understand the role of different key factors of collaborative practice that can be redesigned to leverage <b>operational</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R

They have compared electricity-specialized firms with diversified utility firms in their financial performance and corporate value. A problem of their study {{is that it has}} not empirically measured the <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> of the electric utility firms. As an extension of the preceding study, this research investigates the <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> of 104 US electric utility firms (1990 - 2004) by fully utilizing DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis). This study finds the three new policy implications. First, the synergy effect has not existed in the <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> of diversified utility firms before and after the deregulation on the US electricity markets. Thus, core business concentration is more effective for electric utility firms than corporate diversification to enhance their <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> under the current US deregulation policy. Second, the <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> has had an increasing trend until 1996 and a decreasing trend after 1996. Thus, the US deregulation policy has been influential on their <b>operational</b> <b>performance.</b> Third, the enhancement in <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> of electric utility firms has improved their financial performance. The improvement in financial performance has increased their corporate value. Thus, this study finds the business causality among <b>operational</b> <b>performance,</b> financial performance and corporate value in the US electric utility industry.

We first conceptualize the relationship between customer knowledge and <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> and delineate their attributes based on a review of the pertinent literature.

40|$|MSc (Enginnering), Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentIn {{recent years}} {{companies}} have made {{increased use of}} Lean Manufacturing audits to measure the degree of Lean Manufacturing implementation within their organizations. Thereafter, a gap analysis highlights areas for improvement, which leads to increased <b>Operational</b> <b>Performance.</b> This approach may be flawed. The audit may measure Lean Manufacturing characteristics that are not beneficial or the Lean Manufacturing audit may be inaccurate due to auditor bias or inadequate scope. The result is frustration {{and a lack of}} belief in the effectiveness of Lean Manufacturing as a competitive strategy. This study tests the hypothesis that “Lean Manufacturing audits drive improvements in <b>Operational</b> <b>Performance.</b> ” A sample company comprising sixty four organizations operating in a job shop and Batch operations management environment is used as a case study. The organizations manufacture and service high value added products for heavy industry. The Lean Manufacturing audit developed to assess the effectiveness of Lean Manufacturing audits in driving <b>Operational</b> <b>Performance</b> uses Lean Manufacturing characteristics commonly used in previous research. These characteristics include policy deployment, standardized work, visual management and housekeeping, quick changeover techniques, total preventative maintenance, continuous improvement, error proofing, cultural awareness, material control and level production. Commonly used <b>Operational</b> <b>Performance</b> measures such as On-Time-Delivery, Inventory turns and Direct Labour Utilization are used to assess <b>Operational</b> <b>Performance.</b> A range of independent auditors were used to gather data on the extent of implementation of Lean Manufacturing and <b>Operational</b> <b>Performance</b> measures. Structural Equation Modelling is used to relate the results of the Lean Manufacturing audits to <b>Operational</b> <b>Performance.</b> This is the first known paper to use Structural Equation Modelling in measuring the extent of implementation of Lean Manufacturing to <b>Operational</b> <b>Performance.</b> Lean Manufacturing audit results have a significant correlation to <b>Operational</b> <b>Performance</b> but {{with a high degree of}} variation in <b>Operational</b> <b>Performance</b> not accounted for by the results of the Lean Manufacturing audit. This variation is caused by the inadequate scope of the audit relative to <b>Operational</b> <b>Performance</b> measures as well as auditor bias.

We propose a moderated mediation model to investigate the impacts of servitisation on the mechanisms through which social capital with suppliers improves <b>operational</b> <b>performance.</b> The hypotheses are empirically tested using structural equation modelling and data collected from 276 manufacturing firms in China. The results show that social capital improves <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> both directly and indirectly through knowledge management, and the relationships are influenced by servitisation.

Customer needs are not only dynamic but also heterogeneous hence a firm must find ways to provide goods that match {{the needs of a}} target market at a given time. In order to survive, manufacturing firms need to build mass customization capabilities that will enable them to meet dynamic and diverse customer needs for a particular market. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the influence of mass customization capabilities on <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> of multinational manufacturing firms in Kenya. The specific objectives included: to examine the extent of adoption of mass customization capabilities by multinational manufacturing firms in Kenya, to assess the influence of solution space development on <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> of multinational manufacturing firms in Kenya, to establish the influence of robust process design on <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> of multinational manufacturing firms in Kenya and to assess the influence of customer choice navigation on <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> of multinational manufacturing firms in Kenya. Data was collected by use of questionnaires from the target population of 93 multinational manufacturing firms in Kenya. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and multiple correlation analysis were used to analyze the data. Results showed that solution space development was the most widely adopted mass customization capability followed by robust process design then customer choice navigation as evidenced by their overall mean scores.
