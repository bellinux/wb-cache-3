50|$|Both the <b>overflow</b> <b>stream</b> and the {{underflow}} stream from a {{lamella clarifier}} will often require post-treatment. The underflow stream is often put through a dewatering process {{such as a}} thickener or a belt press filter to increase the density of slurry. This is an important post-treatment as the underflow slurry is often not able to be recycled back into the process. In such a case it often needs to be transported to a disposal plant, {{and the cost of}} this transport depends on the volume and weight of the slurry. Hence an efficient dewatering process can result in a substantial cost saving. Where the slurry can be recycled through the process it often needs to be dried, and dewatering again is an important step in this process.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the fluid}} flow in alumina {{precipitators}} with draft tube circulators has been investigated. These precipitators are operated with a quiescent zone {{at the surface}} whereby settling of solids achieves partial clarification of the <b>overflow</b> <b>stream.</b> However, plant operating experience has shown {{that there is a}} difference in solids concentration at the overflow depending on the tank design. To investigate the reasons for this variation, CFD modelling has been carried out for tanks of the same diameter but differing aspect ratios. Initially, steady-state simulations were carried out, which indicated the presence of a recirculating vortex in {{the lower part of the}} annulus. Turbulence intensity in the vicinity of this vortex, as predicted from the k-epsilon model, was high, suggesting that the flow pattern might in fact be unsteady. Therefore, for further insight, transient large eddy simulations were carried out. These showed similar flow structures but a flow pattern with large time variations. It is thought that intermittent surges from the recirculating vortex can transport solids into the clarifying layer. Since the vortex is closer to the surface in the shorter tank, average solids concentration reporting to the overflow launder is higher...|$|E
40|$|Results from spectroscopic {{observations}} of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected {{for the first time}} in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~ 500 - 600 km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from velocities of ~ 500 km/s to ~ 1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence for <b>overflow</b> <b>stream</b> of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed, confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the accretion curtain model.

40|$|We present optical {{spectroscopy}} of EX Hya {{during its}} 1991 outburst. This outburst is characterised by strong irradiation {{of the front}} face of the secondary star by the white dwarf, an overflowing stream which is seen strongly in HeII and by {{a dip in the}} light curves, which extends from 0. 1 - 0. 6 in the binary and spin phases. Strong irradiation of the accretion curtain and that of the inner regions of the disc led to strong emission of HeII and to the suppression of the Hg and Hb emission. Disc overflow was observed in quiescence in earlier studies, where the <b>overflow</b> <b>stream</b> material was modulated at high velocities close to 1000 km/s. In outburst, the overflowing material is modulated at even higher velocities (~ 1500 km/s). These are streaming velocities down the field lines close to the white dwarf. Evidence for material collecting near {{the outer edge of the}} disc and corotating with the accretion curtain was observed. In decline, this material and the accretion curtain obscured almost all the emission near binary phase 0. 4, causing a dip. The dip minimum nearly corresponds with spin pulse minimum. This has provided additional evidence for an extended accretion curtain, and for the corotation of material with the accretion curtain at the outer edge of the disc. From these observations we suggest that a mechanism similar to that of Spruit & Taam, where outbursts result due to the storage and release of matter outside the magnetosphere, triggers the outbursts of EX Hya. This is followed by the irradiation of the secondary star due to accretion induced radiation. Comment: 12 pages, 14 figures, 1 table. Figures 6, 7, 8 and 11 at low resolution.
