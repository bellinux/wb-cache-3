The present paper reviews available data on massive hydriding of zirconium claddings covering <b>out-of-pile</b> studies and in-pile tests in research reactors. Analyses of these experimental data give evidence that threshold conditions leading to the onset of massive hydriding are drastically changed under irradiation. The changes are caused mainly by irradiation damage of oxygen sublattice in ZrO 2 by fission fragments leaving the periphery of fuel pellets. The tests in research reactors provide a basis to develop a parametric dependency which relates the threshold of massive hydriding to composition of steam-hydrogen mixture, irradiation dose rate and temperature.

To reduce interaction layer (IL) growth, {{a small amount of}} Si is added to the Al. As a result, IL growth is affected by the Si content in the Al matrix. In order to predict IL growth during fabrication and irradiation, empirical models were developed. For IL growth prediction during fabrication and any follow-on heating process before irradiation, <b>out-of-pile</b> heating test data were used to develop kinetic correlations. Two <b>out-of-pile</b> correlations, one for the pure Al matrix and the other for the Al matrix with Si addition, respectively, were developed, which are Arrhenius equations that include temperature and time.

40|$|Cladding {{failure is}} one of the major {{considerations}} in analysis of fuel-pin behavior during hypothetical accident transients since time, location, and nature of failure govern the early post-failure material motion and reactivity feedback. <b>Out-of-pile</b> thermal transient tests of both irradiated and unirradiated fast-reactor cladding show that local plastic instability, or bulging, often precedes rupture and that the extent of local instability limits the initial rip length. To investigate the details of bulge formation and growth, a perturbation analysis of the equations governing large deformation of a cylindrical shell has been developed, resulting in a set of linear differential equations for the bulge geometry. These equations have been solved along with appropriate constitutive equations and various constraints on the ends of the cladding. Sources for bulge formation that have been considered include initial geometric imperfections and thermal perturbations due to either eccentric fuel pellets or non-symmetric cooling. Of these, only the first is relevant to <b>out-of-pile</b> burst tests.

Commercial MOX fuel has been successfully used in overseas reactors for many years; however, weapons-derived test fuel contains small amounts of gallium (about 2 parts per million). A concern exists that the gallium may migrate out of the fuel and into the clad, inducing embrittlement. For preliminary <b>out-of-pile</b> experiments, Wilson (1997) states that intermetallic compound formation is the principal interaction mechanism between zircaloy cladding and gallium.

40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{is a key}} {{property of}} interest for both nuclear fuel and structural materials, and must be known for proper design, test, and application of new fuels and structural materials in nuclear reactors. Thermal conductivity is highly dependent on the physical structure, chemical composition, {{and the state of}} the material. Typically, thermal conductivity changes that occur during irradiation are measured <b>out-of-pile</b> by Post Irradiated Examination (PIE) using a “cook and look” approach in hot-cells. Repeatedly removing samples from a test reactor to make <b>out-of-pile</b> measurements is expensive, has the potential to disturb phenomena of interest, and only provides understanding of the sample's end state at the time each measurement is made.

Experimental findings of the INL/USU steady state method examinations help to better understand limitations and benefits of two-thermocouple methods, where laboratory results can be extrapolated to in-pile applications. Additionally, results from the transient method offer the immediate potential for in-pile application, as the method reduces the impact on the sample from only a small centerline sensor, measurement times (e. g., only minutes for complete transient tests compared to hours or days for steady state tests), and uncertainties from estimating difficult parameters such as, in-pile fuel to cladding contact resistance needed for two-thermocouple approaches...|$|E
