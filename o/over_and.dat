2500|$|If a team loses {{resource}} {{in the middle}} of its innings (right hand image below), then the resource that was available to that team is found by taking the resources it had at the start, and subtracting the resources remaining at the point the innings was interrupted (to give the resources used in the first period of the innings), then adding on the resource remaining at the restart. For example, if a team starts with 50 <b>overs</b> <b>and</b> 10 wickets (100% of its resources), but is interrupted when it still has 40 <b>overs</b> <b>and</b> 8 wickets remaining (77.8% of its resources), and restarted when it has 20 <b>overs</b> <b>and</b> 8 wickets remaining (52.4% of its resources), then the resources it actually used is 100% [...] 77.8% + 52.4% = 74.6%. Another way of looking at this is to say it lost the resources available between 40 <b>overs</b> <b>and</b> 8 wickets (77.8%) <b>and</b> 20 <b>overs</b> <b>and</b> 8 wickets (52.4%), i.e. 77.8% [...] 52.4% = 25.4%, so its total resource available was 100% [...] 25.4% = 74.6%.|$|R
