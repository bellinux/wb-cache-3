5|$|The {{continuing}} {{expansion of}} commercial fisheries {{into the deep}} sea has raised concerns about the vulnerability of this and other deepwater shark species to overfishing, as these sharks have slow growth and reproductive rates.

In the early 1980s, the fishing fleet was enlarged with the addition of industrial vessels equipped with demersal gillnets, resulting in a fishery peak in 1984 of 937 tons landed. After 1991, kitefin shark catches declined precipitously to under 15 tons annually which, along with a drop in the global price <b>of</b> <b>liver</b> oil, led to the fishery becoming unprofitable {{by the end of the}} decade.

5|$|Each monomer of the serpin {{aggregate}} {{exists in}} the inactive, relaxed conformation (with the RCL inserted into the A-sheet). The polymers are therefore hyperstable to temperature and unable to inhibit proteases. Serpinopathies therefore cause pathologies similarly to other proteopathies (e.g. prion diseases) via two main mechanisms. First, the lack of active serpin results in uncontrolled protease activity and tissue destruction. Second, the hyperstable polymers themselves clog up the endoplasmic reticulum of cells that synthesize serpins, eventually resulting in cell death and tissue damage. In the case of antitrypsin deficiency, antitrypsin polymers cause the death <b>of</b> <b>liver</b> cells, sometimes resulting in liver damage and cirrhosis. Within the cell, serpin polymers are slowly removed via degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, {{the details of how}} serpin polymers cause cell death remains to be fully understood.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo obtain {{information}} about the basic biliary anatomy <b>of</b> <b>livers</b> with right-sided ligamentum teres (RSLT). Summary of background dataRSLT is a relatively rare anomaly with a reported incidence of 0. 2 – 1. 2 %. Although the portal/hepatic venous and arterial anatomy <b>of</b> <b>livers</b> with RSLT has already been established, the biliary architecture <b>of</b> such <b>livers</b> remains unclear. MethodsRSLT was detected in 48 patients during 12, 071 consecutive image readings (0. 4 %). Of these patients, the cholangiograms of 46 patients were analyzed, and their intrahepatic biliary tree confluence patterns were classified. ResultsThe following four unique biliary confluence patterns were identified in livers with RSLT: the symmetrical type (23 / 46), independent right lateral type (13 / 46), total left type (6 / 46), and total right type (1 / 46). Analyses of the portal and arterial branching patterns <b>of</b> these <b>livers</b> showed {{that there were no}} correlations between their biliary confluence patterns and their portal or arterial ramification patterns. ConclusionThe basic biliary architecture <b>of</b> <b>livers</b> with RSLT was clarified. As the RSLT patients' anomalous biliary confluences differed from those seen in normal livers and were difficult to predict, preoperative cholangiography should be performed prior to complex hepatobiliary surgery involving livers with RSLT to ensure patient safety...|$|R
