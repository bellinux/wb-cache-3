5|$|Cavaliers can {{be subject}} to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This {{condition}} is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development <b>of</b> <b>arthritis</b> and lameness in the limb.|$|E

5|$|The {{triggers}} for precipitation of {{uric acid}} {{are not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes <b>of</b> <b>arthritis</b> include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting allopurinol. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E

In the last decade there has been significant progress in {{the treatment}} <b>of</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> which is the main topic of this dissertation. Major treatment advances have been based around {{the introduction of new}} drugs, including synthetic disease modifiying drugs, but primarily biological drugs (inhibitor). Diagnostic techniques for rheumatoid arthritis have also improved significantly, becoming more accurate, especially in the early stages, enabling earlier treatment and better outcomes. In particular {{a detailed description of the}} negative prognostic indicators for the destructive development <b>of</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> together with improved evaluation <b>of</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> activity, have been the basis for the development of a new algorithm for the treatment <b>of</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis.</b> The complex therapy <b>of</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> is increasingly sophisticated, incorporating both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment methods [...] ...|$|R
