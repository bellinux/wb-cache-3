5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim authority as the court <b>of</b> <b>last</b> resort in the state; during {{what became known as the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was a politically tumultuous time.|$|E

5|$|After Governor Adair's term {{expired in}} 1825, he was succeeded by another Relief Party member, General Joseph Desha. Desha and Sharp had been colleagues in Congress, and Desha re-appointed Sharp as {{attorney}} general. The Relief faction {{in the legislature}} passed several measures favorable to debtors, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck them down as unconstitutional. Unable to muster the votes to remove the hostile justices on the Court of Appeals, Relief partisans in the General Assembly passed legislation to abolish the entire court and create a new one, which Governor Desha promptly stocked with sympathetic judges. For a time, two courts claimed authority as Kentucky's court <b>of</b> <b>last</b> resort; this period {{was referred to as}} the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E
5|$|Armenian {{geographic}} {{names were}} first changed under {{the reign of}} Sultan Abdulhamit II. In 1880, the word Armenia was banned from use in the press, schoolbooks, and governmental establishments, to be replaced with words like Anatolia or Kurdistan. Armenian name changing continued under the early Republican era up until the 21st century. It included the Turkification <b>of</b> <b>last</b> names, change of animal names, change {{of the names of}} Armenian historical figures (i.e. the name of the prominent Balyan family was concealed under the identity of a superficial Italian family called Baliani), and the change and distortion of Armenian historical events.|$|E
5|$|As a consequence, investable funds became {{increasingly}} concentrated {{in a single}} institution, the Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), creating a financial system vulnerable to rent-seeking. Rediscounting and non-performing loans grew steadily at the BNA after 1914, polluting its balance sheet. This corrosion of balance sheets {{was a result of}} crony loans to the other banks and the private sector. In its rediscounting actions the BNA was not engaged in pure lender <b>of</b> <b>last</b> resort actions, following Bagehot's principle of lending freely at a penalty rate. Instead, the state bank allowed the private banks to shed their risks, with bad paper used as security, and lent them cash at 4.5%, below the rate the BNA offered its customers on time deposits.|$|E

5|$|Barry Took, who had {{produced}} {{a series of}} ultimately unsuccessful documentaries for the BBC about working men's clubs, was partially responsible for the choice of location for the exterior shots. The programme which drew the highest ratings of the series focused on Burnlee Working Men's Club, a club in the small West Yorkshire town of Holmfirth and Took saw Holmfirth's potential as the backdrop of a television show. Took's idea was passed to James Gilbert and Roy Clarke via Duncan Wood, who {{was at that time}} filming Comedy Playhouse. Gilbert and Clarke then travelled to Holmfirth and decided to use it as the setting for the pilot <b>of</b> <b>Last</b> of the Summer Wine.|$|E

5|$|Following these decisions, the General Assembly {{attempted}} {{to remove all}} three justices from their positions, but lacked the two-thirds majority required for impeachment. The Assembly then {{attempted to}} abolish the Court of Appeals and create a new one, beginning the Old Court-New Court controversy. The members of the existing court – Owsley, John Boyle, and Benjamin Mills – continued functioning in that role, while a new court of four pro-relief justices was organized by the legislature. For a time, both courts {{claimed to be the}} court <b>of</b> <b>last</b> resort in Kentucky, but by 1826, supporters of the Old Court won control of the legislature and abolished the New Court.|$|E
