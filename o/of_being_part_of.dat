5|$|The {{issue of}} male over-representation {{in terms of}} total number of sports and athletes is structural. In the United Kingdom, for example, more male athletes than female ones receive {{financial}} support. Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution by claiming {{that there are more}} opportunities for men to win at the highest level than there are for women. The importance <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball, and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion. This included additional media coverage, especially during Olympic years. Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females.|$|E
5|$|Built {{during the}} American War of Independence {{she spent the}} last three years of the war off the American coast, and saw action at the Battle of Cape Henry and at the Battle of the Chesapeake. The years of peace were spent either in the Caribbean or off Nova Scotia, before the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolutionary Wars saw her commissioned for service in the Leeward Islands and off the British coast. It was while serving in British waters that she became caught up in the mutiny at the Nore. As one of only two two-decker ships to remain in action during the mutiny she had to maintain the Dutch blockade by creating the illusion <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a larger fleet, which she managed successfully. Adamant then went on to fight at the Battle of Camperdown, after which she moved to the English Channel, and then the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope. Here she took part in the destruction of the French commerce raider Preneuse, and in her later years captured a number of privateers. She became a receiving ship and flagship of a port admiral during the last years of the Napoleonic Wars, until being broken up in June 1814.|$|E

25|$|This {{political}} development {{had a number}} of important economic consequences. First of all, it led to an economic rupture with the Habsburg Empire, seen as a loose economic entity. By the time the Revolt erupted the disadvantages <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> this empire (heavy taxation to finance the military adventures of the Habsburg rulers) began to outweigh the advantages of belonging to its trade network. One of these advantages had been enjoying the services of the Antwerp entrepôt.|$|E

These are people who value both the experience <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a group, as well as achieving results. Also, challenging and difficult tasks reduce social loafing. Social loafing is also reduced when individuals are involved in group work and their rewards are received as a team, rather than individually.|$|E

He was a defence witness in the libel case brought by Maud Allan against Noel Pemberton Billing in 1918.

25|$|SS {{blood group}} tattoos (German: Blutgruppentätowierung) were worn {{by members of}} the Waffen-SS in Nazi Germany during World War II to {{identify}} the individual's blood type. After the war, the tattoo was taken to be prima facie, if not perfect, evidence <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Waffen-SS, leading to potential arrest and prosecution. This led a number of Ex-Waffen-SS to shoot themselves through the arm with a gun, removing the tattoo and leaving scars like the ones resulting from pox inoculation, making the removal less obvious.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s Finland {{was a young}} state, {{having just}} {{attained}} independence from Russian Empire. As a result <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Russia {{the vast majority of}} the armaments of the Finnish army was composed of old Tsarist Russian army equipment, and air defence weapons were few and obsolete. As part of the attempt to improve anti-aircraft armament it was decided to develop purpose-built anti-aircraft machine guns for the army since infantry Maxim machine guns were not adequate for the task. A development plan for 1930-1934 called for 125 heavy 13.2mm machine guns and 125 7.62mm machine guns. The task for designing the weapons was given to the gunsmith Aimo Lahti.|$|E

Prosecutors said that Rosenthal, Levy, and Caire sought to substitute disputed mortgages on property belonging to an uncle of Levy in return for Continental Service's low-interest municipal bonds. The bonds were sold to make a 60 percent first payment on the company. Prosecutors said that some $3 million was plundered from the company.

25|$|In 2006, {{after being}} accused of assaulting his former wife Petra Mollath, Gustl Mollath was tried at the District Court of Nürnberg-Fürth for aggravated assault and {{wrongful}} deprivation of personal liberty of his ex-wife as well as damage to property. The court considered the charges proven but acquitted Mollath {{on the basis of}} finding him criminally insane. A pivotal argument for Mollath's insanity, besides the general impression he made, was that he insisted his wife was involved in a complex system of tax evasion; the court came to call it a paranoid belief system Mollath had developed, which led him to accuse many people <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a conspiracy and act irrationally and aggressively, namely puncturing car tires of people in a way that could lead to accidents.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, {{with the}} hopes <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a golden era at the Wildcats, Redhage re-signed {{with the team}} on a three-year deal.

It was {{originally}} feared that it could be a career-ending injury with there being a real possibility at the time of him requiring a hip replacement. The injury occurred after Redhage lunged for a contested ball in a way that punched the head of his femur through his pelvis, breaking the bone and dislocating the joint. For the first time since joining the Wildcats in 2005, Redhage was injured and out of action. The Wildcats lost four consecutive games after their skipper was whisked to the US for surgery, winning only two from the remaining eight. Despite missing {{the second half of the}} season, Redhage shared the Gordon Ellis Medal with Kevin Lisch for 2010/11.|$|E
