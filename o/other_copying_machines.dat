40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of <b>copy</b> <b>machines</b> on late twentieth-century print cultures. Specifically, this article makes a case for “dry copying,” the method of print reproduction perfected by Xerox in the late 1950 s, as a unique medium rather than a weak imitation of other printing methods. Following {{the claim that the}} widespread availability of <b>copy</b> <b>machines</b> {{in the late twentieth century}} represented the arrival of a new medium, this article further examines how understandings of authorship, established with print culture, came undone in the era of the <b>copy</b> <b>machine.</b> Finally, this paper makes a case for understanding <b>copy</b> <b>machines</b> as a form of “social media” that opened up opportunities for writers, readers and publishers to create, share, exchange and comment on texts and images in communities and networks of their own making in the decades preceding the development of the web...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} mapping which {{occurs when a}} single qubit in an {{arbitrary}} state interacts with another qubit in a given, fixed state resulting in some unitary transformation on the two qubit system which, in effect, makes two copies of the first qubit. The general problem {{of the quality of}} the resulting copies is discussed using a special representation, a generalization of the usual Schmidt decomposition, of an arbitrary two-dimensional subspace of a tensor product of two 2 -dimensional Hilbert spaces. We exhibit quantum circuits which can reproduce the results of any two qubit <b>copying</b> <b>machine</b> of this type. A simple stochastic generalization (using a ``classical'' random signal) of the <b>copying</b> <b>machine</b> is also considered. These <b>copying</b> <b>machines</b> provide simple embodiments of previously proposed optimal eavesdropping schemes for the BB 84 and B 92 quantum cryptography protocols.

40|$|We {{find that}} very {{different}} quantum <b>copying</b> <b>machines</b> are optimal {{depending on the}} indicator used to assess their performance. Several quantum <b>copying</b> <b>machine</b> models acting on non-orthogonal input states are investigated, and assessed according to two types of criteria: Transfer of (Shannon) information encoded in the initial states to the copies, and fidelity between the copies and the initial states. Transformations which optimise information transfer for messages encoded in qubits are found. If the message is decoded one symbol at-a-time, information is best copied by a Wootters-Zurek copier.

40|$|In the paper, bounds for an {{abstract}} multicopying of set of two pure states are derived. The general case, when the <b>copying</b> <b>machine</b> has as input a fixed number of identically prepared particles, is considered. A copying transformation and dimension of state space are not specified. Only the unitarity of quantum mechanical transformations is used. The proposed approach {{is based on}} the notion of the angle between two states. Firstly, the notion of the angle between two states is discussed, and some useful inequalities are in passing considered. The upper bound on the mean global fidelity of copying of two-state set is derived. The lower bounds on the absolute error of copying with multiple copies are then examined. For the case, in which the <b>copying</b> <b>machine</b> has as input one original particle, this question was first considered by Hillery and Buzek. In present paper the stronger bounds on the absolute error are derived. After that the lower bound on the relative error is examined. Finally, the case of the mixed initial state of the <b>copying</b> <b>machine</b> is considered...|$|R
