5|$|The pre-1974 former British English word billion, post-1961 current French word billion, post-1994 current Italian word bilione, German Billion; Dutch biljoen; Swedish biljon; Finnish biljoona; Danish billion; Polish bilion, Spanish billón; Slovenian bilijon and the European Portuguese word bilião (with a {{different}} spelling to the Brazilian Portuguese variant, but in Brazil referring to short scale) all refer to 1012, being long-scale terms. Therefore, each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>words</b> translates to the American English or post-1974 British English word: trillion (1012 {{in the short}} scale), and not billion (109 in the short scale).|$|E

25|$|The Greco-Bactrians {{used the}} Greek {{language}} for administrative purposes, {{and the local}} Bactrian language was also Hellenized, as suggested by its adoption of the Greek alphabet and Greek loanwords.

25|$|NB: Evidence {{from the}} Slavic {{language}} group {{suggests that it}} may be worth revisiting this line of thought: compare Polish wiedźma (witch) / wiedzieć (to know) – the parts <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>words</b> highlighted in bold are pronounced the same i.e., roughly vee-edge.

25|$|Sometimes, and {{particularly}} later, words {{were taken from}} Latin, giving such sets as kingly (from Old English), royal (from Latin through French), regal (direct from Latin).

25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of both languages is taken largely from Romance, Germanic and Slavic languages; most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>words</b> {{are derived from}} Latin. Depending on their international form, Germanic and Slavic words in Interlingua may be Latinized; for example, English blockade, German Blockade, Russian блокада → Interlingua blocada. By comparison, all words in Esperanto take on a characteristic Esperanto form. In this case, the Interlingua blocada and the Esperanto blokado are nearly identical and equally neutral.|$|E
25|$|Not all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>words</b> are stably masculine. Native English speakers, among others, tend {{to treat}} kuzo (acousin) and amiko (afriend) as gender-neutral, and nepo (agrandson/grandchild), bubo (abrat), and koko (arooster/chicken) are often {{ambiguous}} as well. Once such a word is used ambiguously {{by a significant}} number of speakers or writers, it can no longer be assumed to be masculine. Language guides suggest using all ambiguous words neutrally, and many people find this the least confusing approach—and so the ranks of masculine words gradually dwindle.|$|E

Hence, the meanings of the words used for alcoholic beverages in each of these languages has bearing on alcohol in the Bible.|$|E
