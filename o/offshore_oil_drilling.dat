They concluded that a set of such platforms, equipped with radars, could extend coverage several hundred miles offshore, giving half an hour additional warning of an attack.

In this capacity, Rankin may best be remembered for arguing in favor of the African-American plaintiffs in Brown v.

After the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown, Rankin argued in a presentation before the Court that the effort to desegregate schools should take place gradually in an effort to avoid any violence that might arise from the decision. Accordingly, he suggested the plan by which local school districts submitted desegregation plans to federal judges in their states. In addition, Rankin argued a great range of other important cases before the Supreme Court.
