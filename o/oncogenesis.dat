25|$|Many {{studies in}} model organisms have {{established}} {{the significance of}} telomere structure and function in regulating genome stability, cellular aging, and <b>oncogenesis.</b> It {{has been suggested that}} mega-teleomeres may serve as protective mechanism against senescence in long-lived organisms. However, there is some debate on the topic, since telomeric length does not seem to affect lifespan in mice and birds with both long and short life-spans have been shown to have mega-telomeres.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that downregulated miR-181a and miR-181b were also {{involved}} in the <b>oncogenesis</b> of gliomas. miR-181a and miR-181b function as tumor suppressors that cause inhibition of growth, induce apoptosis and inhibit invasion of glioma cells. In addition, the tumor suppressive effect of miR-181b in glioma cells was apparent that the effect of miR-181a. These aberrant results suggest that downregulated miR-181a and miR-181b may be key factors that contribute to the occurrence in malignant human gliomas.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{regulatory}} role during transcription of epigenetic modifications in genes, {{it is not}} surprising that changes in epigenetic markers, such as acetylation, can contribute to cancer development. HDACs expression and activity in tumor cells is very different from normal cells. The overexpression and increased activity of HDACs has been shown to be characteristic of tumorigenesis and metastasis, suggesting an important regulatory role of histone deacetylation on oncogene expression. One of the examples is the regulation role of histone acetylation/deacetylation in P300 and CBP, both of which contribute to <b>oncogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are still}} serious, unsolved {{problems}} related to gene therapy. Difficulties include effective integration of the therapeutic genes into the genome of target cells, {{reducing the risk of}} an undesired immune response, potential toxicity, immunogenicity, inflammatory responses, and <b>oncogenesis</b> related to the viral vectors used in implanting genes and the sheer complexity of the genetic basis of angiogenesis. The most commonly occurring disorders in humans, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, are most likely caused by the combined effects of variations in many genes, and, thus, injecting a single gene may not be significantly beneficial in such diseases.|$|E
25|$|Viral <b>oncogenesis</b> {{are most}} common with DNA and RNA tumor viruses, most {{frequently}} the retroviruses. There {{are two types}} of oncogenic retroviruses: acute transforming viruses and non-acute transforming viruses. Acute transforming viruses induce a rapid tumor growth since they carry viral oncogenes in their DNA/RNA to induce such growth. An example of an acute transforming virus is the Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) that carry the v-src oncogene. v-Src is part of the c-src, which is a cellular proto-oncogene that stimulates rapid cell growth and expansion. A non-acute transforming virus on the other hand induces a slow tumor growth, since it does not carry any viral oncogenes. It induces tumor growth by transcriptionally activating the proto-oncogenes particularly the long terminal repeat (LTR) in the proto-oncogenes.|$|E
25|$|Carcinogenesis, {{also called}} <b>oncogenesis</b> or tumorigenesis, is the {{formation}} of a cancer, whereby normal cells are transformed into cancer cells. The process is characterized by changes at the cellular, genetic, and epigenetic levels and abnormal cell division. Cell division is a physiological process that occurs in almost all tissues and under a variety of circumstances. Normally the balance between proliferation and programmed cell death, in the form of apoptosis, is maintained to ensure the integrity of tissues and organs. According to the prevailing accepted theory of carcinogenesis, the somatic mutation theory, mutations in DNA and epimutations that lead to cancer disrupt these orderly processes by disrupting the programming regulating the processes, upsetting the normal balance between proliferation and cell death. This results in uncontrolled cell division and the evolution of those cells by natural selection in the body. Only certain mutations lead to cancer whereas the majority of mutations do not.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the last}} two decades HSP90 has emerged as an {{intriguing}} target in the war on cancer. [...] HSP90 interacts and supports numerous proteins that promote <b>oncogenesis,</b> thus distinguishing Hsp90 as a cancer enabler as it is regarded as essential for malignant transformation and progression. [...] Moreover, through their extensive interactomes, both paralogs are associated with each hallmark of cancer. The HSP90AA1 gene however is not altered in a majority of tumors according to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Currently bladder cancer is found to have the largest number of alterations followed by pancreatic cancer. [...] This may not come as a surprise since overall Hsp90 expression levels are held at such a high level compared to most all other proteins within the cell., therefore further increasing Hsp90 levels may not provide any benefit to cancer growth. [...] Additionally, whole genome sequencing across all tumor types and cancer cell lines reveals that there are presently 115 different mutations within the HSP90AA1 open reading frame. The effects of these mutations on HSP90A function, however, remain unknown. Remarkably, in a number of tumors the HSP90AA1 gene is homozygously deleted, suggesting that these tumors may have a reduced level of malignancy. This is supported by a comparative genome-wide analysis of 206 gastric cancer patients that reported loss of HSP90AA1 is indeed associated with favorable outcomes after surgery alone. [...] This supports the possibility that the absence of Hsp90A in tumor biopsies may serve as a biomarker for positive clinical outcomes.|$|E
2500|$|Regardless {{of which}} of these {{mechanisms}} give rise to the tumor, recent studies suggest that, in the later stages of c-SCLC <b>oncogenesis,</b> continued mutational progression within each tumor component results in {{the cells of the}} combined tumor developing molecular profiles that more closely resemble each other than they do cells of the [...] "pure" [...] forms of the individual morphological variants. This molecular oncogenetic convergence likely has important implications for treatment of these lesions, given the differences between standard therapeutic regimens for SCLC and NSCLC.|$|E
2500|$|Hsp90 is also {{required}} for induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOS). Both are important for de novo angiogenesis that is required for tumour growth beyond the limit of diffusion distance of oxygen in tissues. It also promotes the invasion step of metastasis by assisting the matrix metalloproteinase MMP2. Together with its co-chaperones, Hsp90 modulates tumour cell apoptosis [...] "mediated through effects on AKT, tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFR) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) function." [...] Also, Hsp90 participates in many key processes in <b>oncogenesis</b> such as self-sufficiency in growth signals, stabilization of mutant proteins, angiogenesis, and metastasis.|$|E

Angiogenic factors such as VEGF and bFGF are CREB activators which could theoretically induce miR-132 production in endothelial cells.
