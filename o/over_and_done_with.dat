500|$|Many {{critics have}} {{emphasised}} {{the importance of}} the religious themes in the poem. Vincent Bucklet stated that the Four Quartets [...] "presuppose certain values as necessary for their very structure as poems yet devote that structure to questioning their meaning and relevance. The whole work is, in fact, the most authentic example I know in modern poetry of a satisfying religio-poetic meditation. We sense throughout it is not merely a building-up of an intricate poetic form on the foundation of experiences already <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>done</b> <b>with,</b> but a constant energy, an ever-present activity, of thinking and feeling." [...] In his analysis of approaches regarding apocalypse and religious in British poetry, M H Abrams claimed, [...] "Even after a quarter-century, T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets has not lost its status as a strikingly 'modern' poem; its evolving meditations, however, merely play complex variations upon the design and motifs of Romantic representation of the poets educational progress." ...|$|E

6000|$|Joe sighed. He {{felt that}} he was made for this sort of life and not for the life of a scholar. As a scholar he was undeniably a failure. He had flunked in his {{examination}}s, while at that very moment, he knew, Bessie was going triumphantly home, her last examination <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> <b>with</b> credit. Oh, {{it was not to be}} borne! His father was wrong in sending him to school. That might be well enough for boys who were inclined to study, but it was manifest that he was not so inclined. There were more careers in life than that of the schools. Men had gone down to the sea in the lowest capacity, and risen in greatness, and owned great fleets, <b>and</b> <b>done</b> great deeds, <b>and</b> left their names on the pages of time. And why not he, Joe Bronson? ...|$|R

60|$|This {{was enough}} for the more knowing urchin, now so full of good things that with another added he must spill, and away he ran for an audience, which could also help him to bait Tommy, that being a game most {{sportive}} when there are several to fling at once. At the door he knocked <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> was <b>done</b> <b>with,</b> a laughing little girl who had strayed from a more fashionable street.

40|$|Getting up, moving, and {{stretching}} {{may seem like}} {{the last thing you}} want to do when your joints ache. Osteoarthritis can affect any joint, causing stiffness and pain <b>with</b> walking, bending <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> everyday activities <b>with</b> your hands. Over time, joints may be damaged from arthritis, and an ongoing lack of exercise weakens the muscles that could otherwise help support the joints. Medications can help to relieve pain, but they do not help strengthen these areas around the joints...|$|R

[...] "Women get into it when they've worked too hard; and I've been working pretty hard lately, of course. It drives me mad when Herries will wear his hat a little crooked--habit of looking like a gay dog. Sometime I swear I'll knock it off. That statue of Britannia over there isn't quite straight; it sticks forward a bit as if the lady were going to topple over. The damned thing is that it doesn't topple <b>over</b> <b>and</b> be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> it. See, it's clamped with an iron prop.

60|$|Lord St. Maurice {{had fallen}} asleep, {{with his head}} resting upon his arms, close to the open window. By his side, with the ink {{scarcely}} dry upon either, were his will, and his farewell letter to Adrienne. No one but himself would ever know the agony, the hopeless grief, which had rent his heart, as word after word, sentence after sentence of passionate leave-taking had found their way on to those closely-written sheets of paper. But it was <b>over</b> now--over <b>and</b> <b>done</b> <b>with.</b> When some faint sound from below, or a breath of the morning breeze from the bosom of the sea awoke him, and he commenced making a few preparations for the start, {{he was surprised to}} find how calm he was. The passion of his grief had spent itself. He thought of those hours before sleep had fallen upon him with horror, but they seemed to him very far away. He was face to face with death, but he felt only {{that he was about to}} make a journey into an undiscovered land. His imagination was dulled. He remembered only that he was going out to meet death, and it behoved him to meet it as an honorable English gentleman.|$|R
6000|$|The {{native forest}} path which they {{followed}} was {{little better than}} a tunnel cut through a grove of low rattan-palms, the delicate but exceedingly tough tendrils of which hung down in all directions. These were fringed with sharp hooks which caught their clothing and tore it, or held on unrelentingly, so {{that the only way}} of escape was to step quietly back and unhook themselves. This of itself would have rendered their progress slow as well as painful, but other things tended to increase the delay. At one place they came to a tree about seven feet in diameter which lay across the path and had to be scrambled <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> this was <b>done</b> <b>with</b> great difficulty. At another, a gigantic mud-bath-- the wallowing hole of a herd of elephants--obstructed the way, and a yell from one of the porters told that in attempting to cross it he had fallen in up to the waist. A comrade in trying to pull him out also fell in and sank up to the armpits. But they got over it--as resolute men always do--somehow! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Couldn't; I owe you {{too much}} already, old man. Besides I {{had a sort of}} superstition that this {{temporary}} starvation--that's what it was, and it hurt--would bring me luck later.

6000|$|He {{took his}} seat beside {{her in the}} carriage. [...] "Helene," [...] he said, [...] "I am {{interested}} in Mr. Brott. No, don't {{look at me like}} that. You need have no fear.

6000|$|She had {{not thought}} of that, {{and she would have}} liked to rock her arms.

60|$|I cannot {{say whether}} or not he {{believed}} that his wife would recover; he fought the fear of her death to the end; for her life was far more largely his than the lives of most men's wives are theirs. For his own life I believe he would never have much cared, if I may trust a saying of one who was so absolutely without pose as he was. He said that he never saw a dead man whom he did not envy for having had it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> being <b>done</b> <b>with</b> it. Life had always amused him, and in the resurgence of its interests after his sorrow had ebbed away he was again deeply interested in the world and in the human race, which, though damned, abounded in subjects of curious inquiry. When the time came for his wife's removal from York Harbor I went with him to Boston, where he wished to look up the best means of her conveyance to New York. The inquiry absorbed him: the sort of invalid car he could get; how she could be carried to the village station; how the car could be detached from the eastern train at Boston and carried round to the southern train {{on the other side of}} the city, and then how it could be attached to the Hudson River train at New York and left at Riverdale. There was no particular of the business which he <b>did</b> not scrutinize <b>and</b> master, not only with his poignant concern for her welfare, but with his strong curiosity as to how these unusual things were <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the usual means. With the inertness that grows upon an aging man he had been used to delegating more and more things, but of that thing I perceived that he would not delegate the least detail.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} there is much to forgive," [...] he answered. [...] "I have some {{explanations}} to make too and, since we're at it, we might as well get them all <b>over</b> <b>and</b> have <b>done</b> <b>with</b> them. Two years ago I did honestly think I was in love with Anna--at least when I was round where she was. She had a taking way with her. But, somehow, even then, when I wasn't with her she seemed to kind of grow dim and not count for so awful much after all. I used to wish she was more like you--quieter, you know, and not so sparkling. When I parted from her that last night before I went west, I did feel very bad, and she seemed very dear to me, but it was six weeks from that before her--your--letter came, and in that time she seemed to have faded out of my thoughts. Honestly, I wasn't thinking much about her at all. Then came the letter--and it was a splendid one, too. I had never thought that Anna could write a letter like that, and I was as pleased as Punch about it. The letters kept coming, and I kept on looking for them more and more all the time. I fell in love all over again--with the writer of those letters. I thought it was Anna, but since you wrote the letters, it must have been with you, Alma. I thought it was because she was growing more womanly that she could write such letters. That was why I came home. I wanted to get acquainted all over again, before she grew beyond me altogether--I wanted to find the real Anna the letters showed me. I--I--didn't expect this. But I don't care if Anna is married, so long as the girl who wrote those letters isn't. It's you I love, Alma." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was no {{pleasant}} {{matter to}} disclose particulars of business which would deprive the old senor {{of the greater}} part of that land we had just ridden <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>did</b> it <b>with</b> great embarrassment. But he listened calmly,--not a muscle of his dark face stirring,--and the smoke curling placidly from his lips showed his regular respiration. When I had finished, he offered quietly to accompany us to the line of demarcation. George had meanwhile disappeared, but a suspicious conversation in broken Spanish and English in the corridor betrayed his vicinity. When he returned again, a little absent-minded, the old man, by far the coolest and most self-possessed of the party, extinguished his black silk cap beneath that stiff, uncomely sombrero which all native Californians affect. A serapa thrown over his shoulders hinted that he was waiting. Horses are always ready saddled in Spanish ranchos, and in half an hour from the time of our arrival we were again loping in the staring sunlight. [...] But not as cheerfully as before. George and myself were weighed down by restraint, and Altascar was gravely quiet. To break the silence, and by way of a consolatory essay, I hinted to him that there might be further intervention or appeal, but the proffered oil and wine were returned with a careless shrug of the shoulders and a sententious [...] "Que bueno? Your courts are always just." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{had been}} a fool, a coward and a fool, he had been fooled too, for {{no one had ever}} warned him to take a firm hold upon life, no one had ever told him of the littleness of fear, or pain, or death; but what was the good of going through it now again?
