40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{identifies the}} determinants of the demand of an <b>open</b> <b>air</b> cinema. As a basis, data from the <b>open</b> <b>air</b> cinema Širák in the years 2010 [...] 2013 has been used. It has been shown, that <b>open</b> <b>air</b> cinema's price elasticity of attendance demand is roughly unit elastic thus it maximizes its revenue from sold tickets.
