5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} first {{interview}} were not very detailed, {{and many of the}} details provided did not match the evidence. Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the killings and about the number of weapons used. During the interview, he was confused about the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> had been killed, and he thought that the women were awake, and moving about the house at the time, which conflicted with the forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} {{from a number}} <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> the highly fragmented DG structure wastes {{a considerable amount of}} time in s as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other. Furthermore, the DGs can exercise considerable control over a Commissioner with the Commissioner having little time to learn to assert control over their staff.|$|E
5|$|When Zong sailed from Accra with 442slaves on 18August 1781, it {{had taken}} on {{more than twice the}} number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> it could safely transport. In the 1780s, British-built ships {{typically}} carried 1.75slaves per ton of the ship's capacity; on the Zong, the ratio was 4.0 per ton. A British slave ship of the period would carry around 193slaves and it was extremely unusual for a ship of Zong relatively small size to carry so many.|$|E

5|$|Brussels' hosting of {{institutions}} {{has made it}} a major centre for the EU. Together with NATO it has attracted more journalists and ambassadors than Washington D.C. However the three-city agreement has been criticised, notably concerning the Parliament due to the large number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> move between the cities. The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due {{to the presence of}} other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.|$|E
5|$|Butch {{women were}} not a novelty in the 1950s; even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the roles were {{pervasive}} and not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there were fewer class distinctions. They further identified {{members of a group}} that had been marginalized; women who had been rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> took a high amount of knowledge to function in. Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period. Many wealthier women married to satisfy their familial obligations, and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates.|$|E

5|$|Each title {{focuses on}} the {{extraordinary}} invading the ordinary world, though the two main Megami Tensei series focus on different things: Shin Megami Tensei focuses more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed {{to survive in a}} world ruled over by tyrannical deities, while Persona focuses on interpersonal relationships and the psychology of a group <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>That</b> protagonist is generally male within the Shin Megami Tensei titles: while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead's gender is not out of the question, some staff feel that Shin Megami Tensei lead roles are better suited to a male character. Throughout its lifetime, the series has incorporated elements of Gnosticism, various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism, early science fiction, Jungian psychology and archetypes, occultism, punk, and cyberpunk. The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts, enabling a blending of concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of antiquity, monarchy confronted several republican forms of government, wherein executive power was {{in the hands of}} a number <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> <b>that</b> elected leaders in a certain way instead of appointing them by hereditary succession. During the archaic period (c. 750–500 BCE), kingship disappeared in almost all Greek poleis, and also in Rome (then still a barely significant town). After the demise of kingship, the Greek city-states were initially most often led by nobility (aristocracy), after which their economic and military power base crumbled. Next, in almost all poleis tyrants usurped power for two generations (tyranny, 7th and especially 6th century BCE), after which gradually forms of governments led by the wealthy (oligarchy) or assemblies of free male citizens (democracy) emerged in Classical Greece (mainly after 500 BCE). Athenian democracy (6th century–322 BCE) is the best-known example of the latter form; classical Sparta (c. 550–371 BCE) was a militaristic polis with a remarkable mix between monarchy (dual kingship), aristocracy (Gerousia) and democracy (Apella); the Roman Republic (c. 509–27 BCE) had a mixed constitution of oligarchy, democracy and especially aristocracy.|$|E
