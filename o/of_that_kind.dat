Also, greatly excelling in every thing relating to household affairs, she entirely relieved me of all concern <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind,</b> which allowed me to give all my time to the prosecution of my studies, and the other duties of my station.|$|E
5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of galaxy.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June 1882, {{the first}} issue of an {{internal}} newspaper of the factory, called, Fabrieksbode ("messenger of the factory"), was published. It was the first magazine <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> in the world. Agneta helped her husband with other publications, such as his 1881 book, La question Ouvrière à la fabrique de Neerlandaise levure et d'alcool. Essai de solution pratique (The Labour Problem in the Dutch Yeast and Alcohol Factory. Attempt at a Practical Solution), and another in 1894, L'Organisation Sociale dans l'industrie (The Social System in the Industry), which was printed in two editions and translated into English and German. The full extent of Matthes' participation is not known, but she was certainly in charge of the translations.|$|E

5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, 61,7% of {{the energy}} {{produced}} was renewable, including 30.4% hydroelectric, 24.1% from wind, 5.2% from biomass, 0.9% solar energy and 1.1% from other renewable energy sources, particularly geothermical energy in the Azores. Thanks to this energetic strategy, during 2013 Portugal had reduced to only 5% the energy that it imports. Fossil fuels are still the source of 38.3% or the energy produced, but the trend is to diminish. In 2013, {{the increase in the}} production of clean energy helped to save 806 million Euros in the imports of fossil fuels and CO2 emission licences. From the beginning, Portugal has opted not to invest in Nuclear Power, so there are not any plants <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> in the country.|$|E
25|$|Only {{seven of}} his {{estimated}} seventy to ninety plays have survived, {{and there is}} a longstanding debate regarding his authorship of one of these plays, Prometheus Bound, which some believe his son Euphorion actually wrote. Fragments of some other plays have survived in quotes and more continue to be discovered on Egyptian papyrus, often giving us surprising insights into his work. He was probably the first dramatist to present plays as a trilogy; his Oresteia is the only ancient example of the form to have survived. At least one of his plays was influenced by the Persians' second invasion of Greece (480–479 BC). This work, The Persians, is the only surviving classical Greek tragedy concerned with contemporary events (very few <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> were ever written), and a useful source of information about its period. The significance of war in Ancient Greek culture was so great that Aeschylus' epitaph commemorates his participation in the Greek victory at Marathon while making no mention of his success as a playwright. Despite this, Aeschylus' work – particularly the Oresteia – is generally acclaimed by modern critics and scholars.|$|E

500|$|The first Danish {{reviews of}} Andersen's 1835 tales {{appeared}} in 1836, and were hostile.

He was told he [...] "lacked the usual form <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of poetry... and would not study models".
