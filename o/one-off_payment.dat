5|$|The {{deposition}} of Empress Irene of Athens (r. 797–802), in October 802, and subsequent accession of Nikephoros I signalled a more violent {{phase in the}} long history of the Arab–Byzantine Wars. Following a series of destructive annual raids across Asia Minor by the Caliphate, Irene seems to have secured a truce with Harun al-Rashid in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of tribute, repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce following Harun's first large-scale campaign in 782. Nikephoros, on the other hand, was more warlike and determined to refill the imperial treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute. Harun retaliated at once, launching a raid under his son al-Qasim. Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced an ultimately unsuccessful revolt of the Asian army under its commander-in-chief, Bardanes Tourkos. After disposing of Bardanes, Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out himself to meet a second, larger invasion under the Caliph himself. After Harun raided the frontier region, the two armies confronted each other for two months in central Asia Minor, but it did not come to a battle; Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters, until the Emperor arranged for a withdrawal and a truce {{for the remainder of the}} year in exchange for a <b>one-off</b> <b>payment</b> of tribute.|$|E

25|$|Austen {{sold the}} {{copyright}} for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the Military Library, Whitehall {{in exchange for}} £110 (Austen had asked for £150). This proved a costly decision. Austen had published Sense and Sensibility on a commission basis, whereby she indemnified the publisher against any losses and received any profits, less costs and the publisher's commission. Unaware that Sense and Sensibility would sell out its edition, making her £140, she passed the copyright to Egerton for a <b>one-off</b> <b>payment,</b> meaning that all the risk (and all the profits) would be his. Jan Fergus has calculated that Egerton subsequently made around £450 from just the first two editions of the book.|$|E

Hair subsequently revoked the offer said that he never considered retirement. The ICC announced that Hair would not be umpiring at the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy due to security concerns and on 4 November 2006, Hair was banned from officiating in international matches by the ICC following a two-day meeting. A leaked ICC report showed that before the Oval incident, Hair was ranked the second-best umpire overall and number one in decision-making.|$|E

The {{permission}} did not extend to the sale of spirits and fortified wines, and any beer house discovered selling those items was closed down and the owner heavily fined. Beer houses were not permitted to open on Sundays. The beer was usually served in jugs or dispensed directly from tapped wooden barrels {{on a table in}} the corner of the room. Often profits were so high the owners were able to buy the house next door to live in, turning every room in their former home into bars and lounges for customers.|$|E
25|$|In 530 the Romans {{defeated}} the Persian troops at Dara and Satala. In 531 Belisarius {{was defeated by}} Persian and Lakhmid forces at the Battle of Callinicum, but, {{during the summer of}} the same year, the Romans captured some forts in Armenia, and effectively repulsed the Persian offensive. Immediately after the Roman failure at Callinicum, which resulted in the dismissal of Belisarius, unsuccessful negotiations between Justinian's envoy, Hermogenes, and Kavadh took place. Justinian then took steps to bolster the Roman position, trying, at the same time, to engage Kavadh diplomatically. In spring 532 negotiations re-opened between the Roman envoys and the new Persian king, Khosrau I, who needed to secure his own position. The two sides finally came to an agreement, and the Eternal Peace, which lasted less than eight years, was signed in September 532. Both powers agreed to return all occupied territories and the Romans to make a <b>one-off</b> <b>payment</b> of 110 centenaria (11,000lbs of gold). The Romans recovered the Lazic forts, and Iberia remained in Persian hands, but the Iberians who had left their country were allowed to either remain in Roman territory or return to their native land.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{deposition}} of Byzantine empress Irene of Athens in October 802 and the accession of Nikephoros I in her place, a more violent {{phase in the}} long history of the Arab–Byzantine Wars began. Following a series of destructive annual raids across Asia Minor by the Abbasid Caliphate, Irene seems to have secured a truce with the Caliph Harun al-Rashid in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of tribute, repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's first large-scale campaign in 782. Nikephoros, on the other hand, was more warlike—a Syriac source records that when he learned of Nikephoros's accession, a Byzantine renegade warned the Arab governor of Upper Mesopotamia to [...] "throw away his silk and put on his armour". In addition, he was determined to refill the imperial treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute. Harun retaliated at once, launching a raid under his son al-Qasim in spring 803. Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced a large-scale revolt of the Byzantine army of Asia Minor under its commander-in-chief, Bardanes Tourkos.

500|$|Hallie Rubenhold's 2005 book The Covent Garden Ladies {{sets out}} her {{interpretation}} of the story behind Harris's List. [...] She claims that John Harrison—otherwise known as Jack Harris, a savvy businessman and pimp {{who worked at the}} Shakespear's Head Tavern in Covent Garden—was the list's originator. [...] Born perhaps around 1720–1730, Harris apparently had expert knowledge of prostitutes working in Covent Garden and beyond, as well as access to rented rooms and premises for his clients' use. [...] He kept a record of the women he pimped and the properties he had access to, possibly {{in the form of a}} small ledger or notebook. [...] Derrick, having previously authored The Memoirs of the Shakespear's Head, and possibly also its companion piece, The Memoirs of the Bedford Coffee House, was probably familiar with the Shakespear's Head. [...] The former book details [...] "Jack, a waiter... who presides over the Venereal Pleasures of this Dome", and its author likely studied Harris as he went about his business. [...] Which of the two men first thought to produce Harris's List is unknown, but probably for a <b>one-off</b> <b>payment</b> Harris allowed his name to be attached to it. [...] With his detailed knowledge of Covent Garden, and with help from various associates, Derrick was therefore able to write the first edition of Harris's List in 1757. [...] As an aspiring author and social climber he preferred not to associate himself publicly with such questionable material, and his name therefore does not appear on any editions.|$|E

50|$|Initially, all scratchcards {{were sold}} for £1. Over the years, scratchcards that {{range in price}} from £2 to £10 have become available. More {{expensive}} scratchcards are larger and offer more games with higher-value prizes. Some scratchcards even have jackpots other than <b>one-off</b> <b>payments,</b> such as a yearly sum or a car. Odds for winning a top prize on a scratchcard depend greatly on how many have been sold and whether there is any top prize scratchcards in circulation at time of purchase. Generally, the odds of winning a top prize are around 1 in 3,500,000 on most scratchcards.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{large numbers}} of {{developing}} and transitional countries have ex¬peri¬enced situations of crisis, following political, economic or natural disasters, or total crisis, triggered by war or totalitarian oppression. The goal {{of this article is}} to study the role of member-owned institutions (MOIs) in the provision of the reparations for victims of human rights abuses or reconstruction in post-conflict and post-disaster situations. We argue that grants usually awarded for reconstruction in post-conflict areas or for reparations payments in post-disaster areas could be best turned into equity and deposits to foster MOIs. MOIs are found to be an appropriate institutional framework, to make the benefits of <b>one-off</b> <b>payments</b> more sustainable and also reinforce the financial sector. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
2500|$|Despite the couple's problems, {{notwithstanding}} extra-marital affairs, she did {{not want}} to divorce Starr, but eventually, on 17 July 1975, their divorce was finalised on the grounds of Starr's affair with American fashion model Nancy Lee Andrews.

Starr later admitted that his first marriage had been dysfunctional, confessing that he had been [...] "a drunk, a wife-beater and an absent father".|$|E
2500|$|What Gille Brigte did at {{this time}} might have changed British history for ever. Gille Brigte sent a messenger, and asked King Henry II for direct lordship (i.e. without the Scottish king as a middle man). Henry sent a {{delegation}} to investigate. This delegation consisted of Roger de Hoveden and Robert de Vaux. Thanks to the former, we {{have a record of}} the embassy. It is reported by Benedict of Peterborough that Gille Brigte offered the King of England a <b>one-off</b> <b>payment</b> of 2000 marks, and a yearly tribute of 500 cows and 500 swine, if the King would [...] "remove them [...] from the servitude of the king of Scotland" [...] (Anderson, [...] p.258).|$|E
2500|$|The {{identity}} of the trumpeter was not public knowledge until 1994, when jazz musician and journalist Ron Simmonds revealed {{that it was the}} Surrey musician Ronnie Hunt. He added, [...] "an attempt was made in later years to re-record that solo, using Stan Roderick, but it sounded too good, and they reverted to the old one." [...] In 2004, the Manchester Evening News published a contradictory story that a young musician from Wilmslow called David Browning played the trumpet on both the original recording of the theme in 1960 and a re-recording in 1964, for a <b>one-off</b> <b>payment</b> of £36. In June 2009, the Mail on Sunday resolved the matter. Browning conceded that Hunt recorded the original in 1960, but believed that his own re-recording in 1964 or 1972 had been used since that date. ITV then confirmed to the Mail that a second version had been recorded in the 1970s, but was only used for a very short while before reverting to Hunt's 1960 recording. In the 1980s the same version was converted to stereo.|$|E
50|$|Income {{from the}} estates was of two sorts: fines and rents.

In 1716, the Chapter of Rochester Cathedral tried to obtain {{a voice in the}} management of the estates, in particular claiming that all fines and rents should be passed directly to the Brethren of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. An appeal to the Bishop of Rochester led to a settlement whereby the number of Brethren was increased, but the Dean still managed the leases and received the income.|$|R

A born orator, Hunzvi organised rowdy demonstrations demanding gratuities and pensions from President Robert Mugabe, and critiqued the president. The pressure tactics were successful and the 50,000 war veterans were granted <b>one-off</b> <b>payments</b> of US $2,500, as well as monthly pensions of US $100. A compensation fund was also set up to benefit those who were disabled following war service, with the amount paid determined by the degree of disability.

50|$|The {{fund has}} been criticized for its {{ineffectiveness}} in alleviating poverty as most of the subsidies are <b>one-off</b> <b>payments,</b> such as the One-off Living Subsidy for Low-income Households Not Living in Public Housing and Not Receiving CSSA. People who are out of the safety net asked the measures under the CCF to be regular. Responding to these voices, the Hong Kong government has regularized some measures since September 2013, including Financial Assistance for Non-school-attending Ethnic Minorities and New Arrivals from the Mainland for Taking Language Examinations, Medical Assistance Programme (Second Phase) and Subsidy for Non-school-attending Ethnic Minorities and New Arrivals from the Mainland Participating in Language Courses.

2500|$|The manor of Pucklechurch lies to the {{immediate}} north-east of Siston, and was held by the Bishop of Bath & Wells since [...] 1275, when he had received it from Glastonbury Abbey.

This was to be kept confidential by both sides. Hair was in contract with the ICC until March 2008, and the payment was said to compensate for the loss of future earnings and retainer payments. He subsequently revoked this offer. Hair had stated that the suggested sum was to be compensation for the four or more years he would have umpired for had the controversy not happened, which he claimed would be [...] "the best years he had to offer international umpiring". Hair had previously suggested, however, in an April 2006 interview that he might give up umpiring {{at the end of the}} World Cup saying [...] "I'm not so sure that after another 12 months I'll have the passion to keep enjoying it."

2500|$|A {{biography}} about Douglas Bader by Paul Brickhill, Reach for the Sky, {{was published}} in 1954. Some 172,000 copies were sold {{in the first few}} months alone. The initial print run of 300,000 quickly sold out, as the biography became the biggest-selling hardback in post-war Britain. Brickhill had originally offered Bader fifty per cent of all proceeds, sealing the arrangement with a handshake. As sales soared, Bader became concerned that, after tax, he would make very little, and he insisted on a new deal, in writing. So, Brickhill agreed to make him a <b>one-off</b> <b>payment</b> from his company Brickhill Publications Limited of £13,125, the majority of which would be for [...] 'expenses', and tax-free, with only a small portion for 'services' and therefore taxable (£ today). The Inland Revenue subsequently waived any tax liabilities on Bader's earnings. After film director Daniel M. Angel bought the film rights and teamed up with Lewis Gilbert to write the screenplay, Bader came to regret the limiting new deal he had wrung from Brickhill. He was so bitter, he refused to attend the premiere, and only saw the film eleven years later, on television. He never spoke to Brickhill again, and never answered his letters. The feature film of the same title was released in 1956, starring Kenneth More as Bader, topping the box office in Britain that year.|$|E
