With assistance from TU München (Munich Technical University) and the Mobile Raketenbasis (MORABA) of the DFVLR, rockets were test fired but with poor results, exploding on the test stand or in mid -air during launch. Tracing the problem to leakage between the paper plies, allowing uneven burning and thus <b>over-pressurisation</b> and explosion, changes were made and the project progressed. To take advantage of the rotation of the earth and increase attainable altitude, it was proposed to fire production rockets from a launch base in Zäire, negotiations were almost complete when the political situation in Zäire forced the abandonment of the project.|$|E

40|$|Feedback {{from active}} galactic nuclei (AGN) {{has often been}} invoked both in {{simulations}} and in interpreting observations for regulating star formation and quenching cooling flows in massive galaxies. AGN activity can, however, also over-pressurise the dense star-forming regions of galaxies and thus enhance star formation, leading to a positive feedback effect. To understand this pressurisation better, we investigate the effect of an ambient external pressure on gas fragmentation and triggering of starburst activity by means of hydrodynamical simulations. We find that moderate levels of <b>over-pressurisation</b> of the galaxy boost the global star formation rate of the galaxy by an order of magnitude, turn stable discs unstable, and lead to significant fragmentation of the gas content of the galaxy, similar to what is observed in high redshift galaxies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Effective strata control, utilising fully {{encapsulated}} {{roof bolts}} {{is dependent on}} the installed quality of the reinforcement elements. One mechanism by which roof bolts may become less than fully efficient is by glove fingering (gloving) and un-mixing of the resin. Following a routine installed bolt quality audit and some small roof failures containing gloved bolts, a work programme was initiated {{to determine the extent of}} the gloving and un-mixing problem and to develop an understanding of mechanisms involved. Results have shown that gloving and un-mixing is a systematic and widespread pheno mena, occurring across the range of resin and/or bolt manufacturers, and in a variety of roof types. Gloving was found in bolts installed using either hand held pneumatic or continuous miner mounted hydraulic bolting rigs, under run of mine (ROM) condition s by operators, and under controlled manufactures “best practice ” conditions. The mechanisms involved have been confirmed as being the development of a pressure front as the bolt encounters the resin cartridge and is spun up the hole, which in turn, leads to <b>over-pressurisation</b> and radial expansion of the resin cartridge. The result is an increase in the diameter of the plastic cartridge. Allowing th...|$|E
40|$|Indonesian volcano Merapi {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{hazardous}} volcanoes on the planet and is characterised by periods of active dome growth and intermittent explosive events. Merapi currently degasses continuously through high temperature fumaroles and erupts basaltic-andesite dome lavas and associated block-and-ash-flows that carry a large range of magmatic, coarsely crystalline plutonic, and meta-sedimentary inclusions. These inclusions are useful in order to evaluate magmatic processes that act within Merapi's plumbing system, and to help an assessment of which phenomena could trigger explosive eruptions. With the aid of petrological, textural, and oxygen isotope analysis we record a range of processes during crustal magma storage and transport, including mafic recharge, magma mixing, crystal fractionation, and country rock assimilation. Notably, abundant calc-silicate inclusions (true xenoliths) and elevated δ 18 O values in feldspar phenocrysts from 1994, 1998, 2006, and 2010 Merapi lavas suggest addition of limestone and calc-silicate materials to the Merapi magmas. Together with high δ 13 C values in fumarole gas, crustal additions to mantle and slab-derived magma and volatile sources are likely a steady state process at Merapi. This late crustal input could well represent an eruption trigger due to sudden <b>over-pressurisation</b> of the shallowest parts of the magma storage system independently of magmatic recharge and crystal fractionation. Limited seismic precursors may be associated with this type of eruption trigger, offering a potential explanation for the sometimes erratic behaviour of Merapi during volcanic crises...|$|E
40|$|Supermassive {{black holes}} (SMBHs) {{are known to}} reside in the centres of most large galaxies. The masses of these SMBHs are known to {{correlate}} with large-scale properties of the host galaxy suggesting that {{the growth of the}} BHs and large-scale structures are tightly linked. A natural explanation for the observed correlation is to invoke a self-regulated mechanism involving feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The focus of this thesis is on the interactions between AGN outflows and the ISM and how the feedback impacts the host galaxy. In particular, it focuses on the two possible mechanism of outflows, namely, outflows related to AGN jets and outflows produced by AGN radiation. High resolution, galaxy scale hydrodynamical simulations of jet-driven feedback have shown that AGN activity can over-pressurise dense star-formation regions of galaxies and thus enhance star formation, leading to a positive feedback effect. I propose, that such AGN-induced pressure-regulated star formation may also be a possible explanation of the high star formation rates recently found in the high-redshift Universe. In order to study in more detail the effects of <b>over-pressurisation</b> of the galaxy, I have performed a large set of isolated disc simulations with varying gas-richness in the galaxy. I found that even moderate levels of <b>over-pressurisation</b> of the galaxy boosts the global star formation rate by an order of magnitude. Additionally, stable discs turn unstable which leads to significant fragmentation of the gas content of the galaxy, similar to what is observed in high-redshift galaxies. The observed increase in the star formation rate of the galaxy is in line with theoretical predictions. I have also studied in detail how radiation emitted from a thin accretion disc surrounding the BH effectively couples to the surrounding ISM and drives a large scale wind. Quasar activity is typically triggered by extreme episodes of gas accretion onto the SMBH, in particular in high-redshift galaxies. The photons emitted by a quasar eventually couple to the gas and drive large scale winds. In most hydrodynamical simulations, quasar feedback is approximated as a local thermal energy deposit within a few resolution elements, where the efficiency of the coupling between radiation of the gas is represented by a single parameter tuned to match global observations. In reality, this parameter conceals various physical processes that are not yet fully un- derstood as they rely on a number of assumptions about, for instance, the absorption of photons, mean free paths, optical depths, and shielding. To study the coupling between the photons and the gas I simulated the photon propagation using radiation-hydrodynamical equations (RHD), which describe the emission, absorption and propagation of photons with the gas and dust. Such an approach is critical for {{a better understanding of the}} coupling between the radiation and gas and how hydrodynamical sub-grid models can be improved in light of these results [...] . L’objectif de ma thèse porte sur les interactions entre les noyaux actifs de galaxies et le milieu interstellaire des galaxies. En particulier, je mets l’accent sur les deux mécanismes possibles responsables de la production des vents par les trous noirs : les jets et les vents produits par le rayonnement de ces trous noirs. Les simulations hydrodynamiques de haute résolution des galaxies comprenant la rétroac- tion d’un jet ont montré que l’activité des noyaux actifs peut conduire à une pression exces- sive sur les régions denses de formation stellaire dans les galaxies, et donc à augmenter la formation d’étoiles, conduisant à un effet positif de rétroaction. Je montre que ces noyaux actifs induits par pression régulée et formation d’étoiles peuvent aussi être une explica- tion possible des taux de formation stellaire élevés observés dans l’Univers à haut décalage spectral.

INCIDENT 02 / 4 / 1. Harwell (United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority) On 6 November 2002 during operations in a glove box in B 220, the over pressure alarm sounded. The operators evacuated and shortly afterwards the airborne activity monitors also sounded. The building emergency arrangements for airborne activity alarms was initiated to ascertain the source and to manage the operations. An investigation by UKAEA confirmed that a release of Americium 241 into the working area had occurred at a quantity in excess of Schedule 8 column 4 of the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 (IRRs). A number of personnel have received intakes including the two operators and the health physics personnel who attended the event. The highest dose (up to 6 mSv.) was received by the Health Physics charge hand. UKAEA placed an embargo {{on the use of}} similar systems and have completed their own management investigation and produced an internal report. It concludes that the likely cause of the event was <b>over-pressurisation</b> of the vacuum equipment used in the process. The report also highlights improvements required to the ventilation system in the laboratory and adjoining areas. An action plan has been developed for this work and progress is being made. NIl has followed the UKAEA investigation and carried out its own study including a visit by a ventilation specialist. This has confirmed the problems with the ventilation system. It is a complex issue that may have a wider impact across the building. A letter has been sent to UKAEA detailing a series of short-term requirements and the need to review implications and produce a longer-term action plan. UKAEA is cooperating fully with these requirements. INCIDENT 02 / 4 / 2.

40|$|The {{inert gases}} Xe and ¿¿ {{constitute}} around 30 % of the fission product inventory in UO 2 nuclear fuel. At temperatures below about 1000 oC die gas atoms are disposed in die fuel matrix and cause lew problems. Above this temperatare part of tbe gas forms bubbles and part is release to free {{volume of the}} fuel rod. The fonnation of gas bubbles causes die fuel tø swell, which can lead tø increased mechanical interaction between the fuel and its containment, whilst high levels of fission gas release can cause <b>over-pressurisation</b> of tbe fuel rod. Both diese effects can lead to failure of die fuel rod. The fission gases Xe and Kr in a section of UO 2 fuel with an average bum-up of 65 MWd/kgHM have recently been analysed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The section exhibited a thin band of high bum-up structure (Rg. l) at the pellet rim [1]. SMS depth profiling carried out on the high bum-up structure revealed that the pores contained the fission gas lost from die fuel matrix (Fig. 2). fa Fig. 2 the intensity sinkes in tibe ¿¿¿ and ^Kr depth profiles mart the locations of bubbles in die high bum-up structure. Since the instrument measures the Xe and Kr ion signals consecutively, the number of gas bubbles encountered in the analysis is equal to die sum of die Xe and Kr intensity spikes in die two traces. The results for Kr in Figa are the first ever obtained for the behaviour of this fission gas in irradiated nuclear fuel. To confirm that Xe and Kr are together in die pores of the high bum-up structure, ion maps showing the distributions of mC& and ^b, which are die stable decay products of 133 Xe (half-life, 5. 3 days) and 85 Kr (half-life, 10. 8 yrs.), were produced. Unlike, die rare gases, which are ionized above die sample surface after release from die pores [2], Cs and Rb being solids at room temperature are ionized in-situ during the sputtering process, as is generally die case in SIMS. Ion maps for the distribution of mCs and ^Rb in the high bum-up structure are shown in Hg. 3. Circles mark pores that unambiguously show evidence of having contained 133 Xe and ^Kr. The concentration of retained Xe at {{the surface of the}} high bum-up fuel was analysed by SIMS and electron probe microanalysis (¿¿¿¿), fa Fig. 4 the radial variation of the ' 2 Xe ion intensity measured in the surface region of the fuel by SIMS depth profiling is superimposed on the ¿¿¿¿ Xe concentration profile. It can be seen that in die radial interval between r/r 0 = 0. 95 and die fuel surface, where tbe high bum-up structure was present, ¿¿¿¿ measured a sharp fall in the concentration of retained Xe. Ibis is because ¿¿¿¿ measures «üy die gas concentration in the fuel matrix (it does not detect the gas in die pores), fa contrast SIMS records a steep increase in tbe 133 Xe intensity in die same region since it detects all die gas present lbe rise in the gas concentration measured by SIMS is consistent with the increase in the local bum-up profile measured by ¿¿¿¿ at the pellet surface. Ibis agreement confirms that a large fraction (perhaps all) of (he Xe released from Ae UO 2 matrix is contained in the pores of die high bum-up structure. JRC. E. 2 -Hot cell...|$|E
