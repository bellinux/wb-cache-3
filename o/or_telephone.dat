5|$|On 22 October 1940, {{during the}} Blitz bombing {{campaign}} against Britain, {{it was decided}} to increase the protection of the Cabinet War Rooms by the installation of a massive layer of concrete known as 'the Slab'. Up to 5 feet (1.5 metres) thick, the Slab was progressively extended and by spring 1941 the increased protection had enabled the Cabinet War Rooms to expand to three times their original size. While the usage of many of the War Rooms' individual rooms changed {{over the course of the}} war, the facility included dormitories for staff, private bedrooms for military officers and senior ministers, and rooms for typists <b>or</b> <b>telephone</b> switchboard operators.|$|E
5|$|Flooding {{was also}} {{reported}} in Hispaniola and eastern Cuba. In Cuba, {{a state of}} alert was declared for Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, Granma, and Holguin provinces, and 7,500people were evacuated. Heavy rainfall caused landslides and isolated several towns after roads and rails were blocked. Some areas lost power <b>or</b> <b>telephone</b> services. Five {{people were killed in}} Cuba, four of whom from drowning and one from electrocution. In nearby Haiti, flooding was worst in Les Cayes, where the Ravine River destroyed many homes and left 1,300homeless. Throughout the country, flooding severely damaged crops and wrecked bridges and roads. There were 21deaths in the Les Cayes area. In the Dominican Republic, there were 12deaths around Santo Domingo after mudslides buried people. Four towns were isolated after rivers exceeded their banks, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. Overall, the system caused 94deaths and $25million in damage.|$|E

5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without power <b>or</b> <b>telephone</b> service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Isis first {{affected}} Baja California Sur on September 2 as {{a tropical}} storm. Shortly after making landfall, a {{weather reporting station}} at San José del Cabo recorded sustained winds of 26mph (42km/h), and gusts reaching up to 46mph (74km/h). A station on the Islas Marías also reported sustained winds of 54mph (87km/h). The winds left widespread areas without power <b>or</b> <b>telephone.</b> The storm produced heavy rainfall in the southern portion of the peninsula, including a 24‑hour total of 12.99inches (330mm) at Los Cabos and a peak rainfall total of 24.02inches (610mm) at Santiago. A married couple was killed after attempting to cross a flooded stream in Los Cabos. Initially, reports indicated a family was missing in La Paz, though they were later proven false. Flooding from the storm closed all roads {{to the north of}} Los Cabos and caused damage to the roads in the area. Mudslides from the rain buried at least 120cars in the area.|$|E
5|$|Patton {{was born}} in Fallsburg, Kentucky on May 26, 1937, in a {{retrofitted}} silo with no indoor plumbing, electricity, <b>or</b> <b>telephone.</b> He was the only son of the three children born to Ward and Irene Patton. The family moved often because Ward Patton, a teacher, was assigned to a different school every year. When {{he was hired by}} a railroad in Pike County, he and his wife agreed that she would remain in Fallsburg with the children until they finished school. Patton attended Fallsburg Elementary School, a four-room schoolhouse in his hometown. He was active in the 4-H club, where he began to develop his public speaking ability. In 1951, he enrolled at Louisa High School in Louisa, Kentucky. He was an honor student, a member of the drama club, a football and baseball player, and class president during his senior year. In 1955, he graduated with the third-highest grade point average in his class of 73.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, Tampico {{was left}} without power or communications. About 15,000people became {{homeless}} {{due to the}} storm, or previously from Hurricane Gladys. The governor of Tamaulipas {{declared a state of}} emergency and requested assistance from the military to provide food and shelter. Within a day after the storm, water access was restored, although the city initially remained without power <b>or</b> <b>telephone.</b> Communications were cut to Tampico, except for the airport at the radio. The rail line from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City was cut during the storm, but was restored ten days later. Due to ongoing flood conditions, there was an outbreak of dysentery that killed two children. The Mexican government flew medical supplies, food, and clothing from Mexico City to Tampico, while four United States helicopters assisted in rescue missions along the Pánuco River. About 10days after Hilda struck Tampico, Hurricane Janet affected the same area, causing further damage and deaths. Collectively, the two hurricanes caused 1,240deaths along their paths, and damage from the consecutive storms totaled about half of Mexico's 1955 national budget. After the two hurricanes, the Mexican government and military worked to assist the affected residents, and the Mexican Red Cross provided vaccinations and medical assistance to prevent the spread of disease.|$|E
5|$|Carol {{maintained}} its intensity {{as it moved}} inland, and its winds were strong enough to knock down trees and power lines in New Hampshire. One tree fell onto a car, killing a person, and there were three deaths overall in the state, along with $3million in damage. There was also a death in neighboring Vermont. Carol produced winds of up to 80mph (130km/h) in Augusta, Maine. Throughout the state, the winds downed hundreds of trees, some of which damaged houses, wrecked cars, destroyed one building, or fell onto power lines. Fallen trees blocked highways, and one person was injured by a falling tree limb. Downed power lines left several counties without power <b>or</b> <b>telephone</b> services. The winds flattened hundreds of acres of corn in North Livermore, and throughout the state, there was heavy damage to the apple crop. Damage to the apple crop amounted to $1.7million. While moving west of Maine, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, including a report of 2.15inches (63mm) in 12hours. Along the coast, high waves damaged boats. In Maine, the hurricane killed three people, injured at least eight, and caused $10million in damage, the costliest natural disaster in the state's history. Carol lost this distinction 10days later when Hurricane Edna caused $15million in damage in the state.|$|E

25|$|Telephone {{numbers are}} {{sometimes}} prefixed with special services, such as vertical service codes, that contain signaling events other than numbers, {{most notably the}} star (*) and the number sign (#). Vertical service codes enable or disable special telephony services either on a per-call basis, or for the station <b>or</b> <b>telephone</b> line until changed. The use of the number sign is most frequently used as a marker signal to indicate the end of digit sequences {{or the end of}} other procedures; as a terminator it avoids operational delays when waiting for expiration of automatic time-out periods.|$|E
25|$|Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Bell {{moved to}} Canada {{with his family}} in 1870 {{following}} the deaths of his brothers, and a year later moved to Boston to teach at a special day school for deaf children. Both Bell's mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing his life's work. He became a renowned educator by opening a private normal class to train teachers of speech to the deaf and as a professor of vocal physiology and the mechanics of speech at Boston University. During this time he also invented an improved phonautograph, the multiple telegraph, the speaking telegraph, <b>or</b> <b>telephone,</b> and numerous other devices.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{a counter}} {{is placed in}} the 24-hour-opened main {{entrance}} and a pistol-armed police officer would sit there as the station duty officer, or watch commander, on a 2-or-4-hour watch.

He or she {{is in charge of the}} safety of the station, including the security of firearms and ammunition. The station duty officer must answer all personal <b>or</b> <b>telephone</b> complaints from civilians, delegate those reports to proper desk police officers, dispatch police officers on patrol to respond, or provide legal advice to common citizens. Also, the station duty officer would reply to all information requests concerning suspicious persons or vehicles over radio communication.|$|E

25|$|Even before 1 January 2000 arrived, {{there were}} also some worries about 9 September 1999 (albeit less than those {{generated}} by Y2K). Because this date could also be written in the numeric format 9/9/99, it could have conflicted with the date value 9999, frequently used to specify an unknown date. It was thus possible that database programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. Data entry operators commonly entered 9999 into required fields for an unknown future date, (e.g., a termination date for cable television <b>or</b> <b>telephone</b> service), in order to process computer forms using CICS software. Somewhat similar to this is the end-of-file code 9999, used in older programming languages. While fears arose that some programs might unexpectedly terminate on that date, the bug {{was more likely to}} confuse computer operators than machines.|$|E
25|$|As a British colony, the now-Republic of Kiribati was centred in the Gilbert Islands, {{just west}} of the IDL of the time. Upon {{independence}} in 1979, it acquired the Phoenix and Line Islands, east of the IDL, from the United States. As a result, the country straddled the IDL. Government and commercial concerns {{on opposite sides of the}} line could only conduct routine business by radio <b>or</b> <b>telephone</b> on the four days of the week which were weekdays on both sides. To eliminate this anomaly, Kiribati introduced a change of date for its eastern half on Sunday, 1 January 1995. After the change, the IDL in effect moved eastwards to go around the entire country. Strictly legal, the 1917 nautical IDL convention is still valid. When the land time zone says it's Monday, these islands would form enclaves of Monday in an ocean which has Sunday. Maps are usually not drawn this way.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, Van Zandt {{split from}} his {{longtime}} manager, Kevin Eggers. He {{found a new}} manager, John Lomax III (grandson of the famed folk music historian John Lomax), who set up a fan club for Van Zandt. Though the club was only advertised through small ads {{in the back of}} music magazines, Lomax immediately began to receive hundreds of impassioned letters from around the world written by people who felt touched by Van Zandt. Some of the letters described how his material often served as a crutch for those who were dealing with depression. In 1978, the singer fired Lomax and re-hired Eggers. He soon signed with Eggers' new label, Tomato Records. The following year, he recorded Flyin' Shoes; he would not release another album until 1987's At My Window. Despite critical acclaim, he remained a cult figure. He normally played small venues (often to crowds of fewer than fifty people) but began to move towards playing larger venues (and even made a handful of television appearances) during the 1990s. For much of the 1970s, he lived a reclusive life outside of Nashville in a tin-roofed, bare-boards shack with no heat, plumbing <b>or</b> <b>telephone,</b> occasionally appearing in town to play shows.|$|E
