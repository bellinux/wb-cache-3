25|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, Mindfulness and mindfulness-based {{programs}} {{have become increasingly}} important to Westerners and in the Western medical and psychological community {{as a means of}} helping people, whether they be clinically sick or healthy. Jon Kabat-Zinn, who founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program in 1979, has defined mindfulness as 'moment to moment non-judgmental awareness.' Several methods are used during time set aside specifically for mindfulness meditation, such as body scan techniques or letting thought arise and pass, and also during <b>our</b> <b>daily</b> <b>lives,</b> such as being aware of the taste and texture of the food that we eat. Some studies offer evidence that mindfulness practices are beneficial for the brain's self-regulation by increasing activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. A shift from using the right prefrontal cortex is claimed to be associated with a trend away from depression and anxiety, and towards happiness, relaxation, and emotional balance.|$|E

40|$|The term “translation” is {{the process}} of {{transferring}} from one language to another language. In fact, translation is a procedure between languages. Therefore, the translation also means intercultural communication. In this study, we want to analyze the intralingual translation. The intralingual translation is not a translation from one language to another language. It is an interpretation of verbal signs by means of other signs of the same language (Jacobson, 1959 : 233). The intralingual translation of a word uses other signs to understand the context better. So the intralingual translation interprets the signs by using other signs of the same language. In fact, the intralingual translation is a way to simplify a text. This type of translation may seem a new field of translation, but actually we often use it in <b>our</b> <b>daily</b> <b>live.</b> In <b>our</b> <b>daily</b> <b>live,</b> we often use the intralingual translation. For example, while explaining something to our children we are forced to use intralingual translation. In this study we want to demonstrate the significance of the intralingual translate in the medical field and in advertising language. Especially we want to show with examples in which cases the intralingual translation is not used and the reason and cases in which intralingual translation must be used to be clarified the situation...|$|R

However, given the current environmental paradigm, we must reflect on the question: is it necessary to approach E. E. from a broader perspective or are we seeing E. E. from a narrow perspective?

The few who are more fortunate are rendered illiberal by their unjust privileges, and oppressive through fear of the awakening indignation of the masses. From the highest to the lowest, almost all men are absorbed in the economic struggle: the struggle to acquire what is their due or to retain what is not their due. Material possessions, in fact or in desire, dominate our outlook, usually to the exclusion of all generous and creative impulses. Possessiveness--the passion to have and to hold--is the ultimate source of war, and the foundation of all the ills from which the political world is suffering.

We all have personal interests in marriage which we are not prepared to sink. It is not only the women who want to get married: the men do too, sometimes on sentimental grounds, sometimes on the more sordid calculation that bachelor life is less comfortable and more expensive, since a wife pays for her status with domestic service as well as with the other services expected of her. Now that children are avoidable, this calculation is becoming more common and conscious than it was: a result which is regarded as [...] "a steady improvement in general morality." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{only reason}} for believing that the laws of motion will remain in {{operation}} {{is that they have}} operated hitherto, so far as our knowledge of the past enables us to judge. It is true that we have a greater body of evidence from the past in favour of the laws of motion than we have in favour of the sunrise, because the sunrise is merely a particular case of fulfilment of the laws of motion, and there are countless other particular cases. But the real question is: Do any number of cases of a law being fulfilled in the past afford evidence that it will be fulfilled in the future? If not, it becomes plain that we have no ground whatever for expecting the sun to rise to-morrow, or for expecting the bread we shall eat at our next meal not to poison us, or for any of the other scarcely conscious expectations that control <b>our</b> <b>daily</b> <b>lives.</b> It is to be observed that all such expectations are only probable; thus we have not to seek for a proof that they must be fulfilled, but only for some reason in favour of the view that {{they are likely to be}} fulfilled.|$|E
6000|$|Like Virgil's husbandman, our {{minstrel}} did {{not know}} how well off he was to have been without schooling. This, I think, every one feels at once to be poetry that sings itself. It makes its own tune, and the heart beats in time to its measure. By and by poets will begin to say, like Goethe, [...] "I sing as the bird sings"; but this poet sings in that fashion without thinking of it or knowing it. And it is the very music of his race and country which speaks through him with such simple pathos. Finland is the mother and Russia is the stepdame, and the listeners to the old national lays grow fewer every day. Before long the Fins will be writing songs in the manner of Heine, and dramas in imitation of [...] "Faust." [...] Doubtless the material of original poetry lies in all of us, but in proportion as the mind is conventionalized by literature, it is apt to look about it for models, instead of looking inward for that native force which makes models, but does not follow them.

[...] "It is merely this," [...] he said: [...] "Having come to live rightly upon earth, as we believe, or having at least ceased to deny God in our statutes and customs, the fear of death, as it once, weighed upon us, has been lifted from our souls. The mystery of it {{has so far been}} taken away that we perceive it as something just and natural. Now that all unkindness has been banished from among us, we can conceive of no such cruelty as death once seemed. If we do not know yet the full meaning of death, we know that the Creator of it and of us meant mercy and blessing by it. When one dies we grieve, but not as those without hope. We do not say that the dead have gone to a better place, and then selfishly bewail them, for we have the kingdom of heaven upon earth already, and we know that wherever they go they will be homesick for Altruria; and when we think of the years that may pass before we meet them again our hearts ache, as theirs must.

If personal experience has definitely convinced him that the inhabitants of that under side of our planet do not adhere to it head downwards, like flies on a ceiling,--his early a priori deduction,--they still appear quite as antipodal, mentally considered. Intellectually, at least, their attitude sets gravity at defiance. For to the mind's eye their world is one huge, comical antithesis of our own. What we regard intuitively in one way from our standpoint, they as intuitively observe in a diametrically opposite manner from theirs. To speak backwards, write backwards, read backwards, is but the a b c of their contrariety. The inversion extends deeper than mere modes of expression, down into the very matter of thought. Ideas of ours which we deemed innate find in them no home, while methods which strike us as preposterously unnatural appear to be their birthright.

6000|$|I myself entirely {{agree with}} another {{sentiment}} of the philosopher of Malmesbury, [...] "that {{the scope of}} all speculation is the performance of some action or thing to be done," [...] and I have not any very great respect for, or interest in, mere knowing as such. I judge {{of the value of}} human pursuits by their bearing upon human interests; in other words, by their utility; but I should like that we should quite clearly understand what it is that we mean by this word [...] "utility." [...] In an Englishman's mouth it generally means that by which we get pudding or praise, or both. I have no doubt that is one meaning of the word utility, but it by no means includes all I mean by utility. I think that knowledge of every kind is useful in proportion as it tends to give people right ideas, which are essential to the foundation of right practice, and to remove wrong ideas, which are the no less essential foundations and fertile mothers of every description of error in practice. And inasmuch as, whatever practical people may say, this world is, after all, absolutely governed by ideas, and very often by the wildest and most hypothetical ideas, {{it is a matter of}} the very greatest importance that our theories of things, and even of things that seem a long way apart from <b>our</b> <b>daily</b> <b>lives,</b> should be as far as possible true, and as far as possible removed from error. It is not only in the coarser practical sense of the word [...] "utility," [...] but in this higher and broader sense, that I measure the value of the study of biology by its utility; and I shall try to point out to you that you will feel the need of some knowledge of biology at a great many turns of this present nineteenth century life of ours. For example, most of us attach great importance to the conception which we entertain of the position of man in this universe and his relation to the rest of nature. We have almost all been told, and most of us hold by the tradition, that man occupies an isolated and peculiar position in nature; that though he is in the world he is not of the world; that his relations to things about him are of a remote character; that his origin is recent, his duration likely to be short, and that he is the great central figure round which other things in this world revolve.
