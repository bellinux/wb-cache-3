5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Virtually every town <b>or</b> <b>city</b> erected some form of memorial to commemorate their dead. During the war, only London provided more recruits to the British Army than Manchester. The Manchester Regiment and the Lancashire Fusiliers, which largely recruited from the city and towns to the north, were swollen by pals battalions drawn from local employers, social groups, and neighbourhoods. By the end of the war, over 13,000 men of the Manchester Regiment, including more than 4,000 from the pals battalions and 13,600 Lancashire Fusiliers, had been killed. An estimated 22,000 Mancunians died and 55,000 were wounded.|$|E

5|$|In the original, 7th-century charter {{recording}} this grant, Reculver {{is referred}} to as a civitas, <b>or</b> <b>city,</b> but this is probably a reference to either its Roman past or the church's monastic status, rather than a large population centre. In 692 Reculver's abbot Berhtwald was elected Archbishop of Canterbury, from which position he probably offered Reculver patronage and support. Bede, writing no more than 40 years later, described Berhtwald as having been well educated in the Bible and experienced in ecclesiastical and monastic affairs, but in terms indicating that Berhtwald was not a scholar.|$|E

5|$|One alternative, {{aimed at}} {{avoiding}} inequality and revenue allocation issues, is {{to implement a}} rationing of peak period travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This system {{would be similar to}} the existing emissions trading of carbon credit. Metropolitan area <b>or</b> <b>city</b> residents, or the taxpayers, would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits, and would have the option of using these for themselves, or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota. This trading system would allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.|$|E
5|$|The Emperors Hadrian, Septimius Severus and Constantius I all held {{court in}} York during their various campaigns. During his stay 207–211AD, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York {{capital of the}} {{province}} of Britannia Inferior, {{and it is likely}} that it was he who granted York the privileges of a colonia <b>or</b> <b>city.</b> Constantius I died in 306AD during his stay in York, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress. In 311AD a bishop from York attended the Council at Arles to represent Christians from the province.|$|E

Trunklines that are not Interstate or US highways bear a M-route designation with the diamond marker.|$|E

In March 2012, the city's Salary Setting Commission {{proposed}} that the mayor be paid $235,000, but the city council unanimously rejected the recommendation, instead keeping the salary at the 2003 level. In March 2014, the Salary Setting Commission recommended no pay increase for the mayor <b>or</b> <b>city</b> council. Instead, they recommended exploring future pay increases with additional condition that council members voting for pay increases {{not be allowed to}} benefit from the increase. This recommendation was approved by the city council in a 5–3 vote in favor of the changes.|$|E
