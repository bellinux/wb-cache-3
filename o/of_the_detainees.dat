5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} the facility, some of the prisoners were {{selected}} for beatings or execution. Survivors reported that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were escorted to the brickyard, from which shots could be heard, and those detainees were not seen again. One surviving prisoner later reported that he witnessed the killing of one prisoner in the camp itself, when Serbian paramilitaries slit the victim's throat in front of detainees. Other prisoners were beaten during interrogations, were shot and wounded, or were otherwise abused. On 19 November, gradual transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> to Sremska Mitrovica prison in Serbia started. These transfers caused a clash between Vujić and the Croatian Serb TO, as the latter {{wanted to keep the}} detainees under their control.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{there have}} been two main {{investigations}} conducted by the MPCC in relation to Afghan detainees. The first was launched on 9 February 2007 after a formal complaint by Amir Attaran regarding the treatment of three specific detainees arrested in Kandahar region in April 2006. The findings from this investigation stated that CF members handled the detainees appropriately, and were given medical treatment. However, the MPCC also found that the CF failed to conduct an investigation into how one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> became injured, contrary to normal direction.|$|E
5|$|Another {{report by}} the UN was {{released}} in October 2011. Interviews with 379 detainees at 47 facilities over the period of a year found “a compelling pattern and practice of systematic torture and ill-treatment” at multiple facilities operated by the ANP and NDS, after 46% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> it spoke with indicated it occurred. A written statement by the Afghan government denied the 'systematic' nature of torture and claimed the report was exaggerated, although it admitted to deficiencies {{due to a lack}} of training and resources. The report also suggested that detainees handed over by the CF received different treatment, with one case citing a man who stated everyone was treated badly unless they were handled by Canadians.|$|E

5|$|The Gospić {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 100–120 civilians in Gospić, Croatia {{during the last two}} weeks of October 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The majority of the victims were ethnic Serbs, arrested in Gospić and the nearby coastal town of Karlobag. Most of them were arrested on 16–17 October. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were taken to the Perušić barracks and executed in Lipova Glavica near the town, while others were shot in the Pazarište area of Gospić. The killings were ordered by the Secretary of Lika Crisis Headquarters, Tihomir Orešković, and the commander of the 118th Infantry Brigade of the Croatian National Guard, Lieutenant Colonel Mirko Norac.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, a {{provision}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detainee</b> Treatment Act (section 1004(a)) {{had created a}} new defense as well as {{a provision}} to providing counsel for agents involved in the detention and interrogation of individuals “believed to be engaged in or associated with international terrorist activity”. The 2006 MCA amended section1004(a) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Detainee</b> Treatment Act to guarantee free counsel in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> civil or criminal prosecution and applied the above mentioned legal defense to prosecutions for conduct that occurred during the period September 11, 2001 to December 30, 2005.

25|$|In the Interwar period, Bolivia and Paraguay were disputing {{possession}} of the Gran Chaco - a desert region between the two countries. The dispute escalated into a full-scale conflict in 1932. During the war the ICRC visited 18,000 Bolivian prisoners of war and 2,500 Paraguayan detainees.

25|$|In 1862, Queen Isabel II and her consort Francis de Assisi de Bourbon visited Málaga to {{mark the}} {{official}} opening of the Córdoba-Málaga railway, the Málaga railway station, and an exhibition of provincial agricultural and industrial products.

25|$|The {{emergency}} episode proved counterproductive {{in several}} respects. It ruined {{the prospects for}} genuine racial partnership, made heroes out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>detainees,</b> and alienated moderate Africans from the Government. Indeed, black opposition at this point started to become violent. Repression of the black majority by the white minority had helped to engender the terrorism that would haunt the country for decades. To deflate the crisis atmosphere {{of the state of}} emergency and yet preserve its sweeping powers as insurance against the future, the regime sought to normalise the exceptional measures, by incorporating them in statute law. Thus nstitutionalised, the official emergency came to an end.|$|E
