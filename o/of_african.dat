5|$|After its {{enactment}} in 1965, the law immediately decreased {{racial discrimination}} in voting. The suspension of literacy tests and assignments of federal examiners and observers allowed for {{high numbers of}} racial minorities to register to vote. Nearly 250,000 African Americans registered in 1965, one-third of whom were registered by federal examiners. In covered jurisdictions, less than one-third (29.3%) of the African American population was registered in 1965; by 1967, this number increased to more than half (52.1%), and a majority <b>of</b> <b>African</b> American residents became registered to vote in 9 of the 13 Southern states. Similar increases were seen in the number <b>of</b> <b>African</b> Americans elected to office: between 1965 and 1985, African Americans elected as state legislators in the 11 former Confederate states increased from 3 to 176. Nationwide, the number <b>of</b> <b>African</b> American elected officials increased from 1,469 in 1970 to 4,912 in 1980. By 2011, the number was approximately 10,500. Similarly, registration rates for language minority groups increased after Congress enacted the bilingual election requirements in 1975 and amended them in 1992. In 1973, the percent of Hispanics registered to vote was 34.9%; by 2006, that amount nearly doubled. The number of Asian Americans registered to vote in 1996 increased 58% by 2006.|$|E
