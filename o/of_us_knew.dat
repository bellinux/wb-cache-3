500|$|In 2014 David Coulthard gave an {{interview}} to Charles Bradley in Autosport where he claimed that indeed an agreement between McLaren and Williams was in place. [...] "Ron [...] had made that deal with Frank , which none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> anything about, that if we helped Williams {{in their quest to}} beat Ferrari they wouldn't {{get in the way of}} helping McLaren. Ron would probably still deny it today. That's what happened." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the strained relationship depicted on-camera among Colbert, O'Brien and Stewart, the three are actually good friends and admire each other's shows. O'Brien admitted that, [...] "the three of us have come along in the same comedic environment," [...] and that, while [...] "our shows all probably have their distinct flavor, [...] this happened because the three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> we would like doing this with each other."

500|$|Melanie McDonagh, {{writing in}} The Telegraph, states that with A Book of Mediterranean Food, David [...] "introduced the Brits to the cooking of Greece, Italy and Provence in 1950 after her return from Greece, via Egypt and India". She {{comments}} that the cookery writer Jane Grigson, a [...] "devotee", said [...] "Basil {{was no more}} than the name of bachelor uncles, courgette was printed in italics as an alien word, and few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> how to eat spaghetti ... Then came Elizabeth David, like sunshine." [...] McDonagh adds that David [...] "was one of the first and much the classiest of the personality food writers, even though she was never a telly chef: paving the way for Jamie, Nigella, Nigel and Hugh F-W." ...|$|E
500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act for the tour. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch {{of the group}} recollected: [...] "One day, Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, came in and said, 'Hey guess what—Madonna's manager called. Do {{you guys want to}} go on tour with her?" [...] DeMann had asked for another group called The Fat Boys, but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying [...] "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about Run–D.M.C.?" [...] But they were too {{expensive}} according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen. Adam [...] "Ad-Rock" [...] Horovitz from the band commented: [...] "It's not like any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> Madonna that much, but we all used to hang out at Dancetaria [...] so we knew about each other. I don't know why she {{thought it would be a}} good idea , though. It was a terrible idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003. Lee described {{the place of}} the filming during an interview with MTV News: [...] "We did it in a cool, old area of town. We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop where you could see Barcelona below. It was really neat." [...] The version of the song used on the video is different from the one off the record, with the band entering the song {{at the end of the}} bridge and a string arrangement by David Campbell. [...] Evanescence wanted the band version to be on the album as well, but [...] "the label was stuck on the demo and wouldn't let us use the version we really wanted. We fought back and forth about it and finally we gave in, but we were all so angry about it." [...] The video was filmed two weeks before Ben Moody's departure from the band. Amy Lee admitted that the visuals in the video were [...] "striking in retrospect", but added that the similarities between what was filmed and Moody's departure were coincidental: [...] "We shot it in Barcelona about a week before Ben left the band unexpectedly. I think none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew,</b> including him, that he was going anywhere. And when we got the video back and watched it, it was right after he had left. And it's bizarre how much the video is about that. We all sat there with goose bumps, like, 'Holy crap. We've got to watch that again.'" [...] In an interview with the British magazine Rock Sound, Lee further explained the concept which was related with his departure: ...|$|E

2500|$|Breault and I {{separated}} {{to pound}} {{on each of}} the boat’s sides. In this way, the rescuers would know that there were two of us. Breault played a kind of tune with his hammer, indicating to the diver that we were in good shape and cheerful. Neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> Morse Code. We [...] had no food or water, and only a flashlight. We were confident we could stay alive for forty-eight hours. The high pressure and foul air gave us severe headaches. We did very little moving or talking; it excited our hearts too much. We heard scraping on the hull for hours. A couple of times we felt the O-5 being lifted, and then we got tossed roughly when the slings broke. We knew they were hard after us. This buoyed our hopes [...] for rescue tremendously. Finally, the sub began to be tilted upward slowly. We felt we would escape this time, but it seemed like forever. The last 20 minutes were unbearable. We heard our comrades walking on deck. Breault opened the hatch and we could see daylight. [...] We were saved!!! ...|$|E
2500|$|Kenseth {{was born}} in Cambridge, Wisconsin. He made an {{agreement}} with his father, Roy, that Roy should buy a car and race, and Matt would work on the car until {{he was old enough}} to race. Kenseth began stock car racing in 1988 at the age of 16 at Madison International Speedway. [...] "My dad bought a car when I was 13 and raced it at Madison," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>knew</b> much and it was a learning experience. He continued to race in 1988 and 1989. My first car– what might be considered a sportsman– was a 1981 Camaro that Todd Kropf had driven to championships at Madison and Columbus 151 Speedway. On the third night out I won a feature. I ran 15 features in 1983 and won two of them." [...] "The first night out in the Kropf car Matt won a heat race," [...] said Kenseth's father Roy. [...] "The third night he won the feature by holding off two of the best drivers at the track, Pete Moore and Dave Phillips, for 20 laps. Matt was smooth. I knew then {{he was going to be}} a racer." [...] He ran for the points title on Saturday nights at Wisconsin Dells in 1989. He finished second in points and won eight features. On Friday nights, he ran about half of the races at Golden Sands Speedway and half at Columbus 151 Speedway. In 1990, he bought a late model from Rich Bickle. In the season-opening race at Slinger Super Speedway, Kenseth inherited the lead and won his only race of the season when track champion Tony Strupp had a flat tire. He finished sixth in season points and won the track's rookie of the year award. Kenseth entered fifteen ARTGO events that season and raced in 40 features that year. After graduating from [...] Cambridge High School that summer, Kenseth worked for four years selling and shipping parts for Left-hander Chassis, a late model racecar chassis manufacturer just south of Wisconsin in Illinois. In 1991 he won the ARTGO race at La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway to become the youngest winner in the series' history. He passed Joe Shear and Steve Holzhausen, and held off Steve and Tom Carlson for the win. 1992 was a difficult year for Kenseth. He won three races and blew up more engines than he could count. He was ready to quit racing after the season. [...] "I felt we were at a standstill", he said. [...] "I wasn't gaining. My dad and I had some major discussions at the end of the year. We had to find the dollars for a good program or I told him I would rather not race." [...] Kipley Performance loaned a motor to Kenseth for the season-final race at La Crosse and the team ran better. Kenseth built a new car for 1993 using a Kipley engine. He used the car at Madison to win eight features and finished second in the points. Mike Butz offered Kenseth the chance to race his late model, and it took some time for the combination to stop struggling before they started winning features. At the end of the season, they won the final short track series race at Madison, La Crosse, and I-70 Speedway.|$|E
