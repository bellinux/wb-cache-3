25|$|A cricket ball is a hard, {{solid ball}} {{used to play}} cricket. A cricket ball {{consists}} of cork covered by leather, and manufacture is regulated by cricket law at first-class level. The manipulation of a cricket ball, through employment of its various physical properties, is a staple component of bowling and dismissing batsmen.

The cricket ball is the principal manner through which the batsman scores runs, by manipulating the ball into a position where it would be safe to take a run, or by directing the ball through or over the boundary.|$|E
25|$|A {{major element}} of {{strategy}} in these sports is {{the condition of}} the ball. Since bowling in cricket has more variations (such as bounce, swing, seam movement, off-spin, leg-spin and so on), {{the condition of the}} ball also affects play to a great degree. In Test cricket, the same ball must be used for at least 80 overs unless it is lost, damaged or illegally modified at which point it must be replaced with a used ball in a similar condition. After the 80 overs, obtaining a new ball is at the discretion of the fielding captain – who will often ask for a new ball immediately, since a new ball is harder, smoother, bounces higher and has an intact seam, which produces greater conventional swing. But when a captain feels that a spin bowling attack {{is more likely to be}} successful, he will persist with the old ball, which is rougher and better grips the surface as well the bowler's fingers. In baseball the ball is replaced numerous times during a game to ensure it is in <b>optimum</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{acrylonitrile}} (AN) removal from wastewater was investigated using powdered activated carbon (PAC). The effect of dose, temperature {{and time of}} contact was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM) keeping AN concentration 100 mg/l as fixed input parameter. The experimental plan was based on Box–Behnken surface statistical design. Linear and quadratic polynomial equations were developed for proper process parametric study for its optimal performance characteristics. The <b>optimum</b> <b>conditions</b> obtained were: adsorbent dose = 25 g/l, temperature = 30 and contact time = 20 min. The AN removal at <b>optimum</b> <b>conditions</b> was 92 ± 0. 8 %. The experimental results under <b>optimum</b> <b>conditions</b> were compared with the simulated values obtained from the model. There was good agreement between the experimental and simulated values. The result of Box–Behnken design indicates that the proposed models predict the responses adequately {{within the limits of}} input parameters being used.

The percentage removal of carbaryl by EGP at <b>optimum</b> <b>conditions</b> (initial concentration— 24.40  mg L− 1, pH— 2, adsorbent dose— 0.01  g and contact time— 5  min) is 92.2 %.

How much the room light reduces the contrast ratio depends on the luminance of the display, as well as the amount of light reflecting off the display.|$|E

50|$|The second {{principle}} of combustion management, however, {{is to not}} use too much oxygen.

50|$|By using palm biomass to {{generate}} renewable energy, fuels and biodegradable products, both the energy balance and the {{greenhouse gas emissions}} balance for palm biodiesel is improved. For every tonne of palm oil produced from fresh fruit bunches, a farmer harvests around 6 tonnes of waste palm fronds, 1 tonne of palm trunks, 5 tonnes of empty fruit bunches, 1 tonne of press fiber (from the mesocarp of the fruit), half a tonne of palm kernel endocarp, 250 kg of palm kernel press cake, and 100 tonnes of palm oil mill effluent. Some oil palm plantations incinerate biomass {{to generate}} power for palm oil mills. Some other oil palm plantations yield large amount of biomass that can be recycled into medium density fibreboards and light furniture. In efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, scientists treat palm oil mill effluent to extract biogas. After purification, biogas can substitute for natural gas for use at factories. Anaerobic treatment of palm oil mill effluent, practiced in Malaysia and Indonesia, results in domination of Methanosaeta concilii.

5000|$|Biodiversity loss (including the {{potential}} extinction of charismatic species) {{is one of}} the most serious negative effects of oil palm cultivation. Large areas of already threatened tropical rainforest are often cleared to make way for palm oil plantations, especially in Southeast Asia, where enforcement of forest protection laws is lacking. In some states where oil palm is established, lax enforcement of environmental legislation leads to encroachment of plantations into protected areas, [...] encroachment into riparian strips, [...] open burning of plantation wastes, and release of palm mill pollutants such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) in the environment. [...] Some of these states have recognised the need for increased environmental protection, resulting in more environment-friendly practices. Among those approaches is anaerobic treatment of POME, which can be a good source for biogas (methane) production and electricity generation. Anaerobic treatment of POME has been practiced in Malaysia and Indonesia. Like most wastewater sludge, anaerobic treatment of POME results in dominance of Methanosaeta concilii.
