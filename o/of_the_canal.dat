5|$|A plan {{to fill in}} {{a section}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> in Nottingham {{resulted}} {{in a number of}} letters appearing in the local press in 1963, and a student at Kesteven College produced a report on the state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal,</b> which was presented to the Grantham Civic Society. In 1970, the British Waterways Board attempted to obtain an act of parliament which would have allowed them to cease maintaining the water levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal.</b> The Inland Waterways Association campaigned against the bill, and the clause was amended. The Grantham Canal Society was formed soon afterwards, to promote restoration of the waterway. In 1974, a National Boat Rally was held at Nottingham, to gain support for the restoration scheme, and to promote the idea of a new link to the Trent, which would pass through old gravel workings.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War a {{large number}} of {{concrete}} pillboxes were built as part of the GHQ Line - Blue to defend against an expected German invasion; many of these are still visible along the banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal.</b> They were generally built close to road and rail bridges, which would have formed important crossing points for enemy troops and vehicles. After the war the Transport Act of 1947 transferred control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> to the British Transport Commission, but by the 1950s large sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> had been closed because of poor lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the Avoncliff Aqueduct. The last through passage was made in 1951 by nb Queen.|$|E

5|$|Restoration of most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> {{does not}} present major problems, but {{challenges}} are {{presented by the}} final sections at both ends. The original route to join the Trent has been severed by {{the building of the}} A52 road. A route was identified which followed the course of the Polser Brook, which passes under the A52 to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal,</b> but by 2009, three possible solutions were under consideration. These pose additional problems in finding funding, since they do not count as restoration, and many of the traditional funding sources are not then available. At Grantham, an embankment carrying the A1 road blocks the line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal,</b> and the terminal basin has been filled in. There are plans for a tunnel under the A1 as part of a cycle route to improve access to Grantham, and the basin could be redeveloped in due course.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{terminal}} docks {{were constructed}} {{for the opening}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal.</b> Four small docks were located {{on the south side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> near Cornbrook, within the Borough of Stretford: Pomona Docks No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4. The three main docks, built primarily for large ocean-going vessels, were in Salford, to the west of Trafford Road on the north bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal,</b> docks No. 6, No. 7, and No. 8. In 1905, No. 9 Dock was completed on the same site. Dock No. 5, known as Ordsall Dock, was part of Pomona Docks, but was dug on the Salford side of the river; it was never completed and was filled in around 1905.|$|E
5|$|The new route added several locks to the canal, making {{water supply}} {{problems}} more severe. Because {{of the way}} the system of locks work, water is lost from the upper part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. This is a particular issue for the pound between Bradford Lock at Bradford on Avon and the Bath Locks, where a series of locks need to be opened each time the gates are opened. Most lock gates are not watertight, therefore some water leaks from the higher levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> to those lower down. The water has to be replaced, or eventually the upper levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> would not hold enough water to be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal,</b> but if no suitable source is available or sufficient, a pumping station, such as the one at Claverton, can be used to maintain the water level. Crofton Pumping Station was built to supply water to the summit pound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal,</b> opening in 1810 but, unlike Claverton, was powered by steam.|$|E

5|$|With various {{plans for}} using the route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> for {{landfill}} and for a bypass, some local interest was aroused regarding its future. The Tiverton Canal Preservation Committee was formed in 1962. This committee was stirred to action by plans in 1966 to infill parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> so that housing could be built over it. Tiverton Borough Council gave the committee the power {{to negotiate with the}} British Waterways Board in March 1967, but the Board were unwilling to offer financial assistance.|$|E
5|$|A feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> was {{the variety}} of methods used at Combe Hay to {{overcome}} height differences between {{the upper and lower}} reaches, initially by the use of caisson locks and when this failed an inclined plane trackway and then finally a flight of 22 conventionallocks.|$|E

5|$|At 4:00p.m., two {{anti-tank}} teams {{joined the}} Sa'iqa {{company on the}} firing ramp. Both teams, along with the company, were ordered to advance eastward and seize the crossroads. At around 5:00p.m., the Israeli Air Force began attacking Egyptian forces in the fort and {{on the west bank}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal.</b> One group of four aircraft attempted to bomb the fort; the first aircraft dropped its payload of seven bombs, then descended to a low altitude to escape anti-aircraft fire. An anti-air platoon at the Kilometer 17 mark soon shot down an Israeli aircraft (either a Mirage III or an A-4 Skyhawk) with a Strela 2 missile, destroying it. Between 6:00 and 7:00p.m. all bunkers and troop shelters inside the fort were cleared, and the Egyptians transferred 26 Israeli prisoners to the west bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal,</b> and thereafter transferred them to Port Said for intelligence gathering. The Israelis concentrated heavy artillery fire against the fort, once they were sure it had been captured by the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|At Port Tennant, {{the course}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> has been covered over by railways, roads and other {{facilities}} of the port, but continues to supply water to the Prince of Wales dock through a large culvert, which helps to maintain water levels in the docks.

5|$|Chauvel assumed {{command of}} the newly formed Anzac Mounted Division on 16 March 1916, the day after it {{relieved}} the 1st Division on the Suez Canal defences. Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches {{for his part in}} the defence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canal.</b> His division was committed to No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences, the northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Canal,</b> under Major General H. A. Lawrence. Arrangements were far from ideal. The mounted troops were parcelled out so that only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel's command. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir Archibald Murray GHQ Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF). Lawrence was too far away to control the battle, especially once the telephone lines were cut. Murray, in Ismailia, was even further back.|$|E

5|$|Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> {{began in}} 1822, with James Hollinsworth as the {{engineer}} and John Easton as the senior surveyor. The Bristol and Taunton scheme had incorporated a high-level {{crossing of the}} River Parrett, but the shortened canal would now join the Parrett at Huntworth, where a basin was to be constructed. This change of route resulted in the Reverend Robert Gray obtaining an injunction, {{and work on the}} lower half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> stopped until the new route could be properly authorised by the 1824 Act. By this time, the estimated cost had risen to £60,000. Below Durston, the canal was cut into the clay subsoil, the clay forming a naturally waterproof channel; but from Durston to Taunton the canal bed had to be puddled with clay to make it watertight, as the underlying ground was shale.|$|E
5|$|Control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> {{passed into}} public {{ownership}} with the Transport Act 1947. Despite concerted efforts, the Conservators {{could not make}} any progress with {{the removal of the}} fixed low-level bridges, which prevented maintenance from being carried out. The Inland Waterways Association started to take an active interest in the restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> from 1952, but this was resisted by the British Transport Commission, who padlocked the lock gates to prevent them being used. Despite this, a team of seven men was employed to maintain the infrastructure through this period. The maintenance of the channel enabled the canal {{to become one of the}} first to be used for the commercial transport of water, which was pumped from the canal to Durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards.|$|E
5|$|During {{the life}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal,</b> {{there were several}} {{proposals}} to link the canal to the Basingstoke Canal, to provide an inland route between London and Southampton. The first was in 1788, and was initiated by the Basingstoke Canal company, six months after they started work on their main line. A survey for a proposed route was made, but no further progress occurred.|$|E
50|$|Increasingly, <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> {{was used}} to carry wastes away from Chicago. In 1900, the larger Sanitary and Ship Canal went into operation, {{carrying}} both wastes and larger, more modern barges. All use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> I&M <b>Canal</b> ended in 1933, with <b>the</b> opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal's</b> modern successor - the Illinois Waterway.|$|R

50|$|As British Waterways at {{the time}} had no {{obligation}} to maintain remainder canals in navigable condition, this renewed use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'remainder' <b>canal</b> system became <b>the</b> early part <b>of</b> a movement which supported <b>the</b> continued existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canals.</b>|$|R
5|$|Following {{the course}} of the {{enlarged}} South Drain, a lock raised the level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> at Shapwick, while the Drain turned off to run parallel to the canal but to its north. The railway ran between the two waterways, crossing to the south side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> immediately after the single arched aqueduct and syphon over the South Drain. The remains of the three-arched aqueduct and syphon over the River Brue are still visible, near the old railway bridge, and from there the canal headed towards Glastonbury, passing the Ham Wall and Street Heath nature reserves and making a sharp right-hand turn just before its terminal basin, which was located near the old Glastonbury and Street railway station.|$|E
5|$|Funded by a Derelict Land Grant, the {{engineering}} consultants Binnies {{carried out a}} feasibility study in 1994, which concluded that full restoration was possible. A new administrative structure for the project was created in 1997, when the Sleaford Navigation Trust was formed, and the Navigation Society was disbanded. The Trust has continued to work on restoring the structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal,</b> campaigning successfully to prevent the Navigation Warehouse from being demolished in 1998. The local council organised funding {{for the restoration of}} the warehouse and the former offices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canal</b> company in 2002, and Lincolnshire County Council funded a further study which looked at how to provide an adequate water supply for a re-opened canal. The former seed warehouse now forms part of The Hub, housing the National Centre for Craft and Design, which is supported by the Arts Council {{and is one of the}} leading centres for the promotion and exhibition of international craft and design in the UK.|$|E
