5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> or if the far end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> is not terminated in its characteristic impedance.

5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s {{decaying}} {{infrastructure and}} {{the withdrawal of}} subsidies brought the future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> into doubt. As one of its last acts the Greater London Council paid for the replacement of two bridges on the line, allowing operations to continue.

5|$|The French Atlantic fleet {{was even}} more {{dispersed}} than the British {{in the spring of}} 1794: Rear-Admiral Pierre Vanstabel had been dispatched, with five ships including two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> to meet the much-needed French grain convoy off the American eastern seaboard.

5|$|The {{growth of}} interstate {{trucking}} in the 1950s {{led to a}} drop in rail traffic throughout the nation.

5|$|Although {{built in}} {{response}} to Gloire, the Warriors had a very different operational concept from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended {{to stand in the}} line of battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of February 1800, the Neapolitan government, reinstated in Naples after being expelled the year before, finally {{agreed to participate in}} the siege and 1,200 troops were embarked on a squadron led by Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's flagship HMS Queen Charlotte and landed on Malta. For a time, both Keith and Nelson remained with the blockade squadron, which consisted of six ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> along with a few Neapolitan Ships <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Line,</b> and several British and Neapolitan frigates. On 17 February a message arrived with the squadron from the frigate HMS Success, which had been stationed off Sicily to watch for French reinforcements. Captain Shuldham Peard reported that he was shadowing a squadron of six or seven French ships sailing in the direction of Malta. These vessels were a relief squadron, sent from Toulon with extensive food supplies and 3,000 additional troops under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée in Généreux, one of the ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> that had escaped at the Nile two years earlier. On 18 February, the convoy was sighted by lookouts on Alexander. In the ensuing chase, Success captured a French transport and attacked the much larger Généreux. Although the frigate was damaged in the exchange, Success second broadside mortally wounded Perrée and delayed the ship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> long enough for HMS Foudroyant, under Lord Nelson, and HMS Northumberland to join the battle.

The rearmost French ship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> Hautpoult, was closely followed by the small brig HMS Recruit, which succeeded in delaying Hautpoult long enough that the main British squadron was able to attack and overwhelm her in a running battle that lasted three days and ended off the coast of Puerto Rico.

Decrés recognised that if he stopped to engage Penelope then the rest of Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping his heavy ship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> could outrun the light and speedy frigate. However, Penelope was too fast, and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decrés' stern repeatedly and pour several raking broadsides into the French ship.|$|E
