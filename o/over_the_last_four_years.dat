2500|$|The League of Women Voters had {{announced}} {{a schedule of}} debates similar to 1976, three presidential and one vice presidential. No one had {{much of a problem}} with this until it was announced that Rep. John Anderson might be invited to participate along with Carter and Reagan. Carter steadfastly refused to participate with Anderson included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. It took months of negotiations for the League of Women Voters to finally put it together. It was held on September 21, 1980 in the Baltimore Convention Center. Reagan said of Carter's refusal to debate: [...] "He [...] knows that he couldn't win a debate even if it were held in the Rose Garden before an audience of Administration officials with the questions being asked by Jody Powell." [...] The League of Women Voters promised the Reagan campaign that the debate stage would feature an empty chair to represent the missing president. Carter was very upset about the planned chair stunt, and at the last minute convinced the League to take it out. The debate was moderated by Bill Moyers. Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch the former Governor, managed only a draw, according to many in the media at that time. The Illinois congressman, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and {{at the time of the}} debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after. Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan, instead he started off by criticizing Carter: [...] "Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend," [...] to which Reagan added: [...] "It's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement." [...] In one moment in the debate, Reagan commented on a rumor that Anderson had invited Senator Ted Kennedy to be his running mate by asking the candidate directly, [...] "John, would you really prefer Teddy Kennedy to me?" ...|$|E
