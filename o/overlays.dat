5|$|The Odyssey {{is capable}} of {{displaying}} three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which adjusts {{the speed of the}} computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, for example to change the center line of a tennis game into the side wall of a handball game. The games include plastic <b>overlays</b> which stick to the television via static cling, to create visuals for the game. Different games that use the same game card can have different <b>overlays,</b> which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.|$|E

A HyperCast <b>overlay</b> network is simply viewed {{as a collection of}} <b>overlay</b> sockets. Each <b>overlay</b> socket has a logical address and a physical address. The logical address is a unique address that identiﬁes the node in the <b>overlay</b> network as well as to route <b>overlay</b> messages among <b>overlay</b> sockets. The physical address of the <b>overlay</b> socket speciﬁes an address in the underlying network where an <b>overlay</b> socket can send and receive messages.|$|R
40|$|Recently, a {{moderate}} {{amount of work}} has been reported {{on the use of}} <b>overlay</b> networks to support value-added network services, such as multicasting, Quality of Service (QoS), security, etc. To design an <b>overlay</b> network, {{the first step is to}} choose an <b>overlay</b> topology connecting all the <b>overlay</b> service nodes. When considering <b>overlay</b> topologies, several questions need to be answered first: How <b>overlay</b> topologies affect <b>overlay</b> routing performance? Which topologies can provide satisfactory performance? How can we construct efficient <b>overlay</b> topologies connecting all the <b>overlay</b> nodes? In this paper, we focus on the <b>overlay</b> network topology construction issue. First, we evaluate and compare the performance and overhead of the existing <b>overlay</b> topologies. Second, we formalize the <b>overlay</b> topology construction problem and propose two new heuristic methods to construct efficient <b>overlay</b> topologies. Simulation results have demonstrated the efficiency of the two proposed approaches. It is shown that <b>overlay</b> service performance varies significantly with respect to different <b>overlay</b> topologies. Thus, it is important to choose an appropriate <b>overlay</b> network topology. The knowledge of IP-layer topology information also benefits significantly in constructing efficient <b>overlay</b> topologies as inferred from the results...|$|R
40|$|Selfish <b>overlay</b> routing is the {{technique}} whereby the sender of the packet can specify the route that the packet should take through the network. Selfish <b>overlay</b> routing allow end users to select routes in an egocentic fashion to optimize their own performance without considering the system wide criteria {{which in turn}} cause performance degradation. The main concept behind the selfish <b>overlay</b> network is whenever there is a link failure the <b>overlay</b> nodes in the network will route the packet to their concerned destination. So far the <b>overlay</b> nodes are deployed randomly in the network and it is proved that the <b>overlay</b> nodes are happened to be deployed even {{in the place where}} there is no link failure. The demerit of such deployment of <b>overlay</b> nodes is memory consumption in the Selfish <b>Overlay</b> Network. To overcome such demerits <b>overlay</b> nodes are deployed dynamicaly in selfish <b>overlay</b> network using fuzzy logic and the result was compared with the normal selfish <b>overlay</b> network without fuzzy logic. Simulation results shows that selfish <b>overlay</b> network with <b>overlay</b> nodes deployed using fuzzy logic gives better result than the selfish <b>overlay</b> network with random deployment of <b>overlay</b> nodes.

5|$|The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} <b>overlays</b> the jaws. There are three {{different}} types of epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth. The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the tooth. The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to the tooth.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Recently, <b>overlay</b> {{networks}} {{have been proposed}} to provide {{a significant portion of}} value-added applications, such as resilient <b>overlay</b> routing, content distribution, <b>overlay</b> multicasting. An important module of these <b>overlay</b> networks is to timely and efficiently monitor the <b>overlay</b> link (IP path) performance between each pair of <b>overlay</b> nodes. Although several work has been proposed to achieve scalable <b>overlay</b> link monitoring, they either use a centralized solution[1] or cannot provide accurate information [2]. A distributed <b>overlay</b> link monitoring technique called Monet is proposed in this paper. Based on the proposed X-Set concept, each <b>overlay</b> node collaborates with a set of neighboring nodes (friend nodes) to determine the necessary <b>overlay</b> links to directly monitor. Whenever an <b>overlay</b> link performance query arrives, an <b>overlay</b> node can reply with accurate <b>overlay</b> link performance based on its local knowledge or by collaborating with its friend nodes. Monet can effectively reduce the <b>overlay</b> network monitoring overhead and deal with dynamic IP-layer path changes. Theoretical analysis and simulation results in terms of monitoring cost and querying overhead are also discussed in this paper. I...|$|R

Experimental results show the following: (a) <b>overlay</b> electrical impact is not significant in case of positive-tone DPL (< 3. 4 % average capacitance variation) and should be the base for determining <b>overlay</b> budget requirement; (b) when considering congestion, <b>overlay</b> electrical impact reduces in positive-tone DPL; (c) Design For Manufacturability (DFM) techniques like wire spreading can have a large effect on <b>overlay</b> electrical impact (20 % increase of spacing can reduce capacitance variation by 22 %); (d) translation <b>overlay</b> has the largest electrical impact compared to other <b>overlay</b> sources; and (e) <b>overlay</b> in y direction (x for horizontal metallization) has negligible electrical impact and, therefore, preferred routing direction should be taken into account for <b>overlay</b> sampling and alignment strategies...|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 28 games {{distributed}} on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were {{included with the}} console—a set of 12 in America and {{a different set of}} 10 in other countries—with 6 others available for purchase either individually for US$5.49 or in a pack for US$24.99; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen <b>overlays</b> and instructions.

While Hood's presentation was innovative, his astrological information was largely standard and was taken from Gerard Mercator's astrological disc made in 1551, or a source used by Mercator.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is critically important}} for strepsirrhines like the ring-tailed lemur. Males and females scent mark both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their anogenital scent glands. The ring-tailed lemur will perform a handstand to mark vertical surfaces, grasping the highest point with its feet while it applies its scent. Use of scent marking varies by age, sex and social status. Male lemurs use their antebrachial and brachial glands to demarcate territories and maintain intragroup dominance hierarchies. The thorny spur that <b>overlays</b> the antebrachial gland on each wrist is scraped against tree trunks to create grooves anointed with their scent. This is known as spur-marking.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss what}} kind of <b>overlay</b> {{topology}} should be pro-actively built before an <b>overlay</b> routing protocol enters a route search process on top of it.

We introduce a family of optimizations, based on a pruning rule. As flooding is {{a key component of}} many route discovery mechanisms in MANETs, our performance study focusses on the delivery percentage, bandwidth consumption and time duration of flooding on the <b>overlay.</b> We also consider the <b>overlay</b> path stretch and the <b>overlay</b> nodes degree as respective indicators for the data transfer transmission time and <b>overlay</b> resilience.

5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands {{on top of the}} other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and threw it in the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot <b>overlays</b> the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E
5|$|The Magnavox Odyssey is {{the first}} {{commercial}} home video game console. It was developed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates and released by Magnavox in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year. The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box which connects to a television set and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square dots on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played, and with no sound capabilities. Players place plastic <b>overlays</b> on the screen to create visuals, and {{the one or two}} players for each game control their dots with the three knobs and one button on the controller in accordance with the rules given for the game. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia {{to go along with the}} games, and a peripheral controller—the first video game light gun—was sold separately.|$|E
5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic <b>overlays</b> for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of application-layer <b>overlay</b> networks has inspired {{the development of}} new network services and applications. Research on <b>overlay</b> networks has focused on the design of protocols to maintain and forward data in an <b>overlay</b> network, however, less attention has been given to the software development process of building application programs in such an environment. Clearly, the complexity of <b>overlay</b> network protocols calls for suitable application programming interfaces (APIs) and abstractions that do not require detailed knowledge of the <b>overlay</b> protocol, and, thereby, simplify the task of the application programmer. In this paper, we present the concept of an <b>overlay</b> socket as a new programming abstraction that serves as the end point of communication in an <b>overlay</b> network. The <b>overlay</b> socket provides a socket-based API that is independent of the chosen <b>overlay</b> topology, and can be configured to work for different <b>overlay</b> topologies. The <b>overlay</b> socket can support application data transfer over TCP, UDP, or other transport protocols. This paper describes the design of the <b>overlay</b> socket and discusses API and configuration options. The <b>overlay</b> socket has been used to develop a variety of applications, from multicast-file transfer programs, to multicast video streaming systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In double {{patterning}} lithography (DPL), <b>overlay</b> errors between two patterning {{steps of the}} same layer translate into CD variability.

In this paper, we electrically evaluate <b>overlay</b> errors for back-end-of-line DPL with the goal of studying relative effects of different <b>overlay</b> sources and interactions of <b>overlay</b> control with design parameters. Exper-imental results show the following: 1) the expected electrical impact of <b>overlay</b> in a path is not significant (< 6 % worst-case RC variation) and should be the basis for determining <b>overlay</b> budget requirement; 2) the worst-case electrical impact of <b>overlay</b> in a single line remains a serious concern (up to 16. 6 % RC and up to 50 mV increase of peak crosstalk noise); 3) translational <b>overlay</b> error has the largest electrical impact compared to other <b>overlay</b> sources; and 4) <b>overlay</b> in y direction (x for horizontal metallization) has negligible electrical impact and, therefore, preferred routing direction should be taken into account for <b>overlay</b> sampling and alignment strategies.

5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This <b>overlays</b> the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E

40|$|To {{validate}} the Front- To Backwafer Alignment (FTBA) calibration and to investigate process related <b>overlay</b> errors, electrical <b>overlay</b> test structures are used that requires FTBA [1]. Anisotropic KOH etch through the wafer {{is applied to}} transfer the backwafer pattern to the frontwafer. Consequently, the crystal orientation introduces an <b>overlay</b> shift.
