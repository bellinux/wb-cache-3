40|$|Based on the {{structure}} model of option pricing (Feng DAI, 2005) and the Partial Distribution (Feng DAI, 2001), this paper designs {{a new kind of}} expression of futures price, presents {{the structure}} pricing model for American futures options on underlying non-dividend-paying, and gives three put-call parities between American call and put option on spots, call and put <b>option</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures,</b> and spot options and futures options, they are different from put-call parity of European options. We prove analytically that an American call <b>option</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> must be worth more than the corresponding American call option on spot and an American put <b>option</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> must be worth less than the corresponding American put option on spot in normal market; and the oppositions in inverted market.

We investigate the problem of futures pricing with two independent sources of risk. In general {{the structure of the}} oil and gas futures markets is closely related to some stock indices. Therefore, we develop a model for the futures market and compound derivatives with pricing in accordance with the correspondent index. We derive a framework for energy derivatives pricing, compute the price of the European call <b>option</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> and corresponding hedging strategy.

The present paper includes a comparative analysis regarding the development degree of certain banking packages and services in countries that are towards the end of the integration process in the E.

2500|$|In many cases, <b>options</b> are traded <b>on</b> <b>futures,</b> {{sometimes}} called simply [...] "futures options". A put is {{the option to}} sell a futures contract, and a call is the option to buy a futures contract. For both, the option strike price is the specified futures price at which the future is traded if the option is exercised. Futures are often used since they are delta one instruments. Calls and <b>options</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> may be priced similarly to those on traded assets by using {{an extension of the}} Black-Scholes formula, namely the Black–Scholes model for <b>futures.</b> For <b>options</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures,</b> where the premium is not due until unwound, the positions are commonly referred to as a fution, as they act like options, however, they settle like futures.|$|R

40|$|Managing {{price risk}} with futures {{contracts}} creates liquidity risk through marking to market. Liquidity risk matters in an imperfect capital market where interim losses <b>on</b> a <b>futures</b> position {{have to be}} financed at a borrowing rate that {{is higher than the}} risk-free rate. However, the impact of liquidity risk can be mitigated using <b>options</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures.</b> This paper analyzes the optimal risk management and production decisions of a risk-averse firm that faces joint price and liquidity risk and can trade derivatives in unbiased markets. Its main contribution is to provide a rationale for the use of <b>futures</b> and <b>options</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> in imperfect capital markets for risk management purposes. The analytical results show that there is a hedging role for <b>option</b> <b>on</b> futures: If liquidity risk materializes, the firm sells <b>options</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> in order to partly cover this liquidity need. The additional exposure to price risk created by the options position is partly offset by an adjustment of the futures position. Otherwise, no options are traded and the optimal futures position is a full hedge. Numerical results show that the existence of liquidity risk reduces the optimal futures hedge ratio and that options are not normally used before a liquidity need actually arises.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to conduct a {{comprehensive}} analysis of unspanned stochastic volatility in commodity markets with focus and empirical evidence on crude-oil market. Using crude-oil <b>futures</b> and <b>options</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> data from New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) there are presented model-free results that strongly suggest the presence of unspanned stochastic volatility in the crude-oil market. Sharp oil prices changes exert influence on macroeconomic activity in general and crude-oil industry in particular. The importance of the results is that they show the extent to which volatility risk is spanned by the futures contracts. The extent to which crude-oil futures contracts trading span volatility will indicate if <b>options</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> are redundant securities or there is needed a mixed strategy combining both types of crude-oil market derivatives (futures and options) to fully hedge against volatility risk. unspanned stochastic volatility, oil market...|$|R

40|$|A {{approaching}} <b>options</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> {{contracts in}} the present paper is argued, on one hand, by the great number of their directions for use (in financial speculation, in managing and risk control, etc.) and, on the other hand, {{by the fact that}} in Romania, nowadays, futures contracts and options represent the main categories of traded financial instruments. Because futures contract, as an underlying asset for options, it is often more liquid and involves more reduced transaction costs than cash product which corresponds to that futures contract, this paper presents a number of information regarding <b>options</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> contracts, which offer a wide range of investment opportunities, being used to protect against adverse price moves in commodity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity markets. There are presented two assessment models of these contracts, namely: an expansion of the Black_Scholes model published in 1976 by Fischer Black and the binomial model used especially for its flexibility.

40|$|<b>Options</b> <b>on</b> {{agricultural}} <b>futures</b> {{are popular}} financial instruments used for agricultural price risk management and to speculate <b>on</b> <b>future</b> price movements. Poor performance of Black’s classical option pricing model has stimulated many researchers to introduce pricing models {{that are more}} consistent with observed option premiums. However, most models are motivated solely {{from the standpoint of}} the time series properties of futures prices and need for improvements in forecasting and hedging performance. In this paper I propose a novel arbitrage pricing model motivated from the economic theory of optimal storage and consistent with implications of plant physiology on the importance of weather stress. I introduce a pricing model for <b>options</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> based <b>on</b> a generalized lambda distribution (GLD) that allows greater flexibility in higher moments of the expected terminal distribution of futures price. I use times and sales data for corn futures and options for the period 1995 - 2009 to estimate the implied skewness parameter separately for each trading day. An economic explanation is then presented for inter-year variations in implied skewness based on the theory of storage. After controlling for changes in planned acreage, I find a statistically significant negative relationship between ending stocks-to-use and implied skewness, as predicted by the theory of storage. Furthermore, intra-year dynamics of implied skewness reflect the fact that uncertainty in corn supply is resolved between late June and early October, i. e., during corn growth phases that encompass corn silking and grain maturity. Impacts of storage and weather on the distribution of terminal futures price jointly explain upward-sloping implied volatility curves. arbitrage pricing model, <b>options</b> <b>on</b> <b>futures,</b> generalized lambda distribution, theory of storage, skewness...|$|R
