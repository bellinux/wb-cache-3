25|$|In February 1996, Yeltsin {{announced}} that he would seek a second term in the summer 1996 Russian presidential election. The announcement followed weeks of speculation that Yeltsin {{was at the end of}} his political career because of his health problems and growing unpopularity in Russia. At the time Yeltsin was recuperating from a series of heart attacks. Domestic and international observers also noted his occasionally erratic behaviour. When campaigning opened in early 1996, Yeltsin's popularity was close to zero. Meanwhile, the opposition Communist Party had already gained ground in parliamentary voting on 17 December 1995, and its candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, had a strong grass roots organization, especially in the rural areas and small towns, and appealed effectively to memories of the <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Soviet prestige on the international stage and the socialist domestic order.|$|E

[...] Both Caltech and MIT have a set of pranking ethics, stating that pranks should be reversible and not cause permanent damage, and emphasize creativity and originality. [...] In recent years, pranking has been officially encouraged by Tom Mannion, Caltech's Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs and Campus Life. [...] "The grand <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> pranking have gone away at Caltech, and that's {{what we are trying to}} bring back," [...] reported The Boston Globe, which noted that [...] "security has orders not to intervene in a prank unless officers get Mannion's approval beforehand."

500|$|The episode {{featured}} numerous {{jokes about}} and references to Ireland and its culture. First of all, the title {{refers to the}} Irish film In the Name of the Father. The Simpson family visits landmarks including Blarney Castle and Guinness Brewery {{as well as the}} Giant's Causeway. The fictional village of Dunkilderry contains yuppie leprechauns described by Grampa as [...] "yuprechauns" [...] and Homer drinks Guinness beer. An advertising executive with Guinness stated that a deal had to be worked out with The Simpsons producers in order for the brand to appear in the episode. The Simpsons visit Dublin on Bloomsday, a day when people recreate the events in James Joyce's novel Ulysses. Homer says that he wants to take Ireland back to the [...] "good <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Angela's Ashes", referencing Irish author Frank McCourt's memoir. In his flashback, Grampa dances in Riverdance style. Musicians Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová reprise their roles from the 2007 Irish film Once - much of which was originally shot in Mountjoy Square, Dublin, coincidentally a location that is also featured in Ulysses. A billboard in Ireland advertises a U2 moving company with the slogan [...] "We Move in Mysterious Ways".|$|E
500|$|As for the game's combat, Snider {{called it}} streamlined, {{but said that}} players {{who do not want}} to use the pause {{mechanic}} {{would not be able to}} appreciate the game, as the combat requires both patience and strategy. He liked the game's third-person view more than the top-down view, saying that being able to view the sky made environments feel more complicated, and praised the high difficulty of boss battles, which task players to manage their stamina carefully. His conclusion was that Origins [...] "feels like a real throwback to the good <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> PC role-playing epics." [...] VanOrd said that the combat system was easily recognizable for players who have played other RPGs developed by BioWare. He added that players can have a lot of fun switching between characters, and agreed that the game had created thrilling boss battles. He praised the choice to have health and stamina replenish immediately after battles, as it sped up combat pace and flow. Tan also commended the combat, finding it a better system than other BioWare RPGs, but disliked the fact that characters can't step into water. Juba praised the amount of space for players to experiment with new skills and abilities, adding that the required focus and attention make combat very satisfying.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers were {{in favor}} of Storm of Zehirs focus on {{exploration}} and the ability to postpone or ignore the game's main storyline, and they compared the gameplay to older role-playing video games such as Icewind Dale II and Fallout. GameZone's reviewer said [...] "This is a game that harkens back to the good <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> adventure D video-gaming", and IGN said [...] "this feels like an homage to the old school D games of the past". [...] The ability to handcraft an entire party instead of just the main character was welcomed, with GameSpot's reviewer noting [...] "Rather than playing as a solo hero chosen for some great destiny, you roll up a party of four average joes just like you did way back when in D classics like the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale franchises," [...] (It should be noted that Baldur's Gate did not actually contain the ability to create the entire party in single player mode; however, in multiplayer, this was possible) [...] and IGN saying [...] "There's a strange kind of nerd joy when it comes to creating a D party". [...] Reviewers also appreciated the [...] "Party Conversation System", which allows typically underutilized social skills to be used by the entire party during conversation. [...] GameSpy said [...] "It's a terrific convention in which the game responds not to one but to every member of an adventuring party.
