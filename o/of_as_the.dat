5|$|After World War II, {{the world}} {{split into two}} large geopolitical blocs, {{separating}} into spheres of communism and capitalism. This led to the Cold War, during which the term First World was often used because of its political, social, and economic relevance. The term itself was first introduced in the late 1940s by the United Nations. Today, the First World is slightly outdated and has no official definition, however, it is generally thought <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> capitalist, industrial, wealthy and developed countries. This definition includes Australia & New Zealand, the developed countries of Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore) and the wealthy countries of North America and Europe, particularly Western Europe. In contemporary society, the First World is viewed as countries that have the most advanced economies, the greatest influence, the highest standards of living, and the greatest technology. After the Cold War, these countries of the First World included member states of NATO, U.S.-aligned states, neutral countries that were developed and industrialized, and the former British Colonies that were considered developed. It can be defined succinctly as Europe, plus the richer countries of the former British Empire (USA, Canada, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand), Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|After the 1960 season, it was {{announced}} that the AL were going to create two new teams, one in Los Angeles and one in Washington, D. C. Although he was thought <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Tigers' best reliever during the season, Sisler was listed by the Tigers as eligible for the 1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft. The draft occurred on December14, 1960 and Sisler was selected by the Washington Senators with the fourth overall pick. The Senators received communication from several teams that were interested in Sisler, namely the Milwaukee Braves of the National League (NL) and the Athletics, but decided to trade their first pick in the expansion draft, Bobby Shantz, instead. New manager Mickey Vernon defined Sisler's role with the team before the season began, designating him as their top relief pitcher. Sisler felt slighted by the Tigers, having been left unprotected by the team, and had considered retiring from baseball, but ultimately decided to sign with the Senators.|$|E
5|$|Arrowmen are {{identified}} {{by a white}} sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow. The Brotherhood member wears a sash bearing an arrow with a red bar {{at each end of}} the arrow. A Vigil Honor member wears a sash with the same bars <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Brotherhood sash {{at each end of the}} arrow, and a Vigil Honor triangle on the center of the shaft. Members wear the sash at Order of the Arrow functions and special Scouting activities when members need to be identified as Arrowmen rendering special services. The OA sash is not worn at the same time as the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt. The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.|$|E

5|$|In July 1942 the U-boats {{became aware}} of Coastal Command {{aircraft}} using another innovation – sonobuoys, which were thought <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> air equivalent of the Navy's ASDIC. A U-boat reported them on 29 July being dropped in the north transit area, and they were thought by the enemy to be devices for preventing U-boats from travelling on the surface. They were, in fact, for detecting submerged U-boats, and were used by No. 210 Squadron RAF, operating Sunderlands. In operational records they were coded High Tea. Most crews were unaware of their existence. The devices stayed in use until 1998, when some wartime crews saw {{them for the first}} time. Until then the RAF had kept them secret.|$|E
5|$|In the {{wilderness}} {{of the dance}} floor, Gaga recognizes the wolf-woman she has become and refuses to misrepresent herself any longer. She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end <b>of</b> , <b>as</b> <b>the</b> singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E
5|$|Later work, {{during the}} 1750s and 1760s, was {{undertaken}} by the landscape gardener Capability Brown.

5|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that Doune Castle was originally built in the thirteenth century, then probably damaged in the Scottish Wars of Independence, before being rebuilt in its present form in the late 14th century by Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany (c.1340–1420), the son of King Robert II of Scots, and Regent of Scotland from 1388 until his death. Duke Robert's stronghold has survived relatively unchanged and complete, and the whole castle was traditionally thought <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> result of a single period of construction at this time. The castle passed to the crown in 1425, when Albany's son was executed, and was used as a royal hunting lodge and dower house. In the later 16th century, Doune became the property of the Earls of Moray. The castle saw military action during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and Glencairn's rising in the mid-17th century, and during the Jacobite Risings of the late 17th century and 18th century. By 1800 the castle was ruined, but restoration works were carried out in the 1880s, prior to its passing into state care in the 20th century. It is now maintained by Historic Scotland.|$|E
5|$|State legislatures elected U.S. Senators {{until the}} {{ratification}} of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. In 1849 one of New York's seats was up for election, and a Whig would likely be elected to replace John Adams Dix. Seward, with Weed's counsel, decided to seek the seat. When legislators convened in January 1849, he was spoken <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> favorite. Some opposed him as too extreme on slavery issues, and intimated {{that he would not}} support the slaveholding President-elect Taylor, a Louisianan. Weed and Seward worked to dispel these concerns, and when the vote for the Senate seat took place, the former governor received five times the vote of the nearest other candidate, gaining easy election on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry {{groups are}} groups {{consisting}} of symmetries of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, {{such as the}} introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as polynomial equations and their solutions. Conceptually, group theory can be thought <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> study of symmetry. Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object X if every group element performs some operation on X compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern {{is connected to the}} structure of the object being acted on.|$|E

5|$|The First Fleet {{brought the}} initial {{population}} of 70 sheep from the Cape of Good Hope to Australia in 1788. The next shipment was of 30 sheep from Calcutta and Ireland in 1793. All {{of the early}} sheep brought to Australia were exclusively used for the dietary needs of the penal colonies. The beginnings of the Australian wool industry were due {{to the efforts of}} Captain John Macarthur. At Macarthur's urging 16 Spanish merinos were imported in 1797, effectively beginning the Australian sheep industry. By 1801 Macarthur had 1,000 head of sheep, and in 1803 he exported 111 kilograms (245lb) of wool to England. Today, Macarthur is generally thought <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> father of the Australian sheep industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} practising Catholics {{probably}} continued to reduce {{in the seventeenth}} century and the organisation of the Church deteriorated. Some were to convert to Roman Catholicism, as did John Ogilvie (1569–1615), who went on to be ordained a priest in 1610, later being hanged for proselytism in Glasgow and often thought <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> only Scottish Catholic martyr of the Reformation era. An Irish Franciscan mission in the 1620s and 1630s claimed large numbers of converts, but these were confined to the Western Isles and had little impact on the mainland. A college for the education of Scots clergy was opened at Madrid in 1633, and was afterwards moved to Valladolid. In 1653 the remaining five or six clergy were incorporated under William Ballantine as prefect of the mission. There were a small number of Jesuits active in Strathgrass from the 1670s. The Pope appointed Thomas Nicolson as the first Vicar Apostolic over the mission in 1694 and the situation of Catholicism began to improve. Nicholson divided Scotland into districts, each with its own designated priests and he undertook visitations to ensure the implementation of Papal legislation. In 1700 his Statuta Missionis, which included a code of conduct for priests and laymen, were approved by all the clergy. By 1703 there were 33 Catholic clergy.|$|E
