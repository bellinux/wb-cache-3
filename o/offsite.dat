5|$|Another 3million Widener items reside <b>offsite</b> (along {{with many}} {{millions}} of items from other Harvard libraries) at the Harvard Depository in Southborough, Massachusetts, from which they are retrieved overnight on request. A project to insert barcodes into each book, begun in the late 1970s, had some 1million volumes yet to reach as of 2006.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium milling {{operations}} produced {{large quantities}} of toxic cutting fluid contaminated with particles of plutonium and uranium. Thousands of 55-gallon drums of the waste were stored outside in an unprotected earthen area called the 903 pad storage area, where they corroded and leaked radionuclides over years into the soil and water. An estimated 5,000 gallons of plutonium-contaminated oil leached into the soil between 1964 and 1967. Portions of this waste, mixed with dust that composed Pad 903, became airborne in the heavy winds of the Front Range and contaminated <b>offsite</b> areas {{to the south and}} east.|$|E
5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow for the sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an <b>offsite</b> retail sales outlet of the winery. Since the early 1990s, there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income, and thus the value of their liquor license.|$|E
5|$|To {{link the}} new {{developments}} around Battersea Power Station to Battersea Park, in 2004 a new curved footbridge was built beneath {{the southern end}} of Chelsea Bridge. The footbridge was built <b>offsite</b> in four sections, transported by road to the King George V Dock where it was assembled, and the completed structure floated down the river and hoisted into position. It is planned that once the riverfront in the area has been opened to the public, following the completion of the rebuilding of Battersea Power Station into a commercial development, the new bridge will form part of the Thames Path. The new bridge curves out from the bank, overhanging the river bank by , and cost Â£600,000 to build.|$|E
5|$|When {{the weather}} improved, work {{commenced}} outside. The cap circle was mostly constructed {{before the first}} work-in commenced. The work-ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August, with 35 people participating. During the first work-in, the fantail posts and braces were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated <b>offsite</b> were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. Intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a windlass. The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time.|$|E
25|$|Most nuclear {{stations}} require {{two distinct}} sources of <b>offsite</b> {{power feeding station}} service transformers that are sufficiently separated in the station's switchyard and can receive power from multiple transmission lines. In addition in some nuclear stations the turbine generator can power the station's house loads while the station is online via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output bus bars {{before they reach the}} step-up transformer (these stations also have station service transformers that receive <b>offsite</b> power directly from the switch yard). Even with the redundancy of two power sources total loss of <b>offsite</b> power is still possible. Nuclear power stations are equipped with emergency power.|$|E
25|$|The Museum Support Center is an <b>offsite</b> {{warehouse}} and workshop that prepares items for display.|$|E
25|$|Building <b>offsite</b> allows high {{precision}} techniques to be utilised {{and reduces the}} possibility of errors in construction.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the court}} held that the FWS's {{reliance}} on unnamed sources for <b>offsite</b> mitigation was contrary to the law and unsupported by any factually reliable basis in the Administrative Record.|$|E
25|$|Some {{departments}} are housed <b>offsite</b> at locations {{within walking distance}} of the main campus, for example, the Department of English is located in a Grade II-listed former Victorian vicarage, while the Law School is based at 67 Liverpool Road.|$|E
25|$|PWRs can passively scram {{the reactor}} {{in the event}} that <b>offsite</b> power is lost to {{immediately}} stop the primary nuclear reaction. The control rods are held by electromagnets and fall by gravity when current is lost; full insertion safely shuts down the primary nuclear reaction.|$|E
25|$|The plaintiffs brought three claims: 1) {{the level}} of {{off-site}} mitigation funding was inadequate and lacked any rational basis; 2) the FWS's <b>offsite</b> mitigation policy was inconsistent; and 3) the FWS's reliance on unnamed sources to pay the additional costs for providing adequate off-site mitigation was arbitrary and capricious.|$|E
25|$|Most major {{rental car}} {{companies}} serve the airport through shuttle busses to <b>offsite</b> locations. Taxis are provided under contract with MetroCab (approximate cost to downtown Detroit is $48), while limousine and luxury vehicle service {{is provided by}} MetroCars. Shores Airport Ride provides luxury transportation from Detroit to Detroit Metro Airport for 3 passengers for $49.00.|$|E
25|$|Some 86 {{workers at}} the site were exposed to radioactivity, but {{according}} to the Department of Energy none received a dose exceeding site guidelines and, similarly, radiation drifting <b>offsite</b> was not considered to pose a hazard by the DOE. In March 2009, TIME magazine identified the Baneberry Test as one of the world's worst nuclear disasters.|$|E
25|$|Fecal sludge {{management}} (FSM) requires {{safe and}} hygienic septic tank and pit latrine emptying services, {{along with the}} effective treatment of solids and liquids and the reuse of treated produce where possible. It may include a range of options including on-site and <b>offsite</b> treatment, and the dispersal or capture and further processing of {{the products of the}} treatment process into such as biogas, compost and energy.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, the museum's {{permanent}} displays {{included a}} dinosaur exhibit, a space museum, and exhibits on geology, biology, petroleum science, technology, and geography. In 1988, the Challenger Learning Center was opened {{in memory of}} the Space Shuttle Challenger crewmembers that were lost during the shuttle's tenth mission. The center's aim is to teach visitors about space exploration. The Wortham IMAX Theatre and the <b>offsite</b> George Observatory were opened in 1989.|$|E
25|$|In-stream {{tidal turbine}} {{technology}} is a relatively simple design. An elevated turbine is submerged under water in a location that enables its movement with tidal cycles. As the blades of the turbine move they create energy that powers an electric generator at the base. From here the power travels to a cable attached to the seafloor and back to an <b>offsite</b> facility {{where it can be}} added to the power grid.|$|E
25|$|Rock {{was being}} transported from <b>offsite</b> to {{complete}} the access road and closure at the 17th Street breach. Once the rock required to build the roads arrived in New Orleans and the access road to the breach was completed, the Corps estimated closure of the breach could be completed in three to four days. Several private firms have volunteered services and provided assistance in design of the closure.|$|E
25|$|Some {{value-added}} resellers are {{now using}} a flash drive as part of small-business turnkey solutions (e.g., point-of-sale systems). The drive {{is used as a}} backup medium: at the close of business each night, the drive is inserted, and a database backup is saved to the drive. Alternatively, the drive can be left inserted through the business day, and data regularly updated. In either case, the drive is removed at night and taken <b>offsite.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also called e-{{volunteering}} {{or online}} volunteering, virtual volunteering is a volunteer who completes tasks, {{in whole or}} in part, <b>offsite</b> from the organization being assisted. They use the Internet and a home, school, telecenter or work computer, or other Internet-connected device, such as a PDA or smartphone. Virtual volunteering is also known as cyber service, telementoring, and teletutoring, as well as various other names. Virtual volunteering is similar to telecommuting, except that instead of online employees who are paid, these are online volunteers who are not paid.|$|E
25|$|ZFS file {{systems can}} be moved to other pools, also on remote hosts over the network, as the send command creates a stream {{representation}} of the file system's state. This stream can either describe complete contents of the file system at a given snapshot, {{or it can be}} a delta between snapshots. Computing the delta stream is very efficient, and its size depends on the number of blocks changed between the snapshots. This provides an efficient strategy, e.g., for synchronizing <b>offsite</b> backups or high availability mirrors of a pool.|$|E
25|$|Onsite {{sanitation}} (or on-site sanitation) {{is defined}} as a sanitation system in which excreta and wastewater are collected, stored or treated at the same location (or on the same plot) where they are generated. Examples are pit latrines and septic tanks. On-site sanitation systems are often connected to fecal sludge management systems where the fecal sludge that is generated onsite is treated as an <b>offsite</b> location. A related term is a decentralized wastewater system which refers in particular to the wastewater part of on-site sanitation. Similarly, an onsite sewage facility can treat the wastewater generated locally.|$|E
25|$|Participants {{arrive on}} the Friday and pitch their tents. There is {{normally}} a large campfire followed by Fire Performers. After this tickets for Saturday's activities are given out (followed by a mad dash to swap activities). On Saturday morning participants are bused <b>offsite</b> to do two activities (e.g. Waterskiing, Zipit, Escape Spike Island, Canoeing, Rafting, High Ropes and the Ventact Famous Monopoly Run). When they return, there is a barbecue at the campsite. On Saturday evening there is a Scouts/Guides Own followed by the ever-popular themed Ventact Disco. On Sunday morning there are activities around Kilcully Campsite before everyone heads home.|$|E
25|$|Turkey Point was {{directly}} hit by Hurricane Andrew on August 24, 1992, destroying two raw water tanks and {{portions of the}} fire protection systems, draining another raw water tank, partially disabling the fire protection systems, causing severe damage to various non-nuclear structures, and cracking the smokestack for fossil-fueled Unit 1. The smokestack later had to be demolished and rebuilt. It also suffered a total loss of <b>offsite</b> power, requiring {{the use of the}} onsite emergency diesel generators for several days. No significant damage was done to the plant's nuclear containment buildings. The plant was built to withstand winds of up to 235mph (380km/h), greatly exceeding the maximum winds recorded by most category 5 hurricanes.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the WAAS, the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) did {{not have}} the ability to provide lateral and {{vertical}} navigation for precision approaches for all users at all locations. The traditional system for precision approaches is the instrument landing system (ILS), which used a series of radio transmitters each broadcasting a single signal to the aircraft. This complex series of radios needs to be installed at every runway end, some <b>offsite,</b> along a line extended from the runway centerline, making the implementation of a precision approach both difficult and very expensive. The ILS system is composed of 180 different transmitting antennas at each point built. The newer system is free of huge antenna systems at each airport.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{the cause}} of the fire, the story goes that before going to bed, a lady of the house threw melted grease from the socket of a large {{candlestick}} into a fire grate in a lower storey {{of the house and the}} ensuing flames set alight the unswept chimney flue, the fire rapidly entering the new mansion wing through windows in the garret that had been left open by workmen. The keys had been taken <b>offsite</b> by carpenters and access to control the fire was impossible. Large numbers of people turned out to help, but their assistance was to no avail. Until the death of the earl in 1781 the cause had been carefully concealed and supernatural forces held to blame.|$|E
25|$|Architectural conservationists {{wanted to}} {{reconstruct}} what remained from the bombing, {{as it was}} the last remaining exchange floor in the City of London. English Heritage, the government's statutory conservation adviser, and the City of London Corporation insisted that any redevelopment must restore the building's old faÃ§ade onto St Mary Axe. Baltic Exchange, unable to afford such an expensive undertaking alone, sold the site to Trafalgar House in 1995. The remaining sculptures and masonry of the structurally unstable faÃ§ade block on the site were photographed and dismantled before the sale; the interior of the Exchange Hall, which was regarded as stable, was initially sealed from the elements in the hope that it would be preserved in situ in any new development, but was subsequently dismantled and stored <b>offsite</b> in 1995â96.|$|E
25|$|Pertinent up-to-date, {{confidential}} {{patient information}} {{is converted to}} a written text document by a medical transcriptionist (MT). This text may be printed {{and placed in the}} patient's record and/or retained only in its electronic format. Medical transcription can be performed by MTs who are employees in a hospital or who work at home as telecommuting employees for the hospital; by MTs working as telecommuting employees or independent contractors for an outsourced service that performs the work <b>offsite</b> under contract to a hospital, clinic, physician group or other healthcare provider; or by MTs working directly for the providers of service (doctors or their group practices) either onsite or telecommuting as employees or contractors. Hospital facilities often prefer electronic storage of medical records due to the sheer volume of hospital patients and the accompanying paperwork. The electronic storage in their database gives immediate access to subsequent departments or providers regarding the patient's care to date, notation of previous or present medications, notification of allergies, and establishes a history on the patient to facilitate healthcare delivery regardless of geographical distance or location.|$|E
25|$|During the 2011 winter-over season, {{station manager}} Renee-Nicole Douceur {{experienced}} a stroke on August 27, resulting in {{loss of vision}} and cognitive function. Because the AmundsenâScott base lacks diagnostic medical equipment such as an MRI or CT scan machine, station doctors were unable to fully evaluate {{the damage done by}} the stroke or the chance of recurrence. Physicians on site recommended a medevac flight as soon as possible for Douceur, but <b>offsite</b> doctors hired by Raytheon Polar Services (the company contracted to run the base) and the National Science Foundation disagreed with the severity of the situation. The National Science Foundation, which is the final authority on all flights and assumes all financial responsibility for the flights, denied the request for medevac, saying the weather was still too hazardous. Plans were made to evacuate Douceur on the first flight available. Douceur and her niece, believing Douceur's condition to be grave and believing an earlier medevac flight possible, contacted Senator Jeanne Shaheen for assistance; as the NSF continued to state Douceur's condition did not qualify for a medevac attempt and conditions at the base would not permit an earlier flight, Douceur and her supporters brought the situation to media attention.|$|E
500|$|During the 1920s professors from Boston and Harvard Universities {{left the}} {{confines}} of their campuses and traveled to teach courses <b>offsite.</b> [...] While they were primarily aimed at teachers, courses were offered wherever 40 or more students expressed an interest. [...] Professors traveled {{on a weekly basis}} to places around New England and as far away as Yonkers, New York.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to its exhibit halls, the Tennessee Aquarium includes two public <b>offsite</b> facilities. [...] The River Gorge Explorer, a 65-foot catamaran tour boat, offers daily tours of the nearby Tennessee River Gorge and other sites along the Tennessee River, boarding from the public pier in Ross's Landing Park adjacent to the aquarium. [...] The aquarium also operates an IMAX 3D theater.|$|E

[...] Professors traveled {{on a weekly basis}} to places around New England and as far away as Yonkers, New York, some 200 miles away.|$|E
500|$|The Keystone agency, who {{had offered}} him <b>offsite</b> work, {{required}} {{him to stay in}} the company's studio. KertÃ©sz tried to return to France to visit, but had no money. [...] By the time he had saved enough, World War II had begun and travel to France was nearly impossible. His struggles with English compounded his problems. Years after learning to speak French in Paris, it was difficult for him to learn another new language. [...] The lack of fluent language added to his feeling like an outsider.|$|E
500|$|While {{designing}} the Eisenhower Tunnel, controversies erupted {{over how to}} build the portions over Vail Pass and Glenwood Canyon. The route of US6 over Vail Pass has a distinctive [...] "V" [...] shape. Initially engineers thought they could shorten the route of I-70 by about [...] by tunneling from Gore Creek to South Willow Creek, an alternative known as the Red Buffalo Tunnel. This alternative sparked a nationwide controversy as it would require an easement across federally protected lands, through {{what is now called}} the Eagles Nest Wilderness. After the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture refused to grant the easement, the engineers agreed to follow the existing route across Vail Pass. The engineers added infrastructure to accommodate wildlife, and had significant portions of the viaducts constructed <b>offsite</b> and lifted in place to minimize the environmental footprint. The grade over Vail Pass reaches seven percent.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is viewed}} by a woman named Tara and her son Brent from a cage below the {{observation}} room, which contains a tank of hydrofluoric acid and a switch marked [...] "Live" [...] and [...] "Die". Pamela awakens in another cage {{on the other side}} of the room. During the game, Hoffman is called away by Erickson and Perez, who found the Baxter audio tape and are having it unscrambled by an <b>offsite</b> technician. They inform him that abnormalities were found in Strahm's fingerprints, and Erickson eventually reveals their knowledge of Strahm's death. The moment his voice is unscrambled, Hoffman attacks and kills everyone in the room, learning from Perez that [...] "everyone" [...] in the law enforcement may know of his implication in the games. [...] He plants fingerprints using Strahm's severed hand, before dowsing fuel on the room and setting it on fire to destroy the evidence.|$|E
500|$|On 17 January 2012, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie {{signed into}} law a bill that legalized direct {{shipping}} from wineries to consumers, and permits New Jersey wineries to open as many as 15 <b>offsite</b> retail sales outlets in the state. The law allows wineries that make less than 250,000 gallons of wine annually, which includes all of New Jersey's wineries, to ship up to 12 cases of wine to per year to any person over 21 in New Jersey or any other state that allows wine shipments. Because this prohibits 90% of wine made in the United States, but does not affect New Jersey's small wineries, proponents of the law fear that {{this section of the}} law will be struck down as unconstitutional. [...] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit had struck down a similar limit in Massachusetts in 2008 in light of the United States Supreme Court decision addressing direct shipping laws a few years earlier.|$|E
