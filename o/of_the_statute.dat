5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute,</b> and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration the object <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute,</b> to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute.</b> The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E

5|$|Coke became {{involved}} in the now classic Shelley's Case in 1581, which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today; the case also established Coke's reputation as an attorney and case reporter.

The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted. This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence.

5|$|In 2004, the 1963 statute {{came under}} {{criticism}} because it states {{the sun in}} the state seal is setting rather than rising.

40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{significant}} new features that {{is included in}} the new statutesof autonomy are the so-called territorial declarations or charters <b>of</b> citizens'rights. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study is to analyse this from two different but complementaryperspectives.

Second, that these charters are regulations which as faras the citizen is concerned, complement constitutional rights and bring themup to date them with new content...|$|R

50|$|Adjudication on <b>the</b> {{constitutionality}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statutes</b> is an adjudication {{system which}} nullifies <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> {{that has been}} found unconstitutional by <b>the</b> review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court.

5|$|This step is {{necessary}} because the rational nexus test is not foolproof. The test {{is based on}} the presumption that the legislative object itself is not in violation of the Constitution.

5|$|Canada's {{aboriginal}} peoples had {{systems of}} governance organised {{in a fashion}} similar to the Occidental concept of monarchy; European explorers often referred to hereditary leaders of tribes as kings.

The country became a self-governing confederation on 1 July 1867, recognised as a kingdom in its own right, but did not have full legislative autonomy from the British Crown until the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Statute</b> of Westminster on 11 December 1931, retaining the then reigning monarch, George V, as monarch of the newly formed monarchy of Canada.

5|$|Canadian {{independence}} from the United Kingdom grew gradually {{over the course of}} many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. World War I and World War II, in particular, gave rise to a desire among Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship. Legislative independence was established with the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Statute</b> of Westminster 1931, the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 took effect on January 1, 1947, and full sovereignty was achieved with the patriation of the constitution in 1982. Canada's nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom. Legislation since the mid-20th century represents Canadians' commitment to multilateralism and socioeconomic development.|$|E

Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud.

5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E
