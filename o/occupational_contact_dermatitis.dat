40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Occupational</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{occupational}} diseases in Europe. In order to develop effective preventive measures, detailed and up-to-date data on the incidence, main causes and professions at risk of <b>occupational</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> are needed. OBJECTIVES: To describe the pattern of patch test reactivity to allergens in the European baseline series of patients with <b>occupational</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in different occupations. METHODS: We analysed data collected by the European Surveillance System on Contact Allergy (ESSCA) network from 2002 to 2010, from 11 European countries. RESULTS: Allergens in the European baseline series associated with an at least doubled risk of <b>occupational</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> include: thiuram rubber chemical accelerators, epoxy resin, and the antimicrobials methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone, methyldibromo glutaronitrile, and formaldehyde. The highest risk of <b>occupational</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> was found in occupations classified as 'other personal services workers', which includes hairdressers, nursing and other healthcare professionals, precision workers in metal and related materials, and blacksmiths, tool-makers and related trades workers.

The two most important occupational hazards for cement workers are irritant and allergic cement <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the severity of <b>occupational</b> cement <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and the common allergens among cement workers in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 97 cement workers from the Cement Workers’ Association of Tainan City and County participated in this study. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate the demographic data and work-related activities of these cement workers. A complete skin examination was conducted, and skin manifestations were assessed by a dermatologist. Allergens from European Standard Tray (Chemotechnique Diagnostic AB, Sweden) with a total of 25 substances were used for patch testing. Results: Our results showed that 65 out of 97 cement workers were suffering from <b>occupational</b> cement hand <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> The most affected skin area was the hand. Thickening of the dorsal surface of the hand, especially around the metacarpophalangeal joint area, and hyperkeratosis of the palm were the major skin manifestations. The results of the patch test showed that 24 out of 97 were allergic to potassium dichromate, nine were allergic to thiuram mix, nine were allergic to fragrance mix and seven were allergic to cobalt chloride.

The outcomes were assessed by measurements of erythema, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and natural moisturizing factor (NMF) levels. In the AD volunteers, repeated AcA exposure led to barrier disruption and significant TEWL increase; no significant differences after the same exposure in the healthy controls were found. Repeated exposure to SLS and the irritant tandems enhanced the reactions and resulted in a significantly higher increase in TEWL in the AD compared to the control group.

Methods and Results: This study involved 78 participants (30 dental professionals and 48 referents). A questionnaire survey as well as skin patch testing with formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde was conducted. The incidence of <b>occupational</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> to formaldehyde among the population investigated was 28. 2 %, and of glutaraldehyde, 24. 4 %. <b>Occupational</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> to formaldehyde was found to be of a significantly higher incidence among dental professionals.

In order to highlight this issue, a 32 -year-old male patient working in an invitation card fabric is presented in this case report. Irritant {{contact dermatitis}} secondary to “petroleum naphta” was present in the patient’s arms. Another important feature of this case, as far as we know, this is the first case of irritant contact dermatitis due to naphtha in the literature. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Five {{workers from}} a plant {{manufacturing}} concrete wall panels and beams {{were referred to}} our department because of suspected occupational dermatitis. When patch tested, 3 workers reacted to potassium dichromate. Four workers reacted to ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, without any obvious exposure. Owing to the high proportion of workers with recent-onset skin disease, an investigation of all workers at the plant was initiated. Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of occupational dermatitis and contact allergy in the workers at the plant. Methods: All 24 workers at the plant underwent a clinical investigation and were patch tested. Results: Four cases of allergic <b>occupational</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and 3 cases of irritant <b>occupational</b> <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> were diagnosed. Contact allergy to potassium dichromate was found in 4 workers. All 4 also reacted to ethylenediamine dihydrochloride and/or amines that were present as additives in the cement. Conclusions: Chromate contact allergy can still be found in concrete workers, despite the legislation regulating the amount of hexavalent chromium (chromate) in cement. Occupational contact allergy to amines {{can be found in}} workers exposed to cement and concrete, so amines should be tested in these workers...|$|E
40|$|Wet work {{tasks are}} the most common {{exposures}} leading to <b>occupational</b> irritant <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Use of liquid-proof gloves is recommended when performing wet work, however, gloves may also contribute to impairment of the skin barrier and development of irritant <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} review the literature on the effects of glove occlusion on skin barrier function. The PubMed database was searched up to 1 February 2015 for articles on the association between glove occlusion and skin barrier function, including human studies only and in English. Only experimental studies including assessment of the skin barrier function were included in the data analysis. Thirteen articles were identified, 8 with focus on occlusion alone, 7 with focus on occlusion in combination with irritant exposure (some overlapping), and 2 field studies. In conclusion, data from the literature showed that the negative effect of occlusion in itself is limited, and that only extensive and long-term occlusion will cause barrier impairment. However, studies investigating combined effect of occlusion and exposure to soaps/detergents indicate that occlusion significantly enhances the skin barrier damage caused by detergents/soaps in a dose-response fashio...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Recent {{years have}} seen {{increased}} levels of production and consumption of seafood, leading to more frequent reporting of allergic reactions in occupational and domestic settings. This review focuses on occupational allergy in the fishing and seafood processing industry.  REVIEW—Workers involved in either manual or automated processing of crabs, prawns, mussels, fish, and fishmeal production are commonly exposed to various constituents of seafood. Aerosolisation of seafood and cooking fluid during processing are potential occupational situations {{that could result in}} sensitisation through inhalation. There is great variability of aerosol exposure within and among various jobs with reported allergen concentrations ranging from 0. 001  to 5. 061 (µg/m 3). Occupational dermal exposure occurs as a result of unprotected handling of seafood and its byproducts. Occupational allergies have been reported in workers exposed to arthropods (crustaceans), molluscs, pisces (bony fish) and other agents derived from seafood. The prevalence of occupational asthma ranges from 7 % to 36 %, and for <b>occupational</b> protein <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> from 3 % to 11 %. These health outcomes are mainly due to high molecular weight proteins in seafood causing an IgE mediated response. Cross reactivity between various species within a major seafood grouping also occurs. Limited evidence from dose-response relations indicate that development of symptoms is related to duration or intensity of exposure. The evidence for atopy as a risk factor for occupational sensitisation and asthma is supportive, whereas evidence for cigarette smoking is limited. Disruption of the intact skin barrier seems to be an important added risk factor for <b>occupational</b> protein <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b>  CONCLUSION—The range of allergic disease associated with occupational exposure to crab is well characterised, whereas for other seafood agents the evidence is somewhat limited. There is a need for further epidemiological studies to better characterise this risk. More detailed characterisation of specific protein antigens in aerosols and associated establishment of dose-response relations for acute and chronic exposure to seafood; the respective roles of skin contact and inhalational exposure in allergic sensitisation and cross reactivity; and the contribution of host associated factors in the development of occupational seafood allergies are important areas for future research.    Keywords: occupational seafood allergy; <b>occupational</b> asthma; protein <b>contact</b> dermatiti...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Dental {{professionals}} may be {{at increased}} risk of developing occupational allergic diseases specially to methacrylates that can permeate protective disposable gloves. Case report. We presented a case of <b>occupational</b> allergic <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in a 28 -year-old dental technician. The patient had complained of itching and cracking of fingers for 6 months. The dermatitis improved over weekends. Skin erythema and scaling were present with primarily involvement of the fingertips. Patch testing with dental series gave positive vesicular reaction to methyl methacrylate. Follow-up after 6 months of allergen avoidance showed a complete regression of dermatitis. Conclusion. Methacrylates serve as bases for acrylic resins which are used in prosthetics. Methyl methacrylate as a small molecular acrylate can permeate thin protective disposable gloves. Using adequate personal protective equipment, like nitrile rubber gloves, {{is the most important}} preventive measure in this occupation. Health practitioners should recognize possible occupational hazards in dentistry and implement appropriate preventive measures to protect health of workers...|$|R
