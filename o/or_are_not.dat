5|$|The Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire or RADQ {{is one of}} {{the better}} known of these checklists and is used by {{attachment}} therapists and others. The checklist includes 93 discrete behaviours, many of which either overlap with other disorders, like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> related to attachment difficulties. Critics assert that it is unvalidated and lacks specificity.|$|E

25|$|The {{control panel}} applet divides the {{monitored}} criteria into categories and color-codes them. Yellow indicates a non-critical warning, e.g. some settings {{are not being}} monitored <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> optimal.

50|$|Although Wi-Fi {{technology}} is popular for consumer home networks, G.hn is also {{intended for use}} in this application. G.hn is an adequate solution for consumers in situations in which using wireless <b>is</b> <b>not</b> needed (for example, to connect a stationary device like a TV or a network-attached storage device), <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> desired (due to security concerns) <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> feasible (for example, due to limited range of wireless signals).|$|R
25|$|A more {{practical}} {{choice is to}} drop the two-port approach altogether, and use various alternatives based on signal flow graph theory, including the Rosenstark method, the Choma method, and use of Blackman's theorem. That choice may be advisable if small-signal device models are complex, <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> available (for example, the devices are known only numerically, perhaps from measurement or from SPICE simulations).|$|E
25|$|The School {{operates}} on an independent, fee-charging basis, {{with a few}} scholarships and means-tested bursaries. It selects pupils {{by the use of}} entrance exams. Pupils appear in examination league tables (though the statistics are not directly comparable to state schools <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> published, such as value added) and in university entrances, and the school typically sends between 6 and 12 students to Oxford and Cambridge every year.|$|E

Pieces move either orthogonally (that is, forward, backward, left, or right, {{in the direction of}} one of the arms of a plus sign, +), or diagonally (in the direction of one of the arms of a multiplication sign, ×). The lion and knight are exceptions in that they do not move, <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> required to move, in a straight line.|$|E

The two systems of higher education - university and polytechnic - are linked, and it is possible to transfer {{from one to the other}} through extraordinary effort. It is also possible to transfer from a private institution to a public one (or vice versa) on the same basis.|$|E
25|$|Topical immunosuppressants like pimecrolimus and {{tacrolimus}} may {{be better}} {{in the short term}} and appear equal to steroids after a year of use. Their use is reasonable in those who do not respond to <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> tolerant of steroids. Treatments are typically recommended for short or fixed periods of time rather than indefinitely. Tacrolimus 0.1% has generally proved more effective than pimecrolimus, and equal in effect to mid-potency topical steroids. There is no link to increased risk of cancer from topical use of 1% pimecrolimus cream.|$|E

Its office is to establish if laws and treaties are <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> in conformity with the constitution, and to monitor the regularity of referendums and legislative and presidential elections. It also intervenes to solve conflicts among a State's institutions.|$|E

According to the U.S. Census in 2011, 25.3 million people are considered limited English proficient, accounting for 9% of the U.S. population. Hospitals frequently admit LEP patients for treatment. With cultural and linguistic barriers, {{it is not surprising that}} it is hard to achieve effective communication between the health care providers and the LEP patients.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia has classically been {{associated}} with disturbances to interoception with people hyper-focused on their bodies. People with anorexia concentrate on distorted perceptions of their body exterior in fear of weight gain, and they also report altered physical states within their bodies, such as indistinct feelings of fullness <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> able to distinguish emotional states from bodily sensations in general (also called alexithymia). Further, people with anorexia experience abnormally intense cardiorespiratory sensations, particularly of the breath, and this is most prevalent before they consume a meal. Abnormal senses of interoceptive awareness such as these have been observed so frequently in anorexia that they have become key characteristics of the illness.|$|E
25|$|Drinks {{especially}} high in simple sugars, such as {{soft drinks and}} fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase dehydration. A too rich solution in the gut draws water {{from the rest of}} the body, just as if the person were to drink sea water. Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable <b>or</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> palatable. Additionally, a mix of both plain water and drinks perhaps too rich in sugar and salt can alternatively be given to the same person, with the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.|$|E
