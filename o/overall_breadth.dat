40|$|As biology {{education}} is being redesigned toward an interdisciplinary focus and as pedagogical trends move toward active-learning strategies and investigative experiences, a {{restructuring of the}} course content for the Introductory Biology course is necessary. The introductory course in biology has typically been a survey of all the biosciences. If {{the total number of}} topics covered is reduced, is the students’ overall knowledge of biology also reduced? Our introductory course has been substantially modified away from surveying the biological sciences and toward providing a deep understanding of a particular biological topic, as well as focusing on developing students’ analytical and communication skills. Because of this shift to a topic-driven approach for the introductory course, we were interested in assessing our graduating students’ overall knowledge of the various biological disciplines. Using the Major Field Test - Biology (Educational Testing Service (ETS), Princeton, NJ), we compared the test performance of graduating students who had a traditional lecture-based introductory course to those who had a topic-driven active-learning introductory course. Our results suggest that eliminating the traditional survey of biology and, instead, focusing on quantitative and writing skills at the introductory level do not affect our graduating students’ <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> of knowledge of the various biosciences...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that elite {{controllers}} with minimal effector T cell responses harbor a low-frequency, readily ex-pandable, highly functional, and broadly directed memory population. Here, we interrogated the in vivo relevance of this cell population by investigating whether the breadth of expandable memory responses is associated with the magnitude of residual viremia in individuals achieving durable suppression of HIV infection. HIV-specific memory CD 8 T cells were expanded by using autologous epitopic and variant peptides. Viral load was measured by an ultrasensitive single-copy PCR assay. Following expansion, controllers showed a greater increase in the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> of Gag responses than did untreated progressors (P 0. 01) as well as treated progressors (P 0. 0003). Nef- and Env-specific memory cells expanded poorly for all groups, and their expanded breadths were indistinguishable among groups (P 0. 9 for Nef as determined by a Kruskal-Wallis test; P 0. 6 for Env as determined by a Kruskal-Wallis test). More importantly, we show that the breadth of expandable, previously unde-tectable Gag-specific responses was inversely correlated with residual viral load (r 0. 6; P 0. 009). Together, these data re-veal a direct link between the abundance of Gag-specific expandable memory responses and prolongedmaintenance of low-level viremia.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of the cross-reactive, or heterologous, neutralizing antibody responses developed during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection and the identification of factors associated with their generation {{are relevant to the}} development of an HIV vaccine. We report that in healthy HIV-positive, antiretroviral-naïve subjects, the breadth of plasma heterologous neutralizing antibody responses correlates with the time since infection, plasma viremia levels, and the binding avidity of anti-Env antibodies. Anti-CD 4 -binding site antibodies are responsible for the exceptionally broad cross-neutralizing antibody responses recorded only in rare plasma samples. However, in most cases examined, antibodies to the variable regions and to the CD 4 -binding site of Env modestly contributed in defining the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> of these responses. Plasmas with broad cross-neutralizing antibody responses were identified that targeted the gp 120 subunit, but their precise epitopes mapped outside the variable regions and the CD 4 -binding site. Finally, although several plasmas were identified with cross-neutralizing antibody responses that were not directed against gp 120, only one plasma with a moderate breadth of heterologous neutralizing antibody responses contained cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against the 4 E 10 epitope, which is within the gp 41 transmembrane subunit. Overall, our study indicates that more than one pathway leads to the development of broad cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies during HIV infection and that the virus continuously escapes their action...|$|E

This study of 48 Vietnamese adults with secondary dengue virus infections defined the breadth and magnitude of peripheral T-cell {{responses to}} 260 overlapping peptide antigens derived from a dengue virus serotype 2 (DV 2) isolate. Forty-seven different peptides evoked significant gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay responses in 39 patients; of these, 34 peptides contained potentially novel T-cell epitopes. NS 3 and particularly NS 3200 - 324 were important T-cell targets. The breadth and magnitude of ELISPOT responses to DV 2 peptides were independent of the infecting dengue virus serotype, suggesting that cross-reactive T cells dominate the acute response during secondary infection. Acute ELISPOT responses were weakly correlated with the extent of hemoconcentration in individual patients {{but not with the}} nadir of thrombocytopenia or overall clinical disease grade. NS 3556 - 564 and Env 414 - 422 were identified as novel HLA-A* 24 and B* 07 -restricted CD 8 + T-cell epitopes, respectively. Acute T-cell responses to natural variants of Env 414 - 422 and NS 3556 - 564 were largely cross-reactive and peaked during disease convalescence.

40|$|Objective Health {{information}} exchange (HIE) systems {{are being developed}} across the nation. Understanding approaches taken by existing successful exchanges can help new exchange efforts determine goals and plan implementations. The goal {{of this study was}} to explore characteristics of use and users of a successful regional HIE. Design We used a mixed-method analysis, consisting of cross-sectional audit log data, semi-structured interviews, and direct observation in a sample of emergency departments and ambulatory safety net clinics actively using HIE. For each site, we measured overall usage trends, user logon statistics, and data types accessed by users. We also assessed reasons for use and outcomes of use. Results Overall, users accessed HIE for 6. 8 % of all encounters, with higher rates of access for repeat visits, for patients with comorbidities, for patients known to have data in the exchange, and at sites providing HIE access to both nurses and physicians. Discharge summaries and test reports were the most frequently accessed data in the exchange. Providers consistently noted retrieving additional history, preventing repeat tests, comparing new results to retrieved results, and avoiding hospitalizations as a consequence of HIE access. Conclusion HIE use in emergency departments and ambulatory clinics was focused on patients where missing information was believed to be present in the exchange and was related to factors including the roles of people with access, the setting, and other site-specific issues that impacted the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> of routine system use.

40|$|AbstractHigh-performance {{stretchable}} electronics have {{to utilize}} high-quality inorganic electronic {{materials such as}} silicon, oxide or nitride dielectrics, and metals. These inorganic materials usually crack or yield at very small intrinsic strains, for example, 1 %, whereas bio-integrated electronics are expected to at least match the stretchability of bio-tissues (20 %) and deployable structure health monitoring networks are expected to expand from wafer scale (several centimeters) to cover macroscopic structures (several meters). To minimize strains in inorganic materials under large deformation, metallic and ceramic films can be patterned into serpentine-shaped ribbons. When the ribbon is stretched, some sections of the ribbon can rotate and/or buckle to accommodate the applied displacement, leaving much smaller intrinsic strain in the materials compared to the applied strain. The choice of {{the shape of the}} serpentine depends on systematic studies of the geometric variables. This paper investigates the effect of serpentine shapes on their stretchability and compliance through theoretical, numerical, and experimental means. Our closed-form curved beam solutions, FEM results, and experimental measurements have found good agreement with one another. Our results conclude that in general, the narrower ribbon, the larger arc radius and arc angle, and the longer arm length will yield lower intrinsic strain and effective stiffness. When the arm length approaches infinite, the stretchability can be enhanced by several orders. A few unexpected behaviors are found at arc angles that are close to straight bars. With additional practical constraints such as minimum ribbon width and finite <b>overall</b> <b>breadth,</b> the optimal serpentine shape can be accurately determined using our closed-form analytical solution...|$|E

40|$|As {{evidenced}} {{from the}} Korean archaeological record, {{there is an}} increased use of plant domesticates {{and a decrease in}} other food sources during the Holocene. These changes in <b>overall</b> human diet <b>breadth</b> culminate with the Late Neolithic-Bronze Age (c. 3500 B. P.) transition where dependence on hunted and gathered food packages decreases during the former period and full-scale agriculture becomes the norm during the latter cultural stage. This dietary shift appears to coincide with Holocene shoreline stabilization and overall large-scale population increase and movement through time. It is proposed here that two primary reasons exist for the change in overall diet breadth: (1) increasing shoreline stabilization during the Holocene and (2) an increase in hunter-gatherer population pressure due to a sedentary lifestyle. Both of these factors would have led to some degree of territorial circumscription, resulting in a progressive decline in overall hunter-gatherer foraging efficiency. In turn, this would have prompted the Holocene Korean Peninsular peoples to find other ways to offset their lowered overall foraging efficiency that had originally focused primarily on higher-ranked food resources (e. g., deer, wild boar). In this case, Korean peoples expanded their <b>overall</b> diet <b>breadth</b> to include a lower-ranked set of food packages (e. g., fish, shellfish) that by the advent of the Bronze Age eventually included plant domesticates regularly.

The purpose of this project is to properly inform the Sunflower Project and reinforce or modify its existing goals. I interviewed thirty local women about food-ways and wealth indicators, including agricultural resources and occupations. Scatter-plots of estimated income (with and without agricultural wealth) versus reported frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption indicated no relationship, nor did wealth inequality appear to affect the <b>overall</b> dietary <b>breadth</b> of households sampled. Income did have a significant association with <b>overall</b> dietary <b>breadth.</b> Distance to market has a negative impact on fruit and vegetable consumption, but analysis was complicated by mobile grocery routes. Living off the main grocery route reduces average weekly fruit and vegetable consumption by two servings. Analysis of foods consumed by each household, as reported in interviews, indicated preference towards fruits over vegetables and proteins over dairy. Given these observations, the Sunflower Project should conduct educational activities and recommend home projects with low resource requirements and high nutritional impact potential. The Sunflower Project should also explore heat resistant varieties of broccoli, which interview participants found desirable. Effort towards increasing vegetable consumption in the communities will require solutions to the reported obstacles to consumption, most notably access, cost, and storage of fruits and vegetables.

40|$|Competition often occurs between {{sympatric}} {{species that}} exploit similar ecological niches. Among canids, competition {{may be reduced}} by partitioning resources such as food, time, and habitat, but the mechanisms of coexistence remain poorly understood, particularly among fox species. We described the food habits of two foxes that live sympatrically across northern and central Asia, the corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) and red fox (V. vulpes), by analyzing scats collected during a field study in Mongolia. We analyzed 829 corsac and 995 red fox scats collected from April 2005 to August 2007 and tested {{the extent to which}} food partitioning occurred. The diets of both species consisted mainly of insects followed by rodents, but also included birds, reptiles, large mammal remains (carrion), plant material (including fruits and seeds), and garbage. Despite high overlap in the proportion of food items consumed, differences existed between species in overall diet with corsacs more frequently consuming beetles, but proportionally fewer crickets and large mammal remains than red foxes. We detected interspecific differences during the pup rearing and dispersal seasons, when prey was abundant, but not during the breeding season, when prey was scarce and diet overlap highest. Each species' diet also differed seasonally and exhibited moderate <b>overall</b> <b>breadth.</b> Corsacs consumed proportionally more beetles and rodents during pup rearing and crickets during dispersal relative to other seasons, whereas red foxes consumed proportionally more crickets during pup rearing and dispersal and more rodents and large mammals during pup rearing and breeding relative to other seasons.

40|$|The {{restricted}} neutralization {{breadth of}} vaccine-elicited antibodies {{is a major}} limitation of current human immunodeficiency virus- 1 (HIV- 1) candidate vaccines. In order to permit the efficient identification of vaccines with enhanced capacity for eliciting cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and to assess the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> and potency of vaccine-elicited NAb reactivity, we assembled a panel of 109 molecularly cloned HIV- 1 Env pseudoviruses representing {{a broad range of}} genetic and geographic diversity. Viral isolates from all major circulating genetic subtypes were included, as were viruses derived shortly after transmission and during the early and chronic stages of infection. We assembled a panel of genetically diverse HIV- 1 -positive (HIV- 1 +) plasma pools to assess the neutralization sensitivities of the entire virus panel. When the viruses were rank ordered according to the average sensitivity to neutralization by the HIV- 1 + plasmas, a continuum of average sensitivity was observed. Clustering analysis of the patterns of sensitivity defined four subgroups of viruses: those having very high (tier 1 A), above-average (tier 1 B), moderate (tier 2), or low (tier 3) sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization. We also investigated potential associations between characteristics of the viral isolates (clade, stage of infection, and source of virus) and sensitivity to NAb. In particular, higher levels of NAb activity were observed when the virus and plasma pool were matched in clade. These data provide the first systematic assessment of the overall neutralization sensitivities of a genetically and geographically diverse panel of circulating HIV- 1 strains. These reference viruses can facilitate the systematic characterization of NAb responses elicited by candidate vaccine immunogens...|$|E
40|$|In HIV-infected persons, certain HLA class I alleles are {{associated}} with effective control of viremia, while others {{are associated}} with rapid disease progression. Among the most divergent clinical outcomes are the relatively good prognosis in HLA-B* 5801 expressing persons and poor prognosis with HLA-B* 5802. These two alleles differ by only three amino acids in regions involved in HLA-peptide recognition. This study evaluated a cohort of over 1000 persons with chronic HIV clade C virus infection to determine whether clinical outcome differences associated with B* 5801 (n = 93) and B* 5802 (n = 259) expression {{are associated with}} differences in HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 (+) T cell responses. The <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> and magnitude of HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 (+) T cell responses were lower in persons expressing B* 5802, and epitope presentation by B* 5802 contributed significantly less to the overall response as compared to B* 5801 -restricted CD 8 (+) T cells. Moreover, viral load in B* 5802 -positive persons was higher and CD 4 cell counts lower when this allele contributed to the overall CD 8 (+) T cell response, which was detected exclusively through a single epitope in Env. In addition, persons heterozygous for B* 5802 compared to persons homozygous for other HLA-B alleles had significantly higher viral loads. Viral sequencing revealed strong selection pressure mediated through B* 5801 -restricted responses but not through B* 5802. These data indicate that minor differences in HLA sequence can {{have a major impact}} on epitope recognition, and that selective targeting of Env through HLA-B* 5802 is at least ineffectual if not actively adverse in the containment of viremia. These results provide experimental evidence that not all epitope-specific responses contribute to immune containment, a better understanding of which is essential to shed light on mechanisms involved in HIV disease progression...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} feature of a potential vaccine against HIV is the production of broadly neutralising antibodies (BrNAbs) capable of potentially blocking infectivity of a diverse array of HIV strains. BrNAbs naturally arise in some HIV infected individuals {{after several years of}} infection and their serum IgG can neutralise various HIV strains across different subtypes. We previously showed that vaccination of cows with HIV gp 140 AD 8 trimers resulted in a high titre of serum IgG against HIV envelope (Env) that had strong BrNAb activity. These polyclonal BrNAbs concentrated into the colostrum during the late stage of pregnancy and can be harvested in vast quantities immediately after calving. In this study, we investigated the effect of prolonged HIV gp 140 vaccination on bovine colostrum IgG HIV Env-binding and BrNAb activity over subsequent pregnancies. Repeated immunisation led to a maintained high titre of HIV Env specific IgG in the colostrum batches, but this did not increase through repeated cycles. Colostrum IgG from all batches also strongly competed with sCD 4 binding to gp 140 Env trimer and with human-derived monoclonal VRC 01 and b 12 BrNAbs that bind the CD 4 binding site (CD 4 bs). Furthermore, competition neutralisation assays using RSC 3 Env gp 120 protein core and a derivative CD 4 bs mutant, RSC 3 Δ 371 I/P 363 N, showed that CD 4 bs neutralising antibodies contribute to the neutralising activity of all batches of purified bovine colostrum IgG. This result indicates that the high IgG titre/avidity of anti-CD 4 bs antibodies with BrNAb activity was achieved {{during the first year of}} vaccination and was sustained throughout the years of repeated vaccinations in the cow tested. Although IgG of subsequent colostrum batches may have a higher avidity towards the CD 4 bs, the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> in neutralisation was not enhanced.

Researchers have been investigating the pervasiveness of earnings management and incentives that induce earnings management. However, the evidence is mixed and studies of using Australian data are scarce. This thesis is an empirical investigation of earnings management in the Australian context addressing if and why Australian firms engage in earnings management. Based on a sample covering all ASX listed firms during the period of 2000 to 2006, this study examines the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> and scope of earnings management behaviour in a broad context across Australian industry sectors and individual firms’ characteristics. The result suggests that Australian firms engage in earnings management. The level of earnings management practices in some specific industries and the association of these practices with firms’ characteristics may help the assessment and improvement of the overall quality of financial reporting. Based on a sub-sample, this study also examines whether the practices of earnings {{management is}} induced by executive compensation incentives. It extends prior research by using more relevant, recent, and large-scale compensation data to capture the dynamic relations between earnings management and different forms of executive pay. Such dynamic relations may be of interest to compensation committees in designing compensation structures that balance the incentives to improve firms’ performances with the incentive to earnings manipulation. This study also examines whether earnings management is induced by benchmark beating incentives. It extends prior research by examining under what circumstance managers are more likely to beat benchmarks. The results suggest that managers beat two earnings benchmarks: reporting profits and sustaining prior year’s earnings. More importantly, managers are more likely to exercise positive discretionary accruals to inflate earnings to beat ex post benchmarks when the true earnings are below relevant benchmarks. This will be of interest to regulators as an effective way to detect earnings management may be pronounced when the ex ante condition under which firms seek to manipulate earnings is identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} bias voltage and the {{presence}} of easily-ionized elements (EIEs) on the spatial distribution of excited-state atoms and ions of Cu, Ag, Cs and Ca in furnace atomization plasma emission spectrometry is presented. The dc bias of the centre electrode significantly affects the spatial distribution of He I, Cu I, Ag I, Cs I, and Ca II emission in the absence of EIEs. A reasonably uniform distribution of excited-state analyte atoms over the central cross-section of the tube occurs when the centre electrode is self-biased during the course of an atomization transient. A depleted area of Cs I emission around the centre electrode coupled with enhanced Ca II emission in the same region reveals that ionization of analytes is most pronounced in this region. With positive dc bias, concentric rings of enhanced emission occur between the centre electrode and the tube wall for analyte atoms and the He I plasma gas, although the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> of analyte emission distribution is decreased. With NaCl, NaNO 3 and CsCl serving as EIEs, analyte emission from Ag I, Cu I and Ca II in the region between the centre electrode and the tube wall is strongly suppressed with self-bias. The degree of the suppression depends on the extent of vapour cloud overlap between analyte and EIE. In general, equimolar amounts of NaNO 3 and CsCl suppress analyte emission similarly and both produce a greater suppression than NaCl. Equal amounts of Fe, added as an interfering matrix, produces a suppression of analyte emission similar to that of EIEs, suggesting that the primary cause of suppression is the loss of energy from the plasma (as photons) due to excitation and ionization of matrix vapour. Control of the dc bias enhances the radial distribution of excited analyte atoms in the presence of EIEs and Fe, but only at low (2 ̆ 2642 5 g) interferent loadings.

Sixty intravenous drug users infected with HIV- 1 circulating recombinant form 07 _BC (CRF 07 _BC), which has been spreading rapidly in western China from north to south, were recruited from Xinjiang, China to assess the HIV- 1 -specific T cell responses at single peptide level with overlapping peptides (OLP) covering the whole concensus clades B and C proteome. Results The median of the total magnitude and total number of OLPs recognized by CTL responses were 10925 SFC/million PBMC and 25 OLPs, respectively, when tested by clade C peptides, which {{was significantly higher than}} when tested by clade B peptides. The immunodominant regions, which cover 14 % (58 / 413) of the HIV- 1 proteome, are widely distributed throughout the HIV- 1 proteome except in Tat, Vpu and Pol-PR, with Gag, Pol-RT, Pol-Int and Nef being most frequently targeted. The subdominant epitopes are mostly located in p 24, Nef, integrase, Vpr and Vif. Of the responses directed to clade C OLPs, 61. 75 % (972 / 1574) can be observed when tested with corresponding clade B OLPs. However, Pol-PR and Vpu tend to be targeted in the clade B sequence rather than the clade C sequence, which is in line with the recombinant pattern of CRF 07 _BC. Stronger and broader CTL responses in subjects with CD 4 cell counts ranging from 200 to 400 /mm 3 were observed when compared to those with less than 200 /mm 3 or more than 400 /mm 3, though there have been no significant correlations identified between the accumulative CTL responses or <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> and CD 4 cell count or plasma viral load. Conclusion This is the first study conducted to comprehensively address T cell responses in Chinese subjects infected with HIV- 1 CRF 07 _BC in which subtle differences in cross-reactivity were observed, though similar patterns of overall immune responses were demonstrated with clade B infected populations. The immunodominant regions identified in this population can facilitate future HIV- 1 vaccine development in China. </p...|$|E

50|$|The {{painting}} of Bhaisajyaguru is substantially {{the same as}} Sakyamuni in composition and color tone. The Buddha is enthroned on a lotus throne atop a wood grain colored altar of Sumidan, seated in the lotus position underneath a white lotus canopy. Like the statue of Prabhutaratna before him, Bhaisajyaguru's hands are in the vitarka mudrā, with the thumb and middle finger touching while the remaining fingers are extended, the left hand raised while the right rests on the leg. A medicine box is held in the left hand, the lower half decorated in a fret and the upper half colored green. The facial features match Sakyamuni, but the head and ushinisha have been rendered in lama style, from which auspicious beams of light stream out in three directions. Although the body is well-proportioned <b>overall,</b> the <b>breadth</b> of the knees appear small compared to the torso, {{in addition to being}} much smaller than the lower body of Sakyamuni. The Buddha's red robes display a rope curtain pattern of yellowish-white with a band of flowers and serrated half-circles embroidered along the ends. They are draped over the right shoulder, while an overcoat covers the left shoulder and has been lightly thrown over the right shoulder. The body is surrounded by a circular nimbus of cobalt blue and the head in a halo of green, both outlined in the five cardinal colors.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 (+) T cell {{responses}} to recognize epitope variants resulting from viral sequence variation in vivo {{may affect the}} ease with which HIV- 1 can escape T cell control and impact on the rate of disease progression in HIV- 1 -infected humans. Here, we studied the functional cross-reactivity of CD 8 responses to HIV- 1 epitopes restricted by HLA class I alleles associated with differential prognosis of infection. We show that the epitope-specific responses exhibiting the most efficient cross-recognition of amino acid-substituted variants were those strongly associated with delayed progression to disease. Not all epitopes restricted by the same HLA class I allele showed similar variant cross-recognition efficiency, consistent with the hypothesis that the reported associations between particular HLA class I alleles and rate of disease progression {{may be due to the}} quality of responses to certain "critical" epitopes. Irrespective of their efficiency of functional cross-recognition, CD 8 (+) T cells of all HIV- 1 epitope specificities examined showed focused TCR usage. Furthermore, interpatient variability in variant cross-reactivity correlated well with use of different dominant TCR Vbeta families, suggesting that flexibility is not conferred by the <b>overall</b> clonal <b>breadth</b> of the response but instead by properties of the dominant TCR(s) used for epitope recognition. A better understanding of the features of T cell responses associated with long-term control of viral replication should facilitate rational vaccine design...|$|R
40|$|Six {{bumble bee}} species were {{observed}} at Blandy Experimental Farm in total. The potentially declining and expanding species (_B. fervidus_ and _B. impatiens_) possessed the narrowest and widest diet breadths respectively. In addition to possessing specialist tendencies, _B. fervidus_ had little niche overlap with other {{species in the}} community (i. e. it visited plants other species were not visiting). Although _B. impatiens_ had the widest diet breadth and was also the most abundant species (50 % total collections), diet <b>breadth,</b> <b>overall,</b> {{was not associated with}} abundance (Spearman&#x 2019;s rho = 0. 37, p = 0. 46). However, we found that species abundance was positively correlated with abundance of most preferred host plant (Spearman&#x 2019;s rho = 0. 97, p = 0. 0012). The results {{of this study indicate that}} resource limitation may put _B. fervidus_ at risk of decline when preferred host plants are reduced or lost, whereas _B. impatiens_ may be resistant to extirpation due to its &#x 201 c;super-generalist&#x 201 d; tendencies. |$|R
40|$|Sex {{determination}} from skeletal {{human remains}} by discriminant function analysis {{is one of}} the methods utilized in the forensic and osteoarcheological sciences. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to establish metric standards for sex determination for medieval Anatolian populations using scapular measurements. The database for this research consisted of 93 adult skeletal remains (47 males and 46 females) from the Dilkaya medieval collection. Four measurements were taken: maximum scapular height, maximum scapular breadth, glenoid cavity height, glenoid cavity breadth, and subjected to discriminant function analysis. All measurements demonstrated some degree of sexual dimorphism, with the highest accuracy of sex determination (94. 8 %) obtained using maximum scapular <b>breadth.</b> <b>Overall</b> accuracies of the functions ranged from 82. 9 % to 95. 0 %, with a higher accuracy rate obtained for female skeletons than for males. Population specific discriminant formulas were developed using combinations of measurements, which can be used in ancient Anatolian populations...|$|R
