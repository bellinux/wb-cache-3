60|$|Julien was {{a little}} staggered. She looked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and laughed scornfully.|$|E
60|$|Then, he strolled {{towards the}} garden-paling, {{and took a}} look at the dahlias. They looked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> with a {{helpless}} drowsy hanging of their heads: which bobbed again, as the heavy drops of wet dripped off them.|$|E
6000|$|... "He noticed, too, {{that the}} Northman on meeting his eyes {{put on an}} elaborately {{surprised}} expression. At least, it seemed elaborated. Nothing could be trusted. And the Englishman felt himself with astonishing conviction faced by an enormous lie, solid like a wall, with no way round {{to get at the}} truth, whose ugly murderous face he seemed to see peeping <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a cynical grin.|$|E
60|$|She shivered all <b>over.</b> She looked <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{her face}} was {{suddenly}} strained.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the great}} ruffen pushing me!" [...] screamed {{a woman in}} front of Jan <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> when the rush was at its fiercest.|$|R
60|$|She {{broke off}} {{suddenly}} and glared <b>over</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the window. Her lower jaw dropped. Bailey {{turned his head}} sharply.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said lies;--lies;--lies!" [...] And Phineas walked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{as though}} he were going to pitch him {{instantly}} out of the window. [...] "You may go and write as many more as you like. It is your trade, and you must do it or starve. But do not come to me again." [...] Then {{he opened the door and}} stood with it in his hand.|$|E
60|$|At {{first he}} looks behind him often to assure himself that Jo is still really following. But look where he will, he still beholds him {{close to the}} {{opposite}} houses, making his way with his wary hand from brick to brick and from door to door, and often, as he creeps along, glancing <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> watchfully. Soon satisfied that {{the last thing in}} his thoughts is to give him the slip, Allan goes on, considering with a less divided attention what he shall do.|$|E
60|$|The woman peered <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a sneer on her face. Then she {{arranged}} the bottles in their places, {{and called out}} a noisy greeting to the Sicilian who was smoking silently among the shadows with only the red tip of his cigarette visible in the darkness. He made no reply. She yawned, and looked downward at the drunken man once more. There {{was no sign of}} life in his coarse face. He was wrapped deep in a drunken sleep, and he still had money in his pockets. Ah, well! It should be hers when these two strangers had gone.|$|E
60|$|He {{went out}} with Alfreton, and noticed that the lad ate little at lunch. When the meal was <b>over</b> he glanced <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a smile through the cigar smoke.|$|R
60|$|She did not {{certainly}} as she shook the popper laughingly, and looked <b>over</b> her shoulder <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> with the bloom of fire-light on her cheeks, its cheerfulness in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|He had the queerest {{impression}} {{that something had}} just peeped <b>over</b> the hedge <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> a queer big head. With round ears! He peered hard, {{but he could see}} nothing.|$|R
60|$|It was, indeed, a task {{which might}} make {{the heart of the}} bravest sink within him. The thin cord {{dangling}} down the face of the brown cliff seemed from above to reach little more than half-way down it. Beyond stretched the rugged rock, wet and shining, with a green tuft here and there thrusting out from it, but little sign of ridge or foothold. Far below the jagged points of the boulders bristled up, dark and menacing. Norbury tugged thrice with all his strength upon the cord, and then lowered himself over the edge, while a hundred anxious faces peered <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as he slowly clambered downwards {{to the end of the}} rope. Twice he stretched out his foot, and twice he failed to reach the point at which he aimed, but even as he swung himself for a third effort a stone from a sling buzzed like a wasp from amid the rocks and struck him full upon the side of his head. His grasp relaxed, his feet slipped, and in an instant he was a crushed and mangled corpse upon the sharp ridges beneath him.|$|E
5000|$|Ballou looked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and said, [...] "If {{you were}} a Universalist, the idea would never occur to you." ...|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "God Complex", Reid begins {{calling a}} mystery {{woman on a}} pay phone and they talk about his {{progress}} with his headaches and sleep deprivation. It is revealed that she is in danger and doesn't want someone to know about her and Reid. While on a case in New Mexico, Alex Blake drops Reid off at a phone booth, unaware {{that he is going}} to call the mystery woman. Blake later returns and questions his motives. The two agents have a heated discussion, and he tells her the mystery woman is a geneticist he contacted about his headaches during season six, whom he believes can help on the case. Thanks to her, they are able to find the unsub and save his latest victim. At the end of the episode, Reid thanks her for her help and tells her that he and the BAU can help her in her situation. However, she refuses because she doesn't want him to hurt Reid. She ends the phone call by telling him that she loves him. Left shocked and speechless, he starts walking to his left but then turns around and walks to his right. Sometime after [...] "The Lesson", Reid continues calling his mystery woman, and it is revealed that her name is Maeve (portrayed by Beth Riesgraf). She tells Reid that her stalker might be gone and because of this, she wants to meet him. During a case in Arizona, Blake confronts him about [...] "phone booth girl". Reid tells Blake that he's nervous to meet her because he already believes she's the most beautiful girl in the world, and he is afraid that she won't like him because of his looks. Blake encourages him to meet her. After Reid gets back from the case, they plan to meet at a fancy restaurant until Reid sees a man gazing <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Thinking him to be Maeve's stalker, Reid calls her to cancel while she is right outside. Spencer realizes that the man is not the stalker, and Maeve has already left. The hostess gives him a bag that she left for him. It turns out to be the very same book he was going to give to her by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Inside, she has written a quote by Thomas Merton; [...] "Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone. We find it with another." ...|$|E
60|$|Evidently he was {{the only}} other prisoner. As he slept I leaned <b>over</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> There was {{something}} strangely familiar about his face, and yet I could not place him.|$|R
6000|$|As Clym {{descended into}} the valley Thomasin came down by the other path, and met <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the gate. [...] "What do you think I have to tell you, Clym?" [...] she said, looking archly <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{weather is}} moderate, Madam Budd; quite moderate," [...] {{observed}} Spike, a sentimental turn coming <b>over</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the moment. [...] "What I call moderate and agreeable." ...|$|R
40|$|Social Change (SSSC) Fellowship Program as a {{model for}} how to {{integrate}} spirituality and civic education into curricular and co-curricular experiences. She describes her experience co-facilitating the SSSC seminar and working with college students engaged in service learning in order to foster a deeper spiritual understanding and motivate students toward social change in their communities through their service work. It was mid-way through a lively class discussion when Sally asked, “How do we separate our beliefs from stereotypes in working towards social justice? ” The students looked at me with their pens steady. Sally had been struggling with feeling unsafe on her morning walk through San Francisco’s Tenderloin district to her summer public service fellowship at Planned Parenthood for the past couple weeks. I tried to conjure up all the student development theories I learned in graduate school, but my mind was blank. Maybe Rev. McLennan would say something? But when I looked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> he was also eagerly awaiting my response. Pens started tapping. After a few moments of silence in the classroom, I managed to squeak, “That’s a great question, Sally. Many of us experience a similar tension. Would anyone like to comment? ” Pens dropped. Someone yawned. ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{one of the}} Minimuls {{that stood}} basting the spit saw that Nod was awake he summoned others who were {{standing}} near, and many stooped softly <b>over,</b> staring <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and whispering together. Nod put his finger to his tongue, and said, [...] "Walla!" [...] One of them instantly shuffled away and brought him a little gourd of a sweetish juice like Keeri, which greatly refreshed him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I have no {{authority}} to make any rules for Josie," [...] replied Mr. George. [...] "I have {{no authority}} <b>over</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> all, but only over you." ...|$|R
60|$|Taurus Antinor had {{to brace}} himself {{up against the}} sickening sense of almost {{physical}} nausea that came <b>over</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> sight of this pitiful creature, more abject than any cur.|$|R
60|$|Presently Clayton {{opened his}} eyes. A faint, shadowy smile lighted his countenance {{as he saw}} the girl leaning <b>over</b> <b>him.</b> <b>At</b> sight of Tarzan the {{expression}} changed to one of wonderment.|$|R
60|$|Cynthia {{was still}} lying {{with her face}} in her pillow when her father came into the dark little house, and peered into her room with the newly lighted lamp in his hand. She turned her face quickly <b>over</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with dry and shining eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "But the army, man? the army?" [...] cried de Marmont, [...] "the garrisons of Antibes and Cannes and Grasse? did the men go <b>over</b> to <b>him</b> <b>at</b> once?--and the officers?" ...|$|R
60|$|The ledger of the Almighty is {{strictly}} kept, {{and every one}} of us has the balance of his operations paid <b>over</b> to <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the end of every minute of his existence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are ye sure o' the spot?" [...] inquired Larry, in an undertone, while {{a feeling}} of awe crept <b>over</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> {{the thought of being}} within a few yards of a murdered man in such a dark, wild place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes! The captain died as near noon as possible. I {{looked through}} his {{papers in the}} afternoon. I read the service <b>over</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> sunset and then I stuck the ship's head north and brought her in here. I--brought--her--in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That isn't the point!" [...] Hitchcock felt a hot {{flush of}} anger sweep <b>over</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> their evident reluctance. [...] "The {{question}} is, {{if it is}} so, {{are we going to}} stand it? What are we going to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{when the}} prayer is ended, the task accepted, first, since the star paused <b>over</b> <b>Him</b> <b>at</b> Bethlehem, the full glory falls upon Him from heaven, and the {{testimony}} is borne to his everlasting Sonship and power. [...] "Hear ye him." ...|$|R
50|$|In December 1896, Newell {{became an}} {{assistant}} division {{superintendent of the}} Boston and Albany Railroad. He was killed on Christmas Eve 1897 when an engine backed <b>over</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> Springfield, Massachusetts. He {{was buried in the}} Newell family plot in Walnut Hill.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Luna {{listened to}} this candid {{account of the}} young man's {{proceedings}} with her head turned a little <b>over</b> her shoulder <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and her eyes fixed as unsympathetically as possible upon his own. [...] "What you propose, then, as I understand it," [...] {{she said in a}} moment, [...] "is that I should betray my sister to you." ...|$|R
50|$|The Miracle of the House of Brandenburg is {{the name}} given by Frederick II of Prussia {{to the failure of}} Russia and Austria to follow up their victory <b>over</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Kunersdorf on 12 August 1759 during the Seven Years' War.|$|R
25|$|His {{final season}} as QPR manager, 1983–84, brought more success as they {{finished}} {{fifth in the}} league (their highest finish since they were runners-up in 1976) and qualified for the UEFA Cup. Venables then moved to Spain to take <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Barcelona, while Alan Mullery took <b>over</b> from <b>him</b> <b>at</b> Loftus Road in an ill-fated arrangement that lasted just six months.|$|R
6000|$|THE EMPEROR (standing {{on a chair}} {{inside his}} box and looking over the wall) Sorcerer: I command you to put that lion to death instantly. It is guilty of high treason. Your conduct is most disgra-- (the lion charges <b>at</b> <b>him</b> up the stairs) help! (He disappears. The lion rears against the box; looks <b>over</b> the {{partition}} <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and roars. The Emperor darts out {{through the door and}} down to Androcles, pursued by the lion.) ...|$|R
60|$|In {{indulging in}} this sally, Razumov managed {{very well to}} conceal the feeling of anxiety which had come <b>over</b> <b>him.</b> <b>At</b> {{the same time he}} was saying to himself that there could be no earthly reason for anxiety. He was {{relieved}} by the evident sincerity of the protesting voice.|$|R
