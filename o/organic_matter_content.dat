Graptolitic argillite is the larger resource, but, because its <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content</b> is relatively low, it is not used industrially. The other one is kukersite, which has been mined for almost a hundred years and is expected to last for another 25–30years. By the end of 2012, the total kukersite resource was 4.8billion tonnes, of which up to 650million tonnes was recoverable. Kukersite deposits in Estonia account for 1.1% of global oil shale deposits.|$|E

2500|$|Erosion is {{strongly}} related to human activity. For example, roads which increase impermeable surfaces lead to streaming and ground loss. Agriculture also accelerates soil erosion (increase of field size, correlated to hedges and ditches removal). Meadows are in regression to the profit of plowed lands. [...] Spring cultures (sunflower, corn, beet) surfaces are increasing and leave the ground naked in winter. Sloping grounds are gradually colonized by vine. Lastly, use of herbicides leaves the ground naked between each crop. New cultural practices, such as mechanization also increases the risks of erosion. Fertilization by mineral manures rather than organic manure gradually destructure the soil. [...] Many scientists observed a gradual decrease of soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content</b> in soils, {{as well as a}} decrease of soil biological activity (in particular, in relation to chemical uses).

Transplanting should be done in early spring, before leaf-out; this timing is especially important in the more northern areas. Fall planting is often successful in Florida. The east central Florida ecotype may be more easily moved than other strains because its roots grow over nine or ten months every year—several months longer than other ecotypes.

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{recognition}} {{and the development}} of the San Joaquin soil dates from the turn of the 20th century. [...] Field operations of the United States Soil Survey, now known as the National Cooperative Soil Survey, began in 1899. [...] The San Joaquin soil was initially documented and officially established in 1900 {{as one of the first}} four soil series recognized in California by the survey. [...] All were considered to have agricultural importance. [...] Since then, three of these series have either been dropped from the official listings or have been combined with other soil series recognized at a later date. [...] Thus, the San Joaquin soil is the oldest, continuously recognized soil series within the state. [...] (More than 1,500 soil series are currently recognized in California.) [...] Nearly one-half million acres (2,000km²) of this soil have now been identified and mapped in many counties in California. [...] With proper management, this soil has produced many billions of dollars of food wealth for the state's economy. [...] Knowledge of the San Joaquin soil's properties and characteristics has become increasingly important in suburban and urban development. [...] As the science of soil has advanced during this century, the concept of the San Joaquin soil has evolved, but has retained, as distinctive soil characteristics, its reddish soil color and its strongly cemented subsoil hardpan that limits root and water penetration. [...] Aside from the texture and structure of the surface soil, the early descriptions of the San Joaquin soil paid little attention to the physical character of the subsoil above the hardpan. [...] The hardpan was expected to be encountered within a depth of 6 feet. [...] The modern concept recognizes mainly a sandy loam surface soil overlying a finer textured subsoil that has a significant clay increase, at its upper boundary or within some part of the subsoil. [...] The subsoil rests abruptly on a mainly silica-cemented hardpan at depths ranging from 20 to 40inches. [...] With these features, plus defined ranges of other surface and subsoil properties such as color, soil texture, structure, consistence, pH, <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> <b>content,</b> and inherent temperature and moisture characteristics, USDA soil taxonomy now places the San Joaquin series in a fine, mixed, thermic family of Abruptic Durixeralfs.
