5|$|On Bermuda, the {{combination}} of the storm and a cold front to its north produced 2.19inches (55.6mm) of rainfall in the first two days of October, which was about half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> rainfall total.|$|E
5|$|Reconciling the {{continuity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> strip with {{the stories that}} preceded and followed it presented difficulties, forcing the story's writers to alter its history {{in a number of}} ways, a technique known as retroactive continuity. Significantly, the strip rewrote various parts of Melchester's history, and shortened Roy Sr.'s recorded playing career to a more realistic level.|$|E
5|$|The Sandman, {{written by}} Neil Gaiman and {{illustrated}} by J. H. Williams III, returned in October 2013 as a limited series.

5|$|Following the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and the {{subsequent}} entry of the United States into World War II, a number of young men from the stake left to join the US military. At one point, 250 men from the stake served in the war, and Kimball ensured that each received a copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> stake bulletin and often wrote personal notes on each copy to the recipient.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, some Georgia Tech {{faculty members}} {{belonging}} to Sigma Xi started a research club that met {{once a month}} at Tech. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> subjects, proposed by ceramic engineering professor W. Harry Vaughan, was a collection of issues related to Tech, such as library development, {{and the development of}} a state engineering station. Such a station would theoretically assist local businesses with engineering problems via Georgia Tech's established faculty and resources. This group investigated the forty existing engineering experiments at universities around the country, and the report was compiled by Harold Bunger, Montgomery Knight, and Vaughan in December 1929.|$|E

The original character designs were created by Sukune Inugami and the school uniform was designed by the company Cospa. It was serialized between the July 2004 and May 2007 issues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> manga magazine Dengeki Daioh, sold between May 21, 2004 and March 21, 2007, respectively. Five bound volumes were released in Japan between January 27, 2005 and May 26, 2007 published under MediaWorks' Dengeki Comics imprint, concluding the series at thirty-five chapters.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} its release in August 2001, Funcom began {{offering}} free trial subscriptions, now common practice for other {{games in the}} MMOG genre. New players were able {{to sign up for}} accounts that remained free for a limited number of days. This required them to supply some personal information, including a credit card number. After their trial period, players could either cancel their accounts, or keep them to continue playing the game at the cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> subscription fee.|$|E
5|$|Both monthly {{and daily}} Yotsuba&! {{calendars}} {{have been released}} every year since 2005, although a monthly calendar for 2009 was not released due to constraints on Azuma's schedule. The 2005 edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> calendar featured pictures of Yotsuba playing with animals such as lions, zebras, and kangaroos. The 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010 editions feature photographs altered to include Yotsuba doing such things as playing with other children or reaching for a balloon. The photographs were by Miho Kakuta, with drawings by Kiyohiko Azuma. The daily calendars have a mix of original and manga artwork, with occasional captions, {{as well as other}} fun items – for example, the 2006 calendar had a game of shiritori ongoing through the year. The daily calendars run from April to March, following the Japanese school year instead of the calendar year.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the strip ended in March 1995 Melchester were in dire straits, {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy, and their {{long-term}} future far from certain. When the strip returned in Match of the Day magazine in May 1997, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> comic's new continuity was ignored, although the basic thread of the club having struggled against relegation and being severely in debt was continued. It was revealed in the first strip that in the intervening years, while Rovers had managed to survive the threat of bankruptcy, a bribery scandal had caused a mass exodus of players and eventual relegation to Division One. Rocky, meanwhile, was playing for fierce local rivals Melborough, after a bitter falling-out with his father over a car accident in Italy in which his mother, Penny, had been killed. Roy, who had quit football as a result, was blamed by some (including his son) for the accident, even though he had no memory of it, and the precise circumstances surrounding the event were never resolved.|$|E

5|$|The {{beginning}} of the Atlantic season featured Alex, the first hurricane observed in June since 1995's Hurricane Allison. One tropical storm, Bonnie, and a tropical depression formed {{in the month of}} July. August featured five cyclones – a tropical depression, tropical storms Colin and Fiona, as well as hurricanes Danielle and Earl (both of which further intensified into major hurricanes). In accordance with climatological norms, September was the most active month of the season, featuring eight tropical cyclones: tropical storms Gaston, Hermine, Matthew, and Nicole, as well as hurricanes Igor, Julia, Karl, and Lisa. This tied 2002 for the most tropical storms observed throughout the month. Igor attained peak winds of 155mph (250km/h) on September15, cementing its status as the most intense storm of the season. Well above-average activity continued into October, with the formation of hurricanes Otto, Paula, Richard, Shary, and Tomas, one hurricane short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> record set in 1870. Tomas persisted into the subsequent month before dissipating on November7, heralding the end of the season's tropical cyclone activity.|$|E

5|$|The first Eblaites worshiped {{many other}} deities, {{such as the}} Syrian goddess Ishara, who was the goddess of the royal family. Ishtar was also worshiped but was {{mentioned}} only five times in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> offering lists, while Ishara was far more important, appearing 40 times. Other deities included Damu; the Mesopotamian god Utu; Ashtapi; Dagan; Hadad (Hadda) and his consort Habadu; and Shipish, the goddess of the sun who had a temple dedicated to her cult. The four city gates were named after the gods Dagan, Hadda, Rasap and Utu, but it is unknown which gate had which name. Overall, the offering list mentioned about 40 deities receiving sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance to Chantal began affecting Bermuda on July 30, producing scattered {{storms and}} increased cloud cover. The {{next day the}} system dropped more rainfall as it passed {{to the west of}} the island, and in the two-day period precipitation accumulated to 2.12inches (53.8mm) at the Bermuda International Airport, accounting for 35% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> rainfall total. Thunderstorms were reported on the island, and maximum reported winds on the island reached 45mph (72km/h). After Chantal passed Bermuda, a ship with the call sign C60Y4 recorded sustained winds of 37mph (59km/h) over the open waters of the north Atlantic Ocean. At around 2300UTC on July 31, a buoy to the southeast of Nova Scotia reported a pressure of 995mbar as Chantal passed nearby.|$|E
5|$|The {{date was}} changed {{once more to}} August 3, before it was finally {{released}} in stores on August 24, 1995, {{the same day as}} the Microsoft's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out {{at the same time as}} the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486–25, 8 megabytes of RAM, 5 megabytes hard disk space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.|$|E

5|$|The typhoon first {{affected}} the Northern Marianas Islands, where it left US$2.5million in damage, while damaging or destroying 114homes. The damage {{was enough to}} warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government. While passing near Okinawa, Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage. Later, the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in Busan, South Korea, and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US$115.4million in damage. About 250,000people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm, and there were disruptions to train, ferry, and airline services. In Kyushu, the storm left ¥4.08billion (US$36.9million) in crop damage after dropping 1,322mm (52.0in) of rain over three days. During the storm's passage, there were 61daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation. The rains caused flooding and landslides, forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close. Across Japan, Nabi killed 29people and caused ¥94.9billion (US$854million) in damage. Soldiers, local governments, and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm damage. After affecting Japan, the typhoon {{affected the}} Kuril Islands of Russia, where it dropped the equivalent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monthly</b> precipitation, while also causing road damage due to high waves. Overall, Nabi killed 35people, and its effects were significant enough for the name to be retired.|$|E
