25|$|The hazards {{posed by}} a {{capacitor}} are usually determined, foremost, {{by the amount}} of energy stored, which is the cause <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> electrical burns or heart fibrillation. Factors such as voltage and chassis material are of secondary consideration, which are more related to how easily a shock can be initiated rather than how much damage can occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{depth of}} the cut can be altered by an {{adjustable}} stop, the smaller base can be rotated through 90 degrees and accessories are provided for altering the offset of the base to the blade (for use with thicker or thinner materials as required). Some models allow slots to be cut at angles other than 90° to the joining face, for example 45°, which greatly speeds up the assembly <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> cabinets.|$|E
25|$|Corto's series {{continued}} {{three years}} later in the French magazine Pif gadget. Due to his rather mixed family ancestry, Pratt had learned snippets <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> kabbalism and lots of history. Many of his stories are placed in real historical eras and deal with real events: the 1755 war between French and British colonists in Ticonderoga, colonial wars in Africa and both World Wars, for example. Pratt did exhaustive research for factual and visual details, and some characters are real historical figures or loosely based on them, like Corto's main friend/enemy, Rasputin. Many of the minor characters cross over into other stories {{in a way that}} places all of Pratt’s stories into the same continuum.|$|E

25|$|St. Albans {{offers a}} number of camps and classes in the summer {{designed}} for children of various ages and interests and fostering both intellectual and physical development. The diverse curriculum consists of core academic classes, as well as specialty courses in such fields as technology and study skills. On the athletic front, St. Albans has once again partnered with Headfirst, a provider of sports instruction and other recreational activities, and Power Through Sports Basketball to offer an impressive variety of camps to students. The school also offers before and after care, {{as well as a}} daily “cool down” in the St. Albans indoor pool for full-day campers. Its academic classes consist <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> robotics and chemistry.|$|E
25|$|The {{understanding}} of friendship in children {{tends to be}} more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations. These friendships provide opportunity for playing and practicing self-regulation. Most children tend to describe friendship in terms <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> sharing, and children are more likely to share with someone they consider to be a friend. As children mature, they become less individualized and are more aware of others. They gain the ability to empathize with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the French crew is {{rescued by}} a cargo ship, and the U.S. Navy is {{deployed}} by NATO after getting {{word from the}} cargo ship captain that the pirates now have [...] "advanced weaponry" [...] (which was really just Kevin's toy lightsaber, that the French crew thought was real). Kyle arrives in Mogadishu, but is immediately taken captive by the pirates and held hostage. He pleads with Cartman to let him and his brother leave, but Cartman refuses, believing that Kyle is simply jealous of his new pirate life. Meanwhile, an English-speaking pirate named Guleed asks Butters and Ike why they decided to become pirates. When {{they say that they}} left because they were tired <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> school, chores, homework, and being yelled at by adults, Guleed responds by telling them that he dreamed of a simple life going to school, and that his mother is suffering with AIDS but cannot be treated, and his father was killed in an attempt to find food for his family. He never set out to be a pirate, but was forced into piracy to support his family. Butters and Ike end up realizing how close-minded they've been and that a life of piracy is one of hardship and suffering rather than fun and adventure like normal life can be. They then tell Cartman that they want to return home, but he refuses to give up his delusions of grandeur and threatens the boys with death by calling the real pirates to hold them at gunpoint. However, Cartman's vision is quickly disrupted when a U.S Navy ship hired by NATO appears off the coast carrying snipers, who shoot all of Cartman's pirate colleagues with a single gunshot to each of their heads. This leaves Cartman dumbfounded and annoyed.|$|E

2500|$|The law of {{conservation}} of momentum {{means that in}} order for a propulsion method to change the momentum of a space craft it must change the momentum of something else as well. [...] A few designs take advantage <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> magnetic fields or light pressure in order to change the spacecraft's momentum, but in free space the rocket must bring along some mass to accelerate away in order to push itself forward. [...] Such mass is called reaction mass.|$|E
2500|$|Shorter brought six new {{compositions}} to the Christmas Eve session. According to Shorter (as {{quoted in}} Don Heckman's liner notes), {{in writing the}} material for this album he was [...] "thinking of misty landscapes with wild flowers and strange, dimly-seen shapes — {{the kind of place}} where folklore and legends are born. And then I was thinking <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> witch burnings too." [...] Fairy tales were also an inspiration: the bluesy [...] "Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum" [...] is titled after the trademark exclamation of the giant in Jack and the Beanstalk.|$|E
50|$|He {{concludes that}} though people can {{contemplate}} the same thing, we cannot contemplate 'the intuitive apprehension' of another. This connotes the Sartrean idea of becoming apprehensive about the awareness {{that we are}} to be responsible for our own doings, and also that we can be conscious <b>of</b> the <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> another consciousness is conscious <b>of</b> the <b>thing,</b> but we cannot reflect on their being conscious <b>of</b> the <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> we can reflect on our being conscious <b>of</b> the <b>thing.</b> In this way we are still only condemned to making ourselves as we battle with our own consciousness, and so we don’t create the world, we are objects in the world.|$|R

2500|$|The term {{remained}} academic {{until the}} late 1990s when it was misappropriated by paleoconservatives {{as part of an}} ongoing Culture War in which it is claimed that the very same theorists who were analysing and objecting to the [...] "massification" [...] and mass control via commercialization of culture were in fact working in a conspiracy to control and stage their own attack on Western society, using 1960s counter culture, multiculturalism, progressive politics and political correctness as their methods. This conspiracy theory version of the term is associated with American religious paleoconservatives such as William S. Lind, Pat Buchanan, and Paul Weyrich, but also holds currency among alt-right/white nationalist groups and the neo-reactionary movement. Adherents of the conspiracy theory often seem to mean that the existence <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> modern feminism, civil rights, gay rights and atheism are dependent on the Frankfurt School, even though these movements predate The Frankfurt School.|$|E
2500|$|Project {{management}} {{can apply}} to any project, but it is often tailored to accommodate the specific [...] needs of different and highly specialized industries. [...] For example, the construction industry, which focuses on the delivery <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> buildings, roads, and bridges, has developed its own specialized form of project management that it refers to as construction project management and in which project managers can become trained and certified. [...] The information technology industry has also evolved to develop its own form of project management that {{is referred to as}} IT project management and which specializes in the delivery of technical assets and services that are required to pass through various lifecycle phases such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. Biotechnology project management focuses on the intricacies of biotechnology research and development. Localization project management includes many standard project management practices even though many consider this type of management to be a very different discipline. It focuses on three important goals: time, quality and budget. Successful projects are completed on schedule, within budget, and according to previously agreed quality standards.|$|E
