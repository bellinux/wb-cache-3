A principal-agent framework was used to elicit contract terms which provide incentives for the custom heifer grower to perform accelerated growth without heifers becoming over-conditioned. In order to provide incentives to custom growers, heifers returned to the dairy farm should be compared in performance to <b>other</b> <b>heifers</b> of similar age.

In three 28 -d periods, three ruminally-cannulated Holstein heifers sequentially grazed orchardgrass pasture (OP), then were fed orchardgrass hay (OH), then returned to OP. These heifers displayed greater shifts in ruminal bacterial community composition (determined by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis and by pyrotag sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes) than did two <b>other</b> <b>heifers</b> maintained 84 d on the same OP. Phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes dominated all ruminal samples, and quantitative PCR indicated that members of the genus Prevotella averaged 23 % of the 16 S rRNA gene copies, well below levels previously reported with cows fed total mixed rations. Differences in bacterial community composition and ruminal volatile fatty acid (VFA) profiles were observed between the OP and OH despite similarities in gross chemical composition. Compared to OP, feeding OH increased the molar proportion of ruminal acetate (P = 0. 02) and decreased the proportion of ruminal butyrate (P < 0. 01), branched-chain VFA (P < 0. 01) and the relative population size of the abundant genus Butyrivibrio (P < 0. 001), as determined by pyrotag sequencing.

40|$|Bovine {{trichomoniasis}} is a prevalent {{sexually transmitted}} disease of cattle caused by the protozoan Tritrichomonas foetus. Currently, diagnosis is most often made by culture. In order to provide a faster immunodiagnostic approach, a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was investigated. A protective surface antigen (TF 1. 17 antigen) of T. foetus was immunoaffinity purified and used in an ELISA to detect antibodies in vaginal mucus from heifers inoculated with T. foetus. In preliminary studies, antibodies of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) isotype were detected in mucus from all experimentally infected heifers which were tested at 6 weeks postinoculation, whereas IgG 1 and IgG 2 were not. In addition, IgA responses detected in postinoculation samples were all greater than those detected in preinoculation samples, unlike those detected by a whole-cell antigen ELISA. For these two reasons, IgA antibodies appeared to be useful diagnostically. Further investigation of IgA antibodies used vaginal mucus collected weekly from heifers inoculated intravaginally with 10 (2), 10 (4), or 10 (6) T. foetus organisms. Heifers with positive cultures for T. foetus had similar IgA responses to TF 1. 17 antigen over the 10 weeks of infection regardless of the initial inoculum dose. This indicates that if the dose is sufficient to establish infection, the magnitude and duration of the immune response are no longer dependent on dose.

40|$|The use of {{assisted}} reproduction techniques can generate up to 27 (superovulation, SO) or 50 (in vitro embryo production, IVP) calves per cow per year instead {{of only one}} calf per cow per year after normal mating. That {{is due to the}} possibility to use more than one oocyte per estrous cycle; namely on average 15 (SO) and 60 (IVP). However, using these techniques, the efficiency per used oocyte decreases dramatically. Instead of the efficient use of oocytes during natural mating, only 30 % efficiency is reached with SO. Furthermore, IVP generates only 8 calves per 100 used immature oocytes. This loss in efficiency might be due to deviations that occur during the final maturation of the oocytes. In this thesis concepts of final follicular maturation in unstimulated normally cyclic cows are applied to maturation during SO and IVP in order to gain better understanding of deviations in follicle and oocyte development using these techniques. Also preovulatory follicular development after SO is used as a model to study maturation in vivo. Chapter 1 introduces the subject. Deviations in preovulatory follicular development as induced using SO or as a result of oocyte collection and maturation during IVP are discussed against the background of the course of follicular maturation in unstimulated normally cyclic cows. In cows treated for SO the period of preovulatory follicular development is reduced compared to this period in unstimulated normally cyclic cows. Also, after SO an asynchrony of development is found within the population of stimulated follicles as well as between the follicle and its oocyte. For IVP, oocytes are usually collected from 3 - 6 mm follicles. These follicles lack part of the processes of follicular growth and selection. Furthermore, during in vitro maturation (IVM) of the collected immature oocytes, deviations in cytoplasmic maturation are frequently found. In chapter 2, the effect of prolongation of the period of preovulatory follicular development after SO on the heterogeneity of the population of preovulatory follicles and their oocytes with respect to the potential to mature, to ovulate, to be fertilized and to develop into embryos was investigated. In eCG-stimulated heifers, the spontaneous occurrence of the LH surge was suppressed with a norgestomet ear implant and at a later time a LH surge was induced using GnRH. The protocol resulted in a LH surge at the desired time in 100 % of the cases. Prolongation of the period of preovulatory follicular development from 42. 4 to 53. 8 h increased ovulation rates with 25 %. It was suggested that the heterogeneity of the follicular population, as is present in normally stimulated heifers {{at the time of the}} spontaneous LH surge, was reduced. The increased ovulation rates did not coincide with an increased number of embryos at day 7 after fertilization. The treatment with norgestomet did not adversely affect Chapter 8 ?Chapter 8 122 final maturation and fertilization. However, the treatment might have disturbed early embryonic development by altering the secretory activity of the cells of the epithelium of the oviduct. The superovulation protocol with LH surge induction (chapter 2) was used in the studies described in chapter 3 and 4 to obtain oocytes at a fixed stage of development in vivo. In chapter 3, it was investigated to what extend IVM contributes to limiting yields of viable embryos in currently used IVP programs. The use of in vivo matured oocytes, collected from eCG-stimulated heifers at 22 - 24 h after the LH surge, instead of in vitro matured oocytes collected from 2 - 8 mm sized follicles, for IVF and IVC improved blastocyst formation and hatching with 100 %. Additionally, also the progress of embryonic development was different for the two groups of oocytes; both blastocyst formation and hatching of blastocysts progressed slower for in vivo matured oocytes than for in vitro matured oocytes. The decreased embryonic development after IVM (chapter 3) might be due to the maturation conditions per se or to a difference in startcompetence of the oocytes collected from 2 - 8 mm sized follicles when compared to the oocytes from preovulatory follicles generated in eCG-treated cows. In chapter 4 the significance of the conditions during maturation for efficient IVP was tested using oocytes for in vivo maturation and IVM which presumably had an equivalent startcompetence. Therefore, heifers were stimulated with eCG using the same protocol as described in chapter 2. From part of the heifers, oocytes from preovulatory follicles were collected at the presumptive time of the LH surge and subsequently subjected to IVM. From the <b>other</b> <b>heifers,</b> oocytes from preovulatory follicles were collected 22 - 24 h after the occurrence of an induced LH surge. Both groups of oocytes were subjected to IVF and IVC. Blastocyst formation and hatching rates were significantly lower after in vitro maturation than after in vivo maturation of the oocytes. It was concluded that the conditions during IVM are an important factor responsible for limited yield after IVP. In this study, the progress of embryonic development was similar for both groups of oocytes and was conform to that as observed for the in vivo matured oocytes in chapter 3. Since in that study in vitro matured oocytes from 2 - 8 mm follicles developed at a faster rate than in vivo matured oocytes from preovulatory follicles it was suggested that oocytes undergo certain changes during follicular development from 2 - 8 mm to preovulatory stage at onset of final maturation which may be involved in programming embryonic development. Both in the studies described in chapter 3 and 4, a large variation in blastocyst formation between individual heifers was found, which is probably due to differences in response to superovulatory treatment. When in the group of heifers donating the in vitro matured oocytes (chapter 4) heifers with exceptional follicular function on the basis of estradiol- 17 ß and progesterone concentrations in the follicular fluid (FF) were excluded, rates of blastocyst formation increased indicating that the steroid producing capacity of the follicular wall influences oocyte quality. In chapter 5 and 6 preovulatory follicular development after eCG-treatment for SO was used as a model to study the possible role of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) ?Summary 123 system during final maturation in vivo. Earlier results from in vitro studies suggested a stimulatory role of IGF-I on growth and differentiation of granulosa cells and on final maturation of the oocyte. IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) are suggested to decrease bioavailability of IGF-I but also individual functions of these IGFBPs on follicle and oocyte maturation can not be excluded. In chapter 5, levels of IGF-I and IGFBPs in the FF of eCG-stimulated follicles with normal and deviant follicular function on the basis of steroid hormones in the FF were compared at several times during final maturation. Final maturation in eCG-stimulated preovulatory follicles with normal function was characterized by rather constant levels of IGF-I and IGFBP 3 in the FF. Low molecular weight IGFBPs (LMW IGFBPs, i. e. IGFBP 2, - 4 and - 5) were absent in FF at the time the oocyte undergoes germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and reaches metaphase I (MI). Just prior to ovulation, in 15 % of the FF of the follicles with normal function, LMW IGFBPs were found. While the levels of IGF-I and IGFBP 3 in the fluid of deviant follicles were not different when compared to eCG-stimulated follicles with normal function, the presence of LMW IGFBPs was different in these follicles; at the onset of final maturation, 35 % of the deviant follicles contained LMW IGFBPs. All these follicles, except one, were classified deviant due to too low estradiol- 17 ß concentrations, probably a sign of atresia. During final maturation, LMW IGFBPs were occasionally found (GVBD, MI) or absent (just prior to ovulation) in deviant follicles. It was concluded that only a permissive role of IGF-I in final maturation can be expected. It was also concluded that, as in unstimulated, normally cyclic cows, low estradiol- 17 ß concentration in the FF of large follicles (> 8 mm) coincided with the presence of LMW IGFBPs. The appearance of LMW IGFBPs in the FF of follicles with normal follicular function just prior to ovulation indicated a different role of the IGF system during ovulation and corpus luteum formation. Because different IGFBP patterns were found in the FFs of eCG-stimulated follicles with deviant follicular function and of concurrently developing follicles with normal follicular function, eCG stimulated follicles were used to study the regulation of the presence of IGFBPs during preovulatory follicular development (Chapter 6). Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), mRNA levels for LMW IGFBPs were analyzed (semi-quantitatively) in eCG-stimulated preovulatory follicles at the onset of maturation with normal or deviant function, on the basis of estradiol- 17 ß concentrations in their FF. No or small differences in gene expression were found. Therefore, it was concluded that the earlier found difference in the presence of LMW IGFBPs in FF could not be explained by a difference in gene expression for these IGFBPs in the wall of the follicle. Thus, regulation of the presence of these proteins has to take place at the level of translation or protein degradation. Finally, in chapter 8, the results of the performed experiments are discussed against the background of the current knowledge and existing hypotheses on final follicular maturation. Possible directions of future research in order to improve the efficiency of {{assisted reproduction}} are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This work {{consists}} of two collaborative research projects between INRA (France) and MTT (Finland) that examine the influence of group management on young cattle. The first work investigated whether pair versus individual housing of calves reduces their chronic stress reactions and whether positive contacts with humans could partly compensate {{for a lack of}} contact with conspecifics. In the second work, pair-housed heifers were either repeatedly regrouped or kept with their familiar peer. The consequences of repeated regrouping on heifers' social behaviour, emotional reactivity, physiology and production were analysed. Calves housed in pairs seem less stressed than calves housed individually, and regular positive contacts with a stockperson can not compensate for the lack of social partners. Pair-housed calves are less ready than their individually housed counterparts to approach humans. However, positive contacts with the stockperson make calves less fearful of people and improve handling both in the individual and pair-housing. Heifers housed in pairs and repeatedly regrouped are more aggressive between each <b>other</b> than <b>heifers</b> kept with the same penmate. However, repeated regrouping lowers heifers' behavioural reactivity in comparison with rearing heifers in stable pairs. Therefore, diversity in the social environment rather than stability appears to be more advantageous for heifers.

The tradeoff between heifer raising costs and milk production loss is examined in a capital budgeting model. Monthly annuity net present value of a heifer investment through the first lactation is assessed for heifers calving at 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28 months of age. A 24 mo AFC base case strategy with 9009. 5 kg subsequent first lactation milk yields $ 7. 34 in returns per month. Accelerated growth resulted in higher returns ($ 12. 77 /mo for 20 mo AFC; $ 9. 86 /mo for 22 mo AFC) when milk production is not affected as total raising costs decline relative to the base case. Slower growth resulted in lower returns ($ 5. 12 /mo for 26 mo AFC; $ 3. 15 /mo for 28 mo AFC). When milk production declines, revenues decline as do feed and marketing costs which are a function of milk produced. Adjusting for factors, breakeven milk production losses were 10. 6 % for 20 mo AFC and 5. 3 % for 22 mo AFC relative to the 24 mo AFC base.

I therefore consider that the failure of heifer 428 to contract English redwater from the injection of virulent blood is another point in favour of my contention that English redwater is not always inoculable. The results obtained from the <b>other</b> five <b>heifers,</b> however, seem to be conclusive, as heifer 430 was certainly infected with English redwater. Therefore English redwater was not inoculable in our five South African heifers, and accordingly when tested they all contracted ordinary redwater, proving that they had not acquired any immunity against South African redwater.

40|$|The {{question}} of which sex of cattle to feed {{is a basic}} economic decision which must be made by feeders. An economic analysis of costs and returns associated with feeding steers in comparison to heifers would give feeders some assistance in making this decision. The objectives {{of this study were}} to make an economic analysis of feeding a pen of steers and a pen of heifers in a feedlot, then determine the break- even prices for feeder cattle which would make the feeder indifferent to whether he fed steers or heifers, and finally to develop a decision model that could be used by feeders to evaluate this decision for their feedlots. Steers gain faster and more economically than do heifers. Steers, however, must be fed from 40 to 60 days longer in order to reach the quality standards of the choice grade. Steers reach the market at heavier weights both as fat cattle and carcasses. On the <b>other</b> hand <b>heifers</b> sell for less per pound as feeders and finish earlier in the feedlot. A graphical decision model was derived which will a id any given feedlot manager in making the decision of which sex would return more profit. This model allows one to plot the break- even prices and price spreads of feeder steers and heifers. The current market prices of feeder cattle on any given day can be compared to the model, and a decision made as to which sex is most profitable. The break-even spread in feeder cattle prices between steers and heifers gets wider as the price of feeder cattle increases. This explains the wide spread when feeder cattle are selling around 38 - 40 cents per pound...|$|R
25|$|Most dairy {{producers}} aim for {{a replacement}} heifer {{to give birth to}} her first calf, and thus join the milking herd, on her second birthday. As the cow’s gestation period is a little over 9 months this means the cow must be inseminated by the age of 15 months. Because the breeding process is inefficient, most producers aim to first breed their heifers between 12–14 months. Before a heifer can be bred she must reach sexual maturity and attain the proper body condition to successfully bear a calf. Puberty in cattle depends largely on weight among <b>other</b> factors. Holstein <b>heifers</b> reach puberty at an average body weight between 550 to 650 lbs. Smaller breeds of cattle, such as Jerseys, usually reach puberty earlier at a lighter weight. Under typical nutritional conditions, Holstein heifers will reach puberty at the age 9–10 months. Proper body condition for breeding is also largely judged by weight. At about 800lbs Holstein heifers will normally be able to carry a healthy calf and give birth with relative ease. In this way, the heifers will be able to give birth and join the milking herd before their second birthday.|$|R
40|$|The diets fed {{to growing}} animals are very {{important}} to ensure that young animals have the proper nutrients available for growth. When feeding dairy heifers, a farmer’s goal is to feed a very digestible diet that will provide nutrients to keep dairy heifers healthy and allow them to grow faster, while spending less money on feed. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether feeding heifers diets containing dry or ensiled forage (haylage) improved digestibility. Our hypothesis was that incorporating hay into the diet of 16 -week-old dairy heifers would provide a more digestible source of nutrients. For this study, 12 heifers were randomly assigned to treatments, with 6 heifers fed hay-based diets and the <b>other</b> 6 <b>heifers</b> fed haylage-based diets. The heifers were housed in individual pens and fed individually on a daily basis for 8 days. Fecal samples were collected during the last 3 days of the feeding period. The fecal collection was achieved by collecting fecal samples from individual heifers every 6 hours over a 3 -day period. Digestibility of the diets and nutrients were determined using chromic oxide as an external marker. In order to determine the digestibility of haylage or hay diets fed to the heifers, the percent of chromic oxide in feed was compared to the percent of chromic oxide in feces. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) of the feeds and feces was determined using the Ankom Fiber Analysis System. Data were analyzed using the Proc Mixed procedure of the Statistical Analysis System. The dry matter digestibility of the diets were similar between treatments (P = 0. 19) and was 68. 4 % for the hay diet and 66. 6 % for the haylage diet. The NDF digestibility was also similar between diets (P = 0. 21) with an NDF digestibility of 68. 4 % for hay and 66. 1 % for haylage diets. In summary, feeding dairy heifers hay-based diets did not significantly improve either the dry matter or NDF digestibility of the diets...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} fasting between Days 8 and 16 of the estrous cycle on plasma {{concentrations}} of luteinizing hormone (LH), progesterone, cortisol, glucose and insulin were determined in 4 fasted and 4 control heifers during an estrous cycle of fasting {{and in the}} subsequent cycle after fasting. Cortisol levels were unaffected by fasting. Concentrations of insulin and glucose, however, were decreased (p<O. 05) by 12 and 36 h, respectively, after fasting was begun and {{did not return to}} control values until 12 h (insulin) and 4 to 7 days (glucose) after fasting ended. Concentrations of progesterone were greater (p<O. 05) in fasted than in control heifers from Day 10 to 15 of the estrous cycle during fasting, while LH levels were lower (p< 0. 01) in fasted than in control heifers during the last 24 h of fasting. Concentrations of LH increased (p<O. 01) abruptly in fasted heifers in the first 4 h after they were refed on Day 16 of the fasted cycle. Concentrations (X ± SE) of LH also were greater (p<O. 05) in fasted (11. 2 ± 2. 6 ng/ml) than in control (4. 7 ± 1. 2 ng/ml) heifers during estrus of the cycle after fasting; this elevated LH was preceded by a rebound response in insulin levels in the fasted-refed heifers, with insulin increasing from 176 ± 35 pg/ml to 1302 ± 280 pg/ml between refeeding and estrus of the cycle after fasting. Concentrations of LH, glucose and insulin were similar in both groups after Day 2 of the postfasting cycle. Concentrations of progesterone in two fasted heifers and controls were similar during the cycle after fasting, whereas concentrations in the <b>other</b> fasted <b>heifers</b> were less than 1 ng/ml until Day 10, indicating delayed ovulation and (or) reduced luteal function. Thus, aberrant pituitary and luteal functions in fasted heifers were associated with concurrent fasting-induced changes in insulin and glucose metabolism...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of pelvic suspension and slaughter age on longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) from 40 heifers with at least 75 % Angus breeding. A total of 20 heifers were slaughtered directly from pasture at 18 months of age, and carcass sides were hung either by the Achilles tendon or the pelvic bone. The <b>other</b> 20 <b>heifers</b> were assigned to an additional winter housing period and slaughtered at 22 months of age; carcass sides were hung only by Achilles suspension. All carcasses were electrically stimulated and assessed according to the EUROP carcass classification system. In addition, the LTL muscles were aged for 7 or 14 days before meat quality was evaluated for intramuscular fat (IMF), drip loss, colour, shear force, compression and sensory analysis. The 22 -month-old heifers were heavier, fatter and had more IMF than 18 -month-old heifers. Conformation scores (muscling) did not differ between the two slaughter groups. Pelvic suspension reduced both between- and within-animal variation for peak force, total energy and compression peak force. For the 18 -month-old heifers, pelvic suspension also decreased peak force, total energy and compression variables for the LTL muscles from both ageing periods, whereas Achilles-suspended samples had lower shear force values only at day 14. Sensory analysis showed that pelvic-suspended sides had greater tenderness, lower bite resistance, less threadiness, higher juiciness and meat flavour and less visible marbling than meat from Achilles-suspended sides. Pelvic-suspended sides at 18 months of age were similar in peak force and total energy values to the 22 -month-old heifers. The importance of ageing the Achilles-suspended sides was more obvious for samples from 18 -month-old heifers than from the 22 -month-old animals. The correlations between the different instrumental measurements and sensory tenderness were considerably higher for carcasses suspended by the Achilles tendon (r = - 520. 55 to 0. 20) than for those hung by the pelvic bone (r = - 520. 25 to 0. 19). More correlations between sensory-evaluated tenderness and shear variables were significant after 7 days (n = 6) of ageing than after 14 days (n = 4) of ageing. This study clearly shows the benefits of pelvic suspension, which reduces {{the need for additional}} feeding after pasture...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine time budgets, blood urea content, total protein and body condition score as adaptive responses to seasonal dynamics by breeding Nguni cows and heifers reared on a sweetveld. Twenty four clinically healthy Nguni cows and heifers were selected for the study. The animals were grouped according to their parities namely: Parity 1 (n= 5), Parity 2 (n= 5), Parity 3 - 6 (old cows) (n= 9) and in-calf heifers (n= 5). Two separate experiments were conducted and running concurrently. In the first experiment time budgets (time spent walking, grazing, lying down, drinking water and browsing) of the cows and heifers were monitored for two consecutive days once a month, while in the second experiment blood samples were collected from the coccygeal vein once a month during weighing. Body condition scores were also determined during weighing times. Heifers maintained significantly (p 0. 05) of both blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (7. 5 ± 0. 39 mmol/l) and TP (80. 7 ± 1. 19 g/l) in November. All the animals had the least BUN levels in January (1. 93 ± 0. 18 mmol/l) while the highest total protein (TP) (82. 1 ± 1. 08 g/l) was recorded in February. All the animals showed distinct (p 0. 05) in most behavioural attributes in the cool-wet season. Heifers spent significantly (p 0. 05) body condition scores, amount of time spent browsing and drinking water. On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>heifers</b> (14. 7 ± 1. 50 %) and first parity cows (13. 9 ± 1. 50 %) traded-off most (p< 0, 05) of their time walking during the cool-dry season. Similarly heifers spent more time browsing (6. 4 ± 0. 62 %) forage plants (p< 0. 05) than all the cows during the cool-wet season. Grazing (r = 0. 17) and standing (r = - 0. 18) were correlated (p< 0. 05) with all the behavioural attributes measured in this environment. It was concluded that seasonal dynamics in trade-off behaviour through time budgeting, maintenance of BUN and TP were necessary for the Nguni cows and heifers to maintain their body condition scores within a narrow range throughout the four seasons...|$|R
40|$|In {{constructing}} or rebuilding a dairy barn, it’s normally {{only the}} cost of investment for the building (climatic barrier, foundation, floor and installations) that is evaluated in the capital investment estimate. Indirect costs as labour, forage, maintenance or animal health that occur because of differences in the building function are not considered. A simple and cheap building may lead to higher operating costs. Low costs for mechanization may lead to high labour costs and that’s why it’s important to include all building related costs when comparing construction and installations alternatives. This report shows results from manual work time studies from 13 farms with dairy cows in loose housing, representing different herd sizes (80 to 450 cows) and levels of mechanization (Automatic milking system, AMS, fixed and rotary parlour and level of mechanisation of feed distribution). The farms were visited both afternoon and morning during season with no grazing. The farmers and the cattle employees answered a questionnaire about work routines and herd information. Following type of work procedures were investigated: dairy cows (milking cleaning of parlour, feeding, littering, and cleaning of cubicles and <b>other</b> work), <b>heifers</b> (feeding, littering, cleaning and other work) and calves (milk feeding, feeding, littering, cleaning and other work). All figures are given as minutes per milking cow and day. There were big time differences between equal milking systems. The AMS barns had the shortest work time for milking (0. 27 to 0. 80 min/cow and day). The various milking time in the AMS stables depended on the numbers of alarms and cows needed to be caught for milking. Work time in the milking parlours (1. 84 to 3. 96 min/cow and day) depended on use of automatic cow gate or herd dog that pushed the cows. For calves, work time varied from 0 min (suckling cows) to 0. 57 min/cow and day. Work time for the young stock varied considerable (0. 32 to 1. 05 min/cow and day). Five model farms were constructed to show the effect of number of cows {{and the level of}} mechanization on the working time. With AMS in a 140 head herd and {{with a high degree of}} mechanization, the work time became 2. 1 min/cow and day. The work time became three times higher (6. 28 min/cow and day) in a herd of the same size using 2 x 8 herringbone parlour and with a low tech mechanisation. The effect of both herd size and level of mechanization was shown in the 400 head herd with a rotary parlour and a mobile mixer wagon where the work time became 3. 87 min/cow and day...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of genetic group and calf sex on selling prices in auctions in the state of Santa Catarina (SC), Brazil. We evaluated 33, 143 animals, representing 3, 587 lots in 47 auctions from 2009 to 2014. The calves were classified according to genetic groups: British breed or crossbreed (BX); Continental breed or crossbreed (CX); Zebu breed or crossbreed (ZC); British and Continental crossbreed (BC); and Bos taurus and Bos indicus crossbreed (TI). The lots were composed of male and female calves. The years presenting low and high changes in the price of calves were similar to the variation in the price of beef cattle and, in 2014, the calf price reached its highest value (R$ 5. 36). Male calves were sold at prices higher than female calves (average 7. 8 %), but this difference was driven by year of analysis, in which the closest approach occurred during periods of reduction in the price of live cattle in SC (2012 and 2013). Calves of genetic groups ZX and TI received, on average, lower prices (R$ 4. 49 and R$ 4. 64, respectively) compared with the other groups. In 2013, males from the BX group had greater variation in price compared with CX (3. 9 %) and BC (5. 7 %). On the <b>other</b> hand, female <b>heifers</b> from the BX group received higher average prices in 2011 compared with the CX, BC, IT, and ZX groups (8. 1, 8. 5, 14. 7, and 16. 5 %, respectively). Recently, female British heifers have had a greater appreciation in auctions held in SC, possibly for their reproductive performance potential of beef cows. Thus, sex and different genetic groups are factors that impact the selling price of calves in the SC region...|$|R
40|$|Fifty-nine {{commercial}} {{dairy farms}} were sampled 7 times over 15 to 21 mo {{to determine the}} role of animal movement, including off-farm rearing of heifers, in the interherd transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella spp. Farm management data were collected by on-site inspections and questionnaires on herd management practices {{before and after the}} study. Forty-four percent (26 / 59) of herds did not acquire any new MDR Salmonella strains. The number of newly introduced MDR Salmonella strains acquired by the remaining 56 % (33 / 59) of herds ranged from 1 to 8. Logistic regression models indicated that off-farm heifer raising, including contract heifer raising where heifers commingle with cattle from <b>other</b> farms [commingled <b>heifers,</b> odds ratio (OR) = 8. 9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 4, 32. 80], and herd size per 100 -animal increment (herd size, OR = 1. 04, 95 % CI, 1. 01, 1. 05) were significantly associated with the introduction of new MDR Salmonella strains. The negative binomial regression similarly revealed that commingled heifers [relative risk (RR) = 2. 3, 95 % CI: 1. 1, 4. 7], herd size per 100 animals (RR = 1. 02, 95 % CI, 1. 01, 1. 03), and a history of clinical salmonellosis diagnosed before the study (RR = 2. 5, 95 % CI, 1. 3, 5. 0) were significantly associated with the number of new MDR Salmonella strains that were introduced. Factors not associated with the introduction of new MDR Salmonella strains were housing of heifers and cows in the same close-up pen, a common hospital-maternity pen, and the number of purchased cattle. This study highlights the role of animal movement in the interherd transmission of MDR Salmonella spp...|$|R
40|$|Follicle {{stimulating}} hormone (FSH) is a {{glycoprotein hormone}} {{with a short}} half-life {{and has to be}} given twice daily for 3 – 4 days to induce superovulation in heifers. Since such a regimen is time consuming we compared the ovulatory response and yield of embryos in heifers following superovulation with either once or twice daily injections of pFSH for 4 days during the mid-luteal phase of a synchronized estrous cycle or during a prolonged luteal phase in heifers which had been immunized against prostaglandin F 2 α (PG). In Experiment 1, crossbred heifers (n = 42) previously actively immunized against a PG immunogen were superovulated in a 2 (cyclic or persistent corpus luteum) × 2 (once or twice daily injection) factorial plan. The heifers were superovulated with 75 units pFSH, which was injected subcutaneously once (22. 5, 22. 5, 15 and 15 units per day) or twice daily (9. 3 units per injection) for 4 days. In Experiment 2, cyclic crossbred beef heifers (n = 80) were superovulated using pFSH which was given randomly to heifers once daily subcutaneously (T 1) or twice daily intramuscularly (T 2) using the same daily dose of 9, 7, 5, and 3 mg per day. Estrus was induced in all heifers in both experiments using 500 μg and 250 μg Cloprostenol 12 hours apart on the third day of pFSH injections. All heifers were inseminated twice with frozen-thawed semen at 12 and 24 hours after the onset of standing estrus or at 56 and 72 hours after the first PG if estrus was not observed. Embryos were recovered at slaughter and graded on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 =excellent, 5 =degenerated). Data were recorded for the number of corpora lutea (CL), large (≥ 10 mm) and medium (5 - 9 mm) follicles, number of embryos recovered and embryo morphology. Data were analyzed by least squares analysis of variance procedures. In Experiment 1, {{there was no difference in}} ovulation rate between main effects. Fewer embryos were recovered from heifers with a persistent corpus luteum (pCL) and injected once daily (1. 71 ±. 75 vs. 5. 75 ± 1. 27) than from any <b>other</b> group. <b>Heifers</b> with pCL yielded lower (P< 0. 05) numbers of freezable embryos than cyclic animals, regardless of injection regimen. In Experiment 2, T 2 heifers had a significantly higher number of CL (16. 4 ± 1. 7 vs. 7. 7 ± 1. 7; P= 0. 0003), large follicles (4. 1 ± 0. 5 vs. 2. 8 ± 0. 5; P= 0. 04), medium follicles (6. 4 ± 0. 7 vs. 4. 4 ± 0. 7; P= 0. 04), embryos recovered (9. 6 ± 1. 1 vs. 4. 9 ± 1. 1; P= 0. 0025) and freezable embryos (4. 7 ± 0. 7 vs. 2. 1 ± 0. 7; P= 0. 014) than T 1 heifers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{order to}} {{maintain}} cohesion of groups, social animals need to process social information efficiently. Visual individual recognition, which is distinguished from mere visual discrimination, has been studied in only few mammalian species. In addition, most previous studies used either {{a small number of}} subjects or a few various views as test stimuli. Dairy cattle, as a domestic species allow the testing of a good sample size and provide a large variety of test stimuli due to the morphological diversity of breeds. Hence cattle are a suitable model for studying individual visual recognition. This study demonstrates that cattle display visual individual recognition and shows the effect of both familiarity and coat diversity in discrimination. [br/]METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We tested whether 8 Prim'Holstein heifers could recognize 2 D-images of heads of one cow (face, profiles, (3 / 4) views) from those of other cows. Experiments were based on a simultaneous discrimination paradigm through instrumental conditioning using food rewards. In Experiment 1, all images represented familiar cows (belonging to the same social group) from the Prim'Holstein breed. In Experiments 2, 3 and 4, images were from unfamiliar (unknown) individuals either from the same breed or <b>other</b> breeds. All <b>heifers</b> displayed individual recognition of familiar and unfamiliar individuals from their own breed. Subjects reached criterion sooner when recognizing a familiar individual than when recognizing an unfamiliar one (Exp 1 : 3. 1 +/- 0. 7 vs. Exp 2 : 5. 2 +/- 1. 2 sessions; Z = 1. 99, N = 8, P = 0. 046). In addition almost all subjects recognized unknown individuals from different breeds, however with greater difficulty. [br/] CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrated that cattle have efficient individual recognition based on categorization capacities. Social familiarity improved their performance. The recognition of individuals with very different coat characteristics from the subjects was the most difficult task. These results call for studies exploring the mechanisms involved in face recognition allowing interspecies comparisons, including humans...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 2115 heifers from two {{tropical}} genotypes (1007 Brahman and 1108 Tropical Composite) raised in four locations in northern Australia were ovarian-scanned every 4 - 6 weeks {{to determine the}} age at the first-observed corpus luteum (CL) and this was used to de. ne the age at puberty for each <b>heifer.</b> <b>Other</b> traits recorded at each time of ovarian scanning were liveweight, fat depths and body condition score. Reproductive tract size was measured close {{to the start of}} the first joining period. Results showed significant effects of location and birth month on the age at first CL and associated puberty traits. Genotypes did not differ significantly for the age or weight at first CL; however, Brahman were fatter at first CL and had a small reproductive tract size compared with that of Tropical Composite. Genetic analyses estimated the age at first CL to be moderately to highly heritable for Brahman (0. 57) and Tropical Composite (0. 52). The associated traits were also moderately heritable, except for reproductive tract size in Brahmans (0. 03) and for Tropical Composite, the presence of an observed CL on the scanning day closest to the start of joining (0. 07). Genetic correlations among puberty traits were mostly moderate to high and generally larger in magnitude for Brahman than for Tropical Composite. Genetic correlations between the age at CL and heifer- and steer-production traits showed important genotype differences. For Tropical Composite, the age at CL was negatively correlated with the heifer growth rate in their first postweaning wet season (- 0. 40) and carcass marbling score (- 0. 49), but was positively correlated with carcass P 8 fat depth (0. 43). For Brahman, the age at CL was moderately negatively genetically correlated with heifer measures of bodyweight, fatness, body condition score and IGF-I, in both their first postweaning wet and second dry seasons, but was positively correlated with the dry-season growth rate. For Brahman, genetic correlations between the age at CL and steer traits showed possible antagonisms with feedlot residual feed intake (- 0. 60) and meat colour (0. 73). Selection can be used to change the heifer age at puberty in both genotypes, with few major antagonisms with steer- and heifer- production traits...|$|R
40|$|Livestock grazing on outfield {{pastures}} {{to utilize}} inexpensive forage and save infield pastures to harvest winter feed {{is an important}} focus topic in Norwegian agriculture. It {{is important for the}} health and biodiversity of native grassland communities to be maintained to prevent secondary succession. One method of grassland management is grazing cattle on outfield pastures. This develops a symbiotic relationship where native grassland is maintained while cattle are nourished without sacrificing their growth and development. In Ringsaker and Vang almenning areas of Hedmark County, three dairy farms practice summer grazing on outfield pastures and allowed 41 of their Norwegian Red heifers to participate in this study. One farm allowed their heifers to forage freely (O-group) and the <b>other</b> farms had <b>heifers</b> in a restricted area (P-group). The aim {{of this study was to}} identify if an outfield grazing production system could support those heifers growth, body weight, and body condition as recommended by the Norwegian dairy coop Tine. Subsequently, I measured both live body weight and body condition of those 41 heifers. The results indicated that the only heifers that gained body weight during the grazing season were those heifers that originated from the open grazing production system (O-group). The heifers in the O-group gained on average 17. 4 kg while grazing on outfield pastures. Those heifers in the O-group were also the closest to the suggested weight recommended by Tine, with an average of 28. 3 kg below the recommended weight for heifers’ respected ages. The heifers in the Pen grazing production system (P-group) lost an extensive amount of weight. Heifers in the P-group lost on average 60. 9 kg, and were also 95 kg below their recommended Tine weight. In addition, this study also found a negative correlation between overweight heifers at the start of the grazing season and percentage body weight loss. Those heifers in our study that were the most overweight lost large percentage of their body weight over the grazing season. In this study the results illustrate that grazing heifers on outfield pastures may be accomplished without sacrificing livestock production through the use of an open grazing management production system...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{practical}} {{information and}} applied results from numerous experimental studies and/or field observations, {{there is a}} persistent gap between scientific recommendations and on-farm reality. There are numerous published reports {{on the impact of}} dairy heifer herd management conditions on short-term, medium-term and long-term performances, but few studies on actual dairy heifer herd management practices - particularly in France. In an attempt to address this shortfall, a survey was conducted in 2010 on 449 herds located in the second largest dairy production region, the Pays de la Loire region (Western France). Economic-related aspects of heifer farming were not addressed. The essentially qualitative survey information was collected by 107 independent agricultural technologists. A quantitative analysis based on a small set of the most representative key production criteria was also conducted on a representative sub-sample of 286 herds. Mean herd size, at 46. 6 cows per farm, and milk production, at 7953 kg milk/cow/lactation, were close to French national averages (47. 3 cows per farm and 81 09 kg milk/cow/lactation). The survey covered nine core themes and confirmed an all-round lack of precise monitoring on animal growth, as reported in earlier studies performed outside France. Most of the farmers surveyed considered animal weight a useful indicator for estimating growth performance. However, very few actually weighed their animals, despite the fact that 0. 80 of the farmers surveyed aimed to calve their heifers before 30 months of age, with 0. 55 of them setting a minimum calving weight target of at least 610 kg. Mean calf age at weaning was 2. 9 months, but in practice this was > 3. 5 months in 0. 31 of cases. Although farmers differ on certain practices, common core foci emerged: weight or age targets for pre-determined growth and development stages (at weaning or at service), recycling non-marketable milk for feeding young calves, essentially visual oestrus detection methods, and others. Based on the farmers' declarations, the estimated time spent rearing a heifer from birth to calving ranges from 12 to 15 h per animal, with most farmers spending an estimated 0 - 2 h/day rearing their heifers. While almost two-thirds of farmers stated that rearing heifers was a necessity, 0. 36 of this survey population claimed they enjoyed the work, whereas 0. 02 of the farmers felt the work was purely a chore. Mirroring the conclusions from <b>other</b> countries, dairy <b>heifer</b> herd performances could be improved through better animal monitoring and management...|$|R
