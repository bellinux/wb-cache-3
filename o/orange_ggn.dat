In Europe it was denoted by the E Number E111, but has been forbidden for use in foods since 1 January 1978 (EU directive 76/399/EEC). It has never been included in the food additives list of the Codex Alimentarius. As such it is forbidden for food use in general, because toxicological data has shown it is harmful.|$|E
