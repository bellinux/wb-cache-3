The HMPIH series demonstrated high Fe mobilization efficacy from cells and showed limited to moderate antiproliferative activity. Importantly, this novel series demonstrated irreversible electrochemistry, which was attributed to the electron-withdrawing effects of the noncoordinating pyrazine N-atom. The latter functionality {{played a major role in}} forming redox-inactive complexes that prevent reactive oxygen species generation. In fact, the Fe complexes of the HMPIH series prevented the oxidation of ascorbate and hydroxylation of benzoate.

40|$|Ferroportin (Fpn) (IREG 1, SLC 40 A 1, MTP 1) is an iron transporter, and {{mutations}} in Fpn {{result in a}} genetically dominant form of iron <b>overload</b> <b>disease.</b> Previously, we demonstrated that Fpn is a multimer and that {{mutations in}} Fpn are dominant negative. Other {{studies have suggested that}} Fpn is not a multimer and that overexpression or epitope tags might affect the localization, topology, or multimerization of Fpn. We generated wild-type Fpn with 3 different epitopes, GFP, FLAG, and c-myc, and expressed these constructs in cultured cells. Co-expression of any 2 different epitope-tagged proteins in the same cell resulted in their quantitative coimmunoprecipitation. Treatment of Fpn-GFP/Fpn-FLAG–expressing cells with crosslinking reagents resulted in the crosslinking of Fpn-GFP and Fpn-FLAG. Western analysis of rat glioma C 6 cells or mouse bone marrow macrophages exposed to crosslinking reagents showed that endogenous Fpn is a dimer. These results support the hypothesis that the dominant inheritance of Fpn–iron <b>overload</b> <b>disease</b> is due to the dominant-negative effects of mutant Fpn proteins...|$|E

40|$|Iron {{homeostasis}} plays {{a critical}} role in many physiological processes, notably synthesis of heme proteins. Dietary iron sensing and inflammation converge in the control of iron absorption and retention by regulating the expression of hepcidin, a regulator of the iron exporter ferroportin. Human mutations in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein hemojuvelin (HJV; also known as RGMc and HFE 2) cause juvenile hemochromatosis, a severe iron <b>overload</b> <b>disease,</b> but the way in which HJV intersects with the iron regulatory network has been unclear. Here we show that, within the liver, mouse Hjv is selectively expressed by periportal hepatocytes and also that Hjv-mutant mice exhibit iron overload as well as a dramatic decrease in hepcidin expression.

40|$|Iron is an {{important}} bio-catalyst of oxidation-reduction reactions in the cell and is essential for life. Paradoxically, {{it may also be}} lethal when the fraction of redox-active metal ions exceeds that sequestered in specialized proteins or cellular compartments, and uncontrolled production of free radical species may arise. The liver is the main body site for iron stores and central in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Important iron-proteins, such as hepcidin, the iron regulatory hormone, are specifically produced by the liver. Pathogenic mutations in hepatic iron transporters and regulators lead to hereditary iron <b>overload</b> <b>diseases,</b> including hemochromatosis. Iron toxicity depends on its excessive accumulation and is due to promotion of oxidant stress: free radicals and membrane oxidation by-products cause hepatocellular death by triggering organelle dysfunction, or by activating cells involved in hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis, such as Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells. Xenobiotics and hepatotoxins as well as immunological and host defense mechanisms may cause subtle changes in the pool of redox-active metal ions and in metal compartmentalization that potentially contribute to hepatotoxic, inflammatory and fibrogenic events. The hepatotoxic and profibrogenic potential of metal ions, particularly iron, is dramatic at moderate levels of tissue metal overload in concomitance with other inciting insults, such as alcohol abuse and viral hepatitis. Removal of metal excess from the liver in iron <b>overload</b> <b>diseases</b> is beneficial and prevents progression toward cirrhosis. The development of drugs able to block catalytically active metals, particularly iron, may prove effective in other chronic liver diseases in which inflammatory, degenerative and fibrogenic processes are fueled by redox-active metal ions...|$|R

We studied the inhibition by soluble HFE of the interaction between soluble TfR and Fe-Tf using radioactivity-based and biosensor-based assays. The results demonstrate that HFE inhibits the TfR:Fe-Tf interaction by binding at or near the Fe-Tf binding site on TfR, and that the Fe-Tf:TfR:HFE ternary complex consists of one Fe-Tf and one HFE bound to a TfR homodimer...|$|E
40|$|Hepcidin is {{a hormone}} {{secreted}} {{in response to}} iron loading and inflammation. Hepcidin binds to the iron exporter ferroportin, inducing its degradation and thus preventing iron entry into plasma. We determined that hepcidin binding to ferroportin leads to the binding and activation of the protein Janus Kinase 2 (Jak 2), which is required for phosphorylation of ferroportin. Ferroportin is a dimer and both monomers must be capable of binding hepcidin for Jak 2 to bind to ferroportin. Once Jak 2 is bound to the ferroportin dimer, both ferroportin monomers must be functionally competent to activate Jak 2 and for ferroportin to be phosphorylated. These results show that cooperativity between the ferroportin monomers is required for hepcidin-mediated Jak 2 activation and ferroportin down-regulation.

40|$|SummaryHereditary hemochromatosis, an iron <b>overload</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} a {{deficiency}} in the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin, is associated with lethal infections by siderophilic bacteria. To elucidate the mechanisms of this susceptibility, we infected wild-type and hepcidin-deficient mice with the siderophilic bacterium Vibrio vulnificus and found that hepcidin deficiency results in increased bacteremia and decreased survival of infected mice, which can be partially ameliorated by dietary iron depletion. Additionally, timely administration of hepcidin agonists to hepcidin-deficient mice induces hypoferremia that decreases bacterial loads and rescues these mice from death, regardless of initial iron levels. Studies of Vibrio vulnificus growth ex vivo show that high iron sera from hepcidin-deficient mice support extraordinarily rapid bacterial growth {{and that this is}} inhibited in hypoferremic sera. Our findings demonstrate that hepcidin-mediated hypoferremia is a host defense mechanism against siderophilic pathogens and suggest that hepcidin agonists may improve infection outcomes in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis or thalassemia...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that the regular {{consumption}} of alcohol {{is responsible for the}} disruption of normal iron metabolism in humans, resulting in the excess deposition of iron in the liver in approximately one-third of alcoholic subjects. The mechanisms involved are largely unknown; however, {{it is likely that the}} two major proteins of iron metabolism, ferritin and transferrin are intimately involved in the process. Tissue damage in alcoholic liver disease and the inherited iron-overload disease, haemochromatosis, are caused by excess alcohol and iron, respectively. The mechanisms of this damage are believed to be similar in both disease conditions and involve free radical-mediated toxicity. A high proportion of haemochromatosis sufferers consume excessive amounts of alcohol and synergistic hepatotoxic events may occur leading to the earlier development of liver cirrhosis. This review describes briefly the role of ferritin and transferrin in normal iron metabolism and in iron <b>overload</b> <b>disease</b> and explores the possible involvement of these proteins in the pathophysiology of excess iron deposition in alcoholic subjects...|$|E
40|$|Hepcidin is a {{peptide hormone}} {{secreted}} by the liver that plays {{a central role}} in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Increased hepcidin levels result in anemia while decreased expression is the causative feature in most primary iron overload diseases. Mutations in hemochromatosis type 2 (HFE 2), which encodes the protein hemojuvelin (HJV), result in the absence of hepcidin and an early-onset form of iron <b>overload</b> <b>disease.</b> HJV is a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor and HJV mutants have impaired BMP signaling. In this issue of the JCI, Babitt and colleagues show that BMPs are autocrine hormones that induce hepcidin expression (see the related article beginning on page 1933). Administration of a recombinant, soluble form of HJV decreased hepcidin expression and increased serum iron levels by mobilizing iron from splenic stores. These results demonstrate that recombinant HJV may be a useful therapeutic agent for treatment of the anemia of chronic disease, a disorder resulting from high levels of hepcidin expression...|$|E
40|$|Pressure <b>overload</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as valvular {{stenosis}} {{and systemic}} hypertension, manifest morphologically in patients as cardiac concentric hypertrophy. Prevention of cardiac remodeling {{due to increased}} pressure overload is important to reduce morbidity and mortality. Epigallocatechin- 3 gallate (EGCG) is a major bioactive polyphenol present in green tea which {{has been found to}} be a nitric oxide-mediated vasorelaxant and to be cardioprotective in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, we investigated whether EGCG supplementation could reduce in vivo pressure overload-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by suprarenal transverse abdominal aortic constriction (AC) in rats. Three weeks after AC surgery, heart to body weight ratio increased in the AC group by 34 % compared to the sham group. EGCG administration suppressed the load-induced increase in heart weight by 69 %. Attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy by EGCG was associated with attenuation of the increase in myocyte cell size and fibrosis induced by aortic constriction. Despite abolition of hypertrophy by EGCG, transstenotic pressure gradients did not change. Echocardiogram revealed that increased left ventricular systolic dimensions and deteriorated systolic function were relieved by EGCG. These results suggest that EGCG prevents the development of left ventricular concentric hypertrophy by pressure overload and may be a useful therapeutic modality to prevent cardiac remodeling in patients with pressure <b>overload</b> myocardial <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
40|$|Iron is {{required}} for most forms of organisms, {{and it is the}} most essential element for the functions of many iron-containing proteins involved in oxygen transport, cellular respiration, DNA replication, and so on. Disorders of iron metabolism are associated with diverse diseases, including anemias (e. g., iron-deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic <b>diseases)</b> and iron <b>overload</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as hereditary hemochromatosis and beta-thalassemia. Hepcidin (encoded by Hamp gene) is a peptide hormone synthesized by hepatocytes, and it {{plays an important role in}} regulating the systematic iron homeostasis. As the systemic iron regulator, hepcidin, not only controls dietary iron absorption and iron egress out of iron storage cells, but also induces iron redistribution in various organs. Deregulated hepcidin is often seen in a variety of iron-related diseases including anemias and iron overload disorders. In the case of iron overload disorders (e. g., hereditary hemochromatosis and beta-thalassemia), hepatic hepcidin concentration is significantly reduced. Since hepcidin deregulation is responsible for iron disorder-associated diseases, the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent findings on therapeutics targeting hepcidin. Continuous efforts have been made to search for hepcidin mimics and chemical compounds that could be used to increase hepcidin level. Here, a literature search was conducted in PubMed, and research papers relevant to hepcidin regulation or hepcidin-centered therapeutic work were reviewed. On the basis of literature search, we recapitulated recent findings on therapeutic studies targeting hepcidin, including agonists and antagonists to modulate hepcidin expression or its downstream signaling. We also discussed the molecular mechanisms by which hepcidin level and iron metabolism are modulated. Elevating hepcidin concentration is an optimal strategy to ameliorate iron <b>overload</b> <b>diseases,</b> and also to relieve beta-thalassemia phenotypes by improving ineffective erythropoiesis. Relative to the current conventional therapies, such as phlebotomy and blood transfusion, therapeutics targeting hepcidin would open a new avenue for treatment of iron-related diseases...|$|R

Iron remains bound to Fpn in the absence of multi-copper oxidases. Fpn with bound iron is recognized by a ubiquitin ligase, which ubiquitinates Fpn on lysine 253. Mutation of lysine 253 to alanine prevents ubiquitination and maintains Fpn-iron on cell surface in the absence of ferroxidase activity.
