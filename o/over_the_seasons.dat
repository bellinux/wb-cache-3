25|$|Since the team's inception, {{the same}} colour {{combination}} for home shirts {{have been used}} each year. The colour scheme of orange shirts, shorts and socks was selected to reflect the famous local product of Shizuoka Prefecture; the mikan. The current bright orange hue, named S-Pulse Orange by the club, {{is the result of}} a gentle evolution from a more yellow/orange shade during the team's early years. At the advent of the J. League, S-Pulse were the only top division club in the country to wear orange, a distinction which is now shared with other top flight mainstays, such as Albirex Niigata and Omiya Ardija. There is currently no third kit. Goalkeeping colours have changed more <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons,</b> with the current first choice kit all black, and all green being the second choice.|$|E
25|$|Competitive mode enables players, {{segregated}} in both {{region and}} platform, {{to participate in}} ranked play. Competitive mode is run in seasons that last for three months each with a short break (on {{the order of a}} week to two weeks) between each season to allow Blizzard to make necessary changes to this format; an exception was made for the first season which ran for 1.5 months to align timing for future seasons as to fall on calendar seasons. Players must have reached level 25 from casual matches to partake in competitive play. Before they can play any ranked matches for that season, they must play through ten preliminary matches which assigns a skill rating, which is partially influenced by the player's previous skill ranking on the last season. This ranking is subsequently used for matchmaking purposes in future competitive games they play that season. The player's skill level can move up or down during a season, influenced by their performance and by winning matches against higher-ranked players or losing matches to lower-ranked ones. Specific aspects of the skill system <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons</b> are described below.|$|E

2500|$|Goldsmith's {{reliance}} on Arnold's score decreased <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons</b> when Stargate SG-1 {{departed from the}} Goa'uld theme and introduced new characters and races. Goldsmith had a thematic approach to races and spaceships. For example, he wanted a mechanical, repetitive musical motif for the Replicators; Gothic, Gregorian and Christian themes were {{the inspiration for the}} Ori motif. The Ancient theme was deliberately carried over to Stargate Atlantis. The end of [...] "Lost City" [...] has a basic melody that would become part of the main title of Atlantis per a suggestion by Goldsmith's assistant. Non-original music was rarely used on SG-1, although Goldsmith chose the aria [...] "Vesti la giubba" [...] from Leoncavallo's [...] "Pagliaccio" [...] for the season 3's [...] "Shades of Grey". Additionally, Lily Frost's song [...] "Who am I" [...] played in Season 7's [...] "Fragile Balance" [...] and CCR's song [...] "Have You Ever Seen the Rain?" [...] played in the series finale [...] "Unending". A television soundtrack with Goldsmith's adapted score was released in 1997, followed by a best-of release in 2001. [...] In Season 1 Episode 7, The Nox, the music that played when The Nox appeared was Spinning The Silk from the album Chrysalis by 2002.|$|E
