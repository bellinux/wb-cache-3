50|$|The campus {{comprises}} purpose-built design spaces, studios {{for recording}} and editing live and <b>off-air</b> <b>television,</b> sound recording, mixing and animation and teaching and exhibition areas. The campus plays host to frequent fashion and art exhibitions. Ulster University has been expanding and developing the Belfast campus since 2009 {{as part of}} one of Northern Ireland's largest-ever urban developments, and nearly 15,000 students and staff will soon be based in the city centre. The first phase of this development opened in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Transmission Gallery" [...] site {{claims that}} the Efail Fach {{transmitter}} re-radiates the signal received <b>off-air</b> from Cilfrew <b>television</b> relay station near Neath, itself a repeater of Kilvey Hill at Swansea. However, Efail Fach used the same frequencies as Cilfrew in the analogue TV days, and shares two frequencies with Cilfrew in the digital TV era.|$|R
5000|$|Keys apologised for the [...] "prehistoric banter" [...] and said: [...] "Such {{comments}} were made off-air to work colleagues, and were, of course, {{never intended to}} be broadcast." [...] He added that [...] "If <b>off-air</b> conversations of <b>television</b> and radio presenters were recorded, {{there would be no}} one left working. That is not to defend what happened." ...|$|R
50|$|Future {{political}} consultant and Fox News Channel founder and CEO Roger Ailes served as producer (1965), and then Executive Producer (1967-68). It was {{while working on}} the show in 1967 that he met Richard Nixon {{with whom he had}} an <b>off-air</b> discussion about <b>television</b> and politics. Nixon subsequently hired Ailes to work as a media consultant on his 1968 presidential campaign, thus launching Ailes's career as a national {{political consultant}} and media strategist.|$|R
50|$|The Llandyfriog {{transmitting}} station is a broadcasting and telecommunications facility located on high ground several kilometres {{east of the}} town of Newcastle Emlyn, Ceredigion, South Wales. It was built in 1980 to relay VHF radio and UHF television to Newcastle Emlyn and the area in general. The site has a 25 m self-standing lattice mast erected on land that is itself about 105 m above sea level and acts as an <b>off-air</b> <b>television</b> relay of Preseli, about 20 km to the west.|$|E
50|$|Funai 212 {{came with}} a JVC model GX-44E hand held Vidicon tube camera with a zoom lens. Model 212D was the NTSC version and 212E was PAL for Europe. The deck and {{electronics}} from the 212 were also used to build the model 335 Technicolor Video Showcase, which included a colour video monitor, speaker and contained an internal 12V battery. A lightweight television tuner pack was available to enable the 212 to record <b>off-air</b> <b>television</b> programming, but since it contained no timer {{it was not possible}} to set it for unattended recordings. Grundig also produced a CVC-format VCR for the PAL market, the VP100, based on the 212E but smaller. The VP100 weighed only 2.3 kg with battery, and had a separate power pack. Model 212 was also available in France as a SECAM recorder, the variant letter for this model is unknown. SECAM tapes play in monochrome on PAL players.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technical}} difficulties {{caused by the}} hills and valleys of East Tennessee and prohibitive cost-per-mile across the vast expanses of the rural flatlands west of the Mississippi had created a pent up demand for television programing. Homeowners {{many of whom had}} no access to cable and a minimal number of <b>off-air</b> <b>television</b> channels were {{looking for a way to}} receive some of the same programs their urban cousins had access to. Since Overholt and a few others in the Knoxville area were in the process of pioneering the satellite to home backyard dish concept it was logical to search for the programming to go along with it. The first shopping channel (Home Shopping Network) had just appeared out of Florida, so the network was launched as a rival. The ability to reach this entertainment starved market was important to the fledgling experiment and this markets appreciation and monetary encouragement was key to SAH's progress. The beginnings of today's satellite television as an industry began by providing the dish and electronics to receive the signals from satellites in space that coincidentally was the same way that HBO and other entertainment was distributed to cable systems across the country. The Knoxville group that Overholt approached had formed the [...] "Satellite TV Awareness Association" [...] (STAA) a local trade organization that's purpose was to inform citizens and elected representatives to Congress of the issues surrounding the [...] "business" [...] of the new industry. The cable lobby had portrayed back yard dish owners as pirates and accused them of stealing their programming. The STAA (Overholt was a member) and others made it public that offers had been made to the programmers to pay for the product being received but most programmers had refused the [...] "offer to pay". The STAA sought assistance from their elected representatives, of which Al Gore was one, for a fair solution to the problem. Gore was conducting local town hall meetings and had a sympathetic ear for this ground roots movement from his constituents. A few months later when the STAA decided to bring the issues to dish owners they used the same satellite signal to do so. From a rented studio in Nashville they hired a local MC to host a panel of [...] "experts" [...] in the field to answer questions and propose solutions to the dish industries problems. Gore was unable to attend in person but had pledged his support and participated in the event via telephone.|$|E
