50|$|Release of Insects {{carrying}} Dominant Lethals (RIDL) is {{a control}} strategy using genetically engineered insects that have (carry) a lethal gene in their genome (an organism's DNA). Lethal genes cause death in an organism, and RIDl genes only kill young insects, usually larvae or pupae. Similar to how inheritance of brown eyes is dominant to blue eyes, this lethal gene is dominant {{so that all}} offspring of the RIDL insect will also inherit the lethal gene. This lethal gene has a molecular on and off switch, allowing these RIDL insects to be reared. The lethal gene is turned off when the RIDL insects are mass reared in an insectory, and turned on when they are released into the environment. RIDL males and females are released to mate with wild males and their offspring die when they reach the larval or pupal stage because of the lethal gene. This causes the population of insects to crash. This technique is being developed for some insects and for other insects has been tested in the field. It {{has been used in}} the Grand Cayman Islands, Panama, and Brazil to control the mosquito vector of dengue, Ae. aegypti.

Accordingly, we manipulated diet and the presence of bacteria in female <b>olive</b> <b>flies,</b> and monitored fecundity—an indirect measure of fitness. Bacteria did not affect fecundity when females were fed a nutritionally poor diet of sucrose, or a protein-rich, nutritionally complete diet. However, when females were fed a diet containing non-essential amino acids as the sole source of amino nitrogen, egg production was significantly enhanced in the presence of bacteria.

In the Western Hemisphere, it is currently restricted to California, Baja California, and Sonora. The olive fruit fly was first detected in North America infesting olive fruits on landscape trees in Los Angeles County in November 1998. It can now be found throughout the state of California. The source of importation was the shipment of olive saplings from Italy to the Port of Ensenada in Baja California, México by a joint venture company known as [...] "Olivarera Italo-Mexicana, S.A. de C.V.

40|$|Abstract Background The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, is {{the major}} {{arthropod}} pest of commercial olive production, causing extensive damage to olive crops worldwide. Current control techniques rely on spraying of chemical insecticides. The sterile insect technique (SIT) presents an alternative, environmentally friendly and species-specific method of population control. Although SIT has been very successful against other tephritid pests, previous SIT trials on <b>olive</b> <b>fly</b> have produced disappointing results. Key problems included altered diurnal mating rhythms of the laboratory-reared insects, resulting in asynchronous mating activity between the wild and released sterile populations, and low competitiveness of the radiation-sterilised mass-reared flies. Consequently, the production of competitive, male-only release cohorts is considered an essential prerequisite for successful <b>olive</b> <b>fly</b> SIT. Results We developed a set of conditional female-lethal strains of <b>olive</b> <b>fly</b> (named Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal; RIDL ®), providing highly penetrant female-specific lethality, dominant fluorescent marking, and genetic sterility. We found that males of the lead strain, OX 3097 D-Bol, 1) are strongly sexually competitive with wild olive flies, 2) display synchronous mating activity with wild females, and 3) induce appropriate refractoriness to wild female re-mating. Furthermore, we showed, through a large proof-of-principle experiment, that weekly releases of OX 3097 D-Bol males into stable populations of caged wild-type <b>olive</b> <b>fly</b> could cause rapid population collapse and eventual eradication. Conclusions The observed mating characteristics strongly suggest that an approach based on the release of OX 3097 D-Bol males will overcome the key difficulties encountered in previous <b>olive</b> <b>fly</b> SIT attempts. Although field confirmation is required, the proof-of-principle suppression and elimination of caged wild-type <b>olive</b> <b>fly</b> populations through OX 3097 D-Bol male releases provides evidence for the female-specific RIDL approach as a viable method of <b>olive</b> <b>fly</b> control. We conclude that the promising characteristics of OX 3097 D-Bol may finally enable effective SIT-based control of the <b>olive</b> <b>fly.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, (Rossi) (Diptera:Tephritidae), {{is a key}} pest {{of olive}} crops. The sterile insect {{technique}} (SIT) is an environmentally benign and species-specific method of pest control, aiming to reduce the reproductive potential of a wild population through the mass-release of sterile insects. Previous <b>olive</b> <b>fly</b> SIT trials, involving the release of gamma-ray sterilised mixed-sex populations, achieved limited success. Key problems included altered diurnal mating rhythms of the laboratory-reared insects, leading to assortative mating between released and wild populations, and low competitiveness of the radiation sterilised mass-reared flies. Consequently, the production of competitive, male-only release cohorts is seen as essential. The RIDL (Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal) system is a transgene-based derivative of SIT, one version of which involves the mass release of insects carrying a female specific lethal transgene (fsRIDL). This thesis describes: 1) the development of fsRIDL <b>olive</b> <b>fly</b> strains and the molecular analysis of transgene insertion and function; 2) the analysis of strain life-history parameters; 3) studies into sexual selection and mating compatibility; 4) a caged proof-of-principle population suppression trial; and, 5) selection dynamics on the fsRIDL trait in caged populations. <b>Olive</b> <b>fly</b> fsRIDL strains were developed with full female-lethal penetrance and repressibility.

The Eco-Trap performed relatively well during the three years of study, significantly reducing <b>olive</b> <b>fly</b> damage levels.

In a subsequent trial we tested a low-cost mass-trapping device. This device demonstrated similar levels of protection to the one seen with the Eco-Trap. Results showed that lure and kill and mass-trapping tactics can be effectively applied in the region of Tubas, and that accessible devices can be adopted to reduce control costs. The results also showed differential levels of damage throughout the region, which were related to elevation above sea level.

Seasonal influences were also relevant for three of the populations. In spite of exogenous effects, the rate of population change was fairly stabl...|$|E
40|$|Part 4 : Environmental AI Modeling (ENAIM) International audienceOlive {{fruit fly}} trap {{measurements}} {{are used as}} one of the indicators for olive grove infestation, and therefore, as a consultation tool on spraying parameters. In this paper, machine learning techniques are used to predict the next <b>olive</b> fruit <b>fly</b> trap measurement, given as input environmental parameters and knowledge of previous trap measurements. Various classification algorithms are employed and applied to different environmental settings, in extensive comparative experiments, in order to detect the impact of the latter on <b>olive</b> fruit <b>fly</b> population prediction...|$|R
40|$|UK company Oxitec has {{developed}} genetically modified (GM) <b>olive</b> <b>flies,</b> {{which it is}} seeking to release in large numbers in olive groves. Oxitec has made an application to make its first experimental releases in netted olive groves in Spain. It has stated it also wishes to release GM <b>olive</b> <b>flies</b> in other countries such as Italy, Greece and Morocco. This briefing explores {{the issues raised by}} the proposed releases. Oxitec: the company Oxitec is a UK company producing genetically modified (GM) insects with the aim of creating a global market in GM insects for open release into the environment. Oxitec is a spin-out company from the University of Oxford which manages its investment in the company via Oxford Spin-out Equity Management. 1 Other known major investors include the Boston-based multi-millionaire Landon Clay, Oxford Capital Partners 2, and, since 2012, Asia Pacific Capital 3. Smaller investors include researchers working in the field. 4 The company has received more than £ 1. 5 million in research funding from UK government sources and the UK Treasury has extended tax relief to investors in an attempt to assist the company grow sufficiently to reach an Initial Public Offering (IPO) 5, 6. UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) has worked with embassies worldwide to seek to help Oxitec to secure markets for its GM insects. 7 Oxitec has close links to the multinational pesticide and seed company, Syngenta: most of its senior management, including its Chief Executive Hadyn Parry, and two Board members, including the Chair, are ex-Syngenta staff. 8 From March 2009 to June 2011, Oxitec received research funding directly from Syngenta for genetic transformation of Lepidoptera (a large order of insects that includes pests such as pink bollworm and diamond back moths 9). 10 Both Oxitec and Syngenta use a consultancy firm run by Colin Ruscoe, Chair of the British Crop Protection Council, 11 and the same PR agency (The Blue Ball Room) 12, which is run by Parry’s wife.
