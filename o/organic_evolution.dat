These {{included}} his follow-up to Variation and Evolution, , {{which was published in}} 1974, following his delivery of the Prather Lectures at Harvard. Stebbins discusses the origins, genetics and developmental biology of the angiosperms. He argues for the role of adaptive radiation in the diversification of the angiosperms and the usefulness of applying our current understanding of species' genetics and ecology to gain knowledge about the evolution of ancient species. He also wrote Processes of <b>Organic</b> <b>Evolution,</b> The Basis of Progressive Evolution, Chromosomal Evolution in Plants and the textbook Evolution with co-authors Dobzhansky, Francisco Ayala and James W. Valentine. His last book, Darwin to DNA, Molecules to Humanity was published in 1982.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, after {{studying}} butterfly coloration, Theodor Eimer (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely read book, On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation. Eimer claimed there were trends in evolution with no adaptive significance {{that would be}} difficult to explain by natural selection. To supporters of orthogenesis, in some cases species could be led by such trends to extinction. Eimer linked orthogenesis to neo-Lamarckism in his 1890 book <b>Organic</b> <b>Evolution</b> as the Result of the Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics According to the Laws of Organic Growth. He used examples such as the evolution of the horse to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described Eimer as a materialist who rejected any vitalist or teleological approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer's criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as they had come to believe that natural selection could not create new species.|$|E

500|$|Wilderness {{protection}} and the conservation movement, led by {{figures such as}} John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, also began to appear at this time. By {{the turn of the}} century, those in favor of recreational ideals of nature began to clash with conservationists such as Muir. Likewise, critics and natural scientists became skeptical of what they saw as a growing cult of nature, which was thought to wrongly champion sentimentality and aesthetics rather than scientific facts. Sympathy for animals and their survival also became a developing thought in the 19th century, due in part to wide acceptance of theories pertaining to <b>organic</b> <b>evolution.</b> In 1837, Charles Darwin wrote in his diary that [...] "If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine—our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements—they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor—we may be all melted together." ...|$|E

[...] Whatever happens, happens". Additionally, Spears scheduled meet-and-greets with Timbaland and Missy Elliott in an effort to help evolve her sound. Elliott would also enlist in further production work with Nisan Stewart for Spears' project, however none of the initial material saw the light of day. Fred Durst was asked by Spears' management to submit material, and he wrote and produced three trip hop tracks that were recorded by Spears in January 2003. However, after news of an affair between them broke, Durst told Jive Records {{he was not going to}} let them use the songs for the album.

2500|$|Later, Joseph Fielding Smith {{published}} his book Man: His Origin and Destiny, which denounced evolution without qualification. Similar statements of denunciation {{were made by}} Bruce R.

This is both false and devilish." [...] Evolution was also denounced by the conservative Ezra Taft Benson, who as an Apostle called on members to use the Book of Mormon to combat evolution and several times denounced evolution as a [...] "falsehood" [...] on a par with socialism, rationalism, and humanism.

2500|$|Lamarck {{constructed}} one of {{the first}} theoretical frameworks of <b>organic</b> <b>evolution.</b> While this theory was generally rejected during his lifetime, Stephen Jay Gould argues that Lamarck was the [...] "primary evolutionary theorist", in that his ideas, {{and the way in which}} he structured his theory, set the tone for much of the subsequent thinking in evolutionary biology, through to the present day. Developments in epigenetics, the study of cellular and physiological traits that are heritable by daughter cells and not caused by changes in the DNA sequence, have caused debate about whether a [...] "neolamarckist" [...] view of inheritance could be correct: Lamarck was not in a position to give a molecular explanation for his theory. Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb for example call themselves neolamarckists. Reviewing the evidence, David Haig observes that any such mechanisms must themselves have evolved through natural selection.|$|E
2500|$|Cuvier was {{critical}} of theories of evolution, including those proposed by his contemporaries Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, which involved the gradual transmutation of one form into another. He repeatedly emphasized that his extensive experience with fossil material indicated [...] one fossil form does not, as a rule, gradually change into a succeeding, distinct fossil form. Because of this and his understanding of animal anatomy and physiology, Cuvier strongly objected to any notion of evolution. According to the University of California Museum of Paleontology, [...] "Cuvier {{did not believe in}} <b>organic</b> <b>evolution,</b> for any change in an organism's anatomy would have rendered it unable to survive. He studied the mummified cats and ibises that Geoffroy had brought back from Napoleon's invasion of Egypt, and showed they were no different from their living counterparts; Cuvier used this to support his claim that life forms did not evolve over time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Through {{his work}} on Drosophila pseudoobscura, a species of fruitfly, Dobzhansky was able to {{identify}} that some populations of this species did not have identical sets of genes. Dobzhansky used experimental breeding in laboratories and gardens, and also surveys related to species in nature to help support aspects of <b>organic</b> <b>evolution.</b> The data in his book show the different genetic mutations and chromosomal changes that were observed. These experiments are vital to this book because they illustrate a transition from the laboratory to the greater field of genetics. Drosophila enabled researchers to gain {{a deeper understanding of}} how scientific knowledge about heredity has expanded and contributed to other areas of biology. By focusing on the opportunities and constraints of the research organism, persuasive accounts of the chromosomal genetics of Drosophila eventually evolved into the genetics of natural populations in the 1930s.

2500|$|To the {{discussion}} of the deeper problems of biological philosophy, he made scarcely any direct and definite contributions. His generalities rarely extended beyond strict comparative anatomy, the phenomena of adaptation to function and the facts of geographical or geological distribution. His lecture on virgin reproduction or parthenogenesis, however, published in 1849, contained the essence of the germ plasm theory, elaborated later by August Weismann and he made several vague statements concerning the geological succession of genera and species of animals and their possible derivation one from another. He referred, especially, to the changes exhibited by the successive forerunners of the crocodiles (1884) and horses (1868) but it has never become clear how much of the modern doctrines of <b>organic</b> <b>evolution</b> he admitted.

In geology Darwin was very much Lyell's disciple, and brought back observations and his own original theorising, including ideas about the formation of atolls, which supported Lyell's uniformitarianism. On the return of the Beagle (October 1836) Lyell invited Darwin to dinner and from then on they were close friends. Although Darwin discussed evolutionary ideas with him from 1842, Lyell continued to reject evolution in each of the first nine editions of the Principles. He encouraged Darwin to publish, and following the 1859 publication of On the Origin of Species, Lyell finally offered a tepid endorsement of evolution in the tenth edition of Principles.|$|E

This was an unprecedented step for the school, as Cluff had previously been the most educated member of the staff, with a master's degree earned {{while he was in}} office. Brimhall, like many of the presidents before him, believed in delegation, and distributed many of his duties among the new faculty. Eventually, problems began to arise. Several of the faculty believed that the school should teach <b>organic</b> <b>evolution,</b> while others disagreed. The ensuing contention ended with a decision not to teach evolution issued by LDS Church president Joseph F.

30|$|Secondary pore {{development}} zones (SPDZ) are {{a typical}} type of abnormally high porosity zone. Since Schmidt and McDonald (1977) proposed {{the theory that}} secondary pores in clastic reservoirs can form during diagenetic processes (Schmidt and McDonald 1977), scientists worldwide have made significant progress in identifying the distinguishing features, genetic mechanisms, distribution, and geological significance of secondary pores (Schmidt and McDonald 1979; Giles and De Boer 1990; Osborne and Swarbrick 1999; Higgs 2007; Zhu et al. 2006; Zhang 2007; Zeng 2001; Yuan and Wang 2001; Liu and Zhu 2006; Wang et al. 1995; Wang and Zhao 2001; Ma et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2008; Dutton and Loucks 2010; Taylor et al. 2015). Currently, SPDZs in shallow layers, which correspond to the mature stage of <b>organic</b> matter <b>evolution,</b> {{are considered to be}} generated from the dissolution of aluminum silicates and carbonate minerals by organic acids and CO 2 from <b>organic</b> matter <b>evolution</b> (Zeng 2001; Yuan and Wang 2001; Liu and Zhu 2006; Wang et al. 1995; Zhang et al. 2014). However, different viewpoints exist regarding the generation of deep SPDZs. Some authors believe that these features form by mineral dissolution in low porosity reservoirs at deep burial depths (Yuan and Wang 2001). Other authors, however, believe that the large amounts of secondary pores that form in these shallow formations are effectively preserved during deep burial, while primary pores are destroyed, which results in the formation of deep SPDZs (Wang et al., 2001; Ma et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2008; Bjørlykke and Jahren 2012; Bjørlykke 2014).|$|R
