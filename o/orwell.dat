25|$|In 2003, the centenary of <b>Orwell's</b> birth {{resulted}} in biographies by Gordon Bowker and D. J. Taylor, both academics and {{writers in the}} United Kingdom. Taylor notes the stage management which surrounds much of <b>Orwell's</b> behaviour, and Bowker highlights the essential sense of decency which he considers to have been <b>Orwell's</b> main motivation.|$|R
25|$|Sonia Brownell then {{commissioned}} Bernard Crick, {{a professor}} of politics at the University of London, to complete a biography and asked <b>Orwell's</b> friends to co-operate. Crick collated {{a considerable amount of}} material in his work, which was published in 1980, but his questioning of the factual accuracy of <b>Orwell's</b> first-person writings led to conflict with Brownell, and she tried to suppress the book. Crick concentrated on the facts of <b>Orwell's</b> life rather than his character, and presented primarily a political perspective on <b>Orwell's</b> life and work.|$|R
50|$|One of <b>Orwell's</b> biographers, Jeffrey Meyers, {{suggested}} in his Orwell: Wintry Conscience of a Generation (2000), that Georges Kopp was <b>Orwell's</b> main inspiration when {{he created the}} character of O'Brien in 1984.|$|R

5|$|VTF-9, meanwhile, was {{extended}} southward to <b>Orwell</b> over VTF-10A by 1938. Like VTF-10A, it initially bypassed <b>Orwell</b> {{to the north}} on Brown Lane; however, it was realigned in the late 1930s to follow modern VT73 into <b>Orwell.</b> Around the same time, VTF-9 was realigned east of Shoreham to follow VTF-9A northeast to Cornwall. The VTF-9A designation was eliminated while the former routing of VTF-9 between Shoreham and Leicester became unnumbered. In the early 1950s, New York extended NY73 east to the ferry landing by way of NY347 and Wicker and Montcalm Streets. Vermont renumbered the Larrabees Point–Orwell section of VTF-9 to VT73 in the mid-1950s in order to match the New York route number. At the same time, the Larrabees Point–Cornwall section of VTF-9 was renumbered by Vermont to VT74.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} a {{socially}} conservative tendency informed much of George <b>Orwell's</b> commentary between 1934 and 1943, and that the same tendency reflected a general European trend. The main sources of this thesis are a large selection of George <b>Orwell's</b> works and a smaller selection of works by Frantz Fanon, Jose Ortega y Gasset, and Antonio Gramsci. This thesis relies upon <b>Orwell's</b> involvement in the Spanish Civil War between 1936 and 1937 and his embrace of nationalism in 1940 as major organizational points of reference. This thesis concludes that <b>Orwell's</b> commentary {{was an example of}} a general European conservative reaction against Marxist-Leninist thought...|$|R

5000|$|The word [...] "telescreen" [...] {{also appears}} in Robert A. Heinlein's Space Cadet, written {{at the same}} time as <b>Orwell's</b> book, where it simply refers to an {{instrument}} similar to a large television, but with none of <b>Orwell's</b> sinister connotations.|$|R
5|$|Wigan Pier, a wharf on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, {{was made}} famous by the writer George <b>Orwell.</b> In his book, The Road to Wigan Pier, <b>Orwell</b> {{highlighted}} the poor working and living conditions of the inhabitants during the 1930s. Following the decline of heavy industry in the region, Wigan Pier's warehouses and wharfs became a local heritage centre and cultural quarter. The DW Stadium is home to Wigan Athletic Football Club and Wigan Warriors Rugby League Football Club.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the pamphlets British Pamphleteers Volume 1: From the 16th Century the 18th Century and Talking to India, by E. M. Forster, Richie Calder, Cedric Dover, Hsiao Ch'ien and Others: A Selection of English Language Broadcasts to India, <b>Orwell</b> edited two newspapers during his Eton years—College Days/The Colleger (1917) and Election Times (1917–1921). While working for the BBC, he collected six editions of a poetry magazine named Voice which were broadcast by <b>Orwell,</b> Mulk Raj Anand, John Atkins, Edmund Blunden, Venu Chitale, William Empson, Vida Hope, Godfrey Kenton, Una Marson, Herbert Read, and Stephen Spender. The magazine was published and distributed to the readers before being broadcast by the BBC. Issue five has not been recovered and was consequently excluded from A. J. West's collection of BBC transcripts.|$|E
5|$|Since {{his death}} many {{collections}} of essays have appeared, {{with the first}} attempt at a comprehensive collection being the four-volume Collected Essays, Letters and Journalism of George <b>Orwell</b> edited by Ian Angus and Sonia Brownell, which was published by Secker and Warburg and Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich in 1968–1970. Peter Davison of De Montfort University spent 17 years researching and correcting the entirety of Orwell's works with Angus and Sheila Davison, and devoted the last eleven volumes of the twenty-volume series The Complete Works of George <b>Orwell</b> to essays, letters, and journal entries. The entire series was initially printed by Secker and Warburg in 1986, finished by Random House in 1998, and revised between 2000 and 2002.|$|E
5|$|Kneale had {{fourteen}} years earlier adapted George <b>Orwell's</b> Nineteen Eighty-Four {{as a classic}} and controversial BBC broadcast and the play reflects much of Kneale's assimilation of <b>Orwell's</b> concern {{about the power of}} the media and Kneale's experience of the evolving media industry.|$|R
5000|$|Most biographers have to {{a greater}} or lesser extent {{concluded}} that [...] "Such, Such Were the Joys" [...] significantly misrepresents the school and exaggerates <b>Orwell's</b> suffering there.

5|$|Two essay {{collections}} {{were published}} during Orwell's lifetime—Inside the Whale and Other Essays in 1940 and Critical Essays in 1946 (the latter {{published in the}} United States as Dickens, Dali, and Others in 1958.) His publisher followed up these anthologies with Shooting an Elephant and Other Essays in 1950, England Your England and Other Essays in 1953—which was revised as Such, Such Were the Joys—and Collected Essays in 1961. The first significant publications in the United States were Doubleday's A Collection of Essays by George <b>Orwell</b> from 1954, 1956's The <b>Orwell</b> Reader, Fiction, Essays, and Reportage from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, and Penguin's Selected Essays in 1957; re-released in 1962 with the title Inside the Whale and Other Essays and in abridged form as Why I Write in 2005 {{as a part of}} the Great Ideas series. In the aforementioned series, Penguin also published the short collections Books v. Cigarettes (2008), Some Thoughts on the Common Toad (2010), and Decline of the English Murder (2009). The later does not contain the same texts as Decline of the English Murder and Other Essays, published by Penguin in association with Secker & Warburg in 1965. The complete texts <b>Orwell</b> wrote for the Observer are collected in Orwell: The Observer Years published by Atlantic Books in 2003.|$|E
5|$|During August and September 1326, Edward mobilised his defences {{along the}} coasts of England {{to protect against the}} {{possibility}} of an invasion either by France or by Roger Mortimer. Fleets were gathered at the ports of Portsmouth in the south and <b>Orwell</b> on the east coast, and a raiding force of 1,600 men was sent across the English Channel into Normandy as a diversionary attack. Edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his subjects to defend the kingdom, but with little impact. The regime's hold on power at the local level was fragile, the Despensers were widely disliked, and many of those Edward entrusted with the defence of the kingdom proved incompetent, or promptly turned against the regime. Some 2,000 men were ordered to gather at <b>Orwell</b> to repel any invasion, but only 55 appear to have actually arrived.|$|E

50|$|The {{veracity}} {{of the stories}} it contains about life at St. Cyprian's has been challenged {{by a number of}} commenters, including <b>Orwell's</b> contemporaries at the school and biographers, but its powerful writing and haunting observations have made it one of <b>Orwell's</b> most commonly anthologised essays.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is named}} after the main {{character}} in George <b>Orwell's</b> novel [...] "Nineteen Eighty-Four". The reference to <b>Orwell's</b> dystopia is embodied in the motto of PWS: [...] "Unplug the Big Brother" [...] which is aligned with its more generalist motto [...] "Paranoia is a virtue".|$|R
5|$|Ernest {{describes}} his close {{relationships with the}} local men; indulges in memories of previous relationships with writers such as George <b>Orwell,</b> and D.H. Lawrence; and satirizes the role of organized religion. Subjects {{as diverse as the}} smell of the pine woods in Michigan, the nature of Parisian cafés , and the quality of Simenon's writing are treated with stream of consciousness digressions.|$|E
5|$|Venom: Lethal Protector {{initiated}} the character's transition from unambiguous villain to anti-hero, and introduced several new characters (including Venom's symbiote offspring Scream, Phage, Riot, Lasher and Agony, who would recur in Marvel comics until the 2011 Carnage, U.S.A. limited series, vigilante group The Jury, its creator General <b>Orwell</b> Taylor, the Sentry, Bomblast, Ramshot, Screech and Firearm).|$|E
5|$|Writer Rhianna Pratchett {{has said}} that the game's story {{examined}} why citizens would accept a life in a society where their personal choices were very limited. It also looked at reasons people might have for attempting to live outside the system and what could result from this. The society portrayed in the game was somewhere between what George <b>Orwell</b> described as an 'anti-utopia' and a Nanny State.|$|E

5|$|On the Vermont side, {{the road}} {{connecting}} Larrabees Point {{to the main}} north–south highways in the area was designated as VTF-9 by 1926. VTF-9 began at the ferry landing at Larrabees Point and continued northeast to Shoreham Center, where it briefly overlapped with then-VT30A (modern VT22A). Past VT30A, VTF-9 continued east along what are now town highways through Whiting to Leicester, where it ended at a junction with US7. At the time, modern VT74 between Shoreham and Cornwall centers was known as VTF-9A while what is now VT73 from Larrabees Point to Brown Lane north of the town center of <b>Orwell</b> was part of VTF-10A.|$|E
5|$|<b>Orwell</b> wrote {{hundreds}} of essays, book reviews and editorials.

The latter press also published the collections Shooting an Elephant and Other Essays in 1950 (republished by Penguin in 2003) and England Your England and Other Essays in 1953.|$|E
