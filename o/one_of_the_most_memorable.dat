During that year's All-Star Game, he completed <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>memorable</b> highlights of his career, throwing the ball off the backboard to himself and completing an alley-oop in traffic.

5|$|In the {{circumstances}} {{it was hardly}} possible for the new king to show adaptability or tolerance or diplomatic skill, which are the fruit of long experience in human relationships. Confronted with a desperate and chaotic situation he met it instead with grim determination and implacable ferocity. Towards {{the end of his}} life, forfeiting the affection and loyalty even of his courtiers and family he became a lonely figure, isolated by suspicion and mistrust. But, in spite of all, the name of this great defender of the faith is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>memorable</b> in Ethiopian history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} the 25th, French, German, and British {{soldiers}} crossed trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and talk. In some areas, men from both sides ventured into no man's land on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to mingle and exchange food and souvenirs. There were joint burial ceremonies and prisoner swaps, while several meetings ended in carol-singing. Men played games of football (soccer) with one another, giving <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>memorable</b> images of the truce. Peaceful behavior was not ubiquitous; fighting continued in some sectors, while in others the sides settled on little more than arrangements to recover bodies.|$|E
5|$|The Saturn {{version of}} Silver Star Story was well {{received}} in Japan, with Weekly Sega Saturn Magazine recognizing it as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>memorable</b> gaming experiences of 1997. The PlayStation version received a 7 out of 10 score from Hyper PlayStation magazine, remarking that although it contained lower quality visual effects and movie playback {{than the previous}} Saturn releases, it still remained a solid role-playing game. It sold enough to qualify for Sony's PlayStation the Best distinction, and was subsequently re-released in Japan in April 1999 at a budget price.|$|E

5|$|The real-life {{surprise}} of the actors gave the scene an intense sense of realism and made {{it one of the}} film's most memorable moments. During preview screenings the crew noticed that some viewers would move towards the back of the theater {{so as not to be}} too close to the screen during the sequence. The scene has frequently been called <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>memorable</b> moments in cinema history. In 2007, Empire magazine named it as the greatest 18-rated moment in film, ranking it above the decapitation scene in The Omen (1976) and the transformation sequence in An American Werewolf in London (1981).|$|E
5|$|Shearer {{suffered}} an injury-hit and frustrating {{season in the}} 2000–01 season, having retired from international football after the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament to focus on club football. He managed only fivegoals in 19games in the league. The 2001–02 season was much better though; Shearer bagged 23goals in 37 league games as Newcastle finished fourth — their highest standing since 1997 — meaning they would qualify for the following season's Champions League competition. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>memorable</b> incidents of the season saw Roy Keane sent off after a confrontation with Shearer during Newcastle's 4–3 win over the Red Devils in September 2001. Shearer also saw red {{for the second time}} in his career this season, after allegedly elbowing an opposition player in a match against Charlton Athletic. The card was subsequently rescinded by referee Andy D'Urso after reviewing video replays after the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 France took on pre-tournament favourites Australia at Concord Oval for a {{place in}} the final. In one of the {{greatest}} World Cup matches, the Australians appeared to be in control, leading 9–0, 15–12 and 24–21 at various stages of the match, only for the French to keep coming back. With the scores locked at 24–24 and the prospect of extra time looming, the French scored <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>memorable</b> tries in rugby history. Starting an attack from inside their own half, the French passed the ball through 11 pairs of hands before fullback Serge Blanco beat Wallabies hooker Tom Lawton to score a try in the corner. France won 30–24, and would face co-hosts New Zealand in the final at Eden Park. The French had not fully recovered from their magnificent effort in the semi-final, and New Zealand won the anti-climactic decider 29–9.|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>memorable</b> City-Poly games {{occurred}} on Thanksgiving Day 1965, at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium, with some 25,000fans in attendance. City beat Poly 52–6, and completed a 10–0 {{season with the}} team finishing the season ranked eighth in the nation by a national sports poll. City's 52–6 victory over Poly in that game is the largest margin of victory {{in the history of}} the series. Former Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke was the quarterback and Maryland Delegate Curt Anderson was the captain. The game is no longer played on Thanksgiving or at Memorial Stadium, but is now located at the home of the Baltimore Ravens, M Bank Stadium, at Camden Yards in downtown Baltimore. City College won the 127th meeting in 2015 by routing Poly by a final score of 42–6, the school's fourth consecutive victory in the series. Poly now leads the series 62–59–6.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Early Netherlandish painters did not usually {{pay much attention to}} landscape backgrounds. They were often included, showing strong influence from the Italian painters, but typically as minor elements of the composition, seen in the far distance and lacking any real observation of nature. This diptych, however, contains <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>memorable</b> landscape backgrounds in Northern 15th-century art. The panoramic view of Jerusalem extends upwards in the distance to the mountainous peaked range in the background. The sky, which continues to {{the upper part of the}} right hand panel, is rendered in deep blues and lined with cumulus clouds. These clouds are similar to those in the Ghent Altarpiece and, as in that work, are included to give depth to and enliven the background skyscape. The sky seems to have just darkened, in keeping with the idea that the panel captures the moment of Jesus' death. Faint cirrus clouds can be seen in the far high-ground, with the presence of the sun is suggested by a shadow falling on the top left area of the panel.|$|E
5|$|To placate the Yankees' {{concerns}} about his durability, Rivera followed a {{strength and conditioning}} program in the offseason, instead of throwing. Torre {{said that he would}} try to reduce Rivera's workload during the 2003 season to minimize the injury risk to his closer. However, Rivera suffered a groin injury before the season began, causing him to miss the first month. After returning on April 30, he pitched well in the season's first half, saving 16games in 17opportunities. His save on June 12 against the St. Louis Cardinals secured the 300th career win for starter Roger Clemens. Rivera slumped early in the second half; over one stretch, he blew five of eleven save opportunities, but he rebounded to convert his final 15 of the season. He finished the 2003 regular season with a new career best in ERA (1.66), along with 40saves in 46opportunities. In the 2003 AL Championship Series against the arch-rival Boston Red Sox, Rivera had <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>memorable</b> postseason performances of his career; in the decisive Game 7, he entered in the ninth inning with the score tied 5–5 and pitched three scoreless innings, his longest outing since 1996. He became the winning pitcher after Aaron Boone hit an eleventh-inning walk-off home run that clinched the Yankees' series victory and advanced them to the 2003 World Series. Rivera celebrated by running to the pitcher's mound and collapsing in joy to thank God, as Boone rounded the bases and was met by his teammates at home plate. Rivera was named the AL Championship Series MVP for recording two saves and a win in the series. The Yankees lost the World Series to the Florida Marlins; Rivera saved five games and allowed only one earned run in 16innings pitched that postseason.|$|E
