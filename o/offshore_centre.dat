Lonely Planet remarked that [...] "nobody comes to Esbjerg for a holiday, in fact, as with many industrial ports, most visitors rush through as quickly as possible". Esbjerg is the main town for Denmark's oil and offshore activities, with companies like Maersk, Ramboll, Stimwell Services, ABB, Schlumberger, COWI and Atkins all having offshore-related activities in the town. Halliburton has an office in Esbjerg. The port has served the Danish offshore industry since oil and gas were first extracted from the North Sea in the early 1970s.

50|$|Views of <b>offshore</b> {{financial}} <b>centres</b> {{tend to be}} polarised. Proponents {{suggest that}} reputable <b>offshore</b> financial <b>centres</b> play a legitimate and integral role in international finance and trade, and that their zero-tax structure allows financial planning and risk management and makes possible some of the cross-border vehicles necessary for global trade, including financing for aircraft and shipping or reinsurance of medical facilities. Proponents point to the tacit support of <b>offshore</b> <b>centres</b> by {{the governments of the}} United States (which promotes <b>offshore</b> financial <b>centres</b> by the continuing use of the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC)) and United Kingdom (which actively promotes offshore finance in Caribbean dependent territories to help them diversify their economies and to facilitate the British Eurobond market).

Very few commentators express neutral views.|$|R
5000|$|The {{extent to}} which a {{jurisdiction}} is regarded as offshore is often a question of perception and degree. [...] Classic tax haven countries such as Bermuda, British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands are quintessentially offshore jurisdictions, and companies incorporated in those jurisdictions are invariably labelled as offshore companies. Thereafter there are certain small intermediate countries or areas such as Hong Kong and Singapore (sometimes referred to as [...] "mid-shore" [...] jurisdictions) which, whilst having oversized financial centres, are not zero tax regimes. Finally, there are classes of industrialised economies which can be used as part of tax mitigation structures, including countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and even the United Kingdom, particularly in commentary relating to corporate inversion. Furthermore, in Federal systems, states which operate like a classic <b>offshore</b> <b>centre</b> can result in corporations formed there being labelled as offshore, even if they form part of the largest economy in the world (for example, Delaware in the United States).|$|E

40|$|This case {{is set in}} July 2013, at the Microsoft IT - India {{headquarters}} in Hyderabad. This is the largest centre of Microsoft IT (“MSIT”) outside of Redmond, Washington, US, and the offshore arm of the Microsoft IT Engineering Divisions. In 2010, when Raj Biyani, a 12 -year veteran from Microsoft Redmond had taken over MSIT’s operations in Hyderabad, {{the results of the}} newly released employee survey were very disturbing. Morale was low, the attrition rate was on the rise and employee polls showed that they were frustrated as they had very little control over the work they did, but instead had to wait for tasks to be assigned from teams in Redmond on a project basis. The organisational structure at Microsoft IT India also created its own set of challenges, as it was divided along the same lines as Redmond, with several Business Process Units (BPUs) working in silos. All employees at Microsoft IT India reported to MSIT Redmond, with only a dotted line reporting to the manager at the helm of Microsoft IT India. This also meant that the teams were very fragmented due to a dual reporting structure. Moreover, a peculiar rotational leadership being practiced at Microsoft IT India had resulted in department heads leading the Indian organisation in turns - thereby resulting in a serious leadership vacuum. Biyani was clear that the only solution to this malaise was to ensure that Microsoft IT India became a strategic offshore operation of Microsoft. To achieve this goal, Biyani spearheaded a blueprint to transform MSIT India, and provide its employees with better growth and career opportunities. The proposal had two clear objectives. The first was to bring together the disconnected Microsoft IT India teams by aligning the organisation to process 2 ̆ 6 services; the second was to develop Microsoft IT India into a Regional Talent Hub (“RTH”) that would bring engineering resources into a shared pool that could be continually aligned to MSIT’s business priorities. Hence, instead of the teams being divided in five silo-like BPUs, all employees would now be combined under the leadership of three discipline leads. Moreover, all discipline leads would report directly to Biyani. To make this proposal more palatable to the Redmond stakeholders, the new positions of Regional General Managers and Regional Portfolio Managers were to be created, reporting directly to the Redmond BPU. By January 2013, the value proposition for Microsoft IT India was defined, and approvals received for the new positions. After several rounds of refinement, the model was implemented and successfully validated through several early wins. Biyani was convinced that the new model would transform Microsoft IT India and re-energise the teams. However, while the initial response received was very positive, he recognised that much had yet to be done. For the model to be truly sustainable, he would have to create a strong message around the value proposition, and come up with the most appropriate metrics to track and report the progress of his vision. What else would Biyani need to do to convince all Microsoft IT India stakeholders of the strong value proposition that had driven him to embark on this disruptive organisational transformation at the India <b>offshore</b> <b>centre...</b>|$|E
