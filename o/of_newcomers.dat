5|$|During {{a tumultuous}} pioneer period {{characterized}} by its centrality in {{proximity to the}} Western United States, transportation in Omaha demanded the construction of massive warehouses where frontier settlers could stock up and communities west of Omaha got food and supplies to build themselves with. Riverboats and stagecoaches jammed the riverside city with a variety <b>of</b> <b>newcomers,</b> prospectors and shady characters. Early Omaha also landed the Union Pacific Railroad headquarters, leading to its important place in national railroad lore.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the huge}} numbers <b>of</b> <b>newcomers</b> were driving Native Americans {{out of their}} {{traditional}} hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food-gathering areas, and they starved to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, Life Amongst the Modocs.|$|E
5|$|During a {{brilliant}} student {{career at the}} Conservatoire de Paris, Bizet won many prizes, including the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1857. He was recognised as an outstanding pianist, though {{he chose not to}} capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public. Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy, he found that the main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works <b>of</b> <b>newcomers.</b> His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored; as a result, his career stalled, and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others. Restless for success, he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s, most of which were abandoned. Neither of his two operas that reached the stage in this time—Les pêcheurs de perles and La jolie fille de Perth—were immediately successful.|$|E

5|$|In the 1820s, Boston's {{population}} grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically {{with the first}} wave of European immigrants. Irish immigrants dominated the first wave <b>of</b> <b>newcomers</b> during this period, especially following the Irish Potato Famine; by 1850, about 35,000 Irish lived in Boston. In {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans, Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews settling in the city. By the end of the 19th century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants. Italians inhabited the North End, Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown, and Russian Jews lived in the West End. Irish and Italian immigrants brought with them Roman Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest religious community, and the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics since the early 20th century; prominent figures include the Kennedys, Tip O'Neill, and John F. Fitzgerald.|$|E
5|$|The 15-year-long Lebanese Civil War {{that started}} in 1975 and the Iranian {{revolution}} of 1979 greatly contributed to the influx of Middle Eastern Armenians to the US. The Armenian communities in these Middle Eastern countries were well established and integrated, but not assimilated, into local populations. Armenians in Lebanon and Iran are represented in the parliaments as ethnic minorities. Many lived in luxury in their former countries, and more easily handled multilingualism, while retaining aspects of traditional Armenian culture. This wave <b>of</b> <b>newcomers</b> revitalized the Armenian American community, especially in the Los Angeles area, where most second-wave Armenian immigrants settled. In 1970 about 65,000 Armenians resided in Southern California, and two decades later, in 1989, the number of Armenian Americans was estimated at 200,000. Although the 1980 US Census put the number of Armenians living in Los Angeles at 52,400, of which 71.9% were foreign born: 14.7% in Iran, 14.3% in the USSR, 11.5% in Lebanon, 9.7% in Turkey, 11.7% in other Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, etc.), and the rest {{in other parts of}} the world.|$|E
5|$|Uruguay had a {{very low}} {{population}} density and a weak government. Ordinary citizens were compelled by circumstances to seek the protection of local caudillos—landlords who were either Colorados or Blancos and who used their workers, mostly gaucho horsemen, as private armies. The civil wars between the two factions were brutal. Harsh tactics produced ever-increasing alienation between the groups, and included seizure of land, confiscation of livestock and executions. The antagonism caused by atrocities, along with family loyalties and political ties, made reconciliation unthinkable. European immigrants, who came in great numbers during {{the latter half of}} the nineteenth century, were drawn into one party or the other; both parties had liberal and conservative wings, so the social and political views <b>of</b> <b>newcomers</b> could be reconciled with either. The feuding blocs impeded development of a broadly supported central national administration.|$|E

40|$|Sulfonylurea and glinide drugs, {{commonly}} used for antidiabetes therapies, {{are known to}} stimulate insulin release from pancreatic -cells by closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels. However, the specific actions of these drugs on insulin granule motion are largely unknown. Here, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to analyze the docking and fusion of single insulin granules in live -cells exposed to either the sulfonylurea drug glibenclamide or the glinide drug mitiglinide. TIRF images showed that both agents caused rapid fusion <b>of</b> <b>newcomer</b> insulin granules with the cell membrane in both control and diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat pancreatic -cells. However, {{in the context of}} -cells from sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR 1) knockout mice, TIRF images showed that only mitiglinide, but not glibenclamide, caused fusion <b>of</b> <b>newcomer</b> insulin granules. Compositely, our data indicate that 1) the mechanism by which both sulfonylurea and glinide drugs promote insulin release entails the preferential fusion <b>of</b> <b>newcomer,</b> rather than previously docked, insulin granules, and that 2) mitiglinide can induce insulin release by a mechanism independent of mitiglinide binding to SUR 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn the literature, many {{solutions}} {{for measuring the}} reputation of web services have been proposed. These solutions help in building service recommendation systems.

In this paper, we propose a new bootstrapping mechanism for evaluating the reputation <b>of</b> <b>newcomer</b> web services based on their initial Quality of Service (QoS) attributes, and their similarity with " long-standing " web services. Basically, the technique uses regression models for estimating the unknown reputation values <b>of</b> <b>newcomer</b> services from their known values of QoS attributes.
