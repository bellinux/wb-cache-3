The present study was aimed to {{investigate}} the phytotoxic activities of these weeds on the seed germination and seedling growth of Vigna unguiculata. The seeds of the test crop were sown in petri dishes lined with filter paper moistened with the different aqueous extract prepared from the weeds while control received distilled water. The {{results showed that the}} germination and seedling growth of Vigna unguiculata were inhibited by the application of fresh leaf extract of Chromoleana odorata. All the different extracts inhibited the root length of the test plant. It was suggested that these weeds be controlled in the field where they grow in association with cultivated crops...|$|E
