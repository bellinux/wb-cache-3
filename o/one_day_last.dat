2500|$|Well, it wasn't {{really my}} idea ... I didn't like {{the thought of}} doing it like {{everyone}} else–maybe a mix through the back catalog and a few exclusive new tracks by some key artists... I wanted something more special. Then a while ago I met Emika, she’s making music herself on Ninja Tune. We sat together <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>last</b> summer {{and she told me}} about her last visit to Berghain. It was a regular Sunday morning and she noticed how everything in the building was resonating and vibrating and swinging and humming–she realized that there were lot of sounds coming from the building itself. That led to the idea of doing field recordings within the building while it's not open to the public ... It took about two or three weeks ... It was a four gigabyte library.|$|E

2500|$|Stocky, {{grinning}} Capt. Frank Monroe Hawks, famed publicity flyer, {{holder of}} nearly all informal city-to-city speed records in the U.S. and Europe, was not grinning <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>last</b> week when attendants at the Worcester, Massachusetts, airport pulled him from beneath his crashed Travel Air [...] "Mystery Plane" [...] Texaco 13. Day before he had hopped from Detroit (in 3 hr. 5 min.). lectured the Worcester Boy Scouts on the necessity of developing foolproof planes, but had delayed his departure until the next morning because of a soggy field. An escort plane had nosed up when it landed just ahead of Capt. Hawks. After attempting to take off from a short dirt road which cut diagonally across the airport, he headed his low-wing monoplane down the field, less than 700 ft. in length. Oozy ground sucked at the wheels, kept him from attaining the 70 m.p.h. required to zoom off. Toward {{the end of the}} runway, going about 50 m.p.h., the ship bounced off a low mound, cut through heavy undergrowth, somersaulted over a stone wall. Hawks cut the motor in time, and saved himself from cremation. Capt. Hawks's nose and jaw were fractured, his face badly battered, several of his big, white teeth knocked out. He lay unconscious in the hospital for hours. Said Harvard Medical School's famed plastic surgeon, Dr. Varaztad Hovhannes Kazanjian: [...] "I do not think his speech will be affected. The operation for restoring his face should leave scarcely a scar." [...] Capt. Hawks's good friend Will Rogers wired: [...] "Sure glad nothing broke but your jaw. That will keep you still for a while. If I broke my jaw, I could still wire gags. What's the matter with you anyhow; are you getting... brittle?" ...|$|E

50|$|Labor Day, {{known in}} Spain as Primero de Mayo or el Día del Trabajador, {{originated}} in 1889 when a nationwide workers’ protest in the United States, originally only planned to <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> <b>lasted</b> several weeks in Chicago {{and ended with}} the imprisonment and assassination of several protesters. Even though the day started being celebrated internationally in 1890, it did not become a holiday in Spain until 1931, and since then its legal and celebrative statuses have varied greatly. Primero de Mayo in Toledo, Spain {{has always been a}} bit {{different from the rest of}} the country because it coincides with the celebration of la Virgen del Valle (the Virgin of the Valley), the town’s main yearly pilgrimage.
