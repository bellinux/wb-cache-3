However, McGuire did capture a number of Ziegfeld's traits, such as sending telegrams to people even in close proximity, his belief that elephants were a symbol <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck,</b> his exquisite taste in costumes and design, and perfectionism over his productions, especially lighting and rostrum pedestaling. McGuire's script, now in the Henry E. Huntington Library, San Marino, California, is dated September 21, 1935, probably the date when it was finalized.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the Eastern Gulf Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral Theodorus Bailey, De Soto spent March and April fruitlessly {{cruising}} for CSS Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico. As {{one of the}} few fast steamers in Bailey's command, De Soto {{possessed a}} speed advantage over most of her blockade running prey. This was demonstrated on 24 April, when De Soto sailors boarded and seized two sloops, Jane Adelie and Bright, sixteen hours out of Mobile, Alabama, and each laden with cotton. Two schooners, General Prim and Rapid, were then taken the very next day, and they too carried cotton. All four prizes were sent to Key West for adjudication. On 27 April, De Soto continued the run <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck,</b> seizing the British schooner Clarita en route from Havana, Cuba to Matamoras.|$|E

5|$|Victory at the Battle of Halmstad (17 August 1676), when Charles and his {{commander-in-chief}} Simon Grundel-Helmfelt defeated a Danish division, was the king's first glimmer <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck.</b> Charles continued south through Scania, {{arriving on}} the tableland of the flooded Kävlinge River– near Lund– on 11 November. The Danish army commanded by Christian V was positioned {{on the other}} side. It was impossible to cross the river and Charles {{had to wait for}} weeks until it froze over. This finally happened on 4 December and Charles launched a surprise attack on the Danish forces to fight the Battle of Lund. This was one of the bloodiest engagements of its time. Of the over 20,000 combatants, about 8,000 perished on the battlefield. All the Swedish commanders showed ability, but the chief glory of the day was attributed to Charles XI and his fighting spirit. The battle proved to be a decisive one for the rule of the Scanian lands and it has been described as the most significant event for Charles' personality. Charles commemorated this date the rest of his life.|$|E

However, Zhao Mengjian (趙孟堅, c. 1199 – 1267), in the Southern Song Dynasty was noted for his portrayal of narcissi, and Zhao's love of the flower is celebrated by the loyalist Song poet Qiu Yuan (c. 1247 – 1327).|$|E

The first evidence of this community is a document noting the attendance of Bishop Eborius of Eboracum at the Council of Arles in 314, and bishops also attended the First Council of Nicaea in 325, the Council of Sardica, and the Council of Ariminum.|$|E
25|$|In Norfolk, Suffolk and the {{northern}} parts of Essex, a black dog, known as Black Shuck or Shug is regarded as malevolent, with stories ranging from terrifying victims to being a portent of illness or death to themselves or a person close to the victim. There are tales that in 1577 it attacked {{the church in the}} village of Bungay, killing two people before running to the church in the nearby village of Blythburgh, leaving claw marks which remain today. There are also less common tales of a similar dog said to accompany people on their way home in the role of protector rather than a portent of ill omen. But in mid Essex Black Shuck is most commonly regarded as a bringer of death, except for on Mersea Island where it's a bringer <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck.</b>|$|E
25|$|A small, left-facing Indian-style {{swastika}} {{was painted}} {{on the inside of}} the original propeller spinner of the Spirit of St. Louis along with the names of all the Ryan Aircraft employees who designed and built it.

The inside of the original propeller spinner can be viewed at the National Air and Space Museum. This propeller spinner was found to be cracked when Lindbergh arrived at New York prior to his transatlantic flight.

25|$|There {{are several}} legends {{as to the}} origin of this custom. Two popular {{explanations}} for the South’s association with peas and good luck dates back to the American Civil War. The first is associated with General William T. Sherman’s march of the Union Army to the sea, during which they pillaged the Confederates' food supplies. Stories say peas and salted pork were said to have been left untouched, because of the belief that they were animal food unfit for human consumption. Southerners considered themselves lucky to be left with some supplies to help them survive the winter, and black-eyed peas evolved into a representation <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck.</b> In another Southern tradition, black-eyed peas was a symbol of emancipation for African-Americans who had previously been enslaved, and who after the Civil War were officially freed on New Years Day. Other Southern American traditions point to Jews of Ashkenazi and Sephardic ancestry in Southern cities and plantations.|$|E
