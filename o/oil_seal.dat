At first this only applied to [...] "Bombphoons", but {{eventually}} all Typhoons used these brakes. After tests conducted in 1943, {{it was determined that}} the Typhoon was capable of carrying a [...] bomb under each wing. With the increased load, it was decided that the extra take-off performance conferred by a four-bladed propeller was an advantage. This led to the adoption of a four-bladed propeller unit (de Havilland or Rotol) from early 1944. Coinciding with the new propeller, it was also decided that the larger tailplanes of the Hawker Tempest were to be fitted when tests showed that they improved the handling characteristics of the Typhoon when carrying [...] bombs. Problems were experienced with <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> leaks from the new propeller unit {{and a growing number of}} Typhoons were held in Maintenance Units (MUs) awaiting the arrival of new seals from the U.S. Some 200 Typhoons were manufactured with the new Tempest tails and the three-bladed propeller. A modification programme was inaugurated but it took several months before a majority of operational Typhoons had the four-bladed propeller and enlarged tailplane.|$|E

5000|$|A third {{manufacturing}} plant was opened in St. John’s by John Chalker Crosbie in 1925. Crosbie {{was inspired by}} a trip to Denmark, where oils from its whaling and sealing industry contributed to a prosperous margarine manufacturing business, despite the country's agrarian economy and large dairy industry. Crosbie thought that Newfoundland, which didn't have a large dairy industry and which produced large amounts of margarine ingredients such as fish oil, whale <b>oil,</b> <b>seal</b> oil as fishing byproducts, would {{be a good place to}} set up a margarine plant. The plant hired the expertise of a Danish chemist George Ehlers in its manufacture.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Volkswagen {{alloy case}} used by Hewland, the Traction Avant case {{could not be}} used up side down, as the input shaft height was much higher in {{relation}} to the output shaft axis so that the oil level needed to lubricate the gears would exceed the then-unreliable input shaft <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> height if used upside down. So the engine needed to sit high above the ground with the oil sump space below, which was not needed by dry-sump racing engines. But the French transaxle was used by several racing car constructors in the late 1950s to 60s with various levels of success.|$|E

The slider bodies are at the top, fixed in the triple clamps, and the stanchion tubes are at the bottom, fixed to the axle. This USD arrangement has two advantages: (i) it decreases the unsprung weight of the motorcycle; and (ii) it increases torsional stiffness, which can improve handling. Two disadvantages of USD forks are: (i) they are more expensive than conventional telescopic forks; and (ii) they are liable to lose all their damping oil should an <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> fail. USD forks are typically found on sportbikes, though the Honda Valkyrie featured USD forks.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{suggest that}} ω- 3 {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids (PUPAs) are beneficial in inhibiting {{the growth of}} cancer cells and may enhance the cytotoxicity induced by certain chemotherapeutic agents. It is known that <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> is rich in ω- 3 PUPAs. The effect of <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> and its role on the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by paclitaxel was, therefore, investigated in breast cancer cell lines, MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231. [...] MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cells were respectively treated with <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> paclitaxel, and paclitaxel in combination with <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b> Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay. Apoptosis was investigated by morphological changes and DNA strand break assay. Western blot assay {{was used to assess}} the expression of p 53 and Bcl- 2 proteins. The lipid peroxide products were measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TEARS) assay and the intracellular lipid composition was determined by gas chromatography (GC). [...] MTT assay showed that <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> induced cell death and enhanced paclitaxel cytotoxicity in both cell lines. The IC₅₀ values of paclitaxel in MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cells were reduced 3. 3 - and 2. 4 -fold, respectively, by the inclusion of 0. 016 % <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b> Morphological assessment and DNA strand break assay indicated that more cells treated with paclitaxel in combination with <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> underwent apoptosis than that with paclitaxel alone treatment. <b>Seal</b> <b>oil</b> alone was also found to induce apoptosis in both cell lines. Western blot showed that the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Bcl- 2 protein in both cell lines was down-regulated by <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> and was inhibited further when cells were treated with paclitaxel in combination with <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b> GC assay determined that the total PUFAs increased significantly in the intracellular lipid composition following incubation with <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> which may be responsible for the increased lipid peroxides found in cells incubated under the same conditions. [...] In addition to <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> Intralipid®, which is a soybean oil emulsion mainly containing ω- 6 PUFAs, was also studied for its cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction. It was found that soybean oil induced cell death in the MCF- 7 cell line but promoted cell growth in the MDA-MB- 231 cell line. Soybean oil did not induce apoptosis as characterized by morphological assessment. [...] In conclusion, <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> was found to induce apoptosis, and to enhance the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by paclitaxel in both breast cancer cell lines, which may be due to its ability to down-regulate the expression of Bcl- 2 protein and to produce lipid peroxides.
