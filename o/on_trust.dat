5|$|A {{secret trust}} is an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee to benefit a person {{without having to}} specify that person in a will. The trustee is transferred property {{under the terms of}} the will which he or she then holds <b>on</b> <b>trust</b> for others.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the fraud {{argument}} is significantly flawed. The theory suggests that liability for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about {{as soon as the}} trustee accepts the property to hold <b>on</b> <b>trust,</b> and so the fraud theory is not necessary to bind the trustee's hands.|$|E

5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, {{suggests}} {{the potential for}} a third class of secret trust. This is where the dying person is encouraged not to make a will so that his property passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. If this is the case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property <b>on</b> <b>trust</b> and fulfil the dying person's wishes.|$|E
5|$|The first Carlton House {{was named}} after Baron Carleton, and was sold to Lord Chesterfield in 1732, who held it <b>on</b> <b>trust</b> for Frederick, Prince of Wales. Frederick held his court there {{until his death in}} 1751, after which it was {{occupied}} by his widow until her death in 1772. In 1783, the then-Prince of Wales George bought the house, instructing his architect Henry Holland to completely remodel it.|$|E
5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a particular purpose. In {{the event that the}} debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held <b>on</b> <b>trust</b> for the creditor. Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced, and returned to the creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E

25|$|Affiliate {{marketing}} is commonly confused with referral marketing, as both forms of marketing use third parties to drive {{sales to the}} retailer.

25|$|European owners wanted rent in cash, kind or labour {{at their}} {{discretion}} {{and the ability}} to select tenants and workers and evict those they did not want, without reference to any customs that restricted these objectives. Africans wanted to occupy estate land under the same conditions as Trust Land: rent-free, without any obligation to provide labour or sell crops to the estate owner, and following traditional customs. Abrahams saw these views as irreconcilable and considered that African residents in estates should be “emancipated”, free to leave the estate and be resettled <b>on</b> <b>Trust</b> Land or to stay on terms negotiated with the owner, not imposed by legislation. This could not be done while much Native Trust Land was overcrowded, so the unused and under-used estate land needed to be acquired for the re-settlement of those leaving estates and also to accommodate some of the excess population already <b>on</b> <b>Trust</b> Land. Abrahams thought that the majority of estate residents would choose to leave, so the owners could then develop the remaining largely unoccupied parts of their estates.|$|E

40|$|Considering {{the need}} for a {{tangible}} focus for qualitative research <b>on</b> <b>trusting,</b> we propose that expectations to the behavior of others can provide that.

40|$|Recognizing the {{potentially}} ruinous effect of negative reviews on {{the reputation of}} the hosts as well as a subjective nature of the travel experience judgements, peer-to-peer accommodation sharing plat-forms, like Airbnb, have readily embraced the “response” option, empowering hosts with the voice to challenge, deny or at least apologize for the subject of critique. However, the effects of different re-sponse strategies <b>on</b> <b>trusting</b> beliefs towards the host remain unclear. To fill this gap, this study focus-es on understanding the impact of different response strategies and review negativity <b>on</b> <b>trusting</b> be-liefs towards the host in peer-to-peer accommodation sharing setting utilizing experimental methods. Examination of two different contexts, varying in the controllability of the subject of complaint, re-veals that when the subject of complaint is controllable by a host, such strategies as confession / apol-ogy and denial can improve trusting beliefs towards the host. However, when the subject of criticism is beyond the control of the host, denial of the issue does not yield guest’s confidence in the host, where-as confession and excuse have positive influence <b>on</b> <b>trusting</b> beliefs...|$|R
25|$|Hauerwas finds {{these two}} moral {{theories}} very limiting {{because they are}} quandary ethics, cases that rely on extreme situations. He believes {{that there needs to}} be a third reasoning that falls somewhere in between these two. He believes that the basic doctor-patient relationship should be built <b>on</b> <b>trust</b> and caring. This characterizes him as more of deontological thinker; however, he does believe in research on human beings. Hauerwas’s perspective is {{that there needs to be}} a middle ground between these two perspectives. The patient becomes dehumanized through research; however, without this research there would be little medical improvement. Hauerwas therefore believes this middle ground should focus on caring for the patient instead of curing. With this, Hauerwas believes we do not have the moral understanding to handle current medicine.|$|E
25|$|On 14 October, Egypt began {{a limited}} {{offensive}} against Israel for political reasons. Sadat needed Assad {{on his side}} for his peace policy with Israel to succeed, and military action was {{a means to an}} end. The renewed Egyptian military offensive was ill-conceived. A week later, due to Egyptian inactivity, the Israelis had organised and the Arabs had lost their most important advantage. While the military offensive gave Assad hope, this was an illusion; the Arabs had already lost the war militarily. Egypt's behavior during the war caused friction between Assad and Sadat. Assad, still inexperienced in foreign policy, believed that the Egyptian–Syrian alliance was based <b>on</b> <b>trust</b> and failed to understand Egypt's duplicity. Although it was not until after the war that Assad would learn that Sadat was in contact with American National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger almost daily during the war, the seeds of distrust had been sown. Around this time, Sadat called for an American-led ceasefire agreement between Egypt, Syria and Israel; however, he was unaware that under Kissinger's tenure the United States had become a staunch supporter of Israel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{security}} of public key validation protocols for web-based applications has recently attracted attention because of {{weaknesses in the}} certificate authority model, and consequent attacks. Recent proposals using public logs have succeeded in making certificate management more transparent and verifiable. However, those proposals involve a fixed set of authorities which create a monopoly, and they have heavy reliance <b>on</b> <b>trusted</b> parties that monitor the logs. We propose a distributed transparent key infrastructure (DTKI), which greatly reduces the monopoly of service providers and removes the reliance <b>on</b> <b>trusted</b> parties. In addition, this paper formalises the public log data structure and provides a formal analysis of the security that DTKI guarantees. ...|$|R
