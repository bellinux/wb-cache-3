5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, various national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts issue forecasts of hurricane activity. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as Weather Research Center (WRC) and Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), then known as TSUNAMI. The forecasts include weekly or monthly assessments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> factors that help {{determine the number of}} tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong pacifist {{sentiment}} after World War I, {{its aftermath}} still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the Treaty of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 per cent of its home territory {{and all of}} its overseas possessions, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rise}} of {{classical}} genetics, many biologists—including {{a new wave of}} physical scientists in biology—pursued the question of the gene and its physical nature. Warren Weaver—head of the science division of the Rockefeller Foundation—issued grants to promote research that applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term molecular biology for this approach in 1938; many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Grainger left Australia {{at the age}} of 13 {{to attend}} the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he {{established}} himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Awataguchi {{district}} of Kyoto, the Awataguchi school {{was active in}} the early and mid-Kamakura period. Leading members of the school were Kunitomo, whose tachi {{are similar to those of}} Sanjō Munechika, and Tōshirō Yoshimitsu, one of the most celebrated of all Japanese smiths. Yoshimitsu was the last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> smiths in the Awataguchi school, and the school was eventually replaced by the Rai school as the foremost school in Yamashiro Province.|$|E
5|$|Most {{historical}} {{buildings are}} concentrated in the Old Town. Bratislava's Town Hall is a complex of three buildings erected in the 14th–15th centuries and now hosts the Bratislava City Museum. Michael's Gate is the only gate that has been preserved from the medieval fortifications, and it ranks among {{the oldest of the}} town's buildings; the narrowest house in Europe is nearby. The University Library building, erected in 1756, was used by the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1802 to 1848. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> legislation of the Hungarian Reform Era (such as the abolition of serfdom and the foundation of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences) was enacted there.|$|E

5|$|The RMNDH {{was only}} a small part of the armed forces of the NDH, largely due to {{restrictions}} imposed by Italy. To avoid these restrictions, the Germans raised the Croatian Naval Legion which fought as part of the German Navy in the Black Sea campaign between 1941 and 1944. After the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the Germans transferred several captured Italian vessels to the RMNDH, although all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> ones had been lost by December 1944 when the remaining personnel were assigned to duties ashore to circumvent their defection to the Yugoslav Partisans. The RMNDH was disbanded in May 1945 with the collapse and defeat of the NDH.|$|E

5|$|Around 90% of the {{turquoise}} parrot population resides in New South Wales. The species is not listed as threatened on the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, though a status of near threatened was proposed by Stephen Garnett and Gabriel Crowley in their 2000 work The Action Plan for Australian Birds on account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> reduction in distribution. Its population and range have varied wildly; widely distributed across eastern Australia from Mackay to Melbourne {{up to the}} 1880s, it vanished from much of its range {{to the extent that}} it was presumed extinct in 1915. It was not recorded from Queensland between 1923 and 1950, and Victoria between the mid-1880s and 1949. However, numbers in New South Wales began increasing in the 1930s and the species had repopulated East Gippsland by the 1960s. Tentatively estimated at 20,000 breeding birds in 2000, the population is thought to be still rising.|$|E
5|$|Between the {{launching}} of the Invincibles to just after {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, the battlecruiser played a junior role in the developing dreadnought arms race, as it was never wholeheartedly adopted as the key weapon in British imperial defence, as Fisher had presumably desired. The biggest factor for this lack of acceptance was the marked change in Britain's strategic circumstances between their conception and the commissioning of the first ships. The prospective enemy for Britain had shifted from a Franco-Russian alliance with many armoured cruisers to a resurgent and increasingly belligerent Germany. Diplomatically, Britain had entered the Entente cordiale in 1904 and the Anglo-Russian Entente. Neither France nor Russia posed a particular naval threat; the Russian navy had largely been sunk or captured in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–5, while the French were in no hurry to adopt the new dreadnought-type design. Britain also boasted very cordial relations with two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> new naval powers, Japan (bolstered by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, signed in 1902 and renewed in 1905), and the USA. These changed strategic circumstances, and the great success of the Dreadnought, ensured that she rather than the Invincible became the new model capital ship. Nevertheless, battlecruiser construction played a part in the renewed naval arms-race sparked by the Dreadnought.|$|E

5|$|Carmella's {{relationship}} with Connor was originally scripted for Nina Tucker, but {{was transferred to}} Carmella by the producers on Goodrem's departure. Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out different sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> changes to Carmella was that she started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented {{that there had been a}} rivalry between the cousins in their youth, so it would be interesting to see what unfolded between them.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Salter Path, North Carolina {{and along}} the Outer Banks near that community, where (despite being only a Category 1 storm) many buildings suffered significant damage {{as a result of}} the storm surge, which has been described as worse than Hurricane Isabel in 2003 and even compared to Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Nearly all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> damage occurred on the sound side, or the side facing the mainland. In addition, several piers and many boats were damaged or destroyed by Ophelia's storm surge. Damage was generally lighter on the mainland, and overall structural damage was relatively light, although there was considerable flooding reported in the Wilmington area. Damage was initially estimated to be about $1.6billion, but in final analysis was dropped to only $70million (2005USD; $77.3million 2008USD). On October7, President George W. Bush declared a state of emergency for ten counties in North Carolina as a result of Ophelia.|$|E
5|$|Friday the 13th was the fifteenth-highest {{grossing}} R-rated film of 2009. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> {{decrease in}} box office revenues {{in its second}} weekend, the film had the sixth-largest second-weekend drop. It is the seventh-largest drop for a film that opened as the top-earning film in the United States. With its $65 million revenue at the North American box office, Friday the 13th is the highest-grossing film among the recent slasher remakes, which comprise When a Stranger Calls (2006), Black Christmas (2006), Halloween (2007), Prom Night (2008), and My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009). The film is ranked seventh-highest earning of all horror remakes, and is the seventh-highest earning slasher film in unadjusted dollars.|$|E

5|$|Oliphant {{took the}} {{initiative}} himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed. Oliphant also travelled to Berkley to with meet with Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium, Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant, George B. Pegram, and Arthur Compton to relay the details which Oliphant had directed to Lawrence. Oliphant was not only {{able to get in}} touch with Lawrence, but he met with Conant and Bush to inform them <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> data the MAUD had discovered. Oliphant’s ability to inform the Americans led to Oliphant convincing Lawrence, Lawrence convincing Compton, and then Kistiakowsky convincing Conant to move forward with nuclear weapons. These actions from Oliphant resulted in Bush taking this report directly to the president.|$|E
5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> {{events of}} Darius's early reign was {{the slaying of}} Intaphernes, {{one of the seven}} noblemen who had deposed the {{previous}} ruler and installed Darius as the new monarch. The seven had made an agreement that they could all visit the new king whenever they pleased, except when he was with his wife. One evening, Intaphernes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius had retired for the night. Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphernes drew his sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers. While leaving the palace, he took the bridle from his horse, and tied the two officers together. The officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphernes had done to them. Darius began to fear for his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had banded together to rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphernes's actions. They denied and disavowed any connection with Intaphernes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{owes its}} {{survival}} {{to a small}} group of enthusiasts, working with the French National Stud. A genetic study performed in 1994 revealed a genetic bottleneck in the mid-1900s, with the entire modern population of Poitevins tracing to one stallion, named Québec, foaled in 1960. There is a significant risk of inbreeding, leading the Unité Nationale de Sélection et de Promotion de Race to promote a plan of managed breeding in 1998. At the same time, crossbreeding with Friesian and Belgian horses was suggested to increase genetic diversity using morphologically and historically similar breeds. The French government distributes bonuses to the owners of the best stallions, a program more important to the Poitevin than to other draft breeds because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significant</b> possibility of extinction.|$|E
