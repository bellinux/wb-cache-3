5|$|Mills played {{primarily}} as a right back or as a midfielder. He was comfortable <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> could play the passing game and was a good tackler.|$|E
5|$|At Chelsea, Fàbregas {{played a}} similar playmaking role in midfield, using his technique, ball control, vision, and passing ability to dictate the tempo of his team's play, {{while he was}} {{supported}} by defensive midfielders, {{in order to give}} him more space and time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> In this deeper creative role, he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho, where he proved to be an effective assist-provider.|$|E
5|$|He {{began his}} {{professional}} career at Dundee United, where he helped them reach the 2014 Scottish Cup Final, and his abilities <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> earned comparisons to Lionel Messi from the Scottish media. In July 2014, {{he transferred to}} Sporting for a fee of around £3 million, and has mainly appeared for the club's B team. During the 2016–17 season, he was loaned to Vitória de Setúbal.|$|E

5|$|The kick was {{returned}} to the Cincinnati 48-yard line, and the Bearcats prepared for a desperation drive in hopes of narrowing the Hokies' lead. On the first play after the punt, however, Pike threw an interception to Virginia Tech defender Cody Grimm. Back in possession of the ball, Taylor kneeled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> four times to wind down the game clock. After the final kneeldown, Virginia Tech secured the 20–7 win.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{approaches of}} the two sides were cancelling each other out. Real's slow pace interspersed with high speed bursts, while Liverpool preferred a more deliberate approach, keeping possession and making use of their wingers. Their various forms of marking also negated each other, Real man marked Liverpool's best players such as Dalglish and Souness, while Liverpool were content for the nearest defender to mark the man <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{creative}} player <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> {{with excellent}} vision, technical skills, and {{an eye for}} goal, he is a free kick specialist and is capable of playing in several offensive positions. Due to his short stature, dynamic abilities and pace, Giovinco acquired the nickname formica atomica ("atomic ant", after the eponymous Hanna-Barbera character) in his youth. In 2015, he was {{named one of the}} 100 best footballers in the world by The Guardian, FourFourTwo, and L'Équipe.|$|E

5|$|Because of this, he {{was later}} moved to a {{deep-lying}} playmaker role by his coaches Mazzone, Fatih Terim, and Ancelotti, where {{he was able to}} excel due to his unique capabilities. This position best utilised Pirlo's attributes, and allowed him to operate creatively from a deeper position, in or even behind the main midfield line, in a seemingly defensive midfield role, where he was allowed more time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to create scoring opportunities with his trademark long balls. During his final season with Milan, Pirlo was also used on the wing under Allegri, due to his ability to provide accurate crosses.|$|E
5|$|Drogba {{is renowned}} for {{performing}} in big games, with a goalscoring record at club level of 10 goals in 10 finals winning 10 trophies. Aside from his goalscoring ability, Drogba is also {{capable of providing}} assists to his teammates. Between the 2009–10 and 2011–12 seasons, he managed 24 assists in the Premier League, with an average pass success rate of 61.4 percent, owing to his vision and creativity <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> He provided 71 assists to teammates {{over the course of}} his entire career at Chelsea until May 2012, showing that he is also a team player.|$|E
5|$|In {{their second}} game in three days, the Panhandles played against the Youngstown Patricians. It was a low-scoring, 2–0 loss. The lone score {{came from a}} safety in the second quarter. The Panhandles were about to punt, but it was blocked. The ball landed in the end zone, and a Panhandle player landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> According to the Youngstown Vindicator, the football's {{condition}} was damaged due to the water {{on the field and}} several fumbles occurred throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the best}} players in the world in his {{position}} during his prime, Evra is a fast, energetic and athletic left back, who, despite his size, is physically strong, and good in the air, which also allows him to be deployed as a centre-back on occasion; in addition to his physical attributes, he is also comfortable <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and adept at getting into attacking positions as a wing-back, where he can deliver crosses to teammates, having functioned as a winger earlier on in his career. An aggressive, tactically intelligent, versatile and hard-working player, he is also renowned for his leadership and tenacity on the pitch. These attributes make him effective both offensively and defensively.|$|E
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|Tech's Jayron Hosley {{returned}} Florida State's subsequent kickoff to the Tech 35-yard line, {{where the}} Hokies' offense {{returned to the}} field. Tech advanced the ball with short rushes, gaining two first downs via quarterback sneaks from Taylor. The Hokies advanced {{as far as the}} Florida State 44-yard line, but Florida State sacked Taylor twice, denying the Hokies another first down. Tech ran down the clock, then punted with 42 seconds remaining in the first half. Rather than attempt to score in the final seconds, Florida State kneeled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and let the first half end with Tech leading, 21–17.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee had {{one final}} {{opportunity}} to score after receiving Virginia Tech's kickoff with 2:38 remaining. Jonathan Crompton threw several passes downfield, completing throws of 9, 9, 8, and 26 yards, advancing the Volunteers {{toward the end}} zone. Inside the Virginia Tech red zone, however, the Volunteers found less success. They committed a false start penalty, advanced the ball with a five-yard run, then Crompton threw two incomplete passes. On fourth down, Crompton was sacked for a 14-yard loss, the Volunteers' final play of the game. Virginia Tech knelt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to run the final seconds off the clock and clinch the 37-14 victory.|$|E
5|$|The Gunn {{family home}} in Thurso was a farm, and the young Bryan would often pester the farmhands to play {{football}} with him. They would use a turnip if no ball was available. By the age of four he was keen on goalkeeping; he was fearless of injury and enjoyed diving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> When Bryan was four-and-a-half, {{the family moved to}} Invergordon, 20 miles from Inverness. He attended Park Primary School in the town and joined the school football team. Future professional Bobby Geddes was favoured over him as first-choice goalkeeper for the team; Gunn played as an outfield player until Geddes moved on to secondary school.|$|E
5|$|The free kick {{following}} the intentional safety {{was returned to}} near midfield, and Davis passed for a first down. Following the second down, Davis was sacked for a loss, but then scrambled for a first down to the Tech 25-yard line. From there, however, Boston College's offense began to struggle. During the four plays that followed, the Eagles were able to gain just one yard and turned the ball over on downs again. The final Boston College play was a sack of Davis, and Virginia Tech proceeded to run out the clock by kneeling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> after taking the field on offense.|$|E

5|$|To pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first {{gunpowder}} {{is poured}} down the bore. This {{is followed by}} a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of windage allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, the fuse located in the vent is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the vent, but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{regarded}} as an elegant batsman who had an erect stance at the crease. He was known for not hitting the ball hard but for having an easy and relaxed style. In hockey, a player {{is not allowed to}} lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and wrists and enabled him to impart momentum <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> without a large swing of the blade. Booth was particularly known for his late cut and his cover drive, which he played in a manner not dissimilar to Mark Waugh. He was known for his quick footwork against spin bowling and was rarely stumped, and he had the ability to change his batting tempo. Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps. A lean player, Booth stood 181cm, weighed 66kg and refrained from smoking, gambling and drinking. He was known for his efficient outfielding, and {{on the second day of}} the Second Test against the West Indies in Trinidad in 196465, he ran out Gary Sobers and Basil Butcher with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time leg spinner before converting to off spin.|$|E
5|$|Bowling {{for long}} periods caused McCool to {{continually}} tear a callus on his third finger, which he used to impart spin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave {{him out of the}} Test matches, feeling that his finger {{would not be able to}} handle the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger.|$|E
5000|$|In John Conway's definition, an n-tangle is {{a proper}} {{embedding}} of the disjoint union of n arcs into a 3-ball; the embedding must send the endpoints of the arcs to 2n marked points <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> boundary.|$|R

2500|$|Cold {{and humid}} weather {{are said to}} enhance swing. Colder air is denser and so may affect the {{differential}} forces <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> experiences in flight. When looking at humidity, changes between 0% and 40% humidity appear to have little to no effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> swing; yet, when approaching [...] 100% humidity [...] "condensation shock" [...] has been observed enhancing the swing of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> [...]|$|R
