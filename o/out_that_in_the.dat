5|$|M {{is another}} {{character}} {{who is more}} fully realised {{than in the previous}} novels, {{and for the first time}} in the series he is shown outside a work setting at the Blades club. It is never explained how he received or could afford his membership of the club, which had a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen, all of whom had to show £100,000 in cash or gilt-edged securities. Amis, in his study The James Bond Dossier, considers that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling; Amis points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1963 book On Her Majesty's Secret Service it is revealed that M's pay as head of the Secret Service is £6,500 a year.|$|E
5|$|Æthelwold's {{reign in}} Northumbria was short, in David Rollason's view because Æthelwold saw it {{only as a}} base for gaining power in Wessex. In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex, where Rollason states that he was {{accepted}} as king by the local Vikings. However, David Dumville points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next year Æthelwold persuaded the Danes in East Anglia to wage war against Edward, and Dumville argues that it is unlikely that there was an unknown separate Viking army in Essex. In his view Æthelwold was aiming to secure recognition in part of the kingdom of Wessex in order to strengthen his claim to the throne, and he succeeded in gaining the submission of the English rulers of Essex.|$|E
5|$|Holland {{looks at}} the {{earliest}} evidence for Muhammad, Mecca and Islam {{in the first century}} of the Arab Empire, pointing to a lack of evidence in the historical record to support the traditional account. Highlighting that very little Muslim testimony from the 7th century exists, he considers it suspect that 30 years after Muhammad's death, Muawiyah I became leader of the Arab Empire in Jerusalem despite showing little sign of being Muslim, and that no mention of Muhammad or Islam can be found in any of Muawiyah's inscriptions, coins, or documents. Holland proceeds to note that {{with the exception of a}} single ambiguous reference in the Qur'an, there is no mention of Mecca in any datable text for a century after Muhammed's death. He points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an, the Prophet appears to address farmers and agriculturalists while his opponents are described as keeping cattle and growing olives and vines. This appears to describe an environment foreign to Mecca, where there was no agriculture; thus Holland posits that the location attributed to Mecca in the Qur'an more closely fits a city in the Negev desert, in what is now southern Israel.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{theological}} truths {{have been}} promulgated as dogmas.

25|$|Crider points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1850s, {{editors and}} orators both North and South claimed their region {{was the true}} {{custodian}} of the legacy of 1776, as they used the Revolution symbolically in their rhetoric. Ryan, noting that the Bicentennial was celebrated {{a year after the}} United States' humiliating 1975 withdrawal from Vietnam, says the Ford administration stressed the themes of renewal and rebirth based on a restoration of traditional values, and presented a nostalgic approach to 1776 that made it seem eternally young and fresh.|$|E
25|$|However, Richard D. Gill {{has argued}} that Jaynes {{misunderstood}} Bell's analysis.

According to Jaynes (writing nearly 30 years after Bell's landmark contributions), it would probably take us another 30 years to fully appreciate Gull's stunning result.|$|E

25|$|In {{following}} years, UEFA made {{it possible}} for nations to forfeit Intertoto places. For example, in 1998, Scotland, San Marino and Moldova forfeited their places, and England, Portugal, and Greece forfeited one of their two, Crystal Palace being the sole English entrant despite finishing bottom of the Premier League. Other clubs have built upon their success in the UI Cup, following it up with great campaigns in the UEFA Cup. Furthermore, UEFA rejected this assertion that the tournament is disruptive. They point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2004–05 season, two of the three 2004 Intertoto Cup winners went on to qualify directly for the Champions League, whilst the 3rd one qualified by winning its 3rd qualifying round tie (Schalke and Lille directly, Villarreal by winning their 3rd qualifying round tie).|$|E
25|$|Johnson began a {{campaign}} against animal cruelty in 1954 when he first tabled a motion {{about the death of}} four horses in that year's Grand National. Johnson asked for Parliamentary time for a debate on the subject and was rebuffed. He then raised the question in an adjournment debate, pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last five Grand Nationals, out of 192 horses which had started, only 36 had finished and nine had had to be killed. Johnson called for an inquiry and demanded the end of heavy whipping. Johnson was in a minority of 32 Conservative MPs to support an increase in the Parliamentary salary in May 1954; the issue caused some concern among his constituents but the executive council of Kemptown (Brighton) Conservative Association passed a unanimous vote of confidence in him.|$|E
25|$|While Pakistan {{said that}} the plane was unarmed and the debris was within Pakistani territory, India {{maintained}} that warnings {{had been given to}} the Atlantic and that its flight trajectory meant it could have fallen {{on either side of the}} border. According to the Indian version of events, the MiGs tried to escort it to a nearby Indian base, when the Pakistani aircraft turned abruptly and tried to make a dash for the border; it was only then that it was fired upon. India claimed that the debris was found in a radius of 2km on either side of the border and that the intrusion took place 10km inside the Kori Creek, which is Indian territory. Pakistan requested that the matter be taken up in the UN. Indian officials claimed that there had been previous violations in the area and pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous year a Pakistani unmanned surveillance aircraft had intruded 150km inside the Indian border, coming close to the Bhuj air base before the IAF spotted it and brought it down with several missiles.|$|E

25|$|Nigamananda {{pointed out}} that the path shown by Gouranga, who practiced and preached {{unconditional}} devotion and love for God, was rather narrow, inasmuch as it was directed to Sri Krishna as the only God. In order to broaden that path, Nigamananda suggested taking the master as an embodiment of Sri Krishna (or any other deity whom the aspirant loved), in which case the guide himself becomes the goal. In this way Nigamananda convincingly reconciled the two apparently contradictory creeds of Shankaracharya and Gauranga who advocated the principle and practice of apparent duality between the devotee and God. After all, Nigamananda pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> path of devotion and love the aspirant has to subdue or tame his ego adequately and hence he attains to the same stage as that of the monastic aspirant whose ego loses its identity on attaining to his goal. In the former case, the devotee's individuality is reduced to a trifle, overpowered by personal god-consciousness, whereas in the latter the aspirant loses his self-consciousness in the ocean of impersonal universal consciousness.|$|E
25|$|MacDonald is {{best known}} for his trilogy that {{analyzes}} Judaism and Jewish culture from the perspective of evolutionary psychology, comprising A People That Shall Dwell Alone (1994), Separation and Its Discontents (1998), and The Culture of Critique (1998). He proposes that Judaism is a group evolutionary strategy to enhance the ability of Jews to out-compete non-Jews for resources. Using the term Jewish ethnocentrism, he argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior, as manifested in a series of influential intellectual movements. MacDonald repeatedly emphasizes that he does not argue that all Jews in all circumstances display the traits he identifies; for example, his Understanding Jewish Influence argues that neoconservatism is a Jewish intellectual movement, while MacDonald also points out that American Jews generally favor the Democratic Party, not Republicans or conservatives and he also points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2000 US Presidential Election about 80% of the Jewish vote went to United States Vice President Al Gore, who was campaigning against George W. Bush, whose campaign MacDonald claims was heavily staffed with and influenced by neoconservatives.|$|E
25|$|The {{stock market}} crash in the 1929 not only {{affected}} {{the business community and}} the public’s economic confidence, but also it led to the banking system soon after the turmoil. The boom of the US economy in the 1920s was based on high indebtedness, and the rupture of the debt chain caused by the collapse of the bank had produced widespread and far-reaching adverse effects. It is precisely because of the shaky banking system, the United States was using monetary policy to save the economy that had been severely constrained. The American economist Kindleberger of long-term studying of the Great Depression pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1929, before and {{after the collapse of the}} stock market, the Fed lowered interest rates, tried to expand the money supply and eased the financial market tensions for several times, however they were not successful, the fundamental reason was that the relationship between various credit institutions and the community was in a drastic adjustment process, the normal supply channels for money supply were blocked. Later, some economists argued that the Fed should do a large-scale opening market business at that time, but the essence of the statement was that the US government should be quick to implement measures to expand fiscal spending and fiscal deficits, whereas, the essence of this argument was that the US government should be promptly implemented to expand the fiscal spending and the fiscal deficits measures.|$|E
