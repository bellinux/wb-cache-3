2500|$|The <b>original</b> <b>administration</b> {{building}} {{was designed by}} the firm Russell & Alpaugh and the construction process began in 1923. The style which was chosen recalls the Romanesque of Northern Italy. The administration building once displayed an octagonal tower and a portico, but these features were toppled in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. An original cafeteria {{building was}} located where the current cafeteria and theater stand today. Although the gymnasium and a beautiful and widely admired auditorium were condemned following the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, the school's original main building from 1924 remains in use. The music building and gym (rebuilt in the early 1980s) have been scheduled to be taken down because they sit on a fault line and therefore against district policy. As of July 2010, the music building is gone.|$|E
2500|$|Trinity High School {{is made up}} {{of eleven}} {{distinct}} buildings, most of which are named for the department they house (often abbreviated to just the first letter). [...] The nine original buildings were: the Fine Arts Building, the Academics Building, the Library, the Science Building, the Physical Education Building, the Cafeteria, the Driver's Education Building, a small two-story building called D-Building, and an Administration Building. [...] The Physical Education building formerly included a natatorium that was mothballed and eventually demolished in the 2010s. The late 1990s brought three major changes to the campus: a system of covered walkways was built to connect most of the school's buildings, a new band hall was added to the Fine Arts Building, and a wing was added to the Academics Building. [...] This new wing became the new face of the campus because of its large and prominent façade and provided new offices for the principal, assistant principals, and secretaries. The <b>original</b> <b>Administration</b> Building was converted to house the counselors' offices.|$|E
2500|$|The University of Richmond's campus {{consists}} of [...] {{in a suburban}} setting on {{the western edge of}} the city. Most of the campus lies within the city limits; a small section of the south campus, including the Special Programs Building (home to the student health center and the campus police), intramural sports fields, and most of the campus apartments, lies within Henrico County. The university has, with few exceptions, remained true to the original architectural plans for the campus—red brick buildings in a collegiate gothic style set around shared open lawns. [...] Many of the original buildings, including Jeter Hall and North Court, both residence halls, and Ryland Hall, the <b>original</b> <b>administration</b> building and library for Richmond College, were designed by Ralph Adams Cram in 1910. Cram, a noted institutional architect, also designed buildings for Princeton, Cornell, Rice, and Williams, among other universities. [...] Warren H. Manning, a former apprentice to Frederick Law Olmsted, designed the original landscape plan. [...] The overall effect of the gothic architecture set amid a landscape of pines, rolling hills, and Westhampton Lake, is intimate and tranquil. In 2000, the campus was recognized by The Princeton Review as the most beautiful in the United States.|$|E

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to solve a lot of problem to shift from an IPv 4 network to an IPv 6 one.
