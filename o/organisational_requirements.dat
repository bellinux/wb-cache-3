40|$|Ever-increasing pace of {{technological}} advancements {{coupled with the}} evolution in organisational procedures and objectives significantly reduces the effectiveness of information systems implemented to fulfil strategic <b>organisational</b> information <b>requirements.</b> Effects of obsolescence are further aggravated by the declining manufacturer support and skill base required for modifying system components to meet evolving user requirements. These factors generally force organisations to replace their legacy information systems or to re-engineer them to effectively fulfil <b>organisational</b> information <b>requirements.</b> However, re-engineering and replacement are both not only costly activities but also have substantial associated risks. This paper discusses costeffective and low-risk techniques to enhance the capabilities of legacy IT systems by introducing high performance intelligent terminal equipment and middleware servers that collaborate with the legacy systems in fulfilling <b>organisational</b> information <b>requirements...</b>|$|R

40|$|Data {{models are}} key {{elements}} {{in understanding the}} meaning (semantics) of data and communicating the information requirements for geoscientific-environmental research. The British Geological Survey (BGS) models its data to provide an understanding of: the <b>organisational</b> information <b>requirements</b> and its communication; {{the nature of its}} data independent of their physical representations and to facilitate the access of the data across multiple outlets. Generally, the components of an optimal model are that it has: structural validity, simplicity, expressibility, nonredundancy, shareability, integrity and can be presented diagrammatically. However, trade-offs are sometimes necessary to avoid the loss of simplicity in trying to achieve greater expressibility in a data model. The paper explores the role of data modelling at the British Geological Survey (BGS) in developing an integrated geoscientific data model, a component of a multi-tiered data architecture. ...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A survey of the literature has suggested that most of IT system failure in information system development is due to problems of identifying and meeting users' requirements. Conventional systems that support the waterfall approach {{try to focus on}} defining information processing requirements rather than looking at IT from a wider perspective. This approach complicates the relationship between the client who 'owns' the problem and the developer who seeks to solve it. Therefore it is common for systems to be created which do not satisfy the needs of their human operators even though they are technically sound. The main aim of the research is to develop a new methodology that can contribute to the effective determination of user requirement. The new methodology has been constructed from unifying ORDIT (<b>Organisational</b> <b>Requirement</b> Definition for Information Technology) and ISAC (Information System Work and Analysis of Change) methodologies. Therefore it can solve a certain set of problems, some which are solved by ORDIT, some which are also solved by ISAC and some which neither of the two methodologies can solve. The activity model used in ISAC is insufficient for solving the organisational issues, therefore it is replaced with the responsibility model which is taken from ORDIT. The responsibility model is used in order to give a clearer understanding of the organisation's structure, aim, objectives and policies. The tables and tools, which are used in the change analysis stage ofISAC, will be used in the new methodology for the purpose of identifying the business problem, user objectives and change needs. These tools and models are used in order to elicit requirements for different problem owner in different levels of the organisation. The new methodology has been applied to a real case study in order to demonstrate and evaluate its performance and usefulness. This case study showed the new methodology to be useful and effective...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} employees' perceptions of the fairness of employment equity practices. It was conducted in an organisation in the Health Services industry, using a Diversity Questionnaire. The sample size was 520 and 245 responses were received, constituting a 47 % response rate. Employees' responses were measured along 10 dimensions of employment equity. The unit of analysis was the group according to gender, race, age and job level. Independent t-tests and analysis of variance techniques were used to determine any statistically significant differences in perceptions between groups. Statistically significant differences were found between race groups and job levels. Gender and age did not significantly affect employees' responses. The research concluded that compliance with <b>organisational</b> justice <b>requirements</b> is as important as compliance with legislative requirements. Ultimately, every organisation should adapt its employment equity strategy according to its specific demographic and environmental context. Industrial and Organisational PsychologyM. Admin...|$|R

30|$|Consistent with an abductive {{research}} technique, new CSR {{themes were}} also identified during coding. The criterion for determining a new theme {{was that it}} was identified by an interviewee as being critical and integral to their interpretation of CSR or it was a strong and re-current theme emerging from CSR practitioners’ discussions of how CSR was implemented. 10 The identified CSR meanings reflected individual/personal meanings/views of CSR, although these were often aligned with broader <b>organisational</b> values. The <b>requirement</b> to code new themes led to the need to develop a new dimension or category of CSR, which was unrelated to Carroll’s four dimensions and was called ‘CSR interaction’, with six themes coded underneath this category.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Often e-Procurement {{systems are}} {{implemented}} because authorities ’ guidelines, tools or legal setting mandates them. The growing relevance of e-Procurement systems and tools {{in public health}} care organisations (HCOs) has raised much attention in business practice and the academic literature, also related to the improvement of public health care services and community welfare (e. g. Henriksen et al., EU Directives 17 - 18 / 2004). The aim {{of this paper is}} to explore <b>organisational</b> <b>requirements</b> that a HCO must meet in order to successfully implement an e-Procurement system, in terms of organisational culture, managerial skills, human resource management and capabilities to manage inter organisational relationships and IT infrastructures. We focused our investigation on the Italian Health Care Sector managed by the public in a complex environment. According to an interpretive approach, we conducted a case study research on 33 Italian public HCOs, both hospitals and local health care services, through a series of in-depth interviews to those departments responsible for procurement. In Italy, in spite of the efforts by both Governments and the EU, it seems the adoption of e-Procurement has not taken off. The results show a) a lack of <b>organisational</b> <b>requirements</b> which don’t allow exploitation of ICT opportunities in the procurement processes, b) HCOs have not however considered <b>organisational</b> <b>requirements</b> in e-Procurement implementation processes; this has led to a sub-optimal adoption of e-Procurement systems and c) inadequacy of IT infrastructure. The implications of our research are that e-Procurement diffusion and success must be anticipated by a deep analysis of the <b>organisational</b> <b>requirements</b> that can improve HCO...|$|E

40|$|Leaders In Need’ is a {{qualitative}} study contributing {{to an understanding}} of the mechanisms for exploring and identifying leadership development requirements and needs. It explores the views of senior leaders in local government as they reflect upon their individual leadership development needs and the <b>organisational</b> <b>requirements</b> expected of them. The research identifies four themes: becoming a leader, <b>organisational</b> <b>requirements,</b> individual needs and potential for improvements. Theme one explores the entry, experience and education of leaders as they prepare to make a transition from professional to leader. Theme two explores <b>organisational</b> <b>requirements,</b> organisational change, challenge and capability. Theme three explores how individual development needs are defined, identified and satisfied. Theme four explores whether improvements can be made to the mechanisms for investigating organisational development requirements and individual development needs. The research finds that leaders and their organisation do have development needs and requirements responsive to transformative modernisation. There are processes and mechanisms available to assist organisations and individuals explore and identify leadership development. When they are applied they are perceived to lack the rigour and effectiveness to adequately explore and identify leadership development requirements and needs. Perceived performance levels influence the mechanisms for exploring development requirements and needs. Leaders direct personal development activity when performance levels are perceived as acceptable. The organisation directs leadership development when performance levels are perceived as unacceptable. There is potential to improve a leadership development response by ensuring individual and organisational development activities overla...|$|E
