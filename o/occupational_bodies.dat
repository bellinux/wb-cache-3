To understand the potential effect of a sensory loss on dynamic low back stability a lumped parameter model of the trunk and neuromotor response was created. Using this model, an increase in the threshold of the sensory system was predicted to increase trunk flexion and delay neuromotor response with a sudden, unexpected perturbation. These predictions were demonstrated in a second experiment where subjects exhibited both an 11. 9 % increase in trunk flexion and an 11. 2 % increase in time to peak paraspinal muscle response (measured using integrated electromyographic activity) after exposure to 20 minutes of vertical, seated, whole body vibration...|$|R

The aim of this bachelor thesis is to create a synoptic manual on processing of body scheme from the perinatal period when the creating of body scheme is an indispensable component, to neonatal, infant and toddler age, when the possibilities of influencing the disorders are the most effective and provide good results. The thesis is divided into two parts; one is theoretical and the other practical. The theoretical part describes the commonly used terms relating to the body and body perception, perception development, specific diagnoses, where the body image disorder is present, methods of evaluation and therapy.

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the fundamental tenets that define the occupational therapy education process, {{and to develop a}} professional education paradigm that corresponds to those principles. Interpretive phenomenology with Heideggerian hermeneutic philosophy was used to explicate the paradigmatic themes embedded in the <b>occupational</b> therapy <b>body</b> of knowledge. The results yielded the Occupational Therapy Professional Education Paradigm (OT-PEP), which is organized around three core concepts: Adaptive thinking, reflection, and creation of meaning. The OT-PEP is important to occupational therapy because it addresses the elements of the education process that are reflective of the philosophical underpinnings of the profession and brings together these understandings as a unified whole. Interpretive phenomenology asserts that analysis of data is influenced by the phenomenologist’s repertoire of experience. Therefore, the OT-PEP presented in the article can be considered a single offering from the author that has the potential to morph with additional analyses. The author is hopeful that occupational therapy education programs will discuss and debate the OT-PEP constructs and determine which elements are most valuable.

METHODS: A total of 402 Caucasians consecutively undergoing total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR) for idiopathic OA at a major centre was surveyed. RESULTS: Previous joint injury was {{more common in the}} TKR group (P < 0. 0001). However, both groups manifested a mixed <b>occupational</b> background, <b>body</b> mass indices similar to the general population and a predominance of females (F:M = 1. 3 - 1. 4 : 1). The TKR group had a significantly younger age of symptom onset (56 yr) than the THR group (61 yr) but both groups had a tendency to bilateral arthroplasty (33 %), nodal involvement (54 - 59 %), a significant excess of right-sided replacements (1. 8 : 1, THR; 2. 2 : 1, TKR) and similar levels of pre-operative pain and disability. Up to 40 % of hips manifested acetabular dysplasia and 10 % possible previous slipped upper femoral epiphyses.

40|$|Objectives: The largest {{study to}} date around six major European airports, the HYENA study (HYpertension and Exposure to Noise near Airports) {{reported}} an excess risk of hypertension related to long-term aircraft noise exposure. The DEBATS study (Discussion {{on the health}} effects of aircraft noise) investigated the relationship between this exposure and the risk of hypertension in men and in women near French airports. Methods: Blood pressure of 1, 244 participants older than 18 years of age was measured. Information about health, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors was collected by means of a face-to-face questionnaire performed at home by an interviewer. Aircraft noise exposure was assessed for each participant's home address using noise maps. They were calculated with the integrated noise model (INM) with a 1 dB-resolution. The major potential confounders being risk factors for hypertension were included in the logistic regression models: age, <b>occupational</b> activity, <b>body</b> mass index, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. Results: After adjustment for the main potential confounders, an exposure-response relationship was evidenced between the risk of hypertension and aircraft noise exposure at night for men only. A 10 -dB(A) increase in Lnight was associated with an odds-ratio of 1. 34 (95 %CI= 1. 00 - 1. 97). Conclusions: These findings contribute to the overall evidence suggesting that aircraft noise exposure at night-time may increase the risk of hypertension in men.

This study was undertaken to investigate the presence and risk factors of depression in the COPD patients attending a tertiary care health facility in north India. Methods: COPD was classified according to GOLD stages based on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) in 126 stable patients. Depression was examined by administering the nine-item Hindi version of Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ- 9). Linear regression model was used to examine association between predictor variables and risk of depression with adjustment of age and sex. Cronbach alpha was calculated to assess internal consistency of PHQ- 9.

40|$|Occupational therapy (OT) lecturers {{are at the}} {{interface}} between student education and training and professional practice and therefore have unique insights into the contemporary factors shaping their professional identity {{and that of the}} profession. Two main contemporary and interrelated factors have been identified. Firstly, neoliberalist government policies which encourage the marketisation of health and social care provision, which has implications for how the profession is defined and for professional autonomy and values, ways of working, education and training. Secondly, how knowledge is constructed and used within evidence based practice and whether this is compatible with an emerging <b>occupational</b> therapy <b>body</b> of knowledge. These factors are being played out in the fields of representation, regulation and higher education, shaping OT lecturer professional identity and therefore approaches to teaching and learning. This was understood as a structure and agency relationship based on Bourdieu’s theories on ‘Habitus’, ‘Field’ and ‘Capital’ (Bourdieu 1998, 1990, 1977). To do this, nine narrative inquiry focused interviews of occupational therapy lecturers from two universities were carried out. These narratives were understood within wider organisational contexts using a document analysis. A thematic analysis was applied to both interviews and documents. Five main themes have been identified: professional identity and artistry; professional and philosophical body of knowledge; doing research, evidencing practice and the neoliberal agenda; the representation and regulation of the College of Occupational Therapists (COT) and the Health Care and Professions Council HCPC); and moving into new ways of working – the selling of OT.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} an introduction, four research papers and one paper describing the data I collected for the studies and how I conducted the study. I collected information on men from conscript inspection lists and linked this {{to a sample of}} men in the Scanian Economic Demographic Database (SEDD) born between 1797 and 1950. The four research papers analyze influences on height and weight in the 19 th and 20 th centuries using individual-level data with uniquely rich and detailed information on community context and family background. Paper 1 investigates the long-term changes in socioeconomic differences in height. Sons of landholders were, on average, taller than others in the early and mid- 19 th century but lost this advantage in the late 19 th century. Sons of fathers with non-manual occupations were always the tallest group in the population. The magnitude of the socioeconomic differences in height varied over time but became smaller over time. Paper 2 investigates the association between the number of siblings present in the household and the height of the sons. I find that men with a larger number of siblings were, on average, shorter than others in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. Dilution of parental resources is a likely explanation of this. The results show that, even if the parental resources were important, {{it is also important to}} consider the societal and historical context. The average height of men in Sweden shows a closely mirrored development to the level of infant mortality. In Paper 3 I test the association between height and the infant mortality rate in the year of birth, first year of life and the adult death rate during pregnancy using a sibling comparison design. I find that both the influence of the risk of being sick as an infant and the selection effect of mortality on height are likely to be weak. Paper 4 investigates the <b>occupational</b> differences in <b>body</b> mass index among men born between 1934 and 1950. Socioeconomic differences in body mass index and the risk of obesity are found almost universally in present-day high-income countries.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 An {{association}} between <b>occupational</b> whole <b>body</b> vibration (WBV) exposure {{and the development}} of lower back pain (LBP) has been established through numerous epidemiological studies. However, the etiological and biomechanical mechanisms of how WBV contributes to LBP and injury are not well understood. Using field-measured occupational WBV exposures in a controlled laboratory setting, this study attempted to expose the human lumbar spine to occupational WBV exposures to better understand the mechanisms of WBV-related low back injury. The occupational exposures selected for this study were those encountered by bus drivers, who are known to have a high prevalence of LBP. Continuous and impulsive WBV accelerations collected at the floor of a bus traversing a standardized route in the Seattle metro area were played into a six-degree of freedom hydraulic shaker platform. Twelve professional drivers sat on an air suspension seat mounted to a six-degree of freedom hydraulic shaker platform. The drivers' response to the continuous and impulsive exposures at the seat and sternum were recorded. The difference between seat- and sternum-measured accelerations were used to calculate the displacement of the spine during the vibrations encountered during continuous and impulsive exposures. Based on these two exposure patterns for the bus drivers, six human lumbar functional spine units (FSUs) were placed in a servohydraulic testing system and continuously exposed to one of the two vibration signatures. A unique staining technique was used to visually differentiate preexisting intervertebral disc damage and damage brought on by cycling the FSU. No discernible damage was found for discs exposed to the continuous WBV while exposing FSUs to the impulsive WBV resulted in endplate fractures and damage to the annulus fibrosis of the intervertebral disc. These findings indicate that, for equal drive times, a more impulsive and intermittent loading signature is more likely to cause injury to components of the low back than a relatively less impulsive and more continuous signature...|$|R

This positioning paper was commissioned by the national training sector’s e-learning strategy, the Australian Flexible Learning Framework (Framework), and was written by University of South Queensland Link Affiliates (USQ Link Affiliates).    The Framework’s E-portfolios business activity (E-portfolios) is taking a national standards-based approach to the use of e-portfolio technologies for managing learner transitions, and is driven by the VET E-portfolio Roadmap (Roadmap).    The Roadmap’s key goal of Verification, to “enable electronic verification of educational attainment data, membership of professional associations or trade/occupational licensing information”, enables E-portfolios to take a leadership role in gaining national agreement in the development of learner information systems which allow learners electronic access to their VET learner attainment data. E-portfolios are learner-driven collections of digital objects, demonstrating experiences, achievements and evidence of learning, and provide learners with a structured way of managing their learning experiences and work history. E-portfolios have been identified as supporting learners to effectively move: • into the VET sector • from the VET sector to further education, and • between VET and employment.

Of the 415, 209 hospital beds in France, 26, 158 BBFE could have occurred in France in 2012, compared with 35, 364 BBFE in 2003. Healthcare personnel safety has been sharply improved during the past 10 years in France...|$|R
40|$|Background: PostExposure Prophylaxis (PEP) {{is widely}} used after {{exposures}} to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) {{to reduce the risk}} of infection in the healthcare setting. Few data are available on the safety and tolerability of Anti Retro Viral drugs (ARV) among Health Care Workers (HCWs) who are prescribed prophylaxis. Objective: To collect information about the safety and compliance of taking ARV for HIV PEP among HCWs. Material and Method: Retrospective review on registry data regarding occupational HIV exposures, the PEP regimens used, and the adverse events associated with PEP was performed. Results: During a five year-period, 820 episodes with <b>occupational</b> blood or <b>body</b> fluid exposures were reported. Nurses (27 %) were the largest group at risk. The most common type of exposure was percutaneous injuries (82 %). Only 125 (15 %) HCWs had occupational exposures to HIV, 64 HCWs were prescribed HIV PEP and 32 (50 %) HCWs did not complete the PEP regimen as initially prescribed. The commonly prescribed ARV was zidovudine (38 %), lamivudine (33 %), and indinavir (11 %). Overall, 18 (28 %) HCWs reported symptoms while on PEP, such as nausea (89 %), vomiting (55 %), and dizziness (39 %). None of the HCWs had HIV seroconversion. Conclusions: Adverse effects from HIV PEP were very common. Clinicians prescribing HIV PEP need to discuss with HCWs about PEP efficacy and side effects. Education efforts aimed at occupational exposur...|$|R
40|$|Analyses of {{asbestos}} bodies {{from the general}} population have confirmed that these structures, like asbestos bodies from the lungs {{of asbestos}} workers, contain an asbestos core. In members of the general population this core is almost always an amphibole, whereas asbestos workers may have bodies formed on either amphibole or chrysotile. Most adults have a few bodies, and increasing numbers are seen in blue collar workers and others who handle small amounts of the fiber, with the highest levels being seen in asbestos workers. In men with minimal or extensive <b>occupational</b> exposure, asbestos <b>bodies</b> are formed on the commercial fibers, amosite and crocidolite, whereas women also form a significant number of bodies on the noncommercial fibers, anthophyllite and tremolite. These findings suggest that women may be exposed to specific asbestos-containing products, eg, cosmetic talc. The commercial fibers found in women and white collar men probably reflect atmospheric pollution with asbestos. At the highest levels of exposure, numbers of asbestos bodies correlate in a general way with the presence of asbestosis, although no precise value has been determined above which asbestosis is always found. In persons with much lower or environmental exposure, there {{does not appear to be}} any correlation between numbers of bodies and disease, in particular between numbers of bodies and carcinoma of the lung or gastrointestinal tract. The situation for mesothelioma is uncertain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Physical {{activity}} in leisure time is often {{considered to have}} favourable effects on the risk of low back pain (LBP), but demonstrating a definite association in epidemiological studies has proven difficult. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to explore associations between physical activity and risk of chronic LBP in an adult population and to investigate whether relationships are limited to certain age groups or to females or males. A particular objective was to determine whether support could be found for a U-shaped relationship, with both low and high activity levels carrying greater risk. Methods The relationship between physical activity and risk of chronic LBP was examined in a Norwegian prospective study using data from the community-based HUNT 2 and HUNT 3 surveys. Participants were 9616 women and 8452 men without LBP at baseline, who reported after 11  years whether they suffered from LBP. Associations between baseline physical {{activity in}} leisure time and risk of chronic LBP at end of follow-up were evaluated by generalized linear modelling with adjustment for potential confounders. Results Significant associations between leisure time physical activity and risk were observed in both sexes after age adjustment, mainly suggesting inverse relationships. Women participating in hard physical activity 1 – 2 h per week had a relative risk (RR) of chronic LBP of 0. 81 (95  % CI 0. 71 – 0. 93) compared to those with only light physical activity less than 1  h per week. The corresponding RR in men was 0. 71 (95  % CI 0. 60 – 0. 85). After adjustment for education, employment, <b>occupational</b> activity, <b>body</b> mass index (BMI) and smoking, significant relationships could only be demonstrated in those aged 50  years or more at baseline. The associations differed between female educational groups, with more U-shaped relationships being observed among women with basic education only. Conclusion No strong support was found overall for U-shaped relationships. However, no further general decrease in risk was seen among those with 3  h or more of hard physical activity per week. The contrasts observed between female educational groups may reflect different preferences regarding specific strenuous activities. Men aged 50  years or more seem in particular to benefit from hard physical activities...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{association}} between non-fasting serum glucose concentrations and major ischaemic heart disease (IHD) events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction). DESIGN [...] A prospective study. SUBJECTS [...] A population based sample of 7735 middle aged British men. Known diabetics, men with a glucose concentration > or = 11. 1 mmol/l at screening, and hypertensive patients taking regular medication {{were excluded from the}} analysis. With exclusions (n = 509) and missing glucose values (n = 49), there were 7177 men available for analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Major IHD events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction) during 9. 5 years follow up on all men. RESULTS [...] There were 505 major IHD events, 222 fatal and 283 non-fatal, in the 7177 men studied. There was a non-linear relation between the glucose concentration and the risk (per 1000 men per year) of all major IHD events and fatal IHD events, with the excess risk in the upper quintile of the glucose distribution (> or = 6. 1 mmol/l). The unadjusted relative risks (RR) in the upper glucose concentration quintile compared with the first to the fourth quintiles combined were 1. 4 (95 % CI 1. 1, 1. 7) for all events and 1. 3 (95 % CI 1. 0, 1. 7) for fatal events. Adjustment for age, smoking, <b>occupational</b> status, <b>body</b> mass index, physical activity, systolic blood pressure, total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations had a minimal effect on these relative risk estimates. This non-linear relationship between the serum glucose concentration and the risk of a major IHD event was observed in men with no evidence of IHD at screening (n = 5518) but not in men with IHD (n = 1659). In the former group, the RR (adjusted for major coronary risk factors) for all major IHD events in the upper quintile relative to the lower quintiles combined was 1. 5 (95 % CI 1. 2, 2. 0) and for fatal IHD events was 1. 8 (95 % CI 1. 1, 2. 6). CONCLUSION [...] These data suggest that asymptomatic hyperglycaemia is an independent risk factor for major IHD events...|$|R

40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} {{a major cause of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality in Iran, yet there are few studies examining risk factors specific to the Iranian context. We conducted a case-control study to explore risk factors for prostate cancer in Mazandaran, Iran from 2005 to 2008. The cases were 137 men with clinicopathologically confirmed prostate cancer. Controls were 137 neighborhood and age match men without prostate cancer by PSA and digit examination. Analysis comprised an exploratory stage to identify potential risk factors, defined as variables associated with case status at the P &lt; 0. 20 level in conditional logistic regression. A second stage included all potential risk factors in multiple conditional logistic regression analysis, retaining those associated with prostate cancer at the P &lt; 0. 05 level. Potential risk factors for prostate cancer in exploratory analysis included family history of prostate cancer, history of other cancer, prostatitis, alcohol consumption, pipe or hookah smoking, walking to work, duration of occupational physical activity, intensity of <b>occupational</b> physical activity, <b>body</b> mass index, and older age. Multivariate analysis found intensity of occupational physical activity, prostatitis, and older age as independent predictors of increased risk for prostate cancer in this Iranian population. Our study confirms several recognized risk factors for prostate cancer, contributes evidence to the discussions of other hypothesized risk factors, and points to potentially new factors. Findings, along with confirmatory studies, can help guide efforts for early detection, treatment, and prevention for this common malignancy that is set to increase in Iran in future decades...|$|R
