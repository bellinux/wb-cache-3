5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you {{had never thought of}} before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as {{we want it to}} be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E
2500|$|After ascertaining {{that the}} {{minister}} {{believed in the}} eternality of the Torah and its directives, Rabbi Shneur Zalman replied: [...] "When a person is, for example, so and so many years old (mentioning the exact age of his questioner), G-d asks him: Where are you? Are you aware of why you were created on this earth? Are you aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> expected {{to do and how}} much you actually have done?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Quién te ha visto y quién te ve y sombra de lo que eras (If {{only they}} could see you now, and shadow <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were)</b> (1944), an auto sacramental that mimics Calderón ones.|$|R
2500|$|And now, O Nibelungen Spectator, pluck up; for all allegories {{come to an}} end somewhere... The rest <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{going to}} see is opera, and nothing but opera. Before many bars have been played, Siegfried and the wakened Brynhild, newly become tenor and soprano, will sing a concerted cadenza; plunge on from that to a {{magnificent}} love duet...The work which follows, entitled Night Falls on the Gods , is a thorough grand opera.|$|E
2500|$|These traits come to {{the fore}} in Hi, Mom!s [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] {{sequence}}. This sequence parodies cinéma vérité, the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience. De Palma describes the sequence as a constant invocation of Brechtian distanciation: [...] "First of all, I am interested in the medium of film itself, and I am constantly standing outside and making people aware that they are always watching a film. At the same time I am evolving it. In Hi, Mom! for instance, there is a sequence where you are obviously watching a ridiculous documentary and you are told that and you are aware of it, but it still sucks you in. There is a kind of Brechtian alienation idea here: you are aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> watching {{at the same time that}} you are emotionally involved with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{score by}} John Williams was {{recorded}} in late March and early April 2011. Tuba player Jim Self reported in May 2011: [...] "For John Williams I [...] recently finished recording for the film War Horse. It's a war movie so the score {{has a lot of}} brass—but it was gentle music often." [...] English folk singer John Tams, who wrote the songs for the stage production of War Horse, was approached by Spielberg and Williams about including one of his songs from the stageshow in the film. In the liner notes to the film soundtrack cd, Spielberg wrote [...] "I feel that John has made a special gift to me of this music, which was inspired not only by my film but also by many of the picturesque settings of the poet William Wordsworth, whose vivid descriptions of the British landscape inspired much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to hear." [...] In the premiere of three of the tracks on New York radio station WQXR’s [...] "Movies on the Radio", broadcaster David Garland drew parallels with the work of British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams.|$|E
