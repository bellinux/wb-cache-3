5000|$|The Late Antique Period, {{respectively}} known also as the Early Byzantine Period, in Kosovo {{marks the}} time frame from {{the rule of the}} Emperor Constantine the Great (306-337 AD), respectively during the 4th, 5th and 6th century AD; a time period which was perceived by historians to describe the transitory phase from antiquity to medieval. One of the most distinguished features of the Late Antiquity was the centralization of power into the emperorshands, division of the military from civil administration, but on top of that, this period is related with the crises in ancient production system and with a decline of the Roman Empire. In regard to this period that is between innovations and tradition, the present day territory of Kosovo, goes through some changes, transformations and developments in economical, social, cultural, religious and political-administrative aspect, which made an impact on future evolution of this area. Furthermore, the novelty of this epoch was the consolidation of the Christianity andthe bloom of the Serbian Orthodox art and architecture, a characteristic for combination of tradition and innovation. Therefore, the construction architecture of this time is known by archaeologists, architects and art historians as the early Christian period architecture. On the other hand, the ancient written sources, archived church written sources, but even the oral histories in the form of myths, legends or local toponomy of the archaeological site locations, stored in the collective memory of people from different parts of the Kosovo, have offered and will provide very important data that is used in synthesised form to provide a general overview of either common or individual extraordinary rich archaeological heritage, not only for the region but even wider, including the southeast Europe. Yet, Kosovo should not be treated anymore as Terra Incognita, but contrariwise, based on the archaeological documentation, this aided by the auxiliary sciences and relevant scientific disciplines, reflect a very advanced civilization, different and even cosmopolite developmentsin the ancientness. The written sources, besides tangible <b>ones,</b> <b>complement</b> the facts on the occupation and continuative presence of the autochthonous population, which was evidenced with the creation of the Dardanian Kingdom, 4th-1st century BC and later with the constitution of the Roman Province of Dardania in 297 AD; established by the Emperor Diocletian [...] The Late Antique period and the Early Medieval period, where a periods withan argued presence {{of a large number of}} toponomies like for example; gradishte (fortes), gradina (stronghold), kala (castle), (tower), (fortification), etc. Furthermore, these toponomies specifically indicate the fortified settlements set on the hills and fortified with ramparts and documented across Kosovo during the systematic archaeological surveys, reconnaissance and trial trenches, carried in the past, since the second part of the last century and continued up to the present days.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the results of the research of volunteering of students of the University of Zagreb and Technical and Social Sciences Polytechnics in Zagreb conducted between 2006 - 2007 within the international comparative research of students in 14 countries of the world. The aim of the research was to collect the data on various aspects of volunteering (experience, basic forms, motivations and benefits of volunteering, values connected with volunteering), and especially to gain insight into international differences. Considering the fact that the paper in particular focuses on the Croatian results, they have shown that the Croatian students, alongside with the Japanese students, are trailing behind all analysed countries. When they volunteer, students in general do it irregularly and informally, and they do most volunteer work for neighbourhood group or local activist organization, in homes for the elderly and the infirm, shelters and similar organisations. Intrinsic reasons for volunteering are emphasised the most, but the instrumental <b>ones</b> <b>complement</b> them. The research has also shown that volunteering is mostly not promoted through the system of education, and that the students consider such initiatives to be useful. The research results are compared with the results of research of volunteering in Croatia to date, and are interpreted within the analysis of civil society development in Croatia and other post-communist countries, and the differences between the countries are commented. 24 page(s...|$|E
