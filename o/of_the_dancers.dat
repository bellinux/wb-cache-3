5|$|The Bal des Ardents (Ball of the Burning Men) or Bal des Sauvages (Ball of the Wild Men) was a {{masquerade}} ball held on 28January 1393 in Paris {{at which}} Charles VI of France {{performed in a}} dance with {{five members of the}} French nobility. Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancers</b> were killed in a fire caused by a torch brought in by a spectator, Charles's brother Louis, Duke of Orléans. Charles and another <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancers</b> survived. The ball was {{one of a number of}} events intended to entertain the young king, who the previous summer had suffered an attack of insanity. The event undermined confidence in Charles's capacity to rule; Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and his brother Orléans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted regicide and sorcery, to offer penance for the event.|$|E

The sudden death of Nilanjana reminded Rishabhanatha of the world's transitory nature, triggering him to renounce his kingdom along with his family and material wealth. He gave his kingdom to his hundred sons, of whom Bharata got the city of Vinita (Ayodhya) and Bahubali got the city of Podanapur (Taxila). He became an ascetic on the ninth day of the month of Chaitra Krishna (Hindu calendar). According to Jain mythologies, he practiced severe austerities for 1,000 years, then gained enlightenment, became a Jina.|$|E
5|$|The Nifo oti, or Samoan fire knife dance, {{is also a}} kind {{of weapon}} dance. The kailao is a {{standing}} male war dance of Tonga. The kailao is performed by men (less commonly women also perform it with the men as a mixed dance), who carry clubs or fighting sticks. The performers dance in a fierce manner to emulate combat, all {{to the accompaniment of}} a slit drum or a tin box. Additional idiophonic percussion is provided by strung rattles worn on the anklets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancers,</b> and the clashing together of the wooden implements of war, which today are either sticks or mock weapons. The dance is unusual for Tonga in that it lacks recited poetry as accompaniment, which fact is taken to mean that it was imported to Tonga from elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|In this article, I {{argue for}} an {{acknowledgement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancer’s</b> role in <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> independent contemporary dance. I propose the term ‘moving identity’ to outline <b>the</b> independent contemporary <b>dancer’s</b> ‘way of moving’ {{which could be}} perceived as <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> various factors including training approaches, choreographic movement traces and anatomical structures. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moving identity allows us to appreciate <b>the</b> <b>dancer’s</b> unique signature movement style as <b>the</b> collation <b>of</b> embodied experiences into a unique way <b>of</b> moving. However, <b>the</b> moving identity is also open to change when <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> encounters new choreography and the choreographer. Professional dance training produces particular types <b>of</b> <b>dancers,</b> depending on <b>the</b> techniques with which they engage. I demonstrate how <b>the</b> independent contemporary <b>dancer</b> troubles this distinctiveness by engaging with a multitude of movement styles and approaches throughout a career. This leads me to a fresh description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancer’s</b> activity through <b>the</b> lens <b>of</b> Deleuzean concepts of multiplicity and de-stratification. Finally, I propose a definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> as a fluid and mutable body-in-flux with the creative potential to significantly influence <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choreographic process...|$|R
40|$|Given that {{embodied}} {{interaction is}} widespread in Human-Computer Interaction, interests on <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> body movements and emotions are gradually increasing. The present paper describes our process of designing and testing a dancer sonification system using a participatory design research methodology. <b>The</b> end goal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> sonification {{project is to}} have dancers generate aesthetically pleasing music in real-time based on their dance gestures, instead of dancing to pre-recorded music. The generated music should reflect both the kinetic activities and affective contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancer’s</b> movement. To accomplish these goals, expert dancers and musicians were recruited as domain experts in affective gesture and auditory communication. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> sonification literature focuses exclusively on describing the final performance piece or the techniques used to process motion data into auditory control parameters. This paper focuses on the methods we used to identify, select, and test the most appropriate motion to sound mappings for a dancer sonification system...|$|R
5|$|The {{death of}} {{four members of}} the nobility was {{sufficiently}} important to ensure that the event was recorded in contemporary chronicles, most notably by Froissart and the Monk of St Denis, and subsequently illustrated in a number of copies of illuminated manuscripts. While the two main chroniclers agree on essential points of the evening—the dancers were dressed as wild men, the King survived, one man fell into a vat, and four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancers</b> died—there are discrepancies in the details. Froissart wrote that the dancers were chained together, which is not mentioned in the monk's account. Furthermore, the two chroniclers are at odds regarding the purpose of the dance. According to the historian Susan Crane, the monk describes the event as a wild charivari with the audience participating in the dance, whereas Froissart's description suggests a theatrical performance without audience participation.|$|E
5|$|The {{physician}} {{recommended a}} program of amusements. A member of the court suggested that Charles surprise Isabeau and the other ladies by joining a group of courtiers who would disguise themselves as wild men and invade the masquerade celebrating the remarriage of Isabeau's lady-in-waiting, Catherine de Fastaverin. This {{came to be known}} as the Bal des Ardents. Charles was almost killed and four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancers</b> burned to death, when a spark from a torch brought by Orléans lit one of the dancer's costumes. The disaster undermined confidence in Charles' capacity to rule. Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and Orléans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted regicide and sorcery, into offering penance for the event.|$|E
5|$|According to Jain {{traditional}} accounts, he {{was born}} to King Nabhi and Queen Marudevi in north Indian city of Ayodhya, also called Vinita. He had two wives, Sunanda and Sumangala. Sumangala is described {{as the mother of}} his ninety-nine sons (including Bharata) and one daughter, Brahmi. Sunanda is depicted as the mother of Bahubali and Sundari. The sudden death of Nilanjana, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancers</b> of Indra, reminded him of the world's transitory nature and he developed a desire for renunciation. After renouncing, the Jain legends state he wandered without food for a whole year. The day on which he got his first ahara (food), is celebrated as Akshaya Tritiya by Jains. He is said to have attained Moksha on Mount Kailash. The text Adi Purana by Jinasena is an account of the events of his life. His iconography includes colossal statues such as Statue of Ahimsa, Bawangaja and those erected in Gopachal hill. His icons include the eponymous bull as his emblem, the Nyagrodha tree, Gomukha (bull-faced) Yaksha, and Chakreshvari Yakshi.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the video features Jay Z as a passenger in a car speeding along Mission Road in Los Angeles, where he encounters Beyoncé, {{standing in the middle}} of the road, at the Fourth Street bridge. Beyoncé performs in various dance sequences, beginning with her wearing a white tank top, denim blue shorts, and red high-heels. She performs an elaborate solo dance on a riser. The scene shifts to a gold set with a mock photo shoot, before moving into a scene with dancers detailing Beyoncé and dancing against a wall while wearing caps and full length pants. Jay Z appears and ignites a line of petrol leading to a car parked under the bridge, which explodes in flames. Jay Z performs his rap in front of the burning car, and Beyoncé dances beside him, wearing an exotic silk print over a fur coat, before kicking the valve off a fire hydrant.

25|$|<b>The</b> {{uniqueness}} <b>of</b> Kiribati {{when compared}} with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on <b>the</b> outstretched arms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> and <b>the</b> sudden birdlike movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head.
