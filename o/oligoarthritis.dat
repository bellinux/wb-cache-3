40|$|Serum {{complexes}} between IgA and a 1 -antitrypsin (IgA–a 1 AT) {{have been}} found at raised levels in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), where {{they appear to be}} associated with more erosive disease. We have now measured the levels of these complexes in the sera and synovial fluid of patients with RA and seronegative <b>oligoarthritis</b> to determine whether there is a relationship between complex levels and joint inflammation, and if bacterial stimulation of the mucosa is associated with complex formation in seronegative <b>oligoarthritis.</b> IgA–a 1 AT complexes were measured in patients with RA (n = 75) and seronegative <b>oligoarthritis,</b> with or without definite reactive arthritis (n = 28), using a newly developed sandwich ELISA. The results were compared with serum levels from healthy volunteers (n = 30). IgA and a 1 AT were also measured using ELISA and radial immunodiVusion (RID) techniques, respectively. IgA–a 1 AT complex levels in the sera of RA patients [mean = 25. 6 arbitrary units (au) ] were significantly higher (P = 0. 0034) than those in patients with seronegative <b>oligoarthritis</b> (mean = 12. 36 au) and healthy controls (mean = 8. 08 au). There was no evidence for the inflamed joint being the source of IgA–a 1 AT complexes since synovial fluid levels were lower than corresponding serum levels, although higher amounts were found in RA than seronegative <b>oligoarthritis</b> (12. 84 au vs 4. 11 au, P = 0. 01). Serum levels of IgA and a 1 AT were similar in RA and seronegative <b>oligoarthritis</b> patients, and were higher than in normals. There was a significant correlation between complex and serum IgA levels in RA (r = 0. 49, P< 0. 001) and seronegative <b>oligoarthritis</b> (r = 0. 53, P< 0. 001) patients, although no relationship was found with a 1 AT levels.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{presence}} of {{increased levels of}} tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in serum and synovial fluid of patients and the encouraging outcome of anti-TNF therapy have implicated TNFalpha in the etiopathogenesis of juvenile <b>oligoarthritis.</b> Although the locus is polymorphic, no study has investigated all TNF single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with respect to disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the association of multiple TNF SNPs with juvenile <b>oligoarthritis</b> and to construct and analyze SNP-tagged TNF haplotypes. METHODS: A total of 144 simplex families consisting of parent and affected child, as well as 88 healthy, unrelated control subjects were available for study. In these individuals, 9 polymorphic positions of TNF were typed by a high-throughput genotyping method based on the SNaPshot assay. The chi-square and extended transmission disequilibrium tests were used to test for association and linkage, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were also calculated. Haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPs) for the locus were identified by ordering the haplotypes according to their frequencies. RESULTS: The study detected association of several TNF SNPs and established linkage of the locus to juvenile <b>oligoarthritis.</b> The most significant association observed was between the intronic + 851 TNF SNP and the persistent <b>oligoarthritis</b> subgroup (OR 3. 86, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 9. 2). Haplotype data mining showed that only 4 of the 9 SNPs need to be typed in order to capture the most frequent TNF haplotypes. CONCLUSION: The TNF locus is linked and associated with juvenile <b>oligoarthritis.</b> Information on the htSNPs can be useful in genetic studies of diseases in which TNF may be of relevance...|$|E

The HLA-B 17 /Cw 6 haplotype was increased in patients with <b>oligoarthritis.</b> The increase of antigen B 17 correlated with <b>oligoarthritis</b> and spondarthritis, whereas Cw 6 was more significant in <b>oligoarthritis.</b> The prevalence of the B 27 /Cw 1 haplotype was greater in association with spondarthritis and was probably related to the B 27. 5 subtype linked to Cw 1. A significant negative association between the B 44 /Cw 5 haplotype and psoriatic arthritis was found. The existence of several haplotypic factors in the different subsets is discussed.

40|$|Oligoarticular {{synovitis}} of undetermined origin can {{closely resemble}} an incomplete form of reactive arthritis/Reiter's syndrome. Eighty three patients with <b>oligoarthritis</b> of undetermined origin were studied prospectively to identify asymptomatic infections potentially triggering the inflammatory {{response in the}} synovial fluid. At the time of initial evaluation, 57 (69 %) of the patients with <b>oligoarthritis</b> and 4 / 20 (20 %) of the control subjects were carriers of clinically silent infections. Evidence for persistent or prior chlamydial infections was frequently and exclusively found in the study group (30 / 83 (36 %) patients v no controls), whereas undetected urogenital infections with mycoplasma were present in nine (11 %) patients and four (20 %) controls. Eleven (13 %) of the patients carried cellular and humoral responses to Borrelia burgdorferi.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Chlamydia trachomatis and Borrelia burgdorferi {{infections are}} {{frequently}} {{the cause of}} unexplained <b>oligoarthritis,</b> as shown by identification of bacteria specific DNA in joint material from patients with reactive arthritis, Lyme arthritis, and undifferentiated <b>oligoarthritis.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether the two organisms occur simultaneously in joint material from patients with arthritis.  METHODS—Seventy six patients with unexplained arthritis were prospectively studied. Synovial fluid was obtained from all patients and examined for DNA from C trachomatis and B burgdorferi using specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols. Data concerning prior genitourinary infection or a history of tick bite were recorded and serum antibodies to C trachomatis and B burgdorferi were determined.  RESULTS—Six patients (8 %) had DNA from both C trachomatis and B burgdorferi in the same synovial fluid specimen (mean leucocyte count 11. 925 /mm 3, 65 % granulocytes). These patients (four men, two women; mean age 33. 7  years) all had <b>oligoarthritis</b> of the knee, ankle, or both (mean disease duration 11. 3  months). From the history and serological examination, four patients had some evidence of actual or previous infection with one or other of the bacteria, while the other two patients had a positive serological test for Chlamydia only.  CONCLUSIONS—DNA from two different microorganisms which are known to be triggering agents for arthritis may be present simultaneously in joint material from patients with unexplained <b>oligoarthritis.</b> This finding raises the question as to whether, in such cases, one or both bacteria contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease or whether they are only innocent bystanders. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{course of}} disease in {{juvenile}} idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is unpredictable with episodes of activity and remission. In order to identify predictive factors, 93 SNPs, JIA subtype, age at onset and ANA status were studied in relation to disease course. METHODS: Genetic and clinical parameters were analysed in a cohort of 272 Caucasian patients with persistent <b>oligoarthritis</b> (n= 129), extended <b>oligoarthritis</b> (n= 57) and rheumatoid factor negative polyarthritis (n= 86). Categories of disease course (remitting (n= 65), intermediate (n= 96) and unremitting (n= 111)) were designed based on the cumulative time spent in active disease in the first 2 years. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed association of the course of disease with JIA subtype (p= 5. 7 * 10 (- 5)) and three SNPs; VTCN 1 rs 10 923 223 (p= 4. 4 * 10 (- 5)), VTCN 1 rs 12 046 117 (p= 0. 017) and CDK 6 rs 42 041 (p= 0. 038). In a subsequent multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis, VTCN 1 rs 10 923 223 (OR 0. 41, 95 %-CI 0. 26 to 0. 63) and JIA subtype (OR 3. 8, 95 %-CI 2. 0 to 7. 2; OR 2. 5, 95 %-CI 1. 4 to 4. 2, for extended <b>oligoarthritis</b> and RF-negative polyarthritis vs persistent <b>oligoarthritis,</b> respectively) were the strongest independent factors for course of disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that VTCN 1, encoding B 7 -H 4, is associated with course of disease in selected subtypes of JIA. VTCN 1 might be useful in predicting the course of disease...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is {{an innate}} immune protein. The aim {{of our study}} was to {{determine}} whether genetically determined MBL deficiency is associated with susceptibility to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and whether MBL 2 genotypes are associated with JRA severity. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study of 218 patients with polyarthritis (n = 67) and <b>oligoarthritis</b> (n = 151), clinical and laboratory disease variables were obtained by clinical examination and chart reviews. Healthy Caucasian adults (n = 194) served as control individuals. MBL 2 gene mutations were determined by Taqman analysis to identify genotypes with high, medium and low expression of MBL. Functional MBL plasma concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Associations between clinical and laboratory variables and MBL 2 genotypes were determined by Kruskal-Wallis and chi 2 tests. RESULTS: MBL 2 genotype frequencies were similar in polyarthritis and <b>oligoarthritis</b> patients as compared with control individuals. MBL plasma concentrations were associated with the high, medium and low MBL genotype expression groups (P < 0. 01). In polyarthritis patients, the presence of low-expressing (deficient) MBL 2 genotypes was associated with early age at onset of disease (P = 0. 03). In <b>oligoarthritis</b> patients, patients with low-expressing MBL 2 genotypes were more often in remission (81 %) than patients in the medium (54 %) and high (56 %) genotype groups (P = 0. 02). The remaining clinical and laboratory variables, such as arthritis severity index, presence of radiographic erosions and antinuclear antibody positivity, were not associated with MBL 2 genotypes. CONCLUSION: Genetically determined MBL deficiency does not increase susceptibility to JRA, but MBL deficiency is associated with a younger age at onset of juvenile polyarthritis. On the other hand, MBL-deficient children with juvenile <b>oligoarthritis</b> are more often in remission. Therefore, MBL appears to play a dual role in JR...|$|E
