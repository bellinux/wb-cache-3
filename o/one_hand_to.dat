5|$|The {{reductions}} were self-sufficient {{indigenous communities}} of 2,000–4,000 inhabitants, usually headed by two Jesuit priests and the cabildo (town council and cacique (tribal leader), who retained their functions {{and played the}} role of intermediaries between the native peoples and the Jesuits. However, {{the degree to which the}} Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the degree to which they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>to</b> theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.|$|E
5|$|Warren Davis, a {{programmer}} hired {{to work on}} the action game Protector, noticed Lee's ideas, and asked if he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom. Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with <b>one</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>To</b> accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later.|$|E

25|$|Another {{formulation}} {{depends on}} the comparison of Galois representations attached on the <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> elliptic curves, {{and on the other}} hand to modular forms. The latter formulation has been used in the proof the conjecture. Dealing with the level of the forms (and the connection to the conductor of the curve) is particularly delicate.|$|E
25|$|During archaeological {{investigations}} of Paleolithic {{sites on the}} Angara, in 1936 the unique Stone Age site of Buret’ was discovered which yielded an anthropomorphic sculpture, skulls of rhinoceroses, and surface and semisubterranean dwellings. The houses were analogous, on <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>to</b> Paleolithic European houses and, on the other, to ethnographically studied houses of the Eskimos, Chukchi and Koryaks.|$|E

25|$|When {{a player}} {{discards}} a tile, other players may steal the tile {{to complete a}} meld.

25|$|The ricasso or {{shoulder}} identifies a short {{section of}} blade immediately below the guard {{that is left}} completely unsharpened. Many swords have no ricasso. On some large weapons, such as the German Zweihänder, a metal cover surrounded the ricasso, and a swordsman might grip it in <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> wield the weapon more easily in close-quarter combat.|$|E
25|$|Buanne {{approached}} several producers {{with the}} idea of recording a collection of romantic Italian songs with an orchestra, which was his real ambition, forged by 5 years of shaping and developing his ideas as an independent artist. The objective behind recording that particular genre was, on <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>to</b> let people know that “Italian music is not just opera or classical”, and on the other hand, to honor his father.|$|E

Sizes vary immensely from icons held in <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> those requiring a pickup truck to transport them.|$|E
25|$|The {{seats in}} most coaches {{until the middle}} of the 20th century were usually bench seats; the backs of these seats could be adjusted, often with <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>to</b> face in either {{direction}} so the car would not have to be turned for a return trip. The conductor would simply walk down the aisle in the car, reversing the seat backs to prepare for the return trip. This arrangement is still used in some modern trains.|$|E
25|$|The quality {{gap between}} locally {{manufactured}} guns and European arms continued to widen as new rapid {{advances in technology}} and mass production in Europe quickly outstripped the pace of developments in Asia. Important developments were {{the invention of the}} flintlock musket and mass production of cast-iron cannon in Europe. The flintlock was much faster, more reliable and more user-friendly than the unwieldy matchlock, which required <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> hold the barrel, and another to adjust the match and pull the trigger.|$|E

Once, a large banner was swaying in the strong wind and many men could not stop it from swaying despite their combined efforts. Dian Wei used only <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> grab the banner pole and succeeded in keeping it upright. Zhao Chong was very impressed with Dian Wei's strength.|$|E
25|$|As a {{theoretical}} or speculative science it is purely descriptive and not practical, being correlated on the <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> physical science {{and on the}} other to history. Its method is {{the same as that of}} physical science, being distinguished from the latter only by its matter. The ontological basis of ethics is the unity of the real and the ideal, and the psychological and actual basis of the ethical process is the tendency of reason and nature to unite in the form of the complete organization of the latter by the former. The end of the ethical process is that nature (i.e. all that is not mind, the human body as well as external nature) may become the perfect symbol and organ of mind.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt {{was able}} to {{convince}} many people {{that he was getting}} better, which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. In private he used a wheelchair, but was careful not to be seen in it in public, although he sometimes appeared on crutches. He usually appeared in public standing upright, while being supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons. For major speaking occasions, an especially solid lectern was placed on the stage so that he could support himself on it; as a result, in films of his speeches Roosevelt can be observed using his head to make gestures, because his hands were gripping the lectern. He might raise <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> gesture, but his other hand held the lectern.|$|E

50|$|Palpation is {{the process}} of using <b>one's</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> examine the body, {{especially}} while perceiving/diagnosing a disease or illness. Usually performed by a health care practitioner, it {{is the process}} of feeling an object in or on the body to determine its size, shape, firmness, or location (for example, a veterinarian can feel the stomach of a pregnant animal to ensure good health and successful delivery).|$|R

25|$|Geonic responsa {{are written}} in three languages, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic. In the {{earliest}} period Aramaic, {{the language of the}} Gemara, prevailed exclusively, but {{in the middle of the}} ninth century Hebrew began to appear in the responsa side by side with it. This innovation was due, on the <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>to</b> the study of Hebrew, which spread through rabbinical circles as a result of the Karaite movement, and, on the other, to the fact that the rulings of the Geonim were sent to distant lands, where the inhabitants were unfamiliar with Aramaic; it thus became necessary to write to them in Hebrew, the dialect of the Mishnah. When Arabic became the prevailing language of the Jews, questions were frequently addressed to the Geonim in that tongue, whereupon the scholars of the academies used the same language in reply.|$|E
25|$|Bettino Craxi {{had visited}} Algeria in November 1984, being warned by the {{president}} Chadli Benjedid that Algeria was ready to invade that region of Tunisia that was crossed by the pipeline towards Italy, if Bourguiba wasn't able to guarantee the stability of his own country. Algeria was trying to diversify its foreign policy, feeling isolated by Spain and by Mitterrand's accord with Morocco and Libya over Chad. For two years, according to Martini, Italian and Algerians secret services worked together in order, on <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>to</b> avoid that the growing destabilization of Tunisia might spillover in Algeria, {{and on the other}} hand to control pro-Palestinian terrorist activities in Italy. Finally, Ben Ali was singled out as possible replacement for Bourguiba: as chief of the Tunisian secret services and as Minister of Interiors, he had opposed plans for rough justice execution of fundamentalists. SISMI's action did not have the consent of René Imbot, head of the French secret service, and the United States were not informed.|$|E
25|$|A {{buddy line}} is a line or strap {{physically}} tethering two scuba divers together underwater to avoid separation in low visibility conditions. A buddy line is usually a short length of about 2 meters with a floating element between the divers {{to reduce the risk}} of snagging on the bottom. A buddy {{line is a}} means of communication and does not need to be very strong or secure, but should not pull off under moderate loads while in use. The divers may communicate by rope signals, but will more usually just use the line to attract attention before moving closer and communicating by hand signals. The disadvantage of a buddy line is an increased risk of snagging and entanglement. The divers may need to disconnect the line quickly at either end in an emergency which may be done by using a quick release mechanism or by cutting the line, both of which require at least <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> be free. A velcro strap requires no tools for release and can be released under tension.|$|E
