50|$|On 24 November 1939, BOAC {{was created}} by Act of Parliament to become the British state airline, formed from the merger of Imperial Airways and British Airways Ltd. The {{companies}} had been operating together since war was declared on 3 September 1939, when their operations were evacuated from the London area to Bristol. On 1 April 1940, BOAC started operations as a single company. Following the Fall of France (22 June 1940), BOAC aircraft kept wartime Britain connected with its colonies and the allied world, often under enemy fire, and initially with desperate shortages of long-range aircraft. During the war, the airline was sometimes loosely referred to as 'British Airways', and aircraft and equipment were marked with combinations of that title and/or the Speedbird symbol and/or the Union Flag.BOAC inherited Imperial Airways' flying boat services to British colonies in Africa and Asia, but with the wartime loss of the route over Italy and France to Cairo these were replaced by the expatriate 'Horseshoe Route', with Cairo as a hub, and Sydney and Durban as termini. Linking Britain to the Horseshoe Route taxed the resources of BOAC. Although Spain denied access, Portugal welcomed BOAC's civilian aircraft at Lisbon. However, the Mediterranean route from Lisbon or Gibraltar to Egypt via Malta risked enemy attack, so the long West Africa route had to be employed (over-water via Lisbon, Bathurst, Freetown, Lagos), then by landplane to Khartoum on the Horseshoe Route. The Empire routes had contained landplane sectors, but the Armstrong Whitworth Ensign and de Havilland Albatross ordered to replace the Handley Page HP.42 'Heracles' biplanes had proved disappointing, leaving the Short Empire flying boats as {{the backbone of the}} wartime fleet.

Hydrostatic weighing, strength testing, and treadmill max VO 2 testing were performed by each subject before and after the eight week training period. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups, experimental and control. The experimental group used a high resistance weight training program in conjunction with their usual running regimen. The control group followed the same running routine, however, did not include the weight training. The major findings of this investigation were as follows: 1. The experimental group showed a significant increase in body mass (p <. 10) and fat-free mass (p <. 01) from pre and post season testing while nonsignificant changes were found in the control group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{with heart}} failure (HF) have an {{increased}} QRS duration, usually attributed to decreased conduction velocity (CV) due to ionic remodeling but which may alternatively result from increased heart size or cellular uncoupling. We investigated the relationship between QRS width, heart size, intercellular coupling, and CV in a rabbit model of moderate HF and in computer simulations. METHODS AND RESULTS: HF was induced by pressure-volume <b>overload.</b> Heart <b>weight</b> (21. 1 +/- 0. 5 versus 10. 2 +/- 0. 4 g, mean+/-SEM; P < 0. 01) and QRS duration (58 +/- 1 versus 50 +/- 1 ms; P < 0. 01) were increased in HF versus control. Longitudinal CV (thetaL; 79 +/- 2 versus 67 +/- 4 cm/s; P < 0. 01) and transversal subepicardial CV (thetaT; 43 +/- 2 versus 37 +/- 2 cm/s; P < 0. 05) were higher in HF than in controls. Transmural CV (thetaTM) was unchanged (25 +/- 2 versus 24 +/- 1 cm/s; P=NS). Patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that sodium current was unchanged in HF versus control. Immunohistochemical experiments revealed that connexin 43 content was reduced in midmyocardium but unchanged in subepicardium. Myocyte dimensions were increased in HF by approximately 30 %. Simulated strands of mammalian ventricular cells (Luo-Rudy dynamic model) revealed increased thetaL and thetaT with increased myocyte size; however, increased CV could not compensate for increased strand size of longitudinally coupled cells, and consequently, total activation time was longer. CONCLUSIONS: Increased myocyte size combined with the observed expression pattern of connexin 43 yields increased thetaL and thetaT and unchanged thetaTM in our nonischemic model of HF. A hypertrophied left ventricle together with insufficiently increased thetaL and unaltered thetaTM results in a prolonged QRS duratio...|$|R

Also, the aim was to determine if there were some differences between pupils of the first, second, third, and fourth grade of primary school. Further on, it aimed at answering the question whether there was some correlation between the already determined relative backpack weight and the mentioned pain intensity while carrying the backpack. The research was conducted on a sample of 252 primary school pupils (boys and girls). Body weight and backpack weight were measured, and a short interview was also conducted. The short interview concerned feelings, intensity and pain location while carrying and the way they carry the backpack.

40|$|Weight excess is an {{increasingly}} frequent disorder of nutritional origin in industrialized areas. In Belgium, 40 % {{of the population}} suffers from <b>weight</b> <b>overload</b> (BMI between 25 and 29. 9 kg/m 2) and 10 to 15 % are obese (BMI > or = 30 kg/m 2). The overweight is responsible for increased morbidity, in particular cardiovascular, and surmortality mainly among patients less than 60 years. The causes of the overweight are related to many interdependent determinants: food, sedentarity, socio-economical environment, genetic, psychological and behavioral characteristics. This complexity explains partly the difficulties of the medical follow-up of these patients. The role of the general practitioner (GP) in this Community health problem is essential at two levels: 1) Treatment of weight excess: a moderate and sustained loss, such as of 5 to 10 % of the initial body weight, already significantly decreases the risks of morbi-mortality. The first role of GP will be to target the patients at particular risk and to treat them while adapting to their motivation. 2) Systematic prevention: all patients, all families, must have access through their GP to information of quality concerning the nutrition and the management of weight. This information should be adapted to each patient, according to the various stages of life. Nutritional imbalances and sedentarity should be detected systematically.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{automatic}} fruit-transportation gyro car {{works in}} the economic forest; the designed Gyrocar sorting, weighing & obstacle avoidance system based on ARM. gyro is specially designed in such way that it moves from one station to another in forest. Gyrocar has three compartments for three colour of fruit & Gyrocar is provided with inbuilt sorting mechanism with an robotic arm with RGB Sensor. Sorting mechanism sort the fruit individually in three different compartments in same gyrocar at each station in forest {{on the basis of}} colour of fruit. Our gyrocar moves from one station to another on path follower mechanism. Gyrocar stops at each station within a particular time period; it can also be manually operated. it also provided with <b>overload</b> alert, if <b>weight</b> of fruit in car exceed above an certain limit by buzzer available in a control room. Whole working is divided in two section one as control room and another is working area where car moves. Real time weight of fruit can be seen on LCD available on same gyrocar as well as in control room with the help of RFTx & RFRx. Our gyrocar also provided Ultrasonic sensor which is used to avoid accident by obstacle in its path. When obstacle in its path, alert by buzzer in control room. Key Points [...] Fruit collection & sorting, weight measurement, Obstacle avoidance, overload indication etc...|$|R

In {{spite of the}} important role of exercise intensity on training prescription, there is still no data regarding the effects of RT intensity on severe hypertension (SH). Objective: This study examined the effects of two RT protocols (vertical ladder climbing), performed at different <b>overloads</b> of maximal <b>weight</b> carried (MWC), on blood pressure (BP) and muscle strength of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with SH. Methods: Fifteen male SHR ENT# 091; 206 ± 10 mmHg of systolic BP (SBP) ENT# 093; and five Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY; 119 ± 10 mmHg of SBP) were divided into 4 groups: sedentary (SED-WKY) and SHR (SED-SHR); RT 1 -SHR training relative to body weight (~ 40 % of MWC); and RT 2 -SHR training relative to MWC test (~ 70 % of MWC). Systolic BP and heart rate (HR) were measured weekly using the tail-cuff method. The progression of muscle strength was determined once every fifteen days. The RT consisted of 3 weekly sessions on non-consecutive days for 12 -weeks. Results: Both RT protocols prevented the increase in SBP (delta - 5 and - 7 mmHg, respectively; p > 0. 05), whereas SBP of the SED-SHR group increased by 19 mmHg (p 0. 05). Conclusions: Our data indicated that both RT protocols were effective in preventing chronic elevation of SBP in SH. Additionally, a higher RT overload induced a greater increase in muscle strength...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{activity}} {{is considered an}} extremely effective therapy in cases of type 1 diabetes (DM- 1), as it promotes glucose uptake independent of insulin action. However, there are few studies {{on the effect of}} a single session of exercise on glucose uptake in DM- 1 (i. e., in the absence of insulin). Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of a single exercise session on glucose homeostasis in DM- 1 rats. For this purpose, 30 male rats were divided into three groups: sedentary control (SC), sedentary diabetic (SD), and exercise diabetic (ED). DM was induced by administration of alloxan and identified by the value of fasting glucose. The physical activity consisted of a single swimming session at the anaerobic threshold intensity for diabetic rats (3. 5 % body <b>weight</b> <b>overload)</b> for 30 min. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed immediately after the physical activity. The animals were sacrificed 48 hr after the OGTT, and samples were taken from the blood, liver, gastrocnemius, and mesenteric and subcutaneous adipose tissue. We observed that DM caused significant reduction in body weight. A single session of physical activity did not modify the response to the OGTT or glucose. However, it resulted in increased HDL cholesterol and hepatic glycogen content. These results suggest that, despite not having an effect on glucose homeostasis, acute physical activity performed at anaerobic threshold intensity leads to beneficial changes in the context of type 1 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Ninety {{percent of}} cases of {{diabetes}} are of the slowly evolving non-insulin-dependent type, or Type 2 diabetes. Lack of exercise is {{regarded as one of}} the main causes of this disorder. In this study we analyzed the effects of physical exercise on glucose homeostasis in adult rats with type 2 diabetes induced by a neonatal injection of alloxan. Methods Female Wistar rats aged 6 days were injected with either 250 mg/kg of body weight of alloxan or citrate buffer 0. 01 M (controls). After weaning, half of the animals in each group were subjected to physical training adjusted to meet the aerobic-anaerobic metabolic transition by swimming 1 h/day for 5 days a week with <b>weight</b> <b>overloads.</b> The necessary overload used was set and periodically readjusted for each rat through effort tests based on the maximal lactate steady state procedure. When aged 28, 60, 90, and 120 days, the rats underwent glucose tolerance tests (GTT) and their peripheral insulin sensitivity was evaluated using the HOMA index. Results The area under the serum glucose curve obtained through GTT was always higher in alloxan-treated animals than in controls. A decrease in this area was observed in trained alloxan-treated rats at 90 and 120 days old compared with non-trained animals. At 90 days old the trained controls showed lower HOMA indices than the non-trained controls. Conclusion Neonatal administration of alloxan induced a persistent glucose intolerance in all injected rats, which was successfully counteracted by physical training in the aerobic/anaerobic metabolic transition. </p...|$|R
