40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new optical {{camouflage}} system that uses RGB-D cameras, for acquiring point cloud of background scene, and tracking observers eyes. This system enables a user to conceal an object located behind a display that surrounded by 3 D objects. If we considered here the tracked point of <b>observer</b> <b>s</b> eyes {{is a light}} source, the system will work on estimating shadow shape of the display device that falls on the objects in background. The system uses the 3 d <b>observer</b> <b>s</b> eyes and the locations of display corners to predict their shadow points which have nearest neighbors in the constructed point cloud of background scene.

Because regression on dam 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>estimated</b> transmitting ability from first lactation resulted in weights more closely approximating theoretical upper limits than weights from regression on dam 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>estimated</b> transmitting ability from all lactations, {{the use of the}} former is preferred to predict heifer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>estimated</b> transmitting ability from first lactation...|$|R
