5|$|The {{peace was}} short lived, however, as in August 1970, eight black {{players on the}} Syracuse Orange {{football}} team {{did not show up}} for preseason practice, citing systemic racism in the program and discrimination by coach Ben Schwartzwalder.

In response, Corbally reinstated the players and approved the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Athletic</b> Policy Board to oversee athletics at the school.
