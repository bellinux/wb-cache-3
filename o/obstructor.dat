6000|$|I {{desire to}} open this matter, and leave the Whigs {{themselves}} to determine upon it. The House of Commons resolved, nemine contradicente, that the Speaker should congratulate Mr. Harley's escape and recovery[8] {{in the name of}} the House, upon his first attendance on their service. This is accordingly done; and the speech, together with the chancellor of the exchequer's, are printed by order of the House.[9] The author of the [...] "Medley" [...] takes this speech to task the very next week after it is published, telling us, in the aforesaid paper, that the Speaker's commending Mr. Harley, for being [...] "an instrument of great good" [...] to the nation, was [...] "ill-chosen flattery"; because Mr. Harley had brought the [...] "nation under great difficulties, to say no more:" [...] He says, that when the Speaker tells Mr. Harley, that Providence has [...] "wonderfully preserved" [...] him [...] "from some unparalleled attempts" [...] (for that the [...] "Medley" [...] alludes to) he only [...] "revives a false and groundless calumny upon other men"; which is [...] "an instance of impotent, but inveterate malice,"[10] that makes him [the Speaker] [...] "still appear more vile and contemptible." [...] This is an extract from his first paragraph. In the next this writer says, that the Speaker's [...] "praying to God for the continuance of Mr. Harley's life, as an invaluable blessing,[11] was a fulsome piece of insincerity, which exposes him to shame and derision"; because he is [...] "known to bear ill will to Mr. Harley, to have an extreme bad opinion of him, and to think him an <b>obstructor</b> of those fine measures he would bring about." ...|$|E

Both politicians accused Smith of using this to divert attention from his struggling campaign against Herbert Hoover. Both Hewitt and Hutchinson determined that they refuse to meet ground with Smith, and that they would not make effort to contact Smith. Hutchinson accused Smith of only having one sentence that was true in his rant. Hutchinson also denied that he and Hewitt were <b>obstructors</b> in the park program for Long Island. Hewitt responded that the $50million statement was untrue and both stated that Smith was trying to rush them into supporting the money.|$|R

He {{proposed}} that the army should be disbanded and on 16 June 1647, {{he was one of}} eleven members of the House of Commons charged by the army with obstructing the business of Ireland, acting against the army and against the laws and liberties of the subject, and with being <b>obstructors</b> of justice. On 20 July, leave of absence was granted to these members for six months and it is probable that Maynard left for the country. In 1648, he was imprisoned for a time in the Tower of London on charges of treason (though eventually released). While imprisoned, he addressed a remonstrance to the House of Lords, claiming his right to a trial by his peers.|$|R

They will learn that lawgivers are nearly always the <b>obstructors</b> of society instead of its helpers, and that in the extremely few cases where their measures have turned out well their success has been owing to the fact that, contrary to their usual custom, they have implicitly obeyed the spirit of their time, and have been--as they always should be--the mere servants of the people, to whose wishes they are bound to give a public and legal sanction." ...|$|R

The specific mechanisms by which these structures are produced, are mostly unknown. We have identified a novel multigene family, the <b>obstructor</b> family, which encodes ten putatively secreted chitin-binding proteins that are characterized by a stereotype arrangement of a N-terminal signaling peptide and 3 chitin-binding-domains. Gene expression studies in Drosophila melanogaster embryos demonstrate that <b>obstructor</b> family members are expressed in cuticle forming tissues. Using computational and phylogenetic analysis, we show that <b>obstructor</b> genes represent an evolutionary conserved multigene family in invertebrates...|$|E

40|$|Obstruction is a time-honored {{tradition}} in legislative politics. In many cases, obstruc-tion can be foreseen to be ultimately unsuccessful and, {{in some of}} these cases, purely costly even to the <b>obstructor.</b> In this article, I construct a model of obstruction in which the individual obstruction of a fait accompli policy proposal is potentially informative precisely and ironically because it is inefficient. The theory, based on the legislators ’ re-election motivations, offers comparative static predictions about the frequency and length of obstruction {{as a function of the}} individual characteristics of the legislator and his or her electoral setting, including the legislator’s value for reelection, the appeal of the legisla-tor’s challenger, the legislator’s individual-specific seniority, competence, and/or valence, and the visibility of the legislator’s obstruction efforts to the voter. Finally, the theory illus-trates the potential for transparency of legislators ’ individual actions to be strictly welfare reducing, even in the absence of pandering...|$|E
40|$|Assembly and {{maturation}} of the apical {{extracellular matrix}} (aECM) {{is crucial for}} protecting organisms, but underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Epidermal cells secrete proteins and enzymes that assemble at the apical cell surface to provide epithelial integrity and stability during developmental growth and upon tissue damage. We analyzed molecular mechanisms of aECM assembly and identified the conserved chitin-binding protein <b>Obstructor</b> (Obst) -A as an essential regulator. We show in Drosophila that Obst-A is required to coordinate protein- and chitin-matrix packaging at the apical cell surface during development. Secreted by epidermal cells, the Obst-A protein is specifically enriched in the apical assembly zone where matrix components are packaged into their highly ordered architecture. In obst-A null mutant larvae, the assembly zone is strongly diminished resulting in severe disturbance of matrix-scaffold organization and impaired aECM integrity. Furthermore, enzymes that support aECM stability are mislocalized. As a biological consequence, cuticle architecture, integrity and function are disturbed in obst-A mutants finally resulting in immediate lethality upon wounding. Our studies identify a new core-organizing center, the assembly zone that controls aECM assembly at the apical cell surface. We propose a genetically conserved molecular mechanism by which Obst-A forms a matrix-scaffold to coordinate trafficking and localization of proteins and enzymes in the newly deposited aECM. This mechanism is essential for maturation and stabilization of the aECM in a growing and remodeling epithelial tissue as an outermost barrier...|$|E
40|$|The {{circumflex}} {{coronary artery}} of pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs was partially obstructed with an externally ap#{ 231 }d hg plastic band. Platelet aggregation {{at the site}} of stenosis caused a gradual decline in blood flow in the artery, which was monitored with an alectromagnetic flow probe placed proximally to the <b>obstructor.</b> The effects of drugs on platelet aggregation were evaluated by monitoring changes in both the rate and the degree of decline in blood flow. In most dogs, aspirin inhibited intravas-cular platelet aggregation (ED 50 = I mg/kg). Dipyridamole, even at doses that severely depressed blood pressure (1 mg/kg), had no effect on platelet aggregation. However, in dogs that had been pretreated with a low dose of dipyridamole (0. 2 mg/kg), the antiaggregatory activity of aspirin was enhanced. This poten-tiation was evident only at low doses of aspirin (0. 03 and 0. 1 mg/kg), where the drug was 1 0 times more active; at high aspirin doses, which depressed vascular cyclooxygenase, no potentia-tion was seen. Further evidence that the mechanism of this synergism may depend on endogenous prostacydin production at the sfte of the parM obstruction was seen when cyclooxy-genase inhibitors applied topically on the exposed artery elimi-nated the antiaggregatory effect of low doses of aspirin. It {{is important to note that}} the protective effect of dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin was less than that seen at the high doses of aspirin alone, suggesting that the theoretical benefits of platelet-specific doses of aspirin may be overstated. Aspirin and dipyridamole have been tested in many clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy in preventing vascular occlusive diseases. The results of these trials have been largely inconclu-sive but do suggest that aspirin alone or combined with dipyr-idamole may prevent occlusion of aortocoronary bypass graft...|$|E
