5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all {{he needed}} to know was that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory <b>of</b> <b>unprecedented</b> proportions.|$|E

5|$|In March 1992, John C. Hitt became UCF's fourth president, {{ushering}} {{in an era}} <b>of</b> <b>unprecedented</b> growth and prominence for the university. Once known mainly as a small commuter and technology school, in recent years UCF has undertaken an effort to increase its academic and research standings while also evolving into a more traditional research university. When Hitt took office, UCF's enrollment was 20,302, and as of 2014 enrollment consists of 60,821 students attending classes on twelve campuses spread across Central Florida. The university consists of thirteen colleges and employs more than 10,150 faculty and staff. Under the direction of Hitt, UCF has raised admissions standards, increased research funding, built new facilities, and established notable partnerships with major research institutions.|$|E
5|$|Later populist {{attempts}} to introduce similarly broad-reaching redistributive legislation enlisted {{the support of}} Gaius Marius, a great general, which was then elected to a string <b>of</b> <b>unprecedented</b> consecutive consulships, which also violated Roman law, which mandated a decade between consulships, further weakening the primarily norms-based constitution. The {{attempts to}} recall the general Sulla led to his marching on Rome in 88BC, installing two new consuls and forcing major reforms of the constitution at sword-point, before leaving a campaign in the East. This further strengthened the precedent that the Republic's constitution was malleable.|$|E
5|$|Operation Barbarossa was {{the largest}} {{military}} operation in human history — more men, tanks, guns and aircraft were committed than had ever been deployed before in a single offensive. The invasion opened up the Eastern Front of World War II, the largest theater of war during that conflict, and it witnessed clashes <b>of</b> <b>unprecedented</b> violence and destruction for four years {{that resulted in the}} deaths of more than 26 million Soviet people. More people died fighting on the Eastern Front than in all other fighting across the globe during World War II. Damage to both the economy and landscape was enormous for the Soviet Union as approximately 1,710 towns and 70,000 villages were razed.|$|E

5|$|The New Kingdom pharaohs {{established}} a period <b>of</b> <b>unprecedented</b> prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours, including the Mitanni Empire, Assyria, and Canaan. Military campaigns waged under Tuthmosis I and his grandson Tuthmosis III extended {{the influence of}} the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen. Between their reigns, Hatshepsut generally promoted peace and restored trade routes lost during the Hyksos occupation, as well as expanding to new regions. When Tuthmosis III died in 1425BC, Egypt had an empire extending from Niya in north west Syria to the fourth waterfall of the Nile in Nubia, cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as bronze and wood.|$|E
5|$|Under his leadership, FIU heralded {{in an era}} <b>of</b> <b>unprecedented</b> {{growth and}} {{prestige}} with all facets of university undergoing major transformations. Physically, the university tripled in size and its enrollment grew to nearly 40,000. During his 23 years as president, the school established the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, the FIU College of Law, the FIU School of Architecture and the Robert Stempel School of Public Health. Also during his tenure, endowment grew from less than $2 million to over $100 million.|$|E
5|$|An {{operation}} {{to expose the}} Erdman Gang leads to the recruitment of Southern, a British Secret Service agent, who is assigned to infiltrate the organisation and leak intelligence on its latest scheme. The gang leader contacts the undercover Southern and Erdman operatives Dempsey and Kenyon at Glen Carrick Castle in the Scottish Highlands, and briefs them on their mission. The trio are {{to drive to the}} Nuclear Plutonium Store, where isotopes for all Britain's power stations are housed, and plant explosives to detonate at 12:30p.m.; this will cause a nuclear explosion <b>of</b> <b>unprecedented</b> scale and devastate half of England. To ensure compliance, the charges, which have already been armed, are contained in wrist bracelets identical to Prescott's and are to be unlocked on retrieval of the key at the Plutonium Store.|$|E

5|$|At the Norman conquest, most English cathedrals {{were already}} richly endowed, and as major centres of Norman power {{they were then}} able to acquire further lands {{formerly}} held by dispossessed English landowners. Furthermore, the development of tithe as a compulsory tax on agricultural production resulted in greatly increased incomes for incumbent clergy. Although all cathedrals gathered donations from worshippers and pilgrims; in practice major building campaigns were largely, or entirely, funded from the accumulated wealth of the bishop and the chapter clergy. The availability of finance largely determined the speed of construction for major projects. When money was readily available, cathedral works could proceed with great speed. At Winchester, during the Norman period, an entire cathedral <b>of</b> <b>unprecedented</b> size was built from scratch in less than 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Especially {{important}} was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. The herring was <b>of</b> <b>unprecedented</b> significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, {{and it was one}} of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. Stockfish, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of mollusks including oysters, mussels and scallops were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Freshwater fish such as pike, carp, bream, perch, lamprey and trout were common.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Elena was an {{unpredictable}} and damaging tropical cyclone that affected {{eastern and central}} portions of the United States Gulf Coast in late August and early September 1985. Threatening popular tourist destinations during Labor Day weekend, Elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path, triggering evacuations <b>of</b> <b>unprecedented</b> extent. The hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern Florida and eastern Louisiana, though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas. Elena developed on August 28 near Cuba, and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact, it entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued to strengthen. Initially projected to strike the central Gulf Coast, the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on August 30, then stalled just 50mi (80km) west of Cedar Key, Florida. Despite predictions that Elena would continue eastward across Florida, the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours, causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves, before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, on September 2 as a Category 3 major hurricane. The storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on September 4.|$|E

5|$|The design {{challenges}} the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) {{faced with this}} class were considerable, as the combined requirements of optimum hitting power, extreme speed and adequate protection taxed the knowledge of its naval architects and technology of the time. The desired speed of 35knots, for example, had been previously attained only in destroyers and smaller craft. To do so with a capital ship required a hull and a power plant <b>of</b> <b>unprecedented</b> size for a U.S. naval vessel, in addition to careful planning by its designers to ensure it would have enough longitudinal strength to withstand both bending forces while underway and any stress that might occur in combat. It took years between initial and final designs for engine and boiler technology to provide a plant of sufficient power that was also compact enough to allow a practical degree of protection, even in such large ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the 11 November bombing halt was that the average daily sortie rate over southern Laos rose to 620 per day before the new campaign had even begun. The freeing of aircraft (Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) {{that had previously been}} participating in Rolling Thunder, when combined with those from Steel Tiger and Tiger Hound (which were both superseded by Commando Hunt), promised to create an interdiction effort <b>of</b> <b>unprecedented</b> scale. The new sensor-directed effort would see, for the first time, continuous round-the-clock bombing of the communist logistical system. During daylight, the missions would be performed by propeller-driven and jet fighter-bombers and B-52s. At night, fixed-wing gunships would prowl for prey. The new effort would also be supported by aerial defoliation missions (Operation Ranch Hand) and the cloud-seeding weather modification effort known as Operation Popeye (see Ho Chi Minh Trail). On 15 November 1968 the Seventh Air Force was granted authorization for launch of Commando Hunt.|$|E
