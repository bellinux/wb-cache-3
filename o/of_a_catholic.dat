5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} {{perceived the}} threat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution {{that would not}} offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the more radical Puritans though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{reached the age of}} 21, the prince became {{infatuated}} with Maria Fitzherbert. She was a commoner, six years his elder, twice widowed, and a Roman Catholic. Despite her complete unsuitability, the prince was determined to marry her. This was in spite of the Act of Settlement 1701, which barred the spouse <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> from succeeding to the throne, and the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which prohibited his marriage without the King's consent, which would never have been granted.|$|E
5|$|Third Reich {{authorities}} {{disapproved of}} his choice <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> marriage ceremony, performed by Klawitter. Klawitter had been barred from {{membership in the}} Reichskulturkammer (Reich Culture Chamber) and was considered politically unreliable after a 1936 breach of the Pulpit Law, a remnant of the 1870s Kulturkampf that among other religions barred Catholics from criticizing the state from the pulpit.|$|E
50|$|Christianity is a {{minority}} religion within Karnataka, <b>a</b> state <b>of</b> India. Mangalorean <b>Catholics</b> are <b>a</b> community <b>of</b> centuries, though {{there also are}} Mangalorean Protestants. <b>A</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Diocese <b>of</b> Mangalore, <b>a</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Diocese <b>of</b> Belgaum, <b>a</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Archdiocese <b>of</b> Bangalore, <b>a</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Diocese <b>of</b> Bellary, <b>a</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Diocese <b>of</b> Gulbarga, <b>a</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Diocese <b>of</b> Shimoga, <b>a</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Diocese <b>of</b> Mysore, <b>a</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Diocese <b>of</b> Karwar, <b>a</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> Diocese <b>of</b> Udupi are present in Karnataka. The second largest church in Karnataka is the Church of South India with Karnataka Central Diocese, Karnataka Northern Diocese and the Karnataka Southern Diocese. Gangavathy has Mennonite Brethren Churches. An Anglican Body-India Christian Mission Church has its existence in Doddaballapur of Bangalore rural right from 1920s. There is also <b>an</b> Orthodox Diocese <b>of</b> Bangalore. The state had a relatively high number of anti-Christian attacks in 2009. More than 20 churches were devastated by the Hindu nationalist movement Bajrang Dal in 2008. In 2008, Karnataka had more than 100 anti-Christian attacks.|$|R

5|$|As the 19th century wore on non-conformist ministers {{increasingly}} {{began to}} conduct services within the workhouse, but Catholic priests were rarely welcomed. A variety of legislation {{had been introduced}} during the 17th century to limit {{the civil rights of}} Catholics, beginning with the Popish Recusants Act 1605 {{in the wake of the}} failed Gunpowder Plot that year. But although almost all restrictions on Catholics in England and Ireland were removed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, a great deal of anti-Catholic feeling remained. Even in areas with large Catholic populations, such as Liverpool, the appointment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> chaplain was unthinkable. Some guardians went so far as to refuse Catholic priests entry to the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|Charles faced a {{political}} storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being {{next in line}} to the throne. The prospect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> monarch was vehemently opposed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (previously Baron Ashley {{and a member of}} the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the Exclusion Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The Abhorrers—those who thought the Exclusion Bill was abhorrent—were named Tories (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the Petitioners—those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill—were called Whigs (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).|$|E
5|$|Harding's general {{election}} opponent was Ohio Attorney General Timothy Hogan, who {{had risen to}} statewide office despite widespread prejudice against Roman Catholics in rural areas. In 1914, the start of World War I and the prospect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> senator from Ohio increased nativist sentiment. Propaganda sheets with names like The Menace and The Defender contained warnings that Hogan was the vanguard in a plot led by Pope Benedict XV through the Knights of Columbus to control Ohio. Harding did not attack Hogan (an old friend) on this or most other issues, {{but he did not}} denounce the nativist hatred for his opponent.|$|E

5|$|Non-musical subjects, both {{religious}} and numerological, influenced Sorabji's music, too, {{and he took}} inspiration from various sources. His Fifth Piano Sonata (Opus archimagicum) is inspired by the tarot, and his Tāntrik Symphony for Piano Alone has seven movements titled after the bodily centres of Tantric and Shaktic yoga. The song Benedizione di San Francesco d'Assisi sets the text <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> benediction. However, Sorabji did not intend the first two of these works to be programmatic, and he heaped scorn on attempts to represent stories or ideologies in music. Nevertheless, some of his works {{have been described as}} programmatic.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{settlement}} on St. Charles Bay was Lamar, founded in 1839 by James W. Byrne. The town {{was named for}} Mirabeau B. Lamar, who was elected as President of Texas the previous year. The settlers aimed to compete with Aransas City on the adjacent Live Oak Peninsula. After a customhouse was moved from Aransas City, {{at the behest of}} President Lamar, Aransas City declined and Lamar grew into a prosperous port and salt producer. It was bombarded and destroyed by the Union during the American Civil War, leaving only the ruins <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> chapel and a few homes. Shortly thereafter, the town was rebuilt. By 1915, a post office, school, hotel, ranches and twenty-five homes had been constructed at the site. By 1970, 150 people lived in the town and by 2000, it had 1,600 residents. It remains an unincorporated community of Aransas County.|$|E
5|$|Canning's {{views on}} the Catholic Question were not well {{received}} by the most conservative Tories, including the Duke of Wellington. As a result, the ministry was forced to include Whigs. Canning died later in that year, leaving Frederick Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich, to lead the tenuous Tory-Whig coalition. Lord Goderich left office in 1828, to be succeeded by the Duke of Wellington, who had by that time accepted that the denial of some measure of relief to Roman Catholics was politically untenable. George was never as friendly with Wellington {{as he had been}} with Canning and chose to annoy the Duke by pretending to have fought at Waterloo disguised as a German general. With great difficulty Wellington obtained the King's consent to the introduction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> Relief Bill on 29 January 1829. Under pressure from his fanatically anti-Catholic brother, the Duke of Cumberland, the King withdrew his approval and in protest the Cabinet resigned en masse on 4 March. The next day the King, now under intense political pressure, reluctantly agreed to the Bill and the ministry remained in power. Royal Assent was finally granted to the Catholic Relief Act on 13 April.|$|E

5|$|The Czech Catholics, {{who were}} led by Zdeněk of Šternberk, joined forces with Matthias in February 1469. Their united troops were encircled at Vilémov by George of Poděbrady's army. In fear of being captured, Matthias opened {{negotiations}} with his former father-in-law. They met in a nearby hovel, where Matthias persuaded George of Poděbrady to sign an armistice promising that he would mediate a reconciliation between the moderate Hussites and the Holy See. Their next meeting took place in Olomouc in April. Here the papal legates came forward with demands including the appointment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> Archbishop to the See of Prague, {{which could not be}} accepted by George of Poděbrady. The Czech Catholic Estates elected Matthias King of Bohemia in Olomouc on 3 May but he was never crowned. Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia soon accepted his rule but Bohemia proper remained faithful to George of Poděbrady. The Estates of Bohemia even acknowledged the right of Vladislaus Jagiello, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland, to succeed king George of Poděbrady.|$|E
5|$|The new {{voting system}} {{increased}} the socialists' influence in parliament significantly, but its major beneficiaries were the Catholic Party. Partly {{as a result}} of the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> populist challenger, the Christian People's Party, the Catholic Party embraced the new ideology of Social Catholicism introduced following the papal Rerum novarum encyclical of 1891. This gained it considerable popular support, especially in Flanders. In 1894, the Belgian Workers' Party adopted the Charter of Quaregnon, which would form the basis of its ideology until 1979. By 1911, the party had 276,000 members, making it one of the most successful Socialist parties in Europe. As a result of lobbying by the Belgian Workers' Party, Belgium was one of the first countries in Europe to launch a comprehensive social insurance scheme, including sickness compensation (from 1894), voluntary old-age insurance (1900) and unemployment insurance (1907). The big losers from voting reform were the Liberals who lost almost all their parliamentary representation in the years between 1894 and 1900.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{support for}} Diệm {{came from the}} Australian Catholic media. Diệm was a Catholic in a {{majority}} Buddhist country, and he had close religious links with the Vatican, who had helped him rise to power. He had stayed in a seminary run by Cardinal Francis Spellman in the United States in the early 1950s before his elevation to power. Diệm's elder brother Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục was the leading Catholic figure in Vietnam and a classmate of Spellman when the pair studied in Rome. Spellman was {{widely regarded as the}} most powerful Catholic figure in the United States and he helped to organise support for Diệm among American politicians, particularly Catholics. In 1957, Diệm dedicated his country to the Virgin Mary and ruled on the basis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> doctrine known as personalism. His younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu ran the secret and autocratic Catholic Cần Lao Party (Personalist Labor Party), which provided a clandestine network of support and police-state mechanisms to protect Diệm's rule. It counted many leading public servants and military officers among its members. Diệm also maintained land policies that were preferential to the Roman Catholic Church, the largest property owner in the country. Their holdings were exempt from redistribution under land reform schemes, while the construction of Buddhist temples was restricted; military and civil service promotions were given preferentially to Catholics. Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies and in some areas, forced conversions, looting, shelling and demolition of pagodas occurred.|$|E

5|$|Upon Carroll's {{return to}} Maryland, Hart was incensed {{both at the}} threat to his own power and the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Catholic</b> officeholder in the colony. Hart demanded that Carroll take the oath of allegiance, which {{he was willing to}} do, and the oath of abjuration {{confirming}} the Protestant succession to the English throne, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll began to act in the capacity authorized by the proprietor's commission, and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief. Rejecting Carroll's arguments in support of his right to hold government offices, the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and, near the end of 1716, passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders, which were anti-Catholic by intent. Carroll's case may have been undermined {{when he came to the}} defense of his nephew, who had raised a toast to the Catholic James Stuart. Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony. The proprietor, whose position had been so recently restored and who did not want to risk the loss of the colony, confirmed the decision of the assembly. Carroll's commission was formally revoked on 20 February 1717. According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly, Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor. There is no evidence that Hart was accurate, but the assembly passed stricter anti-Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic males of the right to vote.|$|E
