40|$|In Xenopus laevis, the {{capacity}} to regenerate a new lens from the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> gradually decreases between stages 50 and 58, is almost negligible during the metamorphic climax, and disappears after metamorphosis. The factors responsible for lens transdifferentiation of the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> are produced by the neural retina and {{are located in the}} vitreous chamber. This decrease in the regenerative capacity may be due to: (1) a reduction of the inductive power of the retina, (2) a reduction of lens-forming competence of the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea,</b> (3) an inhibition of the lens transdifferentiation process, (4) a combination of these causes. In order to test these hypotheses, fragments of <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> or of outer and inner corneas joined together were isolated from early larvae, late larvae and froglets, and implanted into the eye of host larvae during the premetamorphosis or the metamorphic climax. Results from implants of <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> into the vitreous chamber showed that the drop in lens regeneration capacity during the metamorphic climax is not due to a decrease in the inductive power of the retinal factor and that the gradual decrease in the regenerative capacity observed between stages 50 and 58 is not related to a substantial diminution in {{the capacity}} of <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> cells to transdifferentiate into lens fibers. Results from implants of outer and inner corneas joined together showed that in these implants the lens transdifferentiation of the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> was partially inhibited. These findings indicate that the decrease in lens regeneration is mainly due to an inhibition of the lens transdifferentiation process of the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> by the inner cornea. However, even implants of cornea (multilayered epithelium and substantia propria) excised from metamorphosed animals were able to form lens fibers, although to a lesser percentage than that obtained after implantation of fragments of larval outer and inner corneas. Thus, the lens-forming competence in the corneal epithelium is still present to a certain degree even when lens regeneration capacity is lost. Several observations suggest that in the lentectomized eye of late larvae and froglets the mechanical inhibition of lens transdifferentiation process exerted by the inner cornea (or the substantia propria), due to the rapid formation of a connective barrier against the spreading of the retinal factor toward the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea,</b> has a decisive role in maintaining the phenotypic stability of the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea...</b>|$|E

In this paper we demonstrate that both the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> and the head epidermis covering a transplanted eye are capable of responding not only to the retinal inducer of the larval eye but also to the inductive action of the embryonic optic vesicle by synthesizing crystallins. As the optic vesicle is a very weak lens inductor, which promotes crystallin synthesis only on the lens biased ectoderm of the embryo, these results indicate that the lens-forming competence in the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> and epidermis of larval X. laevis corresponds to the persistence and acquisition of a condition similar to that of the embryonic biased ectoderm...|$|E

40|$|After lentectomy, larval Xenopus laevis can {{regenerate}} a new lens by transdifferentiation of the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> and pericorneal epidermis (lentogenic area). This {{process is}} promoted by retinal factor(s) accumulated into the vitreous chamber. To understand the molecular {{basis of the}} lens-regenerating competence (i. e. the capacity {{to respond to the}} retinal factor forming a new lens) in the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> and epidermis, we analysed the expression of otx 2, pax 6, sox 3, pitx 3, prox 1, betaB 1 -cry (genes all involved in lens development) by Real-time RT-PCR in the cornea and epidermis fragments dissected from donor larvae. The same fragments were also implanted into the vitreous chamber of host larvae to ascertain their lens-regenerating competence using specific anti-lens antibodies. The results demonstrate that there is a tight correlation between lens-regenerating competence and pax 6 expression. In fact, (1) pax 6 {{is the only one of}} the aforesaid genes to be expressed in the lentogenic area; (2) pax 6 expression is absent in head epidermis outside the lentogenic area and in flank epidermis, both incapable of transdifferentiating into lens after implantation into the vitreous chamber; (3) in larvae that have undergone eye transplantation under the head or flank epidermis, pax 6 re-expression was observed only in the head epidermis covering the transplanted eye. This is consistent with the fact that only the head epidermis reacquires the lens-regenerating competence after eye transplantation, forming a lens following implantation into the vitreous chamber; and (4) in larvae that have undergone removal of the eye, the epidermis covering the orbit maintained pax 6 expression. This is consistent with the fact that after the eye enucleation the lentogenic area maintains the lens-regenerating competence, giving rise to a lens after implantation into the vitreous chamber. Moreover, we observed that misexpression of pax 6 is sufficient to promote the acquisition of the lens-regenerating competence in flank epidermis. In fact, flank epidermis fragments dissected from pax 6 RNA injected embryos could form lenses when implanted into the vitreous chamber. The data indicate for the first time that pax 6 is a pivotal factor of lens-regenerating competence in the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> and epidermis of larval X. laevis...|$|E
50|$|Corneal {{abrasions}} {{are also}} a common and recurrent feature in people who suffer specific types of corneal dystrophy, such as lattice corneal dystrophy. Lattice dystrophy gets its name from an accumulation of amyloid deposits, or abnormal protein fibers, throughout the middle and anterior stroma. During an eye examination, the doctor sees these deposits in the stroma as clear, comma-shaped overlapping dots and branching filaments, creating a lattice effect. Over time, the lattice lines will grow opaque and involve more of the stroma. They will also gradually converge, giving the cornea a cloudiness that may also reduce vision. In some people, these abnormal protein fibers can accumulate under the <b>cornea's</b> <b>outer</b> layer—the epithelium. This can cause erosion of the epithelium. This condition is known as recurrent epithelial erosion. These erosions: (1) Alter the cornea's normal curvature, resulting in temporary vision problems; and (2) Expose the nerves that line the cornea, causing severe pain.

40|$|Hypothesis: The {{hypothesis}} {{of this research}} is that changes in the sulphation patterns of the glycosaminoglycans are directly related to changes in ultrastructure, and hence transparency of the cornea. Aims: The aims of this research were to investigate glycosaminoglycan sulphation patterns and collagen fibril ultrastructure from central to peripheral regions of the cornea, and to gain a greater understanding in the effects of keratan sulphate and its reliance on oxygen supply. Methods: The bovine corneal extracellular matrix composition and collagen fibril parameters (fibril diameter and interfibrillar spacing) were biochemically and biophysically evaluated. This involved taking measurements of corneal thickness and hydration, as well as the amount of hydroxyproline and sulphated glycosaminoglycan. Immunolocalization of proteoglycan protein cores (lumican and keratocan) and specific glycosaminoglycans, particularly their sulphation distribution were studied using specific antibodies. Sulphation patterns of keratan sulphate were also quantified using specific antibodies. Transmission electron microscopy coupled with synchrotron small angle x-ray fibre diffraction was also employed to gain a greater understanding of the corneas' collagen fibril architecture and its interaction with glycosaminoglycans across the depths of the cornea. Results: The bovine cornea is thicker in the outer peripheral regions of the cornea and accordingly an increased amount of hydroxyproline is found at this region of the tissue. Keratan sulphate is predominantly found in the bovine cornea and is particularly heavily sulphated across the cornea. The degree of sulphation of keratan sulphate decreases at the outer peripheral regions of the cornea, which, interestingly, is where a transition of collagen fibrils occurs in that fibrils become less uniformly arranged, changes in fibril diameter are seen, and interfibrillar spacing values alter. Depth- profiled synchrotron microbeam analyses show that at different radial positions, from the corneal centre outwards, fibril diameter is greater superficially than in deep stromal regions. This does not include Bowman's layer which is below the spatial resolution of the analysis. The mid-depth stroma has higher interfibrillar spacing than is seen in posterior regions of the stroma, where fibril spacing appeared more compact. Previous work has pointed to a link between glycosaminoglycan content and oxygen availability. Work presented here indicates that in rabbit corneas, after 24 hr in 2 % atmospheric O 2, the glycosaminoglycan sulphation pattern changes significantly, with a significant increase of the high sulphated epitope of keratan sulphate. Conclusion: My data reveal that collagen fibrils in the central regions of the cornea are more closely packed and uniform in diameter than those in the <b>outer</b> peripheral <b>cornea,</b> and this may have potential implications for the transparency of the tissue. Stromal architecture is likely governed by sulphated proteoglycans, and changes in the types and sulphation patterns of corneal glycosaminoglycans from the corneal centre to periphery might be linked to differences in collagen ultrastructure. Moreover, the findings of differences in collagen fibril ultrastructure with depth through the cornea are possibly linked to biochemical alterations in proteoglycans. Finally, it is hypothesised that detrimental conditions, such as hypoxia after contact lens wear, might {{have an effect on the}} type and sulphation status of glycosaminoglycan synthesized and in vitro evidence for this is presented and discussed.

40|$|Amphibious {{vision is}} {{accomplished}} in many animals by special optical and physiological adaptations in the eyes. However, human eyes {{are considered to}} be adapted to a life in air since our curved <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> – which is used to refract {{more than two-thirds of the}} incoming light on land – becomes useless underwater. This thesis produces evidence that Moken children, a population of sea nomads (or sea-gypsies) from Southeast Asia, have developed an underwater visual acuity that is more than twice as good as that of European children. They achieve this by heavy accommodation and concurrent pupil constriction underwater, a reaction absent in European children. This skill is most likely learned since this thesis also shows that European children can be trained to achieve the same level of acuity underwater as the Moken children. European children learned to control their accommodation in only 4 - 6 months, depending on the individual. Experiments were also made to determine whether the physiological diving response is involved in the process of pupil constriction underwater, but the results were negative. The Moken children constrict their pupils even when diving with goggles, a reaction also present in trained European children. In untrained European children however, this pupil constriction is absent. It is possible that training affects the connection between the accommodative response and pupil constriction so that it becomes a conditioned response elicited when the children immerse their heads in water. Furthermore, optical theory is used to predict underwater acuity in humans. Considering that the normal ranges of contrast sensitivity vary a great deal between individuals, the experimental values of underwater acuity are well within the range of values predicted theoretically...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is {{a widely}} used model {{organism}} for tissue development. We have followed the process of corneal development closely in Xenopus and examined the corneal ultrastructure at each stage during its formation. Xenopus cornea development starts at stage 25 from a simple embryonic epidermis overlying the developing optic vesicle. After detachment of the lens placode which takes place around stage 30, cranial neural crest cells start to invade {{the space between the}} lens and the embryonic epidermis to construct the corneal endothelium. At stage 41, a second wave of migratory cells containing presumptive keratocytes invades the matrix leading to the formation of inner cornea and <b>outer</b> <b>cornea.</b> Three-dimensional electron microscopic examination shows that a unique cell mass, the stroma attracting center, connects the two layers like the center pole of a tent. After stage 48, many secondary stromal keratocytes individually migrate to the center and form the stroma layer. At stage 60, the stroma space is largely filled by collagen lamellae and keratocytes, and the stroma attracting center disappears. At early metamorphosis, the embryonic epithelium gradually changes to the adult corneal epithelium, which is covered by microvilli. Around stage 62 the embryonic epithelium thickens and a massive cell death is observed in the epithelium, coinciding with eyelid opening. After metamorphosis, the frog cornea has attained the adult structure of three cellular layers, epithelium, stroma, and endothelium, and two acellular layers between the cellular layers, namely the Bowman's layer and Descemet's membrane. After initial completion, Xenopus cornea, in particular the stroma, continues to thicken and enlarge throughout the lifetime of the animal. In the adult, a p 63 positive limbus-like wavy structure is observed at the peripheral edge of the cornea. Proliferation analysis shows that the basal corneal epithelial cells actively divide and there are a small number of proliferating cells among the stroma and endothelial cells. This study shows that the development and structure of Xenopus cornea is largely conserved with human although there are some unique processes in Xenopus...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> can undergo transdifferentiation to form a lens in the tadpole larva of Xenopus laevis following removal of the original lens. This transformation appears to require an interaction with the neural retina. In the present study, we carried out a series of experiments to determine if the matured tadpole eye can also elicit lens formation in embryonic ectoderm. Labeled embryonic ectoderm was removed from the presumptive lens-forming region, or from the belly region (ventral ectoderm), at various stages of development (stages 11 - 19, gastrula to neural tube stages) and implanted into the eye cavity (posterior chamber) of advanced stage 52 - 55 tadpoles. After 3 days, we examined the tadpoles and their implanted tissues for lens cell formation using lens-specific antibodies. Implanted presumptive lens ectoderm differentiated lens cells in a large number of cases. The percentage of cases forming lens cells and the extent of morphological differentiation increased with increasing age of the implanted tissue. Implanted ventral ectoderm also formed lens cells, although at a reduced frequency and with limited morphological differentiation. These results indicate that the environment of the matured tadpole eye cavity stimulates lens cell formation in both presumptive lens and nonlens ectoderm. The development of the implanted tissues was compared to that found in previous studies where these tissues were cultured as explants or transplanted to lens-forming regions during early development and subjected to various periods of embryonic lens induction. Together, these findings suggest that the process of embryonic lens formation is related to that involved in transdifferentiation of the tadpole cornea during "lens regeneration. " However, the inductive effect of the matured tadpole eye is qualitatively {{different from that of the}} early period of embryonic lens induction and, while more intense, may be more closely related to that which takes place via the optic vesicle during the later phase of embryonic lens induction...|$|E
40|$|In larval X. laevis the {{capacity}} to regenerate a lens {{under the influence of}} inductive factors present in the vitreous chamber is restricted to the <b>outer</b> <b>cornea</b> and pericorneal epidermis (Lentogenic Area, LA). However, in early embryos, the whole ectoderm is capable of responding to inductive factors of the larval eye forming lens cells. In a previous paper, Cannata et al. (2003) demonstrated that the persistence of lens-forming competence in the LA is the result of early signals causing lens-forming bias in the presumptive LA and of late signals from the eye causing cornea development. This paper analyzes 1) the decrease of the lens-forming capacity in ectodermal regions both near LA (head epidermis) and far from LA (flank epidermis) during development, 2) {{the capacity}} of the head epidermis and flank epidermis to respond to lens-competence promoting factors released by an eye transplanted below these epidermal regions, and 3) the eye components responsible for the promoting effect of the transplanted eye. Results were obtained by implanting fragments of ectoderm or epidermis into the vitreous chamber of host tadpoles and by evaluating the percentage of implants positive to a monoclonal antibody anti-lens. These results demonstrated that the lens-forming competence in the flank region is lost at the embryonic stage 30 / 31 and is weakly restored by eye transplantation; however, lens-forming competence in the head region is lost at the larval stage 48 and is strongly restored by eye transplantation. The authors hypothesize that during development the head ectoderm outside the LA is attained by low levels of the same signals that attain the LA and that these signals are responsible for the maintenance of lens-forming competence in the cornea and pericorneal epidermis of the larva. In this hypothesis, low levels of these signals slacken the decrease of the lens-forming competence in the head ectoderm and make the head epidermis much more responsive than the flank epidermis to the effect of promoting factors released by a transplanted eye. Results obtained after transplantation of eyes deprived of some components indicate that the lens and the retina are the main source of these promoting factors. The immunohistochemical detection of the FGFR- 2 (bek variant) protein in the epidermis of stage 53 larvae submitted to eye transplantation at stage 46 showed that the eye transplantation increased the level of FGFR- 2 protein in the head epidermis but not in the flank epidermis, indicating that the lens-forming competence in X. laevis epidermis could be related to the presence of an activated FGF receptor system in the responding tissue...|$|E
