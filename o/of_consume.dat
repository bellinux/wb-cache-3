Getting more and more attracted to the monastery, Vajirañana went to visit his uncle, the reigning Supreme Patriarch Prince Pavareś. By him, Vajirañana was given instruction in poetry, astrology, and Buddhist scripture in 1876. He learned some additional astrology (i.e. how to do calendars) from two other teachers, Khun Debyākaraṇa ("That") and [...] "Pia" [...] (Phrakrupalat Suvaḍhanasutaguṇa at Wat Rājapratiṣṭha).

50|$|Festivals are {{cultural}} celebrations {{and have}} always occupied {{a special place}} in societies. Their celebratory roles, and the many cultural and social implications of ritual and festivity, have long attracted the interest of sociologists and anthropologists. Celebration embodies an intellectual, behavioural and emotional experience, with the emotional responses of all participants. While primitive celebrations might started in concert with agriculture and climate, modern festivals are mostly created and organized with multiple goals, stakeholders and meanings attached to them. Now there is an economic impact of festivals, more than ever. A recent phenomena is “festivalization” which suggests an over-commodification of festivals exploited by tourism and place marketers. So festivals {{play an important role in}} tourism: their role includes attracting tourists, giving a contribution to place marketing, animating attractions and places, and acting as catalysts for other forms of development. Every country has its celebrations, however a festival in one country might be perceived quite differently from festivals in other countries: what is important is the experience and the meanings attached to it. Festivals are connected to cultures and to places, giving each identity and helping bind people to their communities. Similarly, festivals and other planned events can encourage and reinforce group identity.There are myths and symbols connected to traditional festivals, but in modern societies sometimes it is necessary or desirable to invent myths or symbolism with political, religious or other meanings.Motivations to attend festivals have been developed: researchers have demonstrated that people participate to events for entertainment and diversion, socializing, learning and doing something new or novelty seeking.The part <b>of</b> <b>consume</b> is also important nowadays: souvenirs and gifts, or merchandise sold at festivals can also be considered part of the experience.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} land monitoring activities and to analyse land consumption status and trends in Italy. Two methods are {{developed for the}} estimation: land cover mapping and stratified sampling monitoring network. The former {{is used for the}} creation of an accurate map (10 m spatial resolution raster for the years 2012 and 2015) <b>of</b> <b>consumed</b> land (i. e. artificial land cover); the latter allows to estimate very precisely the amount <b>of</b> <b>consumed</b> land. Several spatial analyses were produced integrating the map <b>of</b> <b>consumed</b> land with additional environmental spatial data, allowing for the calculation of several indicators, such as: consumed land inside a buffer of 150 m from water bodies, the surface potentially impacted by consumed land inside buffers at several distances. The monitoring network allowed for the estimation of changes, also in terms of types of artificial areas. Estimates show that land consumption is increasing in Italy, with a pace of growth of about 35 ha per day during the period 2013 - 2015, reaching about 21, 100 km 2 <b>of</b> <b>consumed</b> land (about 7 % of Italian surface).
