5|$|Lympne {{returned}} to civilian use on 1 January 1946. In 1948, the first air ferry service was inaugurated at Lympne by Silver City Airways. Problems with waterlogging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> runway and {{the refusal of}} the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation to upgrade the airfield led to Silver City transferring operations to Lydd (Ferryfield) in 1954. By 1956, the airport's ownership had passed to Eric Rylands Ltd, the Skyways holding company. Skyways operated a coach-air service between London and Paris, flying passengers from Lympne to Beauvais. This service operated until 1974 (1955–1958: the original Skyways; 1958–1971: Skyways Coach-Air; 1971–1972: Skyways International; 1972–1974: Dan-Air Skyways). Following the cessation of commercial operations in October 1974, Lympne continued {{to be used as}} a General Aviation airfield until about 1984. The site is now an industrial estate.|$|E

Murray then reached the final of the 2015 Miami Open, recording his 500th career win along the way to become the first British player to have 500 or more wins in the Open Era. He went on to lose the final to Djokovic, this time in three sets. Murray added Jonas Björkman to his coaching staff in March initially on a five-week trail to help out in periods when Mauresmo was unavailable as she only agreed to work with him for 25 weeks.

40|$|AbstractThis {{experimental}} research compares {{the physical and}} hydraulic properties of two adjacent soils, one covered with a native forest of Mediterranean maquis, {{and the other with}} spontaneous <b>grass.</b> <b>The</b> latter replaced the previous natural forest. The aim is to quantify the significant differences in the soil properties caused by <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural vegetation. Although the soil texture was similar in the different land uses, the soil under the forest had a higher organic matter content, a lower apparent density and a higher water content at saturation than <b>the</b> <b>grassed</b> soil. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water retention characteristics indicated that the retained water content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest soil exceeded that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grassed</b> soil in <b>the</b> range from saturation to - 50 cm of water tension. This suggests that changing the land use altered the soil pore structure within this range. <b>The</b> hydraulic conductivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest soil exceeded that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grassed</b> soil at water tensions of - 10, - 5 and - 3 cm. Conversely <b>the</b> hydraulic conductivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grassed</b> soil was similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest soil at - 1 cm of water tension and at saturation. This result was probably due to <b>the</b> hydraulic activation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desiccation cracks in <b>the</b> <b>grassed</b> soil. This increased <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> infiltrated water in saturated and near-saturated soil conditions. This work shows that changes in land use have an unfavorable impact on the physical and hydraulic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil. Soil covered with grass is more vulnerability to water erosion than that under forest, and there is likely to be general worsening of flow regimes...|$|R

40|$|Land {{degradation}} is a {{major problem}} in <b>the</b> semi-arid environments <b>of</b> Sub-Saharan Africa. Fighting land degradation is essential to ensure the sustainable and long-term productivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabited semi-arid lands. Cenchrus ciliaris (African foxtail grass), Enteropogon macrostachyus (bush rye) and Eragrostis superba (Maasai love grass) are important perennial <b>grasses</b> in <b>the</b> Eastern African semi-arid lands. A study was conducted to establish <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> these indigenous grasses in improving soil hydrological properties, rehabilitation, food security and <b>the</b> livelihoods <b>of</b> agro-pastoral communities in semi-arid districts of Kenya. Soil hydrological properties were tested using a Kamphorst simulator at different stubble heights to represent three different grazing intensities (low, medium, high). Ground cover was estimated using the step-point method. A survey was also conducted across 50 agro-pastoral households to establish <b>the</b> multidimensional benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grasses.</b> Sediment production (as a function of run-off and infiltration capacity) was significantly different (P< 0. 05) at different stubble heights. Ground cover estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grasses</b> were also significantly different (P< 0. 05). Cenchrus ciliaris had the greatest influence in improving soil hydrological properties. Enteropogon macrostachyus and E. superba were ranked second and third, respectively. Enteropogon macrostachyus had the greatest ground cover. Cenchrus ciliaris and E. superba were ranked second and third, respectively. These results were attributed to the growth and morphological characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grasses.</b> Generally, an increase in stubble height increased infiltration capacity and reduced run-off and sediment production. Results from the household survey showed that <b>the</b> <b>grasses</b> provide a source <b>of</b> income through <b>the</b> sale <b>of</b> hay, <b>grass</b> seeds and milk, which also achieve a balanced diet. <b>The</b> <b>grasses</b> also provide a cheap source of thatching materials and livestock feed.
