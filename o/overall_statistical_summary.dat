40|$|This {{report was}} {{produced}} under {{an agreement between}} Transport SA and the Road Accident Research Unit formed in the late 1990 s. Due to various delays in the publication of this report, Transport SA has since become the Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure and the Road Accident Research Unit has become the Centre for Automotive Safety Research. The report describes a series of 236 rural road crashes investigated between 1 March 1998 and 29 February 2000 in South Australia. Investigations began with immediate attendance {{at the scene of}} the crash. The information collected for each crash included: photographs of the crash scene and vehicles involved, video record of the crash scene and vehicles in selected cases, examination of the road environment, a site plan of the crash scene and vehicle movements in the crash, examination and measurements of the vehicles involved, interviews with crash participants, interviews with witnesses, interviews with police, information on the official police report, information from Coroner’s reports, and injury data for the injured crash participants. The report provides an <b>overall</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>summary</b> of the sample of crashes investigated, followed by a detailed examination of the road infrastructure issues contributing to the crashes. This is done on the basis of crash type, with separate sections concerned with single vehicle crashes, midblock crashes and crashes at intersections. A section is also provided that examines the role of roadside hazards in the crashes. Baldock MRJ, Kloeden CN and McLean A...|$|E

The system effectively presents the complex and large-volume sample data of national cancer statistics of the United States. Structure and features Displaying LM plots on the Internet introduces a new and effective way to visualize <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries.</b> Through a Web browser, a user can easily access and view the statistical data in LM plots—globally. Effective Web-based LM plots include many interactions that require retrieving new data from the Web server and displaying it in different layouts to help users. The Java programming environment provides mechanisms that let users interactively control a Web browser’s display content, so we used Java as the programming tool in our implementations. Although spatial resolution is lost in the transition from the printed page to a computer monitor, the interactive viewing options allowed better visualization through drill-down views, multiple levels of detail, sorting, magnified micromaps, miniature <b>overall</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries,</b> confidence interval switching, and other interactive visualization methods. These methods are not new individually, but their integration with LM plots provides a new approach to communicating spatially indexed <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> over the Internet.

40|$|The {{effects of}} age on hemodynamic {{variables}} at rest, {{in response to}} orthostatic challenges, and during exercise were assessed from <b>overall</b> weighted <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> of reports in the medical literature. In normotensive subjects at supine rest, cardiac output and stroke volume (p is less than 0. 001), but not heart rate, declined with aging, whereas systemic vascular resistance increased (p is less than 0. 001). The results were similar in hypertensives, but {{the slope of the}} change in cardiac output was steeper than in normotensives (p is less than 0. 01). This age-related hemodynamic pattern was also observed in longitudinal follow-up studies. The orthostatic fall in stroke volume and rise in heart rate became less pronounced with increasing age (p is less than 0. 05), but the postural increase in systemic vascular resistance was, on average, not related to age. Though the hemodynamic studies in healthy individuals observed that blood pressure is relatively well maintained when older subjects assume the upright position, population studies suggest that an increasing number of these subjects show a postural fall in blood pressure. This is overwhelming evidence that the oxygen uptake at peak exercise decreases with age, mainly related to a lesser peak cardiac output and heart rate (p is less than 0. 001). status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The R package micromap is used {{to create}} linked micromaps, which display <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> {{associated}} with areal units, or polygons. Linked micromaps provide a means to simultaneously summarize and display both statistical and geographic distributions by linking <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> {{to a series of}} small maps. The package contains functions dependent on the ggplot 2 package to produce a row-oriented graph composed of different panels, or columns, of information. These panels at a minimum typically contain maps, a legend, and <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries,</b> with the color-coded legend linking the maps and <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries.</b> We first describe the layout of linked micromaps and then the structure required for both the spatial and statistical datasets. The function create_map_table in the micromap package converts the input of an sp SpatialPolygonsDataFrame into a data frame that can be linked with the statistical dataset. Highly detailed polygons are not appropriate for display in linked micromaps so we describe how polygon boundaries can be simplified, decreasing the time required to draw the graphs, while retaining adequate detail for detection of spatial patterns. Our worked examples of linked micromaps use public health data as well as environmental data collected from spatially balanced probabilistic surveys...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{parallel}} performance visualization scheme, {{based on a}} simple moment analysis of processor utilization data. This method combines the scalability advantages of <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> with the more revealing processor utilization information of Gantt charts. It scales well to large numbers of processors, requiring only storage constant in execution time. 1. Introduction Processor idling can strongly affect the performance of parallel code. Consequently, many parallel performance tools [2, 4, 7, 9, 11] include one or more utilities, such as Gantt charts [3] or <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries,</b> to measure and display processor utilization information. <b>Statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> provide integrated totals of processor use [5]. Summary-based tools scale well to massively parallel computations, since they store and display only a few parameters per processor. However, summaries reveal little about the time dependence of resource use. A programmer, for example, {{might be able to}} identify unde [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} case study to {{demonstrate}} a process for grouping massive multivariate time series based on nonparametric <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> aided by information visualization. We want a method {{that allows us to}} quickly find approximate groups in time series, both to identify typical aggregate behaviors and to find aberrant outliers. We use simple <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> to capture the temporal nature and variability of the time series, as well as the interaction between the various multivariate components. Each individual time series is mapped to a fixed-length vector of summaries. The summary vectors are then clustered using any fast clustering algorithm like  -means. Appropriate information visualization techniques are used at every stage to guide the analyst. Because the method is nonparametric, it is customizable and flexible, and it generalizes easily. When choosing the <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries,</b> we can incorporate domain knowledge that may enhance the clustering. We demonstrate with a massive real life telecommunications application.

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} (often valuable) {{information}} {{are stored in}} web-accessible text databases. "Metasearchers" provide unified interfaces to query multiple such databases at once. For efficiency, metasearchers rely on succinct <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> of the database contents to select the best databases for each query. So far, database selection research has largely assumed that databases are static, so the associated <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> {{do not need to}} change over time. However, databases are rarely static and the <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> that describe their contents need to be updated periodically to reflect content changes. In this paper, we first report the results of a study showing how the content summaries of 152 real web databases evolved over a period of 52 weeks. Then, we show how to use "survival analysis" techniques in general, and Cox's proportional hazards regression in particular, to model database changes over time and predict when we should update each content summary. Finally, we exploit our change model to devise update schedules that keep the summaries up to date by contacting databases only when needed, and then we evaluate the quality of our schedules experimentally over real web databases...|$|R
