It highlighted the risks Thule Air Base posed to Greenlanders from nuclear accidents and potential superpower conflicts. The accident, which occurred two years after the Palomares crash, signaled the immediate end of the airborne alert program, which had become untenable because of the political and <b>operational</b> <b>risks</b> involved. Scott Sagan, a political science academic and anti-nuclear writer, postulated that if the HOBO 28 monitoring aircraft had crashed into the BMEWS early warning array instead of Baffin Bay, it would have presented NORAD with a scenario (radio link to [...] "Hard Head" [...] aircraft and BMEWS both dead, no nuclear detonation detected) that also matched that of a surprise conventional missile attack on Thule, leaving the unreliable submarine telecommunications cable between Thule and the US mainland as the only source of information to the contrary.

40|$|<b>Operational</b> <b>risk</b> was {{identified}} {{as one of the}} primary risk types that a bank faces. Neglected for many years, there is a growing awareness in the banking industry that the management of <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> is crucial for their future existence. The effective management of <b>operational</b> <b>risk,</b> however, requires a structured approach. This study, therefore, investigates the management of <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> by way of a literature study and empirical research in order to develop a framework for a structured approach to <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> management in banking. The framework comprises the primary <b>risk</b> factors of <b>operational</b> <b>risk,</b> namely: people, processes, systems and external events, as well as a definition of <b>operational</b> <b>risk.</b> The <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> exposures that apply to the aforementioned primary risk factors are identified. It, furthermore, illustrates that <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> management is an ongoing process that consists of risk identification, risk evaluation, risk control and risk financing and addresses the methods that could be applied in the management process. As <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> management in the banking industry is still in a development stage it is believed that this study could assist banks with establishing formal <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> management processes. The framework demarcates the area of <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> properly and provides insight into all the activities that should be performed in the <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> management process, but the following issues still require further research: • The practical implementation of methods for the quantification of <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> and determining a capital charge for it; • The effect of the requirements of corporate governance on banks {{as it relates to the}} management of operational risk; and • The interaction between <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> and the other primary risk types to ensure an effective, enterprise-wide risk management process.

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) Financial {{institutions}} and regulatory {{bodies of the}} financial services industry have, {{in the last decade}} of the 20 th century, woken up to the realisation that the risk management procedures adopted and promoted by them did not take into account all the risks to which financial institutions were exposed. The one risk category, made up by an array of risks, that has been acknowledged by financial {{institutions and}} regulatory bodies for some time, but that has not received much recognition in the risk management procedures is <b>operational</b> <b>risk.</b> This is quite ironic, as <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> is the only 'pure" risk, i. e. the only risk with only a downside potential. Credit, market and underwriting risk, on the other hand, could result in profits if managed properly. But the losses to which <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> exposes a financial institution can be minimised through effective risk management. Purpose The greatest obstacle in the process of <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> management is the fact that there is no universally accepted definition of <b>operational</b> <b>risk.</b> The main purpose of this study is to perform an empirical study of the discipline of <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> management.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} mainly {{compares the}} <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> in {{banks of the}} United Kingdom (UK hereafter) and China by measuring the <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> and estimating the firm-specific and macroeconomic determinants of <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> in both the UK and China separately. Four main findings are concluded from the comparison of <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> in banks of the UK and China. It suggests that larger banks with better profitability, less solvency risk, less growth opportunity, better efficiency and greater numbers of employees would prepare more capital to <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> in banks of the UK. By contrast, in China, a larger sized bank with a better liquidity position and more staff settings would require more capital for <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> in China. It also implies that banks in the UK {{are more likely to}} be affected by the status of internal control management. In addition, <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> in Chinese banks is more significantly affected by the number of employees when compared with UK banks. Additionally, the more significant relationship between regulatory capital of <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> and the liquidity in Chinese banks suggests that the <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> management might be able to be improved by enhancing the liquidity management in Chinese banks. With regard to the macroeconomic factors, as well as the final findings, this indicates that <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> in Chinese banks is more likely to be impacted by macroeconomic factors than in UK banks. These findings highlight the differences between <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> in UK banks and Chinese banks, as well as the role of each determinant played in improving <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> in banks of each country...|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to credit, market and liquidity risk, measuring and managing <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> (risk associated with people, systems, processes and external events) {{is a great}} challenge for banks. In 2010, around HUF 35 billion in <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> losses were reported in the banking sector overall, which is significant relative to the pre-tax profits of the banking sector. To a large extent, banks’ <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> measurement methods rely on loss events which have already occurred. If an individual institution has insufficient data for modelling or wishes to include the experiences of extreme events, it should use external data or transpose the risk exposure of the banking sector onto itself. The empirical analysis of the Hungarian banking sector’s <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> data confirms that, similarly to foreign banking sectors and banking groups (which have been already analysed in the relevant literature), {{there is a significant}} relationship in the Hungarian banking sector between institution size as defined by gross income and total <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> losses recorded during the specific period. However, the most significant correlation can be observed between institution size and the frequency of <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> losses. This result could provide basis for the systemic analysis of <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> and support simpler <b>operational</b> <b>risk</b> capital allocation methods. Nonetheless, due to the relatively short time series and the significant dispersion of data, we could not robustly assess the sufficiency of the capital already allocated for <b>operational</b> <b>risk.</b> banks, financial <b>risk,</b> <b>risk</b> management, <b>operational</b> <b>risk...</b>|$|R
