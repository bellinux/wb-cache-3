5|$|Despite {{the general}} {{reputation}} as a mass producer and a consensus that the region {{is in the midst}} of an economic crisis, parts of the Languedoc wine industry are experiencing commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality. Sales have been improved by many vineyards that concentrate on creating a good brand name rather than relying on the sometimes infamous regional designations. Some vineyards have adopted the youngest batch of AOC classifications developed in the late 1990s, while <b>other</b> <b>vineyards</b> eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines, a practice increasingly demanded by consumers in the large New World wine market.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{vineyards}} of the Mittelmosel {{include the}} sundial (German Sonnenuhr) vineyards; Brauneberg Juffer-Sonnenuhr, Wehlener Sonnenuhr, Zeltinger Sonnenuhr. In the 19th century, large sundials {{were built in}} these vineyards so that the workers would know what time to break for lunch {{or the end of}} the work day. Since these vineyards receive the most exposure to the sun, many of the wines produced from these vineyards are richer and more full-bodied than wine produced from <b>other</b> <b>vineyards.</b> In a similar way to many of Burgundy's Grand Cru vineyards, the Sonnenuhr vineyards are highly parceled with multiple owners of individual plots or rows of vines. The Wehlener Sonnenuhr vineyard alone has more than 200 owners.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other wine {{regions of}} France (such as Bordeaux), {{winemaking}} in the Cote de Nuits exist {{on a very}} small scale. The typical domaine estate produces from 50 to 1,000 cases of wine a year, {{in contrast to a}} Bordeaux chateau which often makes more than 20,000 cases annually. Vineyards in the area are highly fragmented, with multiple owners each owning pieces of a family. A producer may own only 2 to 3 rows of vines in a vineyard which they could either produce as a separate wine or blend with the production of other similarly small holdings in <b>other</b> <b>vineyards</b> in the region. These blended wines will generally take on a larger scale designation of a village or district-level wines. Those producers who keep the production separate and unblended (such as for a Grand cru or Premier cru level wine) will make several batches of very small quantities of wine that can fetch high prices due to demand for their limited supply. A third option is to sell the grapes or wine to a negociant who may be able to purchase similar lots from the same vineyard to produce more cases of that Grand cru or Premier cru level wine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Other</b> <b>vineyard</b> owners {{with more}} than 1 ha in Chambertin are Domaine Jean-Louis Trapet, Domaine Rossignol-Trapet and Camus Père et Fils. Between 0.5 ha and 1 ha each is held by Louis Latour, Domaine Jacques Prieur and Domaine Leroy.|$|R

50|$|A village named Hory Viničné, whose {{economy was}} {{centered}} on vineyards {{on the slopes}} of Vitkov Hill, was first mentioned in 1788. <b>Other</b> <b>vineyard</b> settlements, such as Hrabovka, Ohrada, Parukářka, and Pražačka, would disappear {{in the course of the}} 19th century, but they are remembered in local names. According to a census in 1837, the district (including present-day Žižkov and Vinohrady) had a total of 66 houses and estates with 169 inhabitants and 216 head of livestock.|$|R
2500|$|Within {{the region}} of Pomerol lies what is {{described}} as a bouttonière (or [...] "buttonhole") of unique blue-clay (known as molasse) sitting on top of band of sand rich in iron deposits that is known as crasse de fer or machefer. This is a small region of only about 20 hectares (50 acres) that is very atypical of the soils found in rest of Pomerol, but because the vineyard of the noted estate of Château Pétrus is planted on more than half of these hectares, its influence on the wine has been much discussed in the literature. <b>Other</b> <b>vineyards</b> which have at least some planting on this bouttonière include Château La Conseillante, Château L'Évangile, Château Lafleur, Château Gazin, Château Trotanoy, Château Clinet, Château le Gay and Vieux Château Certan.|$|E
2500|$|Like many Washington wineries and vineyards, the 1991 60 Minutes {{special on}} the [...] "French paradox" [...] saw {{a surge of}} {{interest}} for Red Willow—particularly for red wine varieties such as Merlot. Columbia Winery introduced a special [...] "Milestone Merlot" [...] bottling of vineyard designated wine from Red Willow that would become a staple of Columbia's lineup until David Lake's retirement. Eventually the [...] "Merlot boom" [...] would die down and many red varieties were hard hit in the 1996 vintage {{by a series of}} arctic blasts that severely reduced the yields of that year. The one exception were the Syrah vines planted at Red Willow and younger Syrah vines planted from Red Willow cuttings on Red Mountain and many <b>other</b> <b>vineyards</b> in the Columbia Valley AVA. These demonstration of the winter hardiness of Syrah, as well as the critical acclaim for Syrahs made from Red Willow and other vineyard, would usher in a period of heighten interest for the variety.|$|E
2500|$|While ocean winds {{keep some}} fungus and mildew threats at bay, downy mildew and powdery mildew (known {{regionally}} as [...] "white rust") can pose an occasional threat during the wet winter season. Near harvest time, botrytis can also appear, being a hazard or a welcome visitor {{depending on whether}} or not botrytised wine production is the goal. Another threat is diseased and virus-infected rootstock. After the phylloxera devastation, vineyards in South Africa were replanted with American rootstock (nowadays most commonly 99 Richter, 110 Richter and 101-14 Mgt). Some of these imported rootstocks were infected with various virus such as corky bark, fanleaf and leafroll, which soon spread to <b>other</b> <b>vineyards.</b> These virus-infected vines have a shortened lifespan and difficulties with photosynthesis, which can lead to poor ripening of phenolic compounds in the grape and low quality wine. Since the 1980s, efforts have been undertaken by the South African wine industry to quarantine and promote healthy virus-free vineyards. Additionally, work has been undertaken in clonal research to identify which grape varieties grow best in which climate and wine region.|$|E
2500|$|This double-wedding united two of {{the leading}} {{winemaking}} families in Sonoma, for Vallejo was himself a prominent winemaker in the town. Agoston Haraszthy incorporated the Buena Vista property {{under the name of}} the Buena Vista Vinicultural Society in 1863. [...] Toward the end of 1864, Haraszthy resigned from Buena Vista and formed a partnership with Pietro Giovanari, overseer of Vallejo’s vineyards. [...] The two men produced wine on their own account and for <b>other</b> <b>vineyard</b> owners under the name of Haraszthy and Giovanari.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{phylloxera}} epidemic, winemaking in the Friuli {{region was}} very muted {{and did not}} begin to garner much attention till the 1970s. The international popularity of Pinot grigio in the 1980s and 1990s help to change the dynamic of Friuli-Venezia Giulia winemaking. Prior to this time vineyard owners sold their grapes in bulk to co-ops and négociant-like wineries that would blend the grapes together. With the success of Mario Schiopetto in bottling and marketing the product of his own <b>vineyard,</b> <b>other</b> <b>vineyard</b> owners followed suit and began opening up small wineries of their own.|$|R

5000|$|Charles Heidsieck {{focused on}} selecting, {{blending}} and ageing wines to produce higher quality champagnes, buying grapes from individual growers. In 1867 he purchased several old chalk quarries, called crayères which dated from the Gallo-Roman era, {{in order to}} create optimal conditions for wine maturation.

50|$|The {{bottom part}} of the vineyard, {{situated}} {{in the east and}} bordering the N74, the main road of the area, consists of humus-rich alluvial clay and is almost flat, with poor drainage. This {{part of the}} vineyard borders village level vineyards in the south and partially in the east, mostly regional-level vineyards in the east, {{on the other side of}} the N74, and some Vougeot premier cru vineyards in the north. All <b>other</b> grand cru <b>vineyards</b> of the Côte de Nuits are situated higher up in the slope, typically in its middle part, and no <b>other</b> grand cru <b>vineyard</b> stretch down to the N74 road.|$|R

50|$|In 1992, Paul and Eileen Gerrie {{purchased}} the abandoned Pellier Winery {{site in the}} Spring Valley region of Polk County and established Cristom Vineyards. The existing vineyards were {{in a state of}} disrepair and all but one of them needed to be replanted. The first vintage was produced in 1992 from grapes purchased from <b>other</b> local <b>vineyards.</b> The vineyards were replanted from 1993 to 1996. with the first vintage from the estate owned vineyards bottled in 1994.|$|R

50|$|The winery has two estate vineyards, one {{located on}} the {{property}} in Vallecito, and the other located on property owned by the winery near Murphys. The winery purchases grapes from ten <b>other</b> <b>vineyards</b> in Calaveras County and three {{in other parts of}} California. Silvaspoons Vineyard, located in the Alta Mesa AVA, is the only vineyard outside of the Sierra Foothills AVA from which Twisted Oak Winery sources grapes.|$|E
50|$|The {{vineyard}} {{is roughly}} rectangular, gently sloping from a {{corner in the}} northwest down toward the south and east. The château is situated in this corner. Since the vineyard is large and situated in a slope, it is not homogeneous from a geological point of view. The soils have typically been a determining factor in determining the classification and extent of <b>other</b> Burgundy <b>vineyards,</b> while in this case, the wall-enclosed area has been classified in the same way.|$|R
40|$|The use {{and timing}} of many agronomical {{practices}} such as the scheduling of irrigation and harvesting are dependent on accurate vineyard sampling of qualitative and productive parameters. Crop forecasting also depends on the representativeness of vineyard samples during the whole phenological period. This manuscript summarizes {{the last two years}} of precision viticulture in Sicily (Italy); agronomic campaigns were carried out in 2012 and 2013 within the "Tenute Rapitalà" and "Donnafugata" farms. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index derived from satellite images (RapidEye) acquired at berry set, pre-veraison and ripening phenological stages (occurred at June, July and August respectively) have been related to production parameters (sugar and anthocyanins contents) at harvesting of a selected red autochthonous cultivar (Nero D'Avola). The research aims to assess how robust are prediction models based on simple linear regression analysis, in particular: 1) whether there is a suitable period for acquiring the remote sensing image to evaluate these parameters at harvesting, when their knowledge is required; 2) if these relationships are consistent between years or need to be re-calibrated; 3) the models transferability to <b>other</b> <b>vineyard</b> of the same cultivar. © 2013 SPIE...|$|R
50|$|In the 14th century, Galicia was {{exporting}} plant cuttings to <b>other</b> European <b>vineyards.</b> In the 19th century, {{the entire}} region suffered from a depressed economy and many vineyards shut down due to depopulation as workers moved away to find work. Galician harvest workers were {{a large part of}} the labor that developed the terrace vineyards in the Douro Port wine region. When Spain joined the European Union in 1986, funding assistance began reaching Galicia to help stimulate a resurgence in the wine industry.|$|R
