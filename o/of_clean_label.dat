40|$|Consumers {{in industrialized}} {{countries}} are nowadays {{much more interested}} in information about the production methods and components of the food products that they eat, than they had been 50 years ago. Some production methods are perceived as less “natural” (i. e. conventional agriculture) while some food components are seen as “unhealthy” and “unfamiliar” (i. e. artificial additives). This phenomenon, {{often referred to as the}} “clean label” trend, has driven the food industry to communicate whether a certain ingredient or additive is not present or if the food has been produced using a more “natural” production method (i. e. organic agriculture). However, so far there is no common and objective definition <b>of</b> <b>clean</b> <b>label.</b> This review paper aims to fill the gap via three main objectives, which are to a) develop and suggest a definition that integrates various understandings <b>of</b> <b>clean</b> <b>label</b> into one single definition, b) identify the factors that drive consumers' choices through a review of recent studies on consumer perception of various food categories understood as clean label with the focus on organic, natural and ‘free from’ artificial additives/ingredients food products and c) discuss implications of the consumer demand for clean label food products for food manufacturers as well as policy makers. We suggest to define clean label, both in a broad sense, where consumers evaluate the cleanliness of product by assumption and through inference looking at the front-of-pack label and in a strict sense, where consumers evaluate the cleanliness of product by inspection and through inference looking at the back-of-pack label. Results show that while ‘health’ is a major consumer motive, a broad diversity of drivers influence the clean label trend with particular relevance of intrinsic or extrinsic product characteristics and socio-cultural factors. However, ‘free from’ artificial additives/ingredients food products tend to differ from organic and natural products. Food manufacturers should take the diversity of these drivers into account in developing new products and communication about the latter. For policy makers, it is important to work towards a more homogenous understanding and application of the term <b>of</b> <b>clean</b> <b>label</b> and identify a uniform definition or regulation for ‘free from’ artificial additives/ingredients food products, as well as work towards decreasing consumer misconceptions. Finally, multiple future research avenues are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{supervised}} datasets {{are crucial}} to train con-volutional neural networks (CNNs) for various computer vi-sion problems. However, obtaining a massive amount of well-labeled data is usually very expensive and time con-suming. In this paper, we introduce a general framework to train CNNs with {{only a limited number}} <b>of</b> <b>clean</b> <b>labels</b> and millions <b>of</b> easily obtained noisy labels. We model the relationships between images, class labels and label noises with a probabilistic graphical model and further integrate it into an end-to-end deep learning system. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect a large-scale real-world clothing classification dataset with both noisy and <b>clean</b> <b>labels.</b> Experiments on this dataset indicate that our approach can better correct the noisy labels and im-proves the performance of trained CNNs. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new model}} of CASA labelling which assigns to each time-frequency region a probability "clean" enough to feed a multistream recogniser only adapted to <b>clean</b> data. This <b>labelling</b> process is based on the harmonicity of the speech. The probability is evaluated according to a SNR-feature mapping and the choice of a SNR decision threshold. This allows an extension of a previous method [1] based on the binary detection of noisy time-frequency regions, followed by partial recognition <b>of</b> <b>clean</b> regions. The <b>labelling</b> process is adapted to a new multistream recognition approach [5], since the previous probabilities serve to weight the streams' posteriors. 1. INTRODUCTION We propose to label the time-frequency representation after an analysis of primitive features of the speech, such as harmonicity or binaural cues. First, the CASA (Computational Auditory Scene Analysis, see [9]) approach is based on the definition of multiple representations of the signal allowing the extraction o [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Face {{recognition}} {{performance has}} improved remarkably {{in the last}} decade. Much of this success {{can be attributed to}} the development of deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While CNNs have pushed the state-of-the-art forward, their training process requires a large amount <b>of</b> <b>clean</b> and correctly <b>labelled</b> training data. If a CNN is intended to tolerate facial pose, then we face an important question: should this training data be diverse in its pose distribution, or should face images be normalized to a single pose in a pre-processing step? To address this question, we evaluate a number of popular facial landmarking and pose correction algorithms to understand their effect on facial recognition performance. Additionally, we introduce a new, automatic, single-image frontalization scheme that exceeds the performance of current algorithms. CNNs trained using sets of different pre-processing methods are used to extract features from the Point and Shoot Challenge (PaSC) and CMU Multi-PIE datasets. We assert that the subsequent verification and recognition performance serves to quantify the effectiveness of each pose correction scheme...|$|R
40|$|Consumers are {{critical}} of the ingredients used {{in the production of}} processed meat products. With the increased growth in natural and organic processed meats, suppliers have begun to offer <b>clean</b> <b>label</b> solutions to improve the safety of minimally processed foods. This study investigated the growth of Listeria monocytogenes on uncured, no-nitrate-or-nitrite-added frankfurters with or without clean-label antimicrobials, during a 120 day storage period. No-nitrate-or-nitrite-added brands with no antilisterial control measures exhibited a decreased lag time and shorter generation time for initiation of growth, resulting in a greater population of L. monocytogenes when compared to the sodium nitrite, sodium lactate/diacetate controls or alternatively cured products with <b>clean</b> <b>label</b> antimicrobials. Results indicate that <b>clean</b> <b>label</b> antimicrobials may serve as an effective intervention strategy for L. monocytogenes in the production of uncured, no-nitrate-or-nitrite-added (natural or organic) RTE meat products...|$|R

This study investigated the growth of Listeria monocytogenes on uncured, no – nitrate – or– nitrite– added Emulsified Frankfurter Style Cooked Sausages (EFSC) with or without natural or “ <b>clean</b> <b>label</b> ” antimicrobials, over a 120 d sampling period. Additional quality attributes including residual nitrate, residual nitrite, TBARS analysis and color were also analyzed. No – nitrate – or – nitrite– added treatments with no anti – listerial control measures exhibited a decreased lag time and shorter generation time for initiation of growth, resulting in a greater population of L. monocytogenes {{when compared to the}} sodium nitrite, sodium lactate/diacetate controls or alternatively cured products with natural or “ <b>clean</b> <b>label</b> ” antimicrobials. Curing systems which utilize a natural nitrate source and nitrate reducing starter culture were negatively impacted by the addition of these antimicrobials. Significantly higher levels (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) of residual nitrate and lower levels (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) of residual nitrite were found in treatments which contained natural and “ <b>clean</b> <b>label</b> ” antimicrobials. Results indicate that natural and “ <b>clean</b> <b>label</b> ” antimicrobials may serve as an effective intervention strategy for L. monocytogenes in the production of uncured, no – nitrate – or – nitrite – added (natural or organic) ready – to – eat (RTE) meat products, but may have negative impacts on the generation of nitrite for curing reactions and other quality attributes...|$|R

40|$|SummaryWe {{showed how}} cognitive, {{semantic}} information modulates olfactory representations {{in the brain}} by providing a visual word descriptor, “cheddar cheese” or “body odor,” during the delivery of a test odor (isovaleric acid with cheddar cheese flavor) and also during the delivery <b>of</b> <b>clean</b> air. <b>Clean</b> air <b>labeled</b> “air” {{was used as a}} control. Subjects rated the affective value of the test odor as significantly more unpleasant when labeled “body odor” than when labeled “cheddar cheese. ” In an event-related fMRI design, we showed that the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) /medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was significantly more activated by the test stimulus and by <b>clean</b> air when <b>labeled</b> “cheddar cheese” than when labeled “body odor,” and the activations were correlated with the pleasantness ratings.
