2500|$|The main {{academic}} subjects are introduced through up to two-hour morning lesson blocks that last for several weeks. [...] These lesson blocks are horizontally integrated at {{each grade level}} in that {{the topic of the}} block will be infused into many of the activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>and</b> vertically integrated in that each subject will be revisited {{over the course of the}} education with increasing complexity as students develop their skills, reasoning capacities and individual sense of self. This has been described as a spiral curriculum.|$|E

2500|$|The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is {{sponsoring}} a multi-year study of value-added modeling with their Measures of Effective Teaching program. [...] Initial results, released in December 2010, indicate that both value-added modeling and student perception of several key teacher traits, such as control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>and</b> challenging students with rigorous work, correctly identify effective teachers. [...] The study about student evaluations {{was done by}} Ronald Ferguson. [...] The study also discovered that teachers who teach to the test are much less effective, and have significantly lower value-added modeling scores, than teachers who promote a deep conceptual understanding of the full curriculum. Reanalysis of the MET report’s results conducted by Jesse Rothstein, an economist and professor at University of California, Berkeley, dispute some of these interpretations, however. Rothstein argues that the analyses in the report {{do not support the}} conclusions, and that [...] "interpreted correctly... undermine rather than validate value-added-based approaches to teacher evaluation.” [...] More recent work from the MET project, however, validates the use of value added approaches.|$|E
2500|$|McKenzie {{believed}} that students' daily activities needed strict structure and supervision. [...] "It {{is not merely}} enough to open the doors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>and</b> let the students succeed or fail as their own caprice, or even their own judgment shall determine." [...] "If guidance and control can save the student from present mistaken inclination and provides for his future and permanent good, the University has a solemn duty to perform." [...] Indeed, close oversight of students' daily regimen offered opportunities for early intervention in matters of academics and conduct, especially among weaker students. Hours were set for daily activities such as meals, sleep, recitations, and study periods, and attendance at weekly chapel and religious services required. Interactions between the sexes were carefully regulated and supervised, and girls were [...] "carefully chaperoned." [...] Strict routines protected students [...] "from themselves" [...] and helped direct conservation of [...] "every physical and moral strength" [...] so students can [...] "survive the scholastic tests which are put upon them." [...] In addition to promoting academic [...] focus, daily routines taught the lessons of [...] "regularity, promptness, reliability, continuity, and [...] thoroughness," [...] which are fundamental attributes of [...] "good [...] citizenship and moral and religious [...] character." ...|$|E
60|$|In spite, however, {{of these}} disagreeables, I should {{recommend}} any student to suffer them with Spartan courage, as the benefits he receives should repay him an hundredfold for them all. The {{life of the}} debating society is a handy antidote to the life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>and</b> quadrangle. Nothing could be conceived more excellent as a weapon against many of those peccant humours {{that we have been}} railing against in the jeremiad of our last ‘College Paper’—particularly in the field of intellect. It is a sad sight to see our heather-scented students, our boys of seventeen, coming up to College with determined views—roués in speculation—having gauged the vanity of philosophy or learned to shun it as the middle-man of heresy—a company of determined, deliberate opinionists, not to be moved by all the sleights of logic. What have such men to do with study? If their minds are made up irrevocably, why burn the ‘studious lamp’ in search of further confirmation? Every set opinion I hear a student deliver I feel a certain lowering of my regard. He who studies, he who is yet employed in groping for his premises, should keep his mind fluent and sensitive, keen to mark flaws, and willing to surrender untenable positions. He should keep himself teachable, or cease the expensive farce of being taught. It is to further this docile spirit that we desire to press the claims of debating societies. It is as a means of melting down this museum of premature petrifactions into living and impressionable soul that we insist on their utility. If we could once prevail on our students to feel no shame in avowing an uncertain attitude towards any subject, if we could teach them that it was unnecessary for every lad to have his opinionette on every topic, we should have gone a far way towards bracing the intellectual tone of the coming race of thinkers; and this it is which debating societies are so well fitted to perform.|$|E
