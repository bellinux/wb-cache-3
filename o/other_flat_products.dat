So {{the development of}} new and efficient algorithm invokes the interests of many researchers. This paper describes a novel approach based on stationary wavelet transform for the segmentation of web surface defect. The segmentation is performed firstly by decomposing the gray level image into sub-band images and then by an image fusion scheme for the sub-images. Compared with orthogonal wavelet transform (OWT), the notable advantage of stationary wavelet transform (SWT) is its shift invariance. These properties are especially important for defect detection. Image fusion makes full use of available information in each sub-band images to obtain better output results when compared with ordinary image enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of our method. The proposed method is targeted for web surface defect inspection but has the potential for broader application areas such as steel, wood and fabric defect detection. With the development of high performance signal processors, spectral analysis or a combination of statistical and spectral analysis would be the trend of web surface defect inspection...|$|R

50|$|In 2003, Lisco {{exported}} 373 kn of {{finished products}} (48.5% of production). 881 kn of various products were exported in 2004, including 477 kn of HBI (54% of exports) and 72 kn of rebar. It {{is considered the}} only Arab company manufacturing this material. <b>Flat</b> <b>products</b> were 59% of exports in 2004. Europe received about 64.4% followed by Asian and Arab countries. Higher domestic demand for rebar resulted in exports declining to 20 kn in 2004. Exports {{in the first half}} of 2005 was approximately 384 kn; mostly HBI (54%) and <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> (31.7%). Exports fell for long <b>products</b> (81%), <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> (20%) and HBI (5%). This drop is due to the fact that the company stopped exporting rebar as well as a global recession, which led to a demand contraction for iron and steel products, particularly hot-rolled coils and HBI. Exports in 2006 exceeded one million tons, including 449 kn of <b>flat</b> <b>products.</b> During the first quarter of 2006 Lisco increased hot-rolled coils exports by 125% and exported sponge iron for the first time.|$|R

Production of long and <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> grew 18% in 2004; mainly rebar (460kt); hot-rolled coils (429kt) and HBI (606kt). Lisco produced over 574 kn of finished {{products in the}} first half of 2005, increasing 65% over the first half of 2004. The company also increased liquid steel production 52%. Rebar was 57.3% of finished products, hot-rolled coils was 39.3%. Sponge iron production was 579.407 tons, 348.243 tons of HBI, 376.239 tons of billets and blooms and 281.832 tons of slabs. During the first nine months of 2005, Lisco reached its highest production ever; 1 million tons of liquid steel. This was confirmed by Secretary of the Popular Committee, Dr. Mohammad Abu Ojeila Al-Mabrouk at celebrations in September 2005 on the occasion of the passage of 15 years since the company’s mills began production, which concurs with the anniversary of the Al-Fatah Revolution in Libya. In 2005, Lisco achieved the highest rate of increase in steel production among Arab companies, which amounted to 34.8%. Its production increased by 65% in the period from January to June 2005 compared with the same period of 2004. Production of both long and <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> was 1.070 tons in 2006. <b>Flat</b> <b>products</b> achieved a new output record for the company of 564kt, 13% higher than 2005. Production of bars and rods was 26% lower than 2005. Long product sales were 642 kn in 2006, a sizeable increase from 634 kn in 2005, forcing the company to import 168 kn of long products, mostly from Ukraine.|$|R
