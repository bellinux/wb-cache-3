5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} patrol from the 13th Parachute Battalion reported a large gathering of Germans in Bréville and suspected an attack was imminent. At 08:00 a massive artillery and mortar bombardment fell along the 1st Special Service Brigade lines, while the 857th Grenadier Regiment, which had {{gathered in the}} village, attacked No. 6 Commando.

5|$|Having {{learned about}} the block-booking studio system that almost {{guaranteed}} the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood, {{though he did not}} generally make this known. His insistence <b>on</b> <b>no</b> more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E

5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual.

5|$|Although {{pleased with}} {{the result of the}} engagement, Lord Keith issued strict {{instructions}} that Nelson was to remain in active command of the blockade and <b>on</b> <b>no</b> account to return to Palermo. If {{he had to go to}} port in Sicily, then he was to use Syracuse instead. Keith then sailed to Livorno, where his flagship was destroyed in a sudden fire that killed over 700 of the crew, although Keith himself was not on board at the time. By early March, Nelson had tired of the blockade and in defiance of Keith's instructions returned to Palermo again, leaving Captain Thomas Troubridge of HMS Culloden in command of the blockade squadron. In March, while Nelson was absent at Palermo, the ship of the line Guillaume Tell, the last survivor of the Nile, attempted to break out of Malta but was chased down and defeated by a British squadron led by Berry in Foudroyant. Although Nelson briefly returned in April, both of the Hamiltons were aboard his ship and most of his time was spent at Marsa Sirocco in the company of Emma, with whom he was now romantically attached.|$|E
