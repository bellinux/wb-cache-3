25|$|Despite the {{historically}} negative view of opium {{as a cause}} of addiction, the use of morphine and <b>other</b> <b>derivatives</b> isolated from opium in the treatment of chronic pain has been reestablished.

Thalidomide and <b>other</b> <b>derivatives</b> such as pomalidomide and lenalidomide are known as immunomodulatory drugs (or IMiDs) and have been investigated as therapeutic agents for autoimmune diseases and several cancers - particularly myelomas.

25|$|The clandestine {{conversion}} of morphine to ketones of the hydromorphone class or <b>other</b> <b>derivatives</b> like dihydromorphine (Paramorfan), desomorphine (Permonid), metopon, etc. and codeine to hydrocodone (Dicodid), dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), etc. is more involved, time-consuming, requires lab equipment of various types, and usually requires expensive catalysts and {{large amounts of}} morphine at the outset and is less common but still has been discovered by authorities in various ways during the last 20 years or so. Dihydromorphine can be acetylated into another 3,6 morphine diester, namely diacetyldihydromorphine (Paralaudin), and hydrocodone into thebacon.|$|E

In April 2007, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) filed a lawsuit against Dale Gagner citing trademark infringement, as WWE owned all American Wrestling Association properties due to their purchase after the AWA's closure, including the AWA World Heavyweight Championship.
