Each of these pieces is written for a {{different}} small instrumental ensemble, many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>very</b> unusual. Kammermusik No. 6, for example, is a concerto for the viola d'amore, an instrument that has not been in wide use since the baroque period, but which Hindemith himself played. He continued to write for unusual groups of instruments throughout his life, producing a trio for viola, heckelphone and piano (1928), 7 trios for 3 trautoniums (1930), a sonata for double bass and a concerto for trumpet, bassoon, and strings (both in 1949), for example.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, a {{group of}} squatters moved in and took control of an empty house in Ryesgade 58. The squatters, many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>very</b> experienced, moved in slowly and in small groups to avoid detection. The plan succeeded, and {{after a couple of}} months, they had {{established}} a well-organized squat. It was designed so that every floor was an independent collective charged with maintaining its part of the house. They improved the living conditions in the house, and Ryesgade 58 soon became the unofficial headquarters of the squatters movement. It was the center for political activities and was usually the place where foreign squatters lived when visiting Copenhagen. Soon after the squatting of Ryesgade 58, other new squats were established around Copenhagen. These squats included Kapaw in Østerbro, Baldersgade 20 ("Baldurs Street 20"), Bauhaus, and the infamous Sorte Hest ("Black Horse").|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the Seyfert progression from Typenbsp&I to Typenbsp&II (including Typenbsp&1.2 to Typenbsp&1.9), there are other types of galaxies that {{are very similar to}} Seyferts or that can be considered as subclasses <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Very</b> similar to Seyferts are the low-ionisation narrow-line emission radio galaxies (LINER), discovered in 1980. These galaxies have strong emission lines from weakly ionised or neutral atoms, while the emission lines from strongly ionised atoms are relatively weak by comparison. LINERs share a large amount of traits with low luminosity Seyferts. In fact, when seen in visible light, the global characteristics of their host galaxies are indistinguishable. Also, they both show a broad line emission region, but the line emitting region in LINERs has a lower density than in Seyferts. An example of such a galaxy is M104 in the Virgo constellation, also known as the Sombrero galaxy. A galaxy that is both a LINER and a Type I Seyfert is NGC 7213, a galaxy that is relatively close compared to other AGNs. Another very interesting subclass are the narrow line Seyfertnbsp&I galaxies (NLSy1), which have been subject to extensive research in recent years. They have much narrower lines than the broad lines from classic Seyfertnbsp&I galaxies, steep hard and soft X-ray spectra and strong Fe emission. Their properties suggest that NLSy1 galaxies are young AGNs with high accretion rates, suggesting a relatively small but growing central black hole mass. There are theories suggesting that NLSy1s are galaxies in an early stage of evolution, and links between them and ultraluminous infrared galaxies or Seyfertnbsp&II galaxies have been proposed.|$|E

Georgiana later recalled, [...] "We both behaved very well, spoke distinctly and loudly but I trembled so much I could hardly stand".

It's really about the integrity of the group, the dignity of the group." [...] Owen later admitted the group was exhausted after twenty years of nonstop touring and recording, and [...] "everybody needed some time." [...] The tour collected $15 million in box office before it even began, and Alabama performed to packed arenas from June to November 2003. Due to [...] "extraordinary fan response and overwhelming ticket demand," [...] the tour was extended for an additional 30 shows, running between February and June 2004.
