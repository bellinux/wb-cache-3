5|$|The tale shows Potter at {{her best}} in {{depicting}} {{the life of}} the farm and the village of Near Sawrey, but the tale becomes one <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than just local colour and interest. The archetypical tale upon which Jemima is based– the foolish and naive are rescued from destruction by the loyal and dependable– is transformed in Potter's hands to one in which self-preservation and shrewdness become admirable virtues. Graham Greene thought the sandy-whiskered gentleman a character of ominous gloom and suggested Potter had suffered some sort of mental breakdown, but it is more likely she was simply coming to terms with life on a farm. Wild animals invade the precincts of the domesticated ones, and death is part of farming.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the twentieth}} century, {{very little of}} the west’s {{knowledge}} of the Japanese building was gained in Japan. Instead it was gained through exhibitions the Japanese partook in such as the 1876 Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia. The early influence of such exhibitions was more in the creation of an enthusiasm for things Japanese instead <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> authentic. The result was exuberant Japanese decoration, the simplicity of Japanese design lost in the clutter of Victorian ostentation.|$|E

500|$|Although Clements and Musker had {{originally}} intended to hire animator Glen Keane to animate Ursula due to his history of animating Disney villains, Keane specifically requested that he be allowed to animate Ariel after hearing Benson sing [...] "Part of Your World" [...] for the first time. Captivated by her performance, he {{decided to make the}} scene his most important assignment, volunteering to animate the entire [...] "Part of Your World" [...] musical sequence himself and becoming its lead animator. Animating one particular scene to appear as though the camera is rotating around Ariel while she sings [...] "Look at this trove, treasures untold. How many wonders can one cavern hold?" [...] was particularly challenging for the animators to perfect without the aid of computer animation, taking them considerably longer to complete. Keane described the song as the moment [...] "the audience starts thinking of Ariel as this real, living thing. A girl who's dreaming <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>more.</b> And since so many of us feel just like that ... that's when the audience falls in love with this character." ...|$|E

500|$|Common lyrical themes include {{technology}} and a resistance to change. Adrien Begrand, writing for PopMatters, described the lyrics on The Sophtware Slump as [...] "one's attempt {{to transcend the}} glut of technology in today's urban lifestyle, in search <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> real, more natural, more pastoral". Ben Sisario of The New York Times stated that the band [...] "provided the soundtrack to dot-com-era alienation, singing in a cracked yet still innocent voice of life spent staring into a computer screen". Ross Raihala, reviewing Sumday for Spin, identified what he called Lytle's [...] "geeky identification with technology". On The Sophtware Slump, CMJ writer Richard A. Martin commented on Lytle's [...] "sympathy for the lost souls and machines of the high-tech dot-com landscape". Lytle described his empathy with machines in 2003, stating [...] "I find it easier dealing with certain things by living through inanimate objects" [...] and how the song [...] "I'm on Standby" [...] is about Lytle relating to a mobile phone: [...] "I was {{spending so much time}} learning the art of turning off, while still being 'on'".|$|E

Retaining a degree of patriotism, Gerard bought a Cooper T23-Bristol, which {{he would continue to}} use for both Championship and non-Championship races until [...] when he upgraded to the new, mid-engined T43 chassis. While he only twice finished in the top ten in Championship races in his Coopers – in 1954 and in his final Championship event at the 1957 British Grand Prix – Gerard remained a force in UK national level race events. During the 1950s he won many races, at most British circuits, and was a widely respected competitor.|$|E
2500|$|Go {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. [...] "The scenes may change, but the Soundtrack remains the same: sweet, flawed, sort-of-optimistic emo-pop," [...] said Kory Grow of Spin. Gregory Heaney of Allmusic wrote that while previous effort My Dinosaur Life was a summer record released in winter, Go {{is the exact}} opposite; he also complimented the band's poppier sound, noting, [...] "Once fans shift into the proper gear, [...] really shows that these guys are capable <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> expansive than anything they've done before." [...] Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press opined that Pierre's neurotic lyricism took on a more sophisticated form, summarizing that, [...] "On Go, Motion City Soundtrack have successfully navigated both personal and aesthetic maturity, making this a win-win situation for themselves and fans." ...|$|E

2500|$|Calling it [...] "an {{extraordinary}} {{story of}} family fallout", Daniel Hahn of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Sentence by sentence, The Vegetarian {{is an extraordinary}} experience. Last year’s London Book Fair had Korea as guest of honour, {{in the hope of}} tempting English-language publishers to seek out more contemporary Korean novelists, but The Vegetarian will be hard to beat. It is sensual, provocative and violent, ripe with potent images, startling colors and disturbing questions." [...] Claire Fallon, writing for The Huffington Post, called it [...] "an elegant tale, in three parts, of a woman whose sudden turn to veganism disrupts her family and exposes the worst human appetites and impulses". Calling it a melancholic tale <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than vegetarianism, Thrity Umrigar, writing in The Boston Globe, described The Vegetarian as a tale of a woman torn between a stock of her own cautious and conventional life choices and her family members who are not as innocent as they seem to be.|$|E
