25|$|Much of the {{criticism}} is that money is being spent on the rich {{at the expense of}} the poor. Critics contend that it does not serve any of the townships of Gauteng where the transport problem is severe and where the majority of the people live. However, supporters maintain that the train was never meant to be an alternative to mass public transport; instead, it was intended to reduce pressure on Johannesburg's overloaded highway system. Figures released by the Gauteng provincial government in 2003 indicated that the project would do little to relieve traffic on the over-used Ben Schoeman Highway (one of the major motivations for the project), as traffic volumes would be higher when the Gautrain was completed and operating at full capacity in 2010. Leftist political groupings like the SACP and labour movements like COSATU branded the Gautrain as a train for the rich and called on government not to proceed with the project. A national parliamentary <b>oversight</b> <b>body,</b> the Transport Portfolio Committee, held public hearings in November 2005 and subsequently advised Cabinet to scrap or postpone the project.

Legislation to authorize this was signed by President Nixon on October 18, 1973. By the terms of this legislation, coins of these denomination minted for delivery after July 4, 1975 and before December 31, 1976 would bear special reverses, and also be dated 1776–1976.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the subject of}} conflict of interest: an ethical dilemma in politics and administration. Conflict of interest denotes {{a situation in which}} an employee has a private financial interest sufficient to influence, or appear to influence, the exercise of his or her public duties. A primary reason for concern about conflicts of interest is that they reduce public trust and confidence in the integrity and impartiality of public functionaries. The subject of this article is the categories of conflict of interest, conflict of interest's overlap with corruption and measures for combating conflict of interest. Different categories of conflict of interest that are identified and explained include the use of inside knowledge and influence, self-dealing, the misuse of government property, outside employment, post-employment, gift-giving traditions and entertainment, influence peddling and personal conduct. Measures for combating conflict of interest include <b>oversight</b> <b>bodies,</b> judicial institutions and commissions of inquiry. <b>Oversight</b> <b>bodies</b> include the Public Protector, the Auditor-General and the Public Service Commission [...] To effectively fight conflict of interest, the government should implement the recommendations of these <b>oversight</b> <b>bodies,</b> no matter who may be involved.

Accordingly, the use of health data in medical research in general and in biobankrelated medical research in particular, has made data protection law highly relevant.
