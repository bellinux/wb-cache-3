This paper concentrates on the rendering of more general textiles whose macrostructures are defined by free-form surfaces.

These developments require new materials such as electroconductive textiles. As a result, research into screen printing of conductive silver inks <b>onto</b> <b>textiles</b> has emerged. In this study, screen printing is used to print four kinds of silver-based conductive inks on a flexible foam and a nonwoven substrate. The screen printing method is chosen because it is a low cost and user friendly technique to obtain flexible and lightweight conductive fabrics. For the evaluation of the electrical properties the square resistance of the printed fabrics is measured after repeated dry cleaning cycles. The printed textiles studied here show good electrical properties after printing (< 0. 05 /«). However, after 60 dry cleaning cycles, the conductivity decreased considerably.
