40|$|A {{national}} survey of recreational and indigenous fishing was conducted in Australia during 2000 - 01. The survey was a joint initiative of Commonwealth and State governments. Grants from the Natural Heritage Trust, Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, State and Territory fisheries agencies supported the project. The {{national survey}} was a multifaceted project {{designed to provide a}} range of information about non-commercial fishing in Australia. The project comprised three independent surveys, the National Recreational Fishing Survey, the Indigenous Fishing Survey of Northern Australia and the <b>Overseas</b> Visitor <b>Fishing</b> Survey. Different methodologies and analytical approaches were required for each of these surveys, reflecting their varying characteristics...|$|R
50|$|Fox Harbour {{started as}} a fishing {{community}} in the early 19th century by the three families of Matthew, Martin, and George Spurvey, although fisherman from England and Ireland had come <b>overseas</b> to <b>fish</b> there seasonally since the 18th century. All of them returned to England in the 1820s except for a Matthew Spurvey. Other families had settled in Fox Harbour by then {{with the arrival of}} Healey, Kelly and Dreaddy families from Ireland in 1806. The population grew over time, and peaked at 746. Fox Harbour was incorporated in 1964, and the council building opened in 1969. The council building now incorporates the fire station, the library, museum, and the council office.|$|R
50|$|The {{tradition}} of building wooden boats in modern Malaysia goes back centuries: For <b>overseas</b> trade, for <b>fishing,</b> for piracy, for travelling up the many rivers, for each purpose a special design was developed. When Malacca became the main trading centre for spices arriving from the Maluku Islands, Indonesia, the Malay peninsula {{turned into a}} melting pot of the seafaring, trading civilisations: Indians and Chinese, Arabs and Indonesians, Vietnamese and Thai, Burmese, Europeans and others, all arrived in their distinctive craft, inspiring Malaysian shipbuilding.|$|R
40|$|Dr. Mallen-Cooper {{has been}} a {{specialist}} fishway biologist for 30 years and has designed over 200 fishways in Australia and <b>overseas,</b> from <b>fish</b> locks and fish lifts on large dams to low-level pool-type and nature-like fishways. His approach to projects is to clarify ecological function, develop migration models and integrate fish behavior into all aspects of dam, weir and fishway design. A key aspect of this is integrating biology, hydrology and hydraulics, {{which has led to}} new approaches and applications in fishway design and improved ecological function. In the last 10 years Dr. Mallen-Cooper has had a significant focus on broader linkages for fish passage and fish migration within catchments and between rivers and floodplains, and maximizing benefits for fish from environmental flows. Southern Hemisphere fish passage is different although the underlying principles are the same. Coping with small and large fish, upstream, downstream and lateral migrations, highly variable and often very low seasonal flows present challenges that all need to be addressed. Lessons from his experience would assist a more holistic approach to fish passage in the tropics and Northern Hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|Our present {{sea fish}} {{production}} {{is of the}} order of 7 - 8 lakh tons per annum and it is estimated that another 3 lakh tons of fish are produced in inland waters, There is in addition a considerable amount of subsistence fishing. This production is high and places India among the first seven nations having annual production of over a million tons. This is, however, inadequate to meet the country's needs which may be roughly computed at about 40 lakh tons per annum. The national income from fisheries is estimated at about 60 crores of rupees per annum and <b>overseas</b> trade in <b>fish</b> and fish products secures for the country about 3 - 5 crores of rupees as foreign exchange...|$|R
5000|$|The Barrier Reef Phosphate (Guano) Syndicate {{interests}} on the north-east {{coast of}} Queensland {{have been taken}} over by Phosphates Pty, Ltd, a private company formed with a capital of Â£10,000 to work guano deposits and exploit other products The Bunker Group includes Lady Musgrave, Fairfax, and Hoskyn Islands, as they run m that order north of Lady Elliott Island The new company has secured leases of Fairfax and Hoskin, and the right to remove guano there fromFrom the report of the company's surveyor it appears that there are 20000 tons of guano available for immediate exploitation, and samples analysed by Mr John D. Spence, PCS, are said to show the component parts of nitrogen and phosphoric acid to make it of commercial value as a phosphate fertiliser which {{could be used as a}} base in the manufacture of complete compound fertilisers.In addition to the guano commercial use of the coral obtainable from the islands may be mace by conversion into lime, a branch of industry now followed farther north, whence lime for the sugar industry is drawn in large quantities. The company proposes, with a formula which has been proved satisfactory, to prepare turtle soup, turtle extract and calipee and calapash for [...]he <b>overseas</b> market. <b>Fish</b> and other Great Barrier products will also be dealt in by the company.|$|R
40|$|Research PaperTasmania's abalone, rock {{lobster and}} scalefish {{fisheries}} have an annual beach price value of about A$ 120, A$ 64 and A$ 10 million respectively. Whilst small by <b>overseas</b> standards, Tasmania's <b>fishing</b> industry {{is an important}} part of this small island State's predominantly rural income, amounting to some 16 % of total agricultural production. It is therefore natural that the legislative objectives for Tasmanian fisheries extend beyond those associated with resource sustainability, to encompass social and economic outcomes including benefit for Tasmanian fishers, Tasmanian coastal communities and Tasmania's population as a whole. The abalone, rock lobster and scalefish fisheries have a distinctly different history and significantly different management regimes. Whilst all management arrangements were designed to achieve sustainability of the resource and the ecosystem from which it is harvested, each also has had different social outcomes and economic outcomes. The introduction of quota management regimes in the abalone and rock lobster fisheries has achieved the principal management objectives. The primary objective of making the scalefish fishery sustainable using input controls has yet to be achieved, although current changes should more closely match the amount of allocated effort in the fishery with an ecologically sustainable catch...|$|R
