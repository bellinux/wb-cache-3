5|$|At {{the same}} time that Salk was testing his vaccine, both Albert Sabin and Hilary Koprowski {{continued}} working on developing a vaccine using live virus. During a meeting in Stockholm to discuss polio vaccines in November 1955, Sabin presented results obtained on a group of 80 volunteers, while Koprowski read a paper detailing the findings of a trial enrolling 150 people. Sabin and Koprowski both eventually succeeded in developing vaccines. Because of the commitment to the Salk vaccine in America, Sabin and Koprowski both did their testing outside of the United States, Sabin in Mexico and then in the Soviet Union, and Koprowski in the Congo and Poland. In 1957, Sabin developed a trivalent vaccine, containing attenuated strains of all three types of poliovirus. In 1959, ten million children in the Soviet Union received the Sabin <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine.</b> For this work, Sabin was given the medal of the Order of Friendship Among Peoples, described as the Soviets' highest civilian honor, despite having become an American {{during the height of the}} cold war. Sabin's <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> using live virus came into commercial use in 1961. Once Sabin’s <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> became widely available, it supplanted Salk’s injected vaccine because it was cheaper to produce and easier to administer.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Albert Sabin {{developed}} another live, oral polio vaccine. It {{was produced}} by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of wild poliovirus infection and replication, but the vaccine strain is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. A single dose of Sabin's oral polio vaccine produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in about 50 percent of recipients. Three doses of live-attenuated <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95 percent of recipients. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957, and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio vaccine used worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Because cVDPV2 strains {{continued}} to arise from trivalent <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> that included attenuated WPV2, in April and May 2016 this vaccine {{was replaced with}} a bivalent version lacking WPV2 as well as trivalent injected inactivated vaccine that cannot lead to cVDPV cases. This is expected to prevent new strains of cVDPV2 from arising and allow eventual cessation of WPV2 vaccination.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{developments}} in vaccine delivery technologies have included <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Early attempts to apply <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> showed {{varying degrees of}} promise, beginning early in the 20th century, {{at a time when}} the very possibility of an effective <b>oral</b> antibacterial <b>vaccine</b> was controversial. By the 1930s there was increasing interest in the prophylactic value of an <b>oral</b> typhoid fever <b>vaccine</b> for example.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{limited number}} of <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{currently}} approved for use in humans and veterinary species clearly illustrates that development of efficacious and safe <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> has been a challenge not only for fish immunologists. The insufficient efficacy of <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{is partly due to}} antigen breakdown in the harsh gastric environment, but also to the high tolerogenic gut environment and to inadequate vaccine design. In this review we discuss current approaches used to develop <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> for mass vaccination of farmed fish species. Furthermore, using various examples from the human and veterinary vaccine development, we propose additional approaches to fish vaccine design also considering recent advances in fish mucosal immunology and novel molecular tools. Finally, we discuss {{the pros and cons of}} using the zebrafish as a pre-screening animal model to potentially speed up vaccine design and testing for aquaculture fish species...|$|R

25|$|In late April, the WHO {{announced}} a new $5.5 billion, 6-year cooperative plan (called the 2013–18 Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan) to eradicate polio from its last reservoirs. The plan called for mass immunization campaigns in the three remaining endemic countries, and also dictated a switch to inactivated virus injections, to avoid {{the risk of the}} vaccine-derived outbreaks that occasionally occur from use of the live-virus <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bovine {{colostrum}} from pasture-fed cows contains immunoglobulins {{specific to}} many human pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium parvum, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus species, and rotavirus (which causes diarrhea in infants). Before {{the development of}} antibiotics, colostrum was {{the main source of}} immunoglobulins used to fight bacteria. In fact, when Albert Sabin made his first <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> against polio, the immunoglobulin he used came from bovine colostrum. When antibiotics began to appear, interest in colostrum waned, but, now that antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens have developed, interest is once again returning to natural alternatives to antibiotics, namely, colostrum.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{widespread}} use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined rapidly in many industrialized countries. Czechoslovakia became the first country in the world to scientifically demonstrate nationwide eradication of poliomyelitis in 1960. In 1962—just one year after Sabin's oral polio vaccine (OPV) was licensed in most industrialized countries—Cuba began using the <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> in a series of nationwide polio campaigns. The early success of these mass vaccination campaigns suggested that polioviruses could be globally eradicated. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), under the leadership of Ciro de Quadros, launched an initiative to eradicate polio from the Americas in 1985.|$|E
40|$|While the {{majority}} of human pathogens infect the body through mucosal sites, most licensed vaccines are injectable. In fact the only mucosal vaccine that has been widely used globally for infant and childhood vaccination programs is the <b>oral</b> polio <b>vaccine</b> (OPV) developed by Albert Sabin in the 1950 s. While <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> against Cholera, rotavirus and Salmonella typhi have also been licensed, the development of additional non-living <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> against these and other enteric pathogens has been slow and challenging. Mucosal vaccines can elicit protective immunity at the gut mucosa, in part via antigen-specific secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). However, despite their advantages over the injectable route, <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> face many hurdles. A key challenge lies in design of delivery strategies that can protect antigens from degradation in the stomach and intestine, incorporate appropriate immune-stimulatory adjuvants and control release at the appropriate gastrointestinal site. A number of systems including micro and nanoparticles, lipid-based strategies and enteric capsules have significant potential either alone or in advanced combined formulations to enhance intestinal immune responses. In this review we will outline the opportunities, challenges and potential delivery solutions to facilitate the development of improved <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> for infectious enteric disease...|$|R

25|$|Two {{additional}} {{challenges are}} found in unobserved polio transmission and in vaccine-derived poliovirus. First, most polio infections are asymptomatic or result in minor symptoms, with less than 1% of infections leading to paralysis and most infected people are unaware that they carry the disease, allowing polio to spread widely before cases are seen. And since 2000, {{there have been a}} number of outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, following mutations or recombinations in the attenuated strain used for the oral polio vaccine, which have raised the necessity of eventually switching to the more expensive inactivated polio vaccine. The risk of vaccine-derived polio will persist long after the switch to inactivated vaccine, since a small number of chronic excretors continue to produce active virus for years (or even decades) after their initial exposure to the <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{concern is}} the {{presence}} of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses. The oral polio vaccine is not perfect: while the genetic characteristics are carefully balanced to maximize efficacy and minimize virulence, it is possible for the polio virus in the <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> to mutate. [...] As a result, persons given the oral polio vaccine can acquire acute or chronic infections; or can transmit (circulate) mutated virus to other people. It is likely that circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus cases will exceed wild-type cases in the near future, making it desirable to discontinue use of the oral polio vaccine as soon as safely possible.|$|E

40|$|THESIS 10812 While the {{majority}} of human pathogens infect the body through mucosal sites, most licenced vaccines are injectable. In fact the only mucosal vaccine that is widely used for infant and childhood vaccination programs is the <b>oral</b> polio <b>vaccine</b> (OPV) developed by Albert Sabin in the 1950 s. While <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> against Cholera, rotavirus and Salmonella typhi have been licenced, the development of vaccines against other enteric pathogens has been slow and challenging. Mucosal vaccines elicit protective immunity at the gut mucosa, in part via antigen-specific secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). This explains the low efficacy of injectable cholera vaccines, which have been abandoned in favour of <b>oral</b> cholera <b>vaccines</b> (OCVs). However, <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> face many challenges including passage through the acidic environment of the stomach followed by the proteolytic environment of the duodenum {{which can lead to}} the destruction of vaccines. The gut innate immune system is also difficult to activate due to its predisposition towards hyporesponsiveness and tolerance. Lastly, adjuvants such as alum, incorporated in injectable vaccines to enhance their immunogenicity are lacking for the oral route...|$|R

2500|$|In 1980, Salk {{pointed out}} the renewed {{interest}} in his killed virus vaccine, particularly in developing countries. [...] "The 'live' virus vaccine is highly effective in developed countries ...", he said, [...] "but in the developing countries, where polio is on the increase, the drawback is that the live virus fails to establish the infection that leads to immunity because of intestinal inhibitors in the population." [...] Recent evidence of this was found in Iran, where a number of children receiving the <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> became infected with polio, leading Iranian researchers to recommend using the killed virus in the future.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1962, {{public health}} {{officials}} in the U.S. and Canada faced a [...] "major dilemma": whether to continue using the recently begun Sabin vaccine inoculations until further studies were conducted, due to reports of polio cases among persons who had received it. The U.S. Surgeon General, Luther Terry, recommended a temporary halt due to 16 cases of confirmed polio in adults. And [...] "the Canadian Federal Health Department recommended against mass use of the [...] <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> pending further study of its effects." [...] One of the unfortunate results caused by the controversy was that [...] "many authorities have deplored the confusion that has been created in the public mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{more than}} a year without {{detection}} of the virus in Laos, WHO declared in March that transmission of cVDPV1 there had ceased, and Laos was removed from the list of infected countries. [...] However, separate new outbreaks caused by cVDPV2 occurred in southern and east-central provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, resulting in nine cases of paralysis. [...] Syria has seen an outbreak of cVDPV2 at Mayadin, in the Deir ez-Zor Governorate, a center of fighting in the Syrian Civil War. Testing following initial reports detected numerous cases in Mayadin, plus isolated cases in several neighboring districts. As of 8 November, Syria had 63 confirmed cases. [...] Genetic analysis suggested the virus had been circulating undetected for about two years. [...] The suppression of cVDPV2 is especially urgent, given the withdrawal of strain 2 from the <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> in 2016 (it remains part of the IPV vaccine). WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization recommends that cVDPV2 suppression be prioritized over targeting WPV1, and according to protocol OPV2 is restricted to this purpose. [...] Its use was authorized to suppress the Congo and Syria outbreaks as well as those in Pakistan and Nigeria identified in late 2016, the latter effort including neighboring countries of Chad, Cameroon, and Niger, and also in Mozambique, where vaccine-derived PV2 was detected in an area with low vaccination. [...] Vaccine-derived PV2 was also detected in Afghanistan, apparently the result of cross-border spread following OPV2 use around Quetta, Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|To date most <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> cannot {{withstand}} the alimentary tract {{or do not}} elicit strong mucosal immune response.

40|$|SummaryOral {{vaccines}} using killed bacterial extracts {{have been}} used to prevent acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, they are not recommended by current clinical guidelines. Two systematic reviews have been published on the efficacy of <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The first, on the effects of an oral whole-cell nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae vaccine (NTHi) found a significant decrease in the incidence of acute episodes of chronic bronchitis (Poisson rate ratio 0. 666; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 500, 0. 887; P= 0. 005), and a 58 % reduction in the prescription of antibiotics 3 months after vaccination. The second review evaluated studies that used multicomponent vaccines. It found that the duration of exacerbations was significantly shorter in the treatment group (weighted mean difference − 2. 7 days, 95 % CI − 3. 5 to − 1. 8). These reviews suggest that <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> reduce the number, severity, duration, or both, of acute exacerbations. However, many of the primary trials on which they are based are small and methodologically flawed. Further trials are needed before the use of <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> could be considered as part of the routine clinical management of patients with COPD or chronic bronchitis...|$|R
2500|$|A {{country is}} {{regarded}} as polio free or non-endemic if no cases have been detected for a year. However, {{it is still possible}} polio circulates under these circumstances, as was the case for Nigeria, where a particular strain of virus resurfaced after 5 years in 2016. This can be due to limited surveillance and under-vaccinated populations. Moreover, for the currently circulating virus WPV1, only 1 in 200 infection cases exhibit symptoms of polio paralyses in non-vaccinated children, and possibly even fewer in vaccinated children. Therefore, even a single case is considered an epidemic. According to modeling, it can take 4 to 6 months of no reported cases to achieve only a 50% chance of eradication, and 1 to 2 years for e.g. 95% chance. [...] For a polio virus to be certified as eradicated world-wide, at least three years of good surveillance without cases needs to be achieved, though this period may need to be longer for a strain like WPV3, where a lower proportion of those infected demonstrate symptoms. [...] Wild poliovirus type 2 was certified eradicated in 2015, the last case having been detected in 1999. [...] Wild poliovirus type 3 has not been detected since 2012, but its eradication has yet to be certified, and the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication in 2017 recommended not certifying its eradication independent of that of WPV1, and hence of wild poliovirus as a whole. [...] This recommendation would mean that PV3 will not be removed from the bivalent <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine,</b> as was considered necessary with PV2 due to its high risk of giving rise to cVDPV strains, but rather oral vaccination for PV3 will continue until total eradication of polio allows all oral vaccination to cease.|$|E

GFP was fused to the carboxy-terminus of S 1 for expression of S 1 -GFP to show expression of recombinant S 1 by agroinfiltration of tobacco leaves. The GFP tag enables a relatively quick confirmation of antigen expression in plant cells by fluorescent microscopy. Such analysis using GFP that precedes stable plant transformation will enable the rapid screening of multiple constructs to attain optimal recombinant protein expression.

5000|$|With {{the menace}} of polio growing, Sabin and other researchers, most notably Jonas Salk in Pittsburgh and Hilary Koprowski and Herald Cox in New York City and Philadelphia, sought a vaccine {{to prevent or}} {{mitigate}} the illness. The Sabin vaccine is an <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> containing weakened forms of strains of polio viruses. In 1955, Salk's [...] "killed" [...] vaccine was released for use. It was effective in preventing most of the complications of polio, but did not prevent the initial intestinal infection. The Sabin vaccine is easier to give than the earlier vaccine developed by Salk in 1954, and its effects last longer. Sabin first tested his live attenuated <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> at the Chillicothe Ohio Reformatory in late 1954. From 1956 - 1960, he worked with Russian colleagues to perfect the <b>oral</b> <b>vaccine</b> and prove its extraordinary effectiveness and safety. The Sabin vaccine worked in the intestines to block the poliovirus from entering the bloodstream. In the intestines, Sabin had discovered, the poliovirus multiplied and attacked.
