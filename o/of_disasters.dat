5|$|The Byzantine naval {{predominance}} {{lasted until}} the early 9th century, when a succession <b>of</b> <b>disasters</b> {{at the hands of}} the resurgent Muslim fleets spelled its end and inaugurated an era that would represent the zenith of Muslim ascendancy. Already in 790, the Byzantines suffered a major defeat in the Gulf of Antalya, and raids against Cyprus and Crete recommenced during the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809). Around the Mediterranean, new powers were rising, foremost amongst them the Carolingian Empire, while in 803, the Pax Nicephori recognized the de facto independence of Byzantine Venice, which was further entrenched by the repulsion of a Byzantine attack in 809. At the same time, in Ifriqiya, the new Aghlabid dynasty was established, which immediately engaged in raids throughout the central Mediterranean.|$|E

Conditions improved in 1835 when the city became the Assembly of the Estates of the Realm (Rådgivende Stænderforsamling) and in 1847 with the railway connecting Copenhagen and Roskilde.|$|E

5|$|The {{death toll}} was 61 as of October6, {{and a day}} later it reached about 250. The Mexican {{government}} reported 341 deaths on October13, excluding victims in a landslide in Acalama, Puebla, and the total reached 379 by October28. However, non-government agencies reported 500deaths in Mexico by October9, {{and as many as}} 600 as of mid-November. The International Disaster Database, published by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>Disasters,</b> reported 636deaths from the floods. The high death toll, in comparison to similar floods in 1944, was due to more landslides and flooding in more populated areas. About 500,000people were injured.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} approached, {{residents}} of low-lying areas were advised to seek shelter. According to the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority, the communication system had been activated and collectors in coastal districts were given satellite telephones. Additionally, district authorities collected food, water, and other essential emergency supplies. Offshore Odisha, rough seas caused two trawlers to collide, resulting in 18fatalities; {{their bodies were}} later found floating Dhamra Port in the Bhadrak district of Odisha. Two additional trawlers were reported missing. Nine fishing trawlers sank offshore West Bengal, with only 66fishermen accounted for. Initially, as many as 600were estimated to have been missing, though 250people swam back to Digha, where most of them received treatment at either a medical clinic or a hospital. According to the Chief Minister of West Bengal, 111people were still missing offshore West Bengal by late on November12. Forty-nine fatalities were confirmed offshore India, while two deaths occurred inland in West Bengal. Later, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>Disasters</b> raised the death toll to 124.|$|E
5|$|In 610, {{during the}} Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, Heraclius became the emperor of the Byzantine Empire, after overthrowing Phocas. Meanwhile, the Sasanian Empire conquered Mesopotamia and in 611 they overran Syria and entered Anatolia, occupying Caesarea Mazaca (now Kayseri, Turkey). Heraclius, in 612, managed to expel the Persians from Anatolia, but was decisively {{defeated}} in 613 when {{he launched a}} major offensive in Syria against the Persians. Over the following decade the Persians were able to conquer Palestine and Egypt. Meanwhile, Heraclius prepared for a counterattack and rebuilt his army. Nine years later in 622, Heraclius finally launched his offensive. After his overwhelming victories over the Persians and their allies in the Caucasus and Armenia, Heraclius, in 627, launched a winter offensive against the Persians in Mesopotamia, winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Nineveh thus threatening the Persian capital city of Ctesiphon. Discredited by these series <b>of</b> <b>disasters,</b> Khosrow II was overthrown and killed in a coup led by his son Kavadh II, who at once sued for peace, agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territories of the Byzantine Empire. Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem with a majestic ceremony in 629.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{humanitarian}} {{action in the}} aftermath <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> could be explained with the concept <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> governance.

Its goal is to make the affected person to be resilient in the aftermath <b>of</b> <b>disaster.</b> This paper elaborates the principle <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> governance including the concept of humanitarianism, the development of humanitarian enterprise, and the issue of coordination within the chaotic coordination after disaster.

5|$|Throughout Mexico, {{the floods}} {{killed at least}} 379people, {{according}} to the federal government, and as many as 600 according to relief agencies; the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>Disasters</b> later estimated there were 636deaths, and damage in Mexico was estimated at $451.3million (4.3billion pesos). Nationwide, the floods damaged or destroyed 90,000houses, which left about 500,000people homeless. Flooding caused thousands of landslides, many in more populated areas than the flooding in 1944. The floods also caused 39rivers to overflow, and the combination of floods and landslides destroyed bridges, houses, widespread crop fields, schools, and electrical networks. Impact was worst in Puebla, where damage totaled $240million (2.1billion pesos) and many roads were washed out. Landslides in the state killed 107people in Teziutlán. Elsewhere in the country, the floods washed crocodiles into the streets of Villahermosa, the capital of Tabasco, and in Oaxaca, the rainfall occurred after an earthquake left thousands homeless. Flooding also extended into Central America in late September through early October, causing $40million (385million pesos) in crop damage and 70deaths.|$|E
