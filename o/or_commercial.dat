5|$|Eastwood then {{branched}} out {{to star in}} the only musical of his career, Paint Your Wagon (1969). Eastwood and Lee Marvin play gold miners who buy a Mormon settler's less favored wife (Jean Seberg) at an auction. Bad weather and delays plagued the production, and the film's budget eventually exceeded $20million, which was extremely expensive for the time. The film was not a critical <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> success, although it {{was nominated for a}} Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture– Musical or Comedy.|$|E

After {{the success of the}} 1988 Disney/Amblin film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Little Mermaid is given credit for breathing life back into the art of Disney animated feature films after a string of critical <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> failures produced by Disney that dated back to the early 1970s. It also marked the start of the era known as the Disney Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|The {{feature-length film}} sequels Thunderbirds Are Go and Thunderbird 6 were {{released}} in 1966 and 1968. The first was greenlit by Lew Grade before the TV series had started its broadcast run. Written and {{produced by the}} Andersons and directed by David Lane, both films were distributed by United Artists. Neither was a critical <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> success, and Century 21 Cinema's plans for further sequels were abandoned.|$|E

Since the war, the display of the flag of Japan is mostly limited to buildings attached to national and local governments such as city halls; it is rarely seen at private homes <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> buildings, but some people and companies have advocated displaying the flag on holidays. Although the government of Japan encourages citizens and residents to fly the Hinomaru during national holidays, they are not legally required to do so. Since the Emperor's 80th Birthday on December 23, 2002, the Kyushu Railway Company has displayed the Hinomaru at 330 stations.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Dynamics is {{best known}} for {{developing}} the Legacy of Kain and Gex series. Although the first Legacy of Kain video game was developed by Silicon Knights, Crystal Dynamics gained the rights to the franchise in 1998 and developed four sequels between 1999 and 2003. In 2003, the studio took over the development of the best-selling Tomb Raider franchise after its original developer, Core Design, failed to gain critical <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> success with their later games. Crystal Dynamics' first Tomb Raider game, , became a commercial success with 4.5 million copies sold as of February 2009. Its sequel, , sold 2.6 million copies and became the first game the studio developed for the PlayStation 3. Since 2003, the studio has focused development on the Tomb Raider franchise with the help of other studios such as Buzz Monkey Software and Nixxes Software. Crystal Dynamics has developed five games in the series, encompassing two reboots of the franchise.|$|E

5|$|Dubstep's early {{roots are}} in the more {{experimental}} releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass into the South London-based 2-step garage sound. These experiments often {{ended up on the}} B-side of a white label <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> garage release. Dubstep is generally instrumental. Similar to a vocal garage hybrid – grime – the genre's feel is commonly dark; tracks frequently use a minor key and can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff. Other distinguishing features often found are the use of samples, a propulsive, sparse rhythm, and an almost omnipresent sub-bass. Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from dub-influenced techno such as Basic Channel to classical music or heavy metal.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood next {{turned his}} {{attention}} towards Breezy (1973), a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met Sondra Locke for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films {{over the next ten}} years and would become an important figure in his life. Kay Lenz got the part of Breezy because Locke, at age 29, was considered too old. The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and Frank Stanley, came in $1million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule. Breezy was not a major critical <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> success and it was only made available on video in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Emotions {{contains}} influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel, {{as well as}} her continued work of R and soul. The album, while {{praised by}} some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> heights of her debut effort, while selling far less and failed to introduce Carey into a different market. Following these events, Columbia decided to try to market Carey in a similar fashion to her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop/R record. Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box.|$|E

5|$|In {{order for}} natural ice {{to reach its}} customers, {{it had to be}} {{harvested}} from ponds and rivers, then transported and stored at various sites before finally being used in domestic <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> applications. Throughout these processes, traders faced the problem of keeping the ice from melting; melted ice represented waste and lost profits. In the 1820s and 1830s only 10 percent of ice harvested was eventually sold to the end user due to wastage en route. By the end of the 19th century, however, the wastage in the ice trade was reduced to between 20 and 50 percent, depending on the efficiency of the company.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom and Ireland, {{the digital}} {{television}} channel More4 used to broadcast episodes of The Daily Show Tuesday through Friday evenings with the Global Edition, which is uncensored, airs on Mondays; regular episodes air the evening following their U.S. airing. More4 {{was the first}} international broadcaster to syndicate entire Daily Show episodes, though they made edits to the program due to content, language, length <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> references. The program was also available to watch via the internet video on demand service 4oD. However, the 'toss' to The Colbert Report was usually included {{even though it was}} aired on FX, another channel. In addition, the placement of commercial breaks followed the UK format, with one break midway through the show rather than several short breaks at various points. When The Daily Show was on hiatus, either re-runs or alternative content were aired. Since January 2011, only the Global Edition is broadcast.|$|E

5|$|Statistics on {{injuries}} {{related to}} commercial diving are normally collected by national regulators. In the UK the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) {{is responsible for}} the overview of about 5,000 commercial divers; in Norway the corresponding authority is the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA), which has maintained the DSYS database since 1985, gathering statistics on over 50,000 diver-hours of commercial activity per year. The risks of dying during recreational, scientific <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> diving are small, and for scuba diving, deaths are usually associated with poor gas management, poor buoyancy control, equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error {{on the part of the}} victim. According to a North American 1972 analysis of calendar year 1970 data, diving was, based on man hours, 96 times more dangerous than driving a car. According to a 2000 Japanese study, every hour of recreational diving is 36 to 62 times riskier than driving.|$|E
5|$|The 19th {{century was}} a {{turbulent}} time for Spain. Those {{in favour of}} reforming Spain's government vied for political power with conservatives, who tried to prevent reforms from taking place. Some liberals, in a tradition that had started with the Spanish Constitution of 1812, sought to limit {{the power of the}} monarchy of Spain and to establish a liberal state. The reforms of 1812 did not last after King Ferdinand VII dissolved the Constitution and ended a short-lived liberal government with French royalist military assistance. Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874. There were several attempts to realign the political system to match social reality. Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a bourgeois industrial <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> class. The land-based oligarchy remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates (called latifundia) as well as all the important government positions. The landowners' power was challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors, largely unsuccessfully.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} very popular during the three-day exhibition, with players {{lining up to}} see the game, {{especially}} high school students. It was shown again the following year with a larger oscilloscope screen and a more complicated design that could simulate different gravity levels. It was then dismantled and largely forgotten until the late 1970s when Higinbotham testified in court about the game during lawsuits between Magnavox and Ralph H. Baer over video game patents. Since then, it has been celebrated as one of the earliest video games, and Brookhaven has made recreations of the original device. Under some definitions Tennis for Two is considered the first video game, as while it did not include any technological innovations over prior games, it was the first computer game to be created purely as an entertainment product rather than for academic research <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> technology promotion.|$|E
