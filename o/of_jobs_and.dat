5|$|Born the illegitimate {{son of a}} {{domestic}} servant and her employer in Tonbridge, Kent, Smith migrated to Canada in 1907, where he went through a variety <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> began reading about Western esotericism. Through Charles Stansfeld Jones he {{was introduced to the}} writings of Thelema's founder, Aleister Crowley. He subsequently joined Crowley's Thelemite order, the A∴A∴, and the Thelemite wing of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). In 1915, he joined the O.T.O.'s British Columbia Lodge No. 1, based in Vancouver, and rose to become one of its senior members.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, 22.7% of the {{population}} in the Salford USD (Urban Subdivision) were non-white British compared with 15.6% for the surrounding borough. The USD had a slightly larger percentage of Asian and black people. Salford has become a lot more ethnically diverse since the previous census, probably due to the relocation of many BBC establishments from London between 2011 and 2012. This has created lots <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> encouraged migration to the area, which was previously very deprived since the loss of many traditional industries in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Like other Rust Belt cities, Utica had an {{economic}} downturn beginning in the mid-20thcentury. The downturn consisted of industrial decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills, population loss caused by the relocation <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> businesses to suburbs and to Syracuse, and poverty associated with socioeconomic stress and a decreased tax base. With its low cost of living, the city has become a melting pot for refugees from war-torn countries around the world, encouraging growth for its colleges and universities, cultural institutions and economy.|$|E
40|$|This {{article will}} be {{concerned}} with the question whether the books <b>of</b> <b>Job</b> <b>and</b> Ecclesiastes {{can be viewed as}} (postmodern) wisdom in revolt or not. Three questions underlie this title: firstly, are the books <b>of</b> <b>Job</b> <b>and</b> Ecclesiastes wisdom books? Secondly, if so, is their wisdom revolutionary in nature? And thirdly, are there any similarities between the thoughts <b>of</b> <b>Job</b> <b>and</b> Ecclesiastes {{on the one hand and}} that of postmodern thinkers on the other hand? It will be argued that there are various similarities to be cited between the ideas of the ancient wisdom writers <b>of</b> <b>Job</b> <b>and</b> Ecclesiastes and more recent postmodern thinkers. This does not, however, necessarily justify a postmodern tag for the books <b>of</b> <b>Job</b> <b>and</b> Ecclesiastes, but points to a similarity in thought development between the ancient societies <b>of</b> <b>Job</b> <b>and</b> Ecclesiastes and the present-day societies. Such similarities are viewed as a clear indication of the meaningful role which Old Testament wisdom, or wisdom in revolt for that matter, can play in current intellectual and theological debates.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship between career maturity, and career expectations <b>and</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> organisational knowledge <b>of</b> engineering bursars. The sample comprised 168 engineering bursars from a variety of South African universities. A questionnaire was developed to measure bursars’ career expectations <b>and</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> organisational knowledge. The sample was divided into homogeneous clusters on the basis of two dimensions – career expectations <b>and</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> organisational knowledge. These clusters were compared in respect of career maturity. Statistically significant differences were found. A secondary aim of the study was to examine the impact of certain demographic variables on career maturity, career expectations <b>and</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> organisational knowledge. The implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The U.S. wind {{industry}} generates tens {{of thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> {{billions of dollars of}} economic activity. Wind projects provide local taxes, or payments in lieu of taxes and strengthen the economy of rural communities by providing income to farmers with wind turbines on their land. Wind energy in many jurisdictions receives financial or other support to encourage its development. Wind energy benefits from subsidies in many jurisdictions, either to increase its attractiveness, or to compensate for subsidies received by other forms of production which have significant negative externalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} {{closure of}} 150coal mines, {{some of which}} were not losing money, resulted in the loss of tens of thousands <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> had the effect of devastating entire communities. Miners had helped bring down the Heath ministry, and Thatcher was determined to succeed where he had failed. Her strategy of preparing fuel stocks, appointing hardliner Ian MacGregor as NCB leader, and ensuring that police were adequately trained and equipped with riot gear, contributed to her triumph over the striking miners.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Savige {{was born}} on 26 June 1890, in Morwell, Victoria, the eldest of eight {{children}} to Samuel Savige, a butcher, and his wife Ann Nora, née Walmsley. Stan Savige left Korumburra State School {{at the age of}} twelve to work as a blacksmith's striker. While at Korumburra, he enlisted in the school junior cadets as a bugler. The family moved to Prahran, Victoria, in 1907, where Savige worked at a variety <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> served in the Prahran senior cadets for 18months, from 1907 to 1909. He became a scoutmaster, forming the First Yarra Troop. Savige was {{an active member of the}} South Yarra Baptist Church, where he was a Sunday school teacher. Through his church activities, Savige met Lilian Stockton, to whom he became engaged on New Year's Day, 1914.|$|E

5|$|The câmara {{municipal}} (town council) was {{the governing}} body in {{towns and cities}} and had existed in Brazil {{since the beginning of}} the colonial period in the 16th century. The Chamber was composed of vereadores (councilmen), the number of which depended on the size of the town. Unlike the Provincial General Council, the Constitution gave town councils great autonomy. However, when the Provincial Assembly replaced the Provincial General Council in 1834, many of the powers of town councils (including the setting of municipal budgets, oversight of expenditures, creation <b>of</b> <b>jobs,</b> <b>and</b> the nomination of civil servants) were transferred to the provincial government. Additionally, any laws enacted by the town council had to be ratified by the Provincial Assembly—but not by Parliament. While the 1834 Additional Act granted greater autonomy to the provinces from the central government, it transferred the towns' remaining autonomy to the provincial governments. There was no office of mayor, and towns were governed by a town council and its president (who was the councilman who won the most votes during elections).|$|E
5|$|Thi {{lived in}} the American capital until 1975, {{when he moved to}} Arkansas. He {{lived in the}} {{southern}} state for a short period before settling in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He worked in a variety <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> occasionally made speeches at universities and to Vietnamese American organizations and meetings. According to his relatives, Thi remained popular among the Vietnamese American community, most of whom had come to the US after the fall of Saigon and were stridently anti-communist. His family said their refugee compatriots often recognized him, and usually refused to let him pay for meals at their restaurants. Thi's second marriage, to Oanh Nguyen, ended in divorce. They had five children, four sons and a daughter. He later remarried, to Catherine Nguyen, who bore him a daughter. In all, Thi had six children and 12 grandchildren. He died at the Hospice of Lancaster County from heart ailments on 23 June 2007.|$|E
