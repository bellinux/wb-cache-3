2500|$|Restoration {{work was}} {{performed}} on the building and some of its contents in 2009 and 2010. The work was sponsored in part by the German government, which donated 60,000 euros for the effort, and in part by the museum itself, which contributed one million pesos. The effort concentrates on obtaining furniture for display and preservation, <b>other</b> equipment, <b>roof</b> <b>work,</b> and restoration of items in the collection. Restoration includes most of the paintings in the collection, including Viva la vida, El marxismo dará salud a los enfermos, Frida y la cesárea, Naturaleza muerta con bandera, Retrato de Marta Procel, Retrato de mi familia, Retrato de mi padre Wilhelm Kahlo and Los hornos de ladrillos as well as [...] La quebrada and Paisaje urbano by Rivera, Retrato del niño Don Antonio Villaseñor and Retrato de niño muerto by unknown author, Composición by Wolfgang Paalenk, and Retrato de Diego Rivera by Leopold Gottlieb, along with an archive of 6,500 photographs of Kahlo, Rivera with the friends, family and colleagues done by Nickolas Murray, Martin Munckaci, Fritz Henle and Gisele Freund. The conservation work only covers about 35 percent of the total collection.|$|R

40|$|Problem: Roofs {{receive the}} most intense solar heat load among all {{building}} envelope surfaces in Equatorial-region. Solar heat gain through roof contributes to {{a significant portion of}} building heat load. In tropics where building cooling is needed all-year-round, passive methods to reduce heat gain through roof could provide significant cooling energy-savings. Approach: Currently, the most widely adopted practices to curb the heat flux through roof include using thick building material-layer (30 - 40 cm-thick concrete) or insulation (5 - 10 cm-thick). This study investigates the thermal performance of emerging methods: cool roof and green <b>roof.</b> Cool <b>roof</b> <b>works</b> by applying a coating-layer having high-solar-albedo. Green <b>roof</b> <b>works</b> by adding a soil-layer and vegetation. This study numerically compares the heat curbing performances of these technologies under the tropical climate using an experimentally-calibrated EnergyPlus model. Results and discussion: Cool roof performs best in reducing annual net heat gain in tropical climate of Singapore, which receives abundant irradiation. Cool roof reduces heat gain during day-time and promotes heat loss during night-time. Insulation and green roof are effective in curbing heat gain during day-time but they prevent heat loss during night-time. Research limitations: This paper reports the investigation on a flat concrete roof as the base. Investigations on <b>other</b> <b>roof</b> base materials, e. g., metal roof, will be reported in future. Originality: This is the first study that compares performances of cool roof, green roof and insulation against original concrete roof in tropical climate...|$|R

More <b>roof</b> <b>work</b> was probably carried out in 1964. From 1966 to 1969, the building was restored again and a survey of the building was also carried out by the Bureau of Cultural Property. There was more <b>roof</b> <b>work</b> in 1983, while the altar was repaired in 1984. Another survey by the Bureau of Cultural Property, this time of all the temple buildings and stonework, was carried out from 1985 to 1986.

50|$|The <b>roof</b> <b>work</b> of {{the choir}} was built in two phases between 1317 and 1323 from east to west, as a rafter roof with collar beam {{position}} and cross strut. The approximately 28 m long roof has a roof pitch of 57°, consists of 24 rafters and includes the polygonal upper fixation {{of the choir}}. The roof turret design was developed in 1496, and the belfry in 1475. Due to the strong inclination of the rafter container of about 97 cm, a pursuit of spruce and fir {{was set up in}} the 17th century. The roof structure was two times repaired what easily is recognizable. The first repair contained, among other things, the installation of the supporting struts, which stabilized the rafter container. Towards {{to the end of the}} 17th century, the second repair was implemented, which concentrated on the eastern chancel. One can note that the inclination of the entire <b>roof</b> <b>work</b> is originated by the pressure of the polygonal choir construction.|$|R

The <b>other</b> widespread <b>roofing</b> material was local red clay plain tiles. 19th century bulk transport innovations associated with canal and railway infrastructure allowed imports of blue slate from North Wales.
