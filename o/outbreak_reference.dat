40|$|Objective To {{estimate}} the measles effective reproduction number (R) in Australia by modelling routinely collected notification data. Methods R was estimated for 2009 - 2011 {{by means of}} three methods, using data from Australia's National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. Method 1 estimated R as 1 - P, where P equals the proportion of cases that were imported, as determined from data on place of acquisition. The other methods estimated R by fitting a subcritical branching process that modelled the spread of an infection with a given R to the observed distributions of outbreak sizes (method 2) and generations of spread (method 3). Stata version 12 was used for method 2 and Matlab version R 2012 was used for method 3. For all methods, calculation of 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) was performed using a normal approximation based on estimated standard errors. Findings During 2009 - 2011, 367 notifiable measles cases occurred in Australia (mean annual rate: 5. 5 cases per million population). Data were 100 % complete for importation status but 77 % complete for <b>outbreak</b> <b>reference</b> number. R was estimated as < 1 for all years and data types, with values of 0. 65 (95 % CI: 0. 60 - 0. 70) obtained by method 1, 0. 64 (95 % CI: 0. 56 - 0. 72) by method 2 and 0. 47 (95 % CI: 0. 38 - 0. 57) by method 3. Conclusion The fact that consistent estimates of R were obtained from all three methods enhances confidence in the validity of these methods for determining R...|$|E
40|$|Background: Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii {{commonly}} causes hospital outbreaks. However, {{within an}} outbreak, {{it can be}} difficult to identify the routes of cross-infection rapidly and accurately enough to inform infection control. Here, we describe a protracted hospital outbreak of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, in which whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to obtain a high-resolution view of the relationships between isolates. Methods: To delineate and investigate the outbreak, we attempted to genome-sequence 114 isolates that had been assigned to the A. baumannii complex by the Vitek 2 system and obtained informative draft genome sequences from 102 of them. Genomes were mapped against an <b>outbreak</b> <b>reference</b> sequence to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Results: We found that the pulsotype 27 outbreak strain was distinct from all other genome-sequenced strains. Seventy-four isolates from 49 patients could be assigned to the pulsotype 27 outbreak on the basis of genomic similarity, while WGS allowed 18 isolates to be ruled out of the outbreak. Among the pulsotype 27 outbreak isolates, we identified 31 SNVs and seven major genotypic clusters. In two patients, we documented within-host diversity, including mixtures of unrelated strains and within-strain clouds of SNV diversity. By combining WGS and epidemiological data, we reconstructed potential transmission events that linked all but 10 of the patients and confirmed links between clinical and environmental isolates. Identification of a contaminated bed and a burns theatre as sources of transmission led to enhanced environmental decontamination procedures. Conclusions: WGS is now poised to make an impact on hospital infection prevention and control, delivering cost-effective identification of routes of infection within a clinically relevant timeframe and allowing infection control teams to track, and even prevent, the spread of drug-resistant hospital pathogens...|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} for categorization of economic impacts of outbreaks of highly contagious livestock diseases (HCLD) is presented. This framework interprets veterinary measures to control HCLD <b>outbreaks</b> with <b>reference</b> to economic definitions of costs and benefits, {{and the implications}} for value losses both for different stakeholders affected and society as a whole. Four cost categories are identified, that is virus control-related direct costs (DC), spread prevention and zoning-related direct consequential costs (DCC), market and price disruption-related costs during (indirect consequential costs, ICC) and after the outbreak (aftermath costs, AC). The framework is used to review existing literature on cost estimation for different stakeholders. This review shows considerable differences between studies, making comparison of results difficult and susceptible to misunderstanding. It is concluded that the framework provides a logical basis for all future analyses of the economic impacts of HCLD...|$|R

40|$|Whole-genome {{sequencing}} (WGS) {{has emerged}} today as an ultimate typing tool to characterize Listeria monocytogenes out-breaks. However, data analysis and interlaboratory comparability ofWGS data are still challenging for most public health labo-ratories. Therefore, {{we have developed}} and evaluated a new L. monocytogenes typing scheme based on genome-wide gene-by-gene comparisons (core genomemultilocus the sequence typing [cgMLST]) {{to allow for a}} unique typing nomenclature. Initially, we determined the breadth of the L. monocytogenes population based onMLST data with a Bayesian approach. Based on the ge-nome sequence data of representative isolates for the whole population, cgMLST target genes were defined and reappraised with 67 L. monocytogenes isolates from two <b>outbreaks</b> and serotype <b>reference</b> strains. The Bayesian population analysis generated five L. monocytogenes groups. Using all available NCBI RefSeq genomes (n 36) and six additionally sequenced strains, all genetic groups were covered. Pairwise comparisons of these 42 genome sequences resulted in 1, 701 cgMLST targets present in all 42 ge-nomes with 100 % overlap and> 90 % sequence similarity. Overall,> 99. 1 % of the cgMLST targets were present in 67 <b>outbreak</b> and serotype <b>reference</b> strains, underlining the representativeness of the cgMLST scheme. Moreover, cgMLST enabled clustering of outbreak isolates with< 10 alleles difference and unambiguous separation from unrelated outgroup isolates. In conclusion, the novel cgMLST scheme not only improves outbreak investigations but also enables, due to the availability of the automatically curated cgMLST nomenclature, interlaboratory exchange of data that are crucial, especially for rapid responses during transsec-torial outbreaks...|$|R
5000|$|Loosely {{related to}} the author's highly {{regarded}} novel The Stand, the brief story follows one evening on a place called Anson Beach, New Hampshire, {{with a group of}} teens, survivors of a catastrophic virus called A6, or [...] "Captain Trips", that has wiped out virtually the entire population. The virus was said to have spread out of Southeast Asia. The teenagers are shown to have a rather sinister nature in that they abduct a man and burn him on a pyre, believing such a human sacrifice to their gods would grant them protection against A6. The main character of the story, named Bernie, reflects upon this new world and frequently daydreams about [...] "the time before" [...] when he went to Anson Beach in his younger years before the A6 <b>outbreak.</b> A <b>reference</b> is made to a previous virus called A2, which the teens had all survived, leading them to think they were immune to A6's lethal effect. Toward the end of the story, one of them begins to show symptoms of A6, and they realize that perhaps their exposure to A2 did not in fact grant them immunity to this deadlier virus. While Bernie's companion, Susie, accepts his explanation that maybe some teenagers lied about having A2 in order to join their group, Bernie realizes A2 is no guarantee against A6, and starts to accept his eventual death.|$|R

Ability of the strains to inhibit trachea epithelial cilium activity, to induce immune response, to replicate and to cause histopathological lesions in designated organs were followed by repeated samplings during a period of 42 days post-infection. By comparing the results of the strains, clear differences in pathogenicity and in organ distribution of the three serotypes were found. 793 /B had the least capacity to invade the investigated organs, while it produced good humoral response as measured by ELISA. QX-like strains generally replicated in higher titres, although differences were found among the five strains, in the pathogenicity and affinity to different organs. The Chinese isolate of QX-like strain proved to cause the more severe lesions and induce the highest antibody titres as well. Severe kidney damage and dilation of the oviduct were the prominent lesions, which could be related to these strains, although remarkable virus replication and histopathological lesions were not detected in the oviduct...|$|R
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of 19 isolates of Haemophilus ducreyi from {{a recent}} chancroid <b>outbreak</b> and four <b>reference</b> strains was determined in vitro to 13 antimicrobial agents. The rabbit intradermal test for virulence was positive {{for all of the}} local isolates, but not for the reference strains. The “nonvirulent” reference strains were inhibited by lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of most agents tested. For the virulent isolates, the range of MICs (in micrograms per milliliter) of the following were: of vancomycin, 8 to 128; of polymyxin, 32 to 128; of cloxacillin, 32 to 64; of tetracycline, 0. 5 to 32; of cephalothin, 4 to 8; of doxycycline, 0. 25 to 8; and of kanamycin, 1 to 8. Three strains were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (MIC ≥ 128 μg/ml), and these three strains produced β-lactamase. The remainder were susceptible to 4 μg/ml. All strains were susceptible to rifampin (MIC ≤ 1 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (MIC ≤ 4 μg/ml), sulfisoxazole (MIC ≤ 8 μg/ml), and nalidixic acid (MIC ≤ 8 μg/ml).

This Summary (Noninfectious) is being published in the same volume of MMWR as the annual Summary of Notifiable Infectious Diseases and Conditions (1). Data on notifiable noninfectious conditions and disease outbreaks from prior years have been published previously (2, 3). The Summary (Noninfectious) includes a synopsis of major findings from published surveillance reports for nationally notifiable noninfectious conditions and disease outbreaks, internet links to the complete published surveillance reports, and links to data and tables displaying current and historical descriptive statistics for each condition. Providing detailed descriptive current year and historical data and tables online makes the data more accessible and usable to the public. Surveillance summaries and other published reports on each condition will now present major statistical findings and trends and summarize what public health programs are doing to address the condition, evidence-based recommendations for prevention and control of the condition, and how persons, workers, and community groups can use the combination of information to improve their health. An additional benefit of these changes is that the CDC programs responsible for noninfectious conditions and disease outbreaks will develop and publish reports for each notifiable condition as the data become available. This approach minimizes delays that can occur when collating data from multiple programs into a single report. This Summary (Noninfectious) presents the highlights of surveillance information published between April 1, 2016 and January 31, 2017 (surveillance period varied) on five of nine nationally notifiable noninfectious conditions (Box) : cancer, elevated blood lead levels among children aged < 5 years, foodborne disease outbreaks,; and acute nonoccupational and occupational pesticide-related illness and injury.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was defined as the}} study of the {{contribution}} of IPV vaccination to the induction of a) protection against poliovirus infection and b) mucosal immunity. We have described the development of new immunological tools for the rapid detection of poliovirus-specific antibodies and have investigated the induction of mucosal immunity after IPV vaccination. Our studies compared the immunity induced by IPV vaccination to the immune responses after OPV vaccination and/or exposure to wild-type poliovirus. The presence of antibodies that protect individuals from poliomyelitis is usually determined by a neutralisation assay using cell cultures. Cell culture assays, however, are technically demanding. Disadvantages of the serum neutralisation test (NT) include its long duration and the need for a manual screening of the test results, making this assay labour intensive, difficult to standardise and less suitable for the screening of large populations. Other assays able to detect poliovirus-specific antibodies have been developed within the last decade [6, 7]. However, the new assays estimating immunity to polioviruses measure both neutralising and non-neutralising antibodies, whereas it is the presence of neutralising antibodies that is correlated with protection from (re) infection. A newly developed inhibition ELISA known as the PoBI test (Chapter 2) can replace the NT for the determination of protective levels of antibodies to polioviruses in large-scale population studies. Correlations between the PoBI test and the NT were high: 0. 89, 0. 89 and 0. 84 for serotypes 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The sensitivity of the inhibition ELISA was 98. 6 %, 97. 4 % and 92. 1 % for serotypes 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The specificity of the PoBI test as determined with sera from non-vaccinated persons was also high for all three serotypes (99. 0 %, 95. 8 % and 100 % for serotypes 1, 2 and 3 respectively). One of the major advantages of the PoBI test over the NT is the use of inactivated virus as the antigen. In view of the ongoing eradication of poliovirus, the use of live poliovirus in diagnostic assays should be discouraged and must cease altogether in the near future. Under these circumstances, the PoBI assay is an excellent replacement for the standard NT. Three important antigenic sites (epitopes) involved in virus neutralisation have been identified on polioviruses in mouse experiments [13]. It has been reported that trypsin, present in the intestinal fluids, can cleave serotype 3 polioviruses at antigenic site 1 [14]. Trypsin cleavage of poliovirus results in drastically altered antigenic properties, and trypsin-cleaved viruses may escape neutralisation by monoclonal antibodies to antigenic site 1 [9]. Antibody responses to antigenic sites 1 and 3 were determined in fully IPV- or OPV-vaccinated recipients and in individuals who had been naturally infected (Chapter 3) in order to study the immunogenicity of these sites in humans and the effect of trypsin exposure in vivo. Both sites were immunogenic in naturally infected humans. No significant differences were detected in the responses to antigenic site 1 between IPV-and OPV-recipients. However, significantly more OPV recipients (88. 7 %) had detectable antibodies to antigenic site 3 (p< 0. 01) when compared to IPV-vaccinated persons (63. 1 %). While there are no major differences in the systemic humoral immune response between IPV- and OPV-vaccinated persons, {{it is not clear whether}} parenteral vaccination with IPV can lead to priming of the mucosal immune system. We?Summary 122 developed and evaluated ELISAs for the detection of poliovirus serotype-specific IgA and secretory IgA antibodies, and used these assays to examine IgA responses after wild-type infection or vaccination (described in Chapter 4). All of the examined poliomyelitis patients developed a humoral poliovirus-specific IgA response after infection with wild-type poliovirus. In addition, poliovirus-specific IgA was found more frequently in OPV-vaccinated persons than in IPV-vaccinated persons. We observed an age-related increase in the seroprevalence of IgA in the IPV-vaccinated population of The Netherlands. These results may be explained by the assumption that IgA is induced by infection with live poliovirus (wild-type or OPV strains) in the older population, and is unrelated to the IPV vaccination schedule. This is best illustrated by the finding that children between the ages of 13 and 15, born prior to the serotype 1 outbreak of 1978, had significantly more serotype 1 -specific IgA in their serum than serotype 2 - or 3 -specific IgA. We also found that parenteral vaccination with IPV was able to boost IgA responses in 74 % to 87 % of a naturally exposed population. While the presence of IgA in IPV-recipients has been previously documented, our findings support the hypothesis that mucosal priming with live virus is necessary to obtain an IgA response after IPV booster vaccination. A group of fully OPV- or IPV-vaccinated recipients were given a booster vaccination with IPV to investigate the effect of IPV vaccination on the mucosal IgA response (described in Chapter 5). ELISA and ELISPOT-assays were used for the detection of poliovirus-specific IgA responses. No induction of poliovirus-specific IgA was detected in either saliva or stool samples from individuals in the IPV-vaccinated group, and no IgA-producing cells could be detected in their blood. These findings led to the conclusion that IPV vaccination is unable to induce a response to poliovirus at the mucosal level, indicating the possibility of a lower level of protection against (re) infection in IPV recipients. However, IPV did induce high levels of circulating IgA in fully OPV-vaccinated subjects at both the humoral and the mucosal level. When B cell populations were separated on the basis of the expression of mucosal (a 4 b 7 integrin) or peripheral (L-selectin) homing receptors, a large percentage (77. 3 %) of the poliovirus-specific IgA-producing cells in the previously OPV-vaccinated group expressed the a 4 b 7 integrin. It was concluded that IPV vaccination alone is insufficient to induce a mucosal IgA response against poliovirus. Our results did indicate, however, that IPV vaccination can serve as an excellent stimulator of mucosal immunity in mucosally (OPV) primed individuals. These observations indicate that the interpretation of findings from challenge studies using IPV recipients must take into account subjects possible previous contact with live poliovirus. Subjects from endemic regions, for example, may have had previous exposure to live poliovirus, and this may explain the reported induction of mucosal IgA by IPV vaccination in the past [2, 5, 8, 10, 16, 17, 19]. Cases of poliomyelitis in which paralysis occurs are very difficult to distinguish clinically from other cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). Several new diagnostic methods have been developed in recent years (in our laboratory and elsewhere) that have not been evaluated under field conditions [3, 4, 10, 11, 15, 18]. While the virological investigation of stool samples is important, it is a laborious procedure [1]. The detection of poliovirus serotype specific-IgM in AFP patients facilitates the laboratory diagnosis of poliomyelitis and helps to exclude poliovirus as the causative agent (Chapter 6). In fact, virus-specific IgM was detected in the blood for six weeks longer than virus was able to be isolated from stool samples. Poliovirus-specific IgA?Summary 123 persisted in many patients for more than eight weeks after infection and may therefore reflect past exposure rather than a recently acquired infection. For this reason, poliovirus-specific IgA is less suitable for the diagnosis of recent infections. Reports of AFP cases in The Netherlands often succumb to serious delays. As a result, AFP surveillance (in its present form) is not an adequate tool with which to document the absence of poliovirus. To make matters worse, only 18. 6 % of reported AFP cases are virologically examined in The Netherlands (according to WHO guidelines [1, 12]). This implies that poliovirus infection can not be excluded with certainty in 69 % of these cases. The IgM ELISA will be helpful in resolving cases of AFP that cannot be retrospectively classified as poliomyelitis and for which serum samples are available. Despite all of the problems discussed above, we are well on our way to the world-wide eradication of poliovirus through the use of the currently available IPV and OPV vaccines. Before vaccination stops, however, we must ensure that all (silent) circulation of poliovirus within vaccine recipients is terminated. Poliovirus infections in vaccinated recipients are hard to detect, since none of these people will develop any clinical signs. It is for this reason that the absence of clinical cases induced by poliovirus in a vaccinated population can never serve as compelling evidence of poliovirus eradication. More sensitive tools must be developed to ensure that poliovirus transmission is halted in the vaccinated population. We were able to detect poliovirus-specific IgA in young IPV-vaccinated children, indicating that they have never been in contact with live poliovirus. This is a clear indication that we are on the right track towards the elimination of poliovirus from The Netherlands. We are only a short time away from a complete absence of poliomyelitis <b>outbreaks.</b> ?Summary 124 <b>References</b> 1. Conyn-van Spaendonck MAE, Geubbels ELPE, Suijkerbuijk AWM.
