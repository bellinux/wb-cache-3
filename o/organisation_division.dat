25|$|An {{alternative}} approach called analyzer-based imaging was first explored in 1995 by Viktor Ingal and Elena Beliaevskaya at the X-ray laboratory in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and by Tim Davis {{and colleagues at}} the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research <b>Organisation)</b> <b>Division</b> of Material Science and Technology in Clayton, Australia. This method uses a Bragg crystal as angular filter to reflect {{only a small part}} of the beam fulfilling the Bragg condition onto a detector. Important contributions to the progress of this method have been made by a US collaboration of the research teams of Dean Chapman, Zhong Zhong and William Thomlinson, for example the extracting of an additional signal caused by ultra-small angle scattering and the first CT image made with analyzer-based imaging. An alternative to analyzer-based imaging, which provides equivalent results without requiring the use of a crystal, was developed by Alessandro Olivo and co-workers at the Elettra synchrotron in Trieste, Italy. This method, called “edge-illumination”, operates a fine selection on the X-ray direction by using the physical edge of the detector pixels themselves, hence the name. Later on Olivo, in collaboration with Robert Speller at University College London, adapted the method for use with conventional X-ray sources, opening the way to translation into clinical and other applications. Peter Munro (from the University of Western Australia) substantially contributed to the development of the lab-based approach, by demonstrating that it imposes practically no coherence requirements and that, this notwithstanding, it still is fully quantitative.|$|E

40|$|Effect of Local Management of Schools, {{which was}} {{introduced}} by Education Reform Act 1988 in England and Wales, upon school management shall be examined, drawing upon empirical evidence at secondary schools. A particular methodology concerning policy study underlies the examination. While rejecting a linear conception of policy, the methodological position views legislation as but one aspect of continual {{process in which the}} locii of powers are constantly shifting as the various resources implicit and explicit in texts are recontextualized and employed in the struggle to maintain or change views of schooling. It requires us to focus on how educational stakeholders interprete legislation and reconcile it with their own values. Hence a whole grasp of policy change with reference to conflict and compromise between different values at practitioners' site as well as political arena. Witnessed are enforced hierarchy in management <b>organisation,</b> <b>division</b> of duties and responsibility, changes in role requirements and closely involvement of school governors with senior management team which leads to widening separation between senior management and the others at school. Argumentation is provided that the separation reflects value conflict between rational management value and teaching professional value. Lastly the problem of bureacracy in school management is situated within a whole theoretical framework which conceptualizes three components of value concerning LMS. Those ideal types are rational management, competitive market principle and teacher professionalism. Insight into those interactions enbodied by conflict and compromise will shed light on reserch into LMS as policy...|$|E

Because of this local government has been described as having a Cinderalla framework. 2 In the <b>organisation</b> <b>division</b> legislation deals with areas, names, the corporate body, the council, members, meetings, committees. Provisions on these matters vary unnecessarily between the five main local areas. 3 Legislation on personnel is spread over numerous enactments. Even with such detailed provisions there is no certainty that the best person will be selected. However, since 1922 a local government service has developed. 4 The complex, piecemeal and not easily accessable legislation leaves the members relying on the managers 2 ̆ 7 policy leadership. 5 In the area of finance failure to update the valuation law resulted in the Supreme Court deoision in finding the collection of rates on agricultural land unconstitutional. 6.

The English system, from which Irish local government originated, has been rationalised. Unlike Ireland, the courts intervene increasingly both in disputes between local authorities and between local and central government. 8. In Ireland since 1922, although some changes were made - rural district councils were abolished, the Local Appointments Commission was established, the management system was introduced and some statutes were up-dated - no effort has been made to deal comprehensively with local government legislation. 9.

40|$|Extract] The {{project was}} {{developed}} {{in response to a}} request to ACIAR from the Vietnamese Government for collaborative research to help improve the productivity of soybean and expand production in Vietnam. Most of the soybeans produced in Vietnam are used for human food, and projected production was not enough to meet increasing demands for vegetable oil and for high protein meal for livestock. Average soybean yields in Vietnam in the early 1990 s were very low, only about 0. 7 tonne/hectare, and made the crop unprofitable and unattractive to farmers. The government was keen to make soybean a more attractive crop, to expand production and reduce the national reliance on imports. As a legume, increasing the use of soybeans in rotations also improves the nitrogen economy and sustainability of cropping systems. The technical objectives of the project were to help the Vietnamese Government to increase soybean productivity by identifying more attractive varieties, and by developing and promoting good agronomic practices. Improving the knowledge and skills of researchers was also a specific objective. The strategy for achieving these objectives was to share improved, tropically adapted soybean germplasm, and agronomic and breeding experience in the tropics, which had been developed through two previous ACIAR projects in Thailand. The project established formal links between key agencies responsible for soybean improvement research and development (R&D) in Vietnam: the Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Science (VAAS), the Institute of Agricultural Science of South Vietnam, and Thai Nguyen University of Agriculture and Forestry (TNUAF) with, in Australia, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research <b>Organisation</b> <b>Division</b> of Plant Industry (CPI) and James Cook University (JCU). Additional informal links were established when the project started with the Hanoi Agricultural University (HAU), the Research Institute of Oil and Oil Plants and Can Tho University...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The paper {{examines}} {{the key issues}} experienced in recruiting and retaining practice involvement in a large complex intervention trial in Australian General Practice. Methods Reflective notes made by research staff and telephone interviews with staff from general practices which expressed interest, took part or withdrew from a trial of a complex general practice intervention. Results Recruitment and retention difficulties were due to factors inherent in the demands and context of general practice, the degree of engagement of primary care <b>organisations</b> (<b>Divisions</b> of General Practice), perceived benefits by practices, {{the design of the}} trial and the timing and complexity of data collection. Conclusion There needs to be clearer articulation to practices of the benefits of the research to participants and streamlining of the design and processes of data collection and intervention to fit in with their work practices. Ultimately deeper engagement may require additional funding and ongoing participation through practice research networks. Trial Registration Current Controlled Trials ACTRN 12605000788673 </p...|$|R
