5|$|Vice President Sherman {{had been}} renominated at Chicago; seriously ill during the campaign, he died six {{days before the}} election, and was {{replaced}} on the ticket {{by the president of}} Columbia University, Nicholas Murray Butler. But few electors chose Taft and Butler, who won only Utah and Vermont, for a total of eight electoral votes. Roosevelt won 88, and Wilson 435. Wilson won though he had only a plurality of the popular vote and less <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> Taft and Roosevelt combined. Taft had hoped to better Roosevelt in the popular vote, but finished with just under 3.5 million, over 600,000 less than the former president. Taft was not on the ballot in California, due to the actions of local Progressives, nor in South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech {{was about to be}} upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> Dodd.|$|E

25|$|However, these {{advantages}} held {{within them}} disadvantages. First, since a note has no intrinsic value, {{there was nothing}} to stop issuing authorities from printing more <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> they had specie to back it with. Second, because it increased the money supply, it increased inflationary pressures, a fact observed by David Hume in the 18th century. The result is that paper money would often lead to an inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a standing army. For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility in Europe and America. It was also addictive, since the speculative profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations established mints to print money and mint coins, and branches of their treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.|$|E
25|$|Airtemp {{was more}} {{sophisticated}} and efficient than the complicated rival air conditioners of 1953. It recirculated, rather than merely cooled, the air inside the vehicle, {{and it was also}} the highest capacity unit available on an automobile. It was also simple to operate, with a single switch on the dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions, which the driver selected as desired. The system was capable of cooling a Chrysler from 120 degrees to 85 degrees in about two minutes, and of completely eliminating humidity, dust, pollen and tobacco smoke at the same time. Since it relied on fresh air, and drew in sixty percent more <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> any contemporary system, Airtemp avoided the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. It was silent and unobtrusive. Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the package shelf as on GM and on other cars, small ducts directed cool air toward the ceiling of the car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.|$|E

Gregory Kirschling of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B minus, saying [...] "Saw II is just barely a better B flick than Saw" [...] and that both films are [...] "more clever and revolting than they are actually chilling". He praised Bell's performance as Jigsaw, saying [...] "As the droopy-lidded maniac in the flesh, Tobin Bell is, for all the film's gewgaws, Saw II sturdiest horror, a Terence Stamp look-alike who calls to mind a seedy General Zod lazily overseeing the universe from his evildoer's lair". [...] He ended his review: [...] "Where Saw II lags behind in Saw's novelty, it takes the lead with its smoother landing, which is again primed to blow the movie wide open, but manages a more compelling job <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> the original's cheat finish".|$|E
500|$|While at King's College, Slotin {{distinguished}} {{himself as}} an amateur boxer by winning the college's amateur bantamweight boxing championship. Later, he gave {{the impression that he}} had fought for the Spanish Republic and trained to fly a fighter with the Royal Air Force. Author Robert Jungk recounted in his book , the first published account of the Manhattan Project, that Slotin [...] "had volunteered for service in the Spanish Civil War, more {{for the sake of the}} thrill <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> on political grounds. He had often been in extreme danger as an anti-aircraft gunner." [...] During an interview years later, Sam stated that his brother had gone [...] "on a walking tour in Spain", and he [...] "did not take part in the war" [...] as previously thought. Slotin earned a Ph.D. degree in physical chemistry from the university in 1936. He won a prize for his thesis entitled [...] "An Investigation into the Intermediate Formation of Unstable Molecules During some Chemical Reactions." [...] Afterwards, he spent six months working as a special investigator for Dublin's Great Southern Railways, testing the Drumm nickel-zinc rechargeable batteries used on the Dublin–Bray line.|$|E
500|$|Celebration {{received}} {{a score of}} 84/100 at Metacritic, indicating [...] "universal acclaim" [...] from music critics. Sarah Crompton from The Daily Telegraph gave the collection {{four out of five}} stars and said: [...] "Madonna's Celebration shows just how consistently she delivers the goods, with tracks such as 'Music', 'Ray of Light', 'Frozen' and 'Don't Tell Me'", with [...] "only a couple of [...] which feel dispensable." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the compilation four out of five stars and commented that [...] "functionally, what Madonna and fans are really celebrating with the release of Celebration is the hard proof that Madonna's back catalogue is now so immense and so varied that she can release a behemoth, two-disc greatest hits package that shoehorns in 36 songs and still manages to significantly short-change the singer's legacy", though also noticing that [...] "the album is missing songs, doesn't always include the right ones, [...] seems to have been sequenced by a not particularly intuitive Genius playlist." [...] Tim Sendra from AllMusic praised that [...] "the collection does a fine job of living up to the title— it's certainly a celebration of Madonna's career and includes some of the most celebratory and thrilling pop music ever created." [...] While reviewing the double-disc deluxe edition version of the album, he commented: [...] "The 34-track double-disc Deluxe Edition has an easier time <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> the single-disc 18-track release does."

500|$|One of {{the major}} criticisms of the game stemmed from a {{disparity}} between the emotional thrust {{of the story and}} the actions of the player, with GameTrailers' Justin Speer pointing out that while the story attempted to characterise Lara Croft as vulnerable and uncomfortable with killing, the player was encouraged to engage enemies aggressively and use brutal tactics to earn more experience points. Speer felt that this paradoxical approach ultimately let the game down as it undermined Lara's character {{to the point where he}} found it difficult to identify with her at all. IGN's Keza MacDonald also highlighted the issue, but was less critical <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> Speer, pointing out that both Lara and the player had to adapt quickly to killing in order to survive. However, Game Informers Matt Miller noted that the game offered the player several options for progressing through its combat situations, and that the player could avoid open conflict entirely if they chose to do so. He also praised the behaviour and presence of the enemies for the way they felt like they had actual tasks to perform on the island, rather than being clusters of polygons whose only function was to be killed by the player in order for them to progress. While on the subject of character development, GamesRadar's Ryan Taljonick expressed that the supporting characters were underdeveloped relative to Lara Croft, describing them as [...] "pretty generic characters who, while rarely annoying, just aren't memorable".|$|E
500|$|Wings was an {{immediate}} success upon release and became the yardstick for which aviation films were measured against, in terms of [...] "authenticity of combat and scope of production". One {{of the reasons for}} its resounding popularity was the public infatuation with aviation in the wake of Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight. The Air Corps who had supervised production expressed satisfaction with the end product. The critical response was equally enthusiastic and the film was widely praised for its realism and technical prowess, despite a superficial plot, [...] "an aviation picnic" [...] as Gene Brown called it. The combat scenes of the film were so realistic that one writer studying the film in the early 1970s was wondering if Wellman had used actual imagery of planes crashing to earth during World War I. One critic observed: [...] "The exceptional quality of Wings lies in its appeal as a spectacle and as a picture of {{at least some of the}} actualities of flying under wartime conditions." [...] Another wrote: [...] "Nothing in the line of war pictures ever has packed a greater proportion of real thrills into an equal footage. As a spectacle, Wings is a technical triumph. It piles punch upon punch until the spectator is almost nervously exhausted". Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times praised the cinematography of the flying scenes and the direction and acting of the entire cast in his review dated August 13, 1927. Hall notes only two criticisms, one slight on Richard Arlen's performance and of the ending, which he described as [...] "like so many screen stories, much too sentimental, and there is far more <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> one wants." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Independent, Cathy Pryor declared, [...] "Louis Theroux is out-oddballed {{this week}} by {{the subject of his}} latest {{documentary}} ... Astonishingly, Theroux makes you feel some sympathy for them and the price they pay for being the way they are." [...] Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent posited that viewers were [...] "... wondering, after an hour, whether the Phelps hadn't got a bit more out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> Louis. They aren't representative of anything but themselves, after all, and they rejoice in the world's detestation. So they had nothing to lose by being held up to ridicule, and gained exactly what they want – a bigger audience for their insane rantings." [...] Writing for The Daily Record, Paul English wrote favorably, [...] "The journalist in me marvels at yet more great work from Theroux. But the human in me mourns that we gave this appalling family exactly what they want. The shiny badge of notoriety..." [...] A review in the Irish Independent was critical of giving any coverage to the group, [...] "Theroux tried to get the teenage daughters to deviate from the standard family line but they weren't budging an inch. The end result was that a group of loathsome people who spend every second of their lives trying to attract free publicity for themselves got a whole hour of it courtesy of the BBC. Ah, the joys of public service television." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kathryn Flett was critical of the choice of title for the documentary, commenting, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America? Says who? Louis Theroux? BBC2? Ooh, I don't like a sweeping statement of a documentary title. Not that the family who comprise the majority of the 71 congregants of the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, aren't appalling, but the title definitely infers that they are the family most hated by most Americans, when I doubt most Americans have the faintest idea who they are." [...] Mike Bradley of The Observer commented about the film, [...] "A shock doc, but an easy target for Theroux." ...|$|E

Kirkwood also cast doubt on Lane's claim that the jury believed there was a conspiracy.
