A standard in-service inspection program is implemented for each tower, including visual examination, topographic measurements and surface mapping of the shell. Monitoring <b>outputs</b> <b>feed</b> <b>data</b> bases which are used to compare, rank and build a maintenance plan over its buildings fleet. This paper focuses on monitoring techniques used by EDF for its draft cooling towers fleet and on the subsequent data analysis to support maintenance and repair strategies. Some outcomes from recent development program concerning advanced data management techniques are also presented. The conclusion deals with further needs to improve EDF’s current practices...|$|R

30|$|The {{data mining}} engine {{starts with a}} {{specified}} business objective, and retrieves its associated feature labels from the objective_label table. For a feature label or a set of feature labels, the fusion planning engine is to discover and schedule a sequence of algorithms in the algorithm pool triggered by the feature label(s). The <b>data</b> <b>attribute</b> discovery engine checks if the <b>data</b> <b>attributes</b> required by the triggered algorithms are contained in the dataset pool. If yes, <b>data</b> <b>attributes</b> are fused from different datasets as the input of the triggered algorithm. If not, unfound <b>data</b> <b>attribute(s)</b> are regarded as feature label(s), the above process is recursively repeated until all <b>data</b> <b>attributes</b> are directly found or indirectly created by applying for data fusion algorithm(s). Each triggered algorithm is associated with its required <b>data</b> <b>attributes</b> as its input and the <b>data</b> <b>attributes</b> are associated with datasets in the dataset pool. As a result, a sequence of algorithms is retrieved and scheduled for execution.|$|R

The core of the Swiss <b>Feed</b> <b>Data</b> Warehouse is a carefully curated data warehouse with more than 2 million chemical analyses of 600 feed types and 400 nutrients. The nutrient measurements are enriched with geographical (as postal code and altitude), temporal (as harvesting and analyses dates), biological (as variety and botanical composition) and technical infor-mation (as conservation and production methods). We propose a solution that offers to users a fast, effective and intuitive approach to query and analyze large amounts of high dimensional <b>feed</b> <b>data.</b> An interactive web-application enables dynamic query construc-tion and offers multiple charts to visualize <b>feed</b> <b>data.</b> Techniques such as radius search and charts allow non-expert users to detect local correlations and trends in the <b>feed</b> <b>data.</b> Historical information {{makes it possible for}} advanced users to analyze changes in the feed quality and determine the balance of nutrients in feed mixes that minimizes the load of severe nutrients from animal excreta into ecosystems...|$|R
