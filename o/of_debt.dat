They get into financial problems which often end in several current executory proceedings. For debtors this situation is apparently hopeless and many of them try to solve it by using bridging loans. This leads to deepening of their personal financial crisis. The Insolvency Act No. 182 / 2006 Sb. which contains the regulation of the Discharge <b>of</b> <b>Debts</b> brings a solution for such debtors.
