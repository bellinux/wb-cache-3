Our duties were to do light work, {{in the way of}} repairing damages; and the captain, understanding that we were both accustomed to fire-arms, gave us a musket a-piece, with orders to blaze away as soon as they began the work below. As we had both stood fire once, we thought ourselves veterans, and proceeded to our stations, smiling and nodding to each other as we went up the rigging. Of the two, my station was the best, since I could see the approach of the brig, the mizen-top-sail offering but little <b>obstruction</b> <b>to</b> <b>vision</b> after she got near; whereas the main-top-sail was a perfect curtain, so far as poor Rupert was concerned. In the way of danger, there was not much difference as to any of the stations on board, the bulwarks of the ship being little more than plank that would hardly stop a musket-ball; and then the French had a reputation for firing into the rigging.|$|E

The ASOS program is a joint effort of the National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Defense (DOD).

ASOS was especially designed {{for the safety of the}} aviation community, therefore the sites are almost always located near airport runways. The system transmits routine hourly observations along with special observations when conditions exceed aviation weather thresholds (e.g. conditions change from visual meteorological conditions to instrument meteorological conditions). The basic weather elements observed are: sky condition, visibility, present weather, <b>obstructions</b> <b>to</b> <b>vision,</b> pressure, temperature, dew point, wind direction and speed, precipitation accumulation, and selected significant remarks.

40|$|Purpose: To {{introduce}} {{and describe}} two methods of grading {{the severity of}} infantile cataracts, and thereby propose a useful clinical guide for early surgical intervention. Methods: Thirty-three subjects, aged 1 week to 8 years, participated in the study. Twenty-two were evaluated soon after birth (1 week), and 11 in childhood (3 – 8 years). All had isolated infantile cataracts, of which 16 were bilateral and 17 unilateral. Nine cataract types were examined; nuclear (n = 9), lamellar (n = 9), posterior lenticonus (n = 4), persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (n = 4), posterior polar (n = 3) and single cases of total, cortical, sutural and anterior polar. Grading the infantile cataracts was performed subjectively based on the cataract morphology, density and position using an 11 -point (0 – 10) ordinal scale. Objective measures of the cataracts were performed by scanning and then digitising photo-slit lamp images to provide cataract intensity profiles. Subjects without cataracts acted as controls. Results: Subjective gradings of 0 and 10 {{were assigned to the}} clear, cataract-free lens and the total cataract, respectively. Fixed grades of 1 (anterior polar, sutural) and 6 (posterior polar) were assigned to the three remaining cataracts with static morphologies. The five cataracts which were all progressive were given grading ranges, reflecting the initial and likely final morphological states. Objective measures were found to be valuable in indicating the exact position and relative density of the cataract, as well as accurately defining boundaries. Conclusions: The magnitude and severity of infantile cataracts can be usefully characterised by an 11 -point ordinal subjective grading scale. Although subjective grading alone is satisfactory, it can be greatly assisted by objective measures, particularly in the documentation of cataract progression. Cataracts assigned grades 1 – 4 were considered minor <b>obstructions</b> <b>to</b> <b>vision</b> and therefore not candidates for early surgery. Cataracts graded 5 and above were considered major visual defects, and ideally should be removed early in life...|$|R

In 1948, the site had been used to mine pottery clay, and was considered very remote - being {{at the end of a}} dirt road through market gardens. [...] It was long after the house was finished that the surrounding streets were paved and developed as a residential suburb.|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the potential for}} low-speed modes to improve transit access, a field test has been designed that will offer shared-use Segway Human Transporters (HT), electric bicycles, and bicycles linked to a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District station and surrounding employment centers. Because of safety concerns, research was conducted {{to better understand the}} risks associated with these modes and potential risk factors. First, a review of the safety literature indicates that user error is the major cause of low-speed mode crashes and significant risk factors are poor surface conditions and <b>obstructions</b> <b>to</b> drivers' <b>vision.</b> As a result, an extensive training program and carefully selected routes have been included in the field test. Second, the regulatory and legislative history of the HT is chronicled to understand how concerns about its interaction with pedestrians have produced legislation that includes specific safety requirements. The low-speed modes used in this project will be equipped with safety devices and participants will be required to wear helmets. Third, the results of a survey of thirteen HT implementation projects provide insight into potential advantages and challenges to the HT field test. Fourth, results of interviews and meetings with field test stakeholders are presented with a discussion of their influence on the field test design. For example, participants will be required to walk the low speed modes at BART to avoid potential conflicts during crowded station conditions. Finally, conclusions and future steps in the project are discussed. UCD-ITS-RR- 04 - 26, Civil Engineering...|$|R

Seidler also explains same principle for three-dimensional spatial arrangement as highly influenced by Theo Van Doesburg's painting [...] "Space, Time, ConstructIon #3" [...] (1923) : [...] "Architecture in recent times has been immensely concerned about this idiom of the exploitation of the interior space which involves this simultaneous viewing of things, the channeling of vistas between its elements. ….As Le Corbusier has said, “Instead of the eye and the mind being abruptly halted by edges and containing surfaces, as had {{been the case in}} the past, they are now laid continuously on an exploration, never quite comprehending the mystery of layered and veiled space”. Seidler says of the design for his Gissing House: [...] "in three dimensions, the fact that the eye is always tempted to look beyond and never quite experiencing it all. There is a temptation with the seeing of things that are not entirely apparent, the tantalising sense of the beyond which you in fact are denied and which entices a person to move through and try and explore an interior." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} a {{detailed}} analysis of the problem of imposing a topological bundle structure on a spherical fibre space over a simply connected base. The method involves a careful study of the notion of fibre homotopy transversality due to N. Levitt. The point is, a topological disc bundle satisfies strong transversality properties for maps from manifolds to the associated Thorn space. These pro-perties can be formulated at least for spherical fibre spaces. Thus, <b>obstructions</b> <b>to</b> transversality can be interpreted as <b>obstructions</b> <b>to</b> imposing a topological bundle structure on a spherical fibre space.
