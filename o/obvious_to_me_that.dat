5|$|It is very <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{you must}} remove Sir George Prevost. I see {{he has gone}} to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly {{the best of their}} rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E
25|$|As for the Hellenes, {{it seems}} <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{ever since they}} came into {{existence}} they have always used the same language. They were weak at first, when they were separated from the Pelasgians, but they grew from a small group into a multitude, especially when many peoples, including other barbarians in great numbers, had joined them. Moreover, I {{do not think the}} Pelasgian, who remained barbarians, ever grew appreciably in number or power.|$|E

The singer released {{a statement saying that}} she was inspired by their work, adding that [...] "it was <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had to get involved and {{be part of the solution}} to help Detroit recover". Continuing to extend her business ventures, the singer premiered MDNA Skin in 2014, a range of skin care products in Tokyo, Japan; the products were later launched in the United States in late 2017. In October 2016, Billboard named Madonna its Woman of the Year. Her [...] "blunt and brutally honest" [...] speech at the ceremony received widespread coverage in the media. Her upcoming projects include co-writing and directing a film adaptation of Andrew Sean Greer's novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Tentatively titled Loved, the film would portray the protagonist's relationship with her gay twin brother Felix.|$|E

[...] In it, she wrote [...] "..i {{would like to}} say i am sincerely sorry. it is <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now <b>that</b> you were right - all those who said we can't in good conscience go to that place and support it or look past for one moment what it deeply represents. i needed a wake up call and you gave it to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|With {{respect to}} the first, I am no optimist, but I have the firmest belief that the Divine Government (if we may use such a phrase to express {{the sum of the}} [...] "customs of matter") is wholly just The more I know intimately of the lives of other men (to say nothing of my own), the more <b>obvious</b> it is <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the wicked does not {{flourish}} nor is the righteous punished. But for this to be clear we must bear in mind what almost all forget, that the rewards of life are contingent upon obedience to the whole Law--physical as well as moral--and that moral obedience will not atone for physical sin, or vice versa.|$|R
5000|$|Encouraged by her {{editor in}} Hattiesburg, {{she moved to}} New Orleans in 1951 {{to work for the}} former New Orleans States-Item newspaper, an {{afternoon}} daily. She was not the first woman journalist in visible positions in New Orleans, for at least two others had preceded her in such work. Walter G. Cowan (c. 1911-2010), her boss at The States-Item, described her as a [...] "natural reporter. It was <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> right off <b>that</b> she had the ability to talk to people and retain their confidence, even though she had to ask embarrassing questions. It's {{the kind of thing that}} rattles new reporters, but she always kept her composure." [...] One of her States-Item colleagues, Jack Wardlaw, became in 1980 the Baton Rouge bureau chief for The Times-Picayune, a year after Kelso had moved to The Times-Picayune.|$|R

2500|$|In 1994 the Montgomery Advertiser {{published}} an eight-part critical {{report on the}} SPLC, saying that it exaggerated {{the threat posed by}} the Klan and similar groups in order to raise money, discriminated against black employees, and used misleading fundraising tactics. The SPLC dismissed the series as a [...] "hatchet job". SPLC's co-founder Joe Levin stated: [...] "The Advertiser's lack of interest in the center's programs and its obsessive interest in the center's financial affairs and Mr. Dees' personal life makes it <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the Advertiser simply wants to smear the center and Mr. Dees." ...|$|E
2500|$|Development on the Hurd {{began in}} 1990 after an {{abandoned}} kernel attempt in 1986, {{based on the}} research TRIX operating system developed by Professor Steve Ward and his group at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS). According to Thomas Bushnell, the initial Hurd architect, their early plan was to adapt the 4.4BSD-Lite kernel and, in hindsight, [...] "It is now perfectly <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this would have succeeded splendidly and {{the world would be}} a very different place today". In 1987 Richard Stallman proposed using the Mach microkernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University. Work on this was delayed for three years due to uncertainty over whether CMU would release the Mach code under a suitable license.|$|E

My wife, Diane, who is an accomplished scientist and an amazing life partner and mother, and my 3 remarkable daughters—Kristin, Sarah, and Mary—are truly the wind beneath my wings. It is their flexibility and gracious spirits <b>that</b> free <b>me</b> <b>to</b> serve and enable <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be effective on your behalf. I am grateful for them and so pleased they could be here in Boston with me for conference this year. Now, I invite you to take a short trip down memory lane with <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a time when I was a student physical therapist volunteering for a week at Muscular Dystrophy Association summer camp. It was a great experience to live with and assist a few young men with Duchenne muscular dystrophy for a week. I captured a glimpse of the effort and struggles associated with being a care provider for wonderful people with extraordinary needs. This perspective helped influence the way I looked at the material learned during my schooling.

6000|$|Whoso clearly appreciates {{all that}} is implied in the falling of a stone can have no {{difficulty}} about any doctrine simply on account of its marvellousness. But the longer I live, the more <b>obvious</b> it is <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the most sacred act of a man's life is to say and to feel, [...] "I believe such and such to be true." [...] All the greatest rewards and all the heaviest penalties of existence cling about that act The universe is {{one and the same}} throughout; and if the condition of my success in unravelling some little difficulty of anatomy or physiology is that I shall rigorously refuse to put faith in that which does not rest on sufficient evidence, I cannot believe that the great mysteries of existence will be laid open <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on other terms.|$|R
500|$|By 4:00 in {{the morning}} the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or {{gathered}} nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be [...] "electricity in the air". One commented: [...] "There was a certain beauty {{in the aftermath of the}} riot... It was <b>obvious,</b> at least <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> a lot of people really were gay and, you know, this was our street." [...] Thirteen people had been arrested. Some in the crowd were hospitalized, and four police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken. Inspector Pine had intended to close and dismantle the Stonewall Inn that night. Pay phones, toilets, mirrors, jukeboxes, and cigarette machines were all smashed, possibly in the riot and possibly by the police.|$|R
2500|$|In {{its early}} release in the United States, many American critics {{dismissed}} Fires on the Plain as a gratuitously bleak anti-war film. In 1963, The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther gave the film a quite harsh description, writing [...] "Never have I seen a more grisly and physically repulsive film than Fires on the Plain." [...] He continued, [...] "So purposefully putrid is it, {{so full of}} degradation and death... that I doubt if anyone can sit through it without becoming a little bit ill... That's how horrible it is." [...] He notes however, [...] "this {{is a tribute to}} its maker, for it is perfectly <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Kon Ichikawa, the director, intended it to be a brutally realistic contemplation of one aspect of war." [...] He points out, [...] "...with all the horror in it, there are snatches of poetry, too..." [...] He ends the review commenting that the only audience who would enjoy the film were those with bitter memories towards the Japanese held over from World War II.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the opinion}} of George Martin, [...] "At that stage 'Please Please Me' was a very dreary song. It was like a Roy Orbison number, very slow, bluesy vocals. It was <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it badly needed pepping up. I told them to bring it in next time and we'd have another go at it." [...] He asked the Beatles to {{consider}} making major changes to it, including increasing its tempo. By {{the time it was}} brought back into the studio on 26 November 1962, its arrangement had been radically altered, and it took 18 takes to record what George Martin immediately predicted would be their first major hit. Paul McCartney in Anthology stated: [...] "We sang it and George Martin said, 'Can we change the tempo?' We said, 'What's that?' He said, 'Make it a bit faster. Let me try it.' And he did. We thought, 'Oh, that's all right, yes.' Actually, we were a bit embarrassed that he had found a better tempo than we had." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kahlo's bedrest {{was over}} by late 1927, {{and she began}} socializing with her old school friends, who were now at {{university}} and involved in student politics. She joined the Mexican Communist Party (PCM) and was introduced to a circle of political activists and artists — including the exiled Cuban communist Julio Antonio Mella, and the Italian-American photographer Tina Modotti. At one of Modotti's parties in June 1928, Kahlo was introduced to Diego Rivera, one of Mexico's most successful artists and a notable figure in PCM. They had met briefly in 1922, when he was painting a mural at her school. Shortly after their introduction in 1928, Kahlo asked him to judge whether her paintings showed enough talent for her {{to pursue a career}} as an artist. Rivera recalled being impressed by her works, stating that they showed, [...] "an unusual energy of expression, precise delineation of character, and true severity ... They had a fundamental plastic honesty, and an artistic personality of their own ... It was <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this girl was an authentic artist".|$|E

"From the first, two {{facts were}} very <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the one <b>that</b> the lady {{had been quite}} willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it {{within a few minutes}} of {{returning}} home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter." ...|$|R

60|$|It was <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> my companion's {{mind was}} now made {{up about the}} case, {{although}} what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again {{in a few minutes}} dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{these people}} were almost in {{rebellion}} against their strange ruler, whose power over them was of a purely moral nature, one that emanated from her personality alone. What I wondered was, being what she seemed to be, why she thought it worth while to exercise it at all. Then I remembered her statement that here and nowhere else she must abide for some secret reason, until a certain mystical gentleman with a Greek name came to fetch her away from this appointed rendezvous. Therefore I supposed she had no choice, or rather, suffering as she did from hallucinations, believed herself to have no choice and was obliged {{to put up with}} a crowd of disagreeable savages in quarters which were sadly out of repair.|$|E

Some other substance--amber, we will say, or ivory--would be chosen as a medium for barter, and gold would be inferior to brass, as being heavier and yet not so hard. No one would be the better for such a consummation as that. Now, if I retained my secret, and used it with wisdom, I might make myself the greatest benefactor to mankind that has ever lived.

60|$|I {{had been}} {{accustomed}} to seeing gunshot wounds, and possessed such a general knowledge of their effects as to be a tolerable judge of what would, and what would not, be likely to prove fatal. The first look I took at the hurt of Chainbearer convinced me {{there could be no}} hope for his life. The ball had passed between two of the ribs, and seemed to me to take a direction downward; but it was impossible to miss the vitals with a wound commencing at that point on the human body. The first shock of the injury had produced insensibility; but we had hardly got the sufferer on the bed, and applied a little water to his lips, ere he revived; soon regaining his consciousness, as well as the power to speak. Death was on him, however; and it was very <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> his hours were numbered. He might live days, but it was not possible for him to survive.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, Watson," [...] he {{explained}} {{in the early hours}} of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, [...] "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he had some strong motive for securing the situation." ...|$|E

"A lamp, burning under a {{shade of}} ground-glass, showed a {{handsome}} apartment, wainscoted with oak; supper was {{laid on the}} table; by the fire-place, standing as if waiting our entrance, appeared a lady; she was young, tall, and well shaped; her dress was handsome and fashionable: so much my first glance sufficed to ascertain. A gay salutation passed between her and Mr. Crimsworth; she chid him, half playfully, half poutingly, for being late; her voice (I always take voices into the account in judging of character) was lively--it indicated, I thought, good animal spirits. Mr. Crimsworth soon checked her animated scolding with a kiss--a kiss that still told of the bridegroom (they {{had not yet been}} married a year); she took her seat at the supper-table in first-rate spirits. Perceiving me, she begged my pardon for not noticing me before, and then shook hands with me, as ladies do when a flow of good-humour disposes them to be cheerful to all, even the most indifferent of their acquaintance. It was now further <b>obvious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she had a good complexion, and features sufficiently marked but agreeable; her hair was red--quite red. She and Edward talked much, always in a vein of playful contention; she was vexed, or pretended to be vexed, that he had that day driven a vicious horse in the gig, and he made light of her fears. Sometimes she appealed to me.|$|E
