Kurikulum 2013 legally replaced KTSP that had been applied since 2006. This curiculum has strenght and weakness. Based on the results of research, Kurikulum 2013 is quite right on target. Nevertheless, there are still found some problems associated with the change of KTSP 2006 to Kurikulum 2013 policy in SMA 1 Kesatrian 1 Semarang such as the facilities that are still less in number, the teachers that still use the old method of teaching and there are many classes which teachers are absent yet the students are not given a substitute task.

The advices from this research are school needs to tightnen the rules not only for students but also for teacher and school needs to provide wifi as a facilities...|$|R
