5|$|Early {{settlement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> islands led {{to major}} changes to local ecosystems and many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species. Ancient Hawaiians brought foreign plants and animals, and their arrival {{was associated with}} increased rates of erosion.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Hawaiians {{were the}} first to {{recognize}} the increasing age and weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands. The volatile state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology, embodied in Pele, the deity of volcanoes. After the arrival of Europeans on the island, in 1880–1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot's volcanics, confirming the relationship long observed by the natives. 1912 marked the founding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands. In the 1970s, a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaii's seafloor.|$|E

5|$|After the war, <b>the</b> {{military}} service <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiians,</b> including James Wood Bush and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from <b>the</b> collective memories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Civil War and <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Hawaii. However, in recent years, Hawaiian residents, historians, and descendants <b>of</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> combatants in <b>the</b> conflict have {{insisted on the}} need to remember <b>the</b> legacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> who fought.

5|$|Fausto's {{remnants}} passed north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Islands uneventfully {{until they}} interacted with a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) on August 30. In combination with warm waters, a tropical depression with some subtropical features developed. At {{this time it}} was located around latitude 30°N. By September 1, Fausto had redeveloped into a tiny but tropical ministorm. Its rebirth was brief, however, as a mid-latitude cyclone absorbed the system early on September 3.|$|E

500|$|When news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Laie Hawaii Temple reached Native Hawaiian {{converts}} (and other Polynesians) living {{far from}} home in <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> Iosepa, Utah, many decided to emigrate back to Hawaii. [...] Although <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> had lived in Iosepa since 1889, the closest temple, Salt Lake Temple, was 75 {{miles away from the}} colony. [...] Moving to Laie gave <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> <b>the</b> ability to be closer to the new temple and allowed them to perform sacred ordinances without having to travel great distances. [...] By January 1917, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiians</b> returned home, leaving Iosepa a ghost town.|$|R

5|$|Passing north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Islands, the {{remnants}} of the hurricane later began to revive, and had re-developed into a tropical depression on August30. Additional re-intensification was not significant, although Fausto managed to become a tropical storm again on September1. Remaining a minimal tropical storm, no further intensification occurred, and by September3, Fausto was absorbed by a frontal system.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts {{are often}} found in groupings or {{submerged}} archipelagos, a classic example being the Emperor Seamounts, an extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Islands. Formed {{millions of years ago}} by volcanism, they have since subsided far below sea level. This long chain of islands and seamounts extends thousands of kilometers northwest from the island of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{tropical}} cyclone to form or enter the central Pacific was first identified on September25 several hundred miles south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Islands. Traveling nearly due west, the storm attained an intensity of 50mph (85km/h) before weakening. By September27, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and later dissipated on September28 over open waters.|$|E

5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> – Emperor {{seamount chain}} reveals the hotspot {{as the center}} of a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E

5|$|As Fefa turned {{more to the}} west, it paralleled {{the cooler}} waters, {{allowing}} the eye to remain distinct as the hurricane remained well-organized. Despite moving over marginally warm sea surface temperatures and becoming involved with the Stratocumulus cloud field to its north, the hurricane restrengthened on August 4 to reach a secondary peak intensity of 105mph (170km/h) while located about 1,265miles (2,070km) east-southeast of Hilo, Hawai'i. After maintaining 105mph (170km/h) winds for about 18hours, Fefa weakened slightly due to increasing wind shear from a cold-core trough as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center area of responsibility. As the shear increased, the cyclone weakened more rapidly, and on August 6 it weakened to a tropical storm while located about 650miles (1,060km) east of the island of Hawaii. Initially, forecasters predicted Fefa {{to turn to the}} northwest to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Islands. However, the storm continued moving almost due westward as it steadily weakened. Aircraft reconnaissance flew into Fefa three times as it neared Hawaii. Late on August 7, Fefa weakened to a tropical depression a short distance of the island of Hawaii, and early on August 8 the depression began dissipating and degenerated into a tropical wave after moving onshore. The remnants tracked west-northwestward and passed south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Islands until dissipating on August 9 to the northwest of Kauai.|$|E
5|$|As Jimena passed {{south of}} Hawaii as a {{weakening}} tropical storm, it brought high winds and heavy rainfall to the island. High wind gusts of 53–58mph (85–93km/h) {{were reported in}} South Point and Kahoolawe. In Honolulu, a weather station reported winds of 36mph (58km/h) while a station in Kauai reported winds of 22mph (35km/h). The storm dropped 6–10inches of rain across the Big Island. In Glenwood, Hawaii, the storm dropped 8.43inches (214mm) of rain. The rainfall from Jimena helped reduce drought conditions across the Big Island. Coastal sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hawaiian</b> Islands reported high surf ranging from 11 to 15feet (3–5meters) high.|$|E

5|$|Christian Hedemann (1852–1932) {{counts as}} among the {{earliest}} Danish photographers who emigrated the farthest distance.

He became an American citizen in 1903 and in 1909 accepted an appointment as Danish Consul.
