In an extra verse in one version of ABBA's On and On and On, Humpty Dumpty is mentioned as being afraid of falling off the wall.|$|E
5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I Could Do It All <b>Over</b> <b>Again,</b> I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If I Could Do It All <b>Over</b> <b>Again...</b> but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} against New Zealand, Nitschke took 0/39 from nine <b>overs.</b> <b>Again</b> pushed up to open, she top-scored with 81 from as many balls, hitting 12 fours and a six to help {{set up a}} six-wicket win to take the competition. She has played as an opener since then.|$|R

5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test over and <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests {{from more than one}} publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must be kept in mind when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} {{stages of the}} Second World War, the bailey was {{levelled}} and used to hold a set of temporary Nissen huts that formed a hospital for United States Army personnel. In 1945, the site was leased by the Air Ministry for use as offices. The Ministry of Works took over the guardianship of the castle in 1951. The ministry {{put pressure on the}} Air Ministry to leave the site, which occurred in 1956; the bailey was then grassed <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> Archaeological excavations were carried out in the bailey between 1961 and 1982, uncovering many of the medieval buildings.|$|E
5|$|GamesRadar {{estimated}} {{that there are more}} than 80 hours of content available in the game. Villoria called the world engaging, and its replay value very high, as players can play the story over and <b>over</b> <b>again</b> with a different origin. Juba agreed, as did Yin-Poole, who added that the way companions react to the player's decisions, as well as the six origin stories, significantly expand the game's longevity.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{that the}} {{phenomenon}} {{occurring in the}} room is far older than the house, Jill theorizes that the stone tape can be recorded <b>over</b> <b>again</b> and again, like magnetic recording tape; the maid's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording. Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her from continuing her research.|$|E
5|$|The Red Army was {{scheduled}} to enter Lithuanian territory from three separate directions at 3:00 pm and had orders {{to take control of}} Vilnius, Kaunas, Raseiniai, Panevėžys, and Šiauliai. The Lithuanian Army was ordered not to resist and to extend friendly greetings; its air force was ordered to remain on the ground. The Soviets came in great numbers clogging Lithuanian roads. They had an obvious intention to show power and intimidate any resistance. Writer Ignas Šeinius claimed that he observed the same squadron of Soviet planes making the same flight over and <b>over</b> <b>again</b> to create an impression of much larger Soviet Air Forces.|$|E
5|$|The Season Four DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Michael comparing Toby to the flu, Toby giving his going-away speech and then being interrupted by Michael, Holly asking Pam if Kevin just ate before jumping in the bounce castle, Jim not sure whether Ryan is going to downsize him, Jim and Pam browsing for apartments online, the revelation that Kevin's band Scrantonicity played 30 full Police songs, all out of tune and off-beat, during Phyllis's wedding, Kelly watching Ryan's YouTube arrest video over and <b>over</b> <b>again</b> at Jim's desk, Jim asking about the website, Troy (Noel Potek)—Ryan's drug dealer—showing up in Scranton.|$|E

5|$|The Toy Story {{films and}} {{characters}} will always hold {{a very special}} place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology.

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, the world is trapped in a time loop, and only one woman, named Pam (Carrie Hamilton), seems to know. Each day the events that happen differ slightly. A bank robbery is committed over and <b>over</b> <b>again</b> until finally the eventual bombing of the building is prevented. Somehow, Mulder and Scully are trapped {{in the middle of}} it all.|$|E
5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage. In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated {{they would not have}} had children if they were able to do it <b>over</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

5|$|This {{same general}} {{area of the}} {{property}} was used also for the drying of the varnished fabric. This consisted of twenty foot high clothes line-type poles that were 100 feet apart and further protected by wind-break fences of canvas. Between the poles were strung wires for laying the wet varnished fabric onto for drying. After drying the fabric was then rewound onto rollers and varnished over and <b>over</b> <b>again</b> several more times to each side and thoroughly dried each time. Each application of new varnish added a thin layer.|$|E
5|$|A {{subdivision}} rule takes a tiling of {{the plane}} by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a tile type. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that {{are made up of}} polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called subdivision complexes for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide it over and <b>over</b> <b>again</b> to get a sequence of tilings.|$|E
5|$|After {{the airport}} opened, {{services}} started with Widerøe-operated twenty-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. The airline operated two trips Bodø–Røst–Værøy–Bodø on weekdays and one round trip during the weekend. In addition, {{there were two}} weekly trips that connected Værøy to Leknes Airport before returning to Bodø. The service was subsidized by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Widerøe replaced the Twin Otters with 37-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-8-100 Dash 8s in 1995. The route from Bodø to Røst was made subject to public service obligation from 1 April 1997, which was won by the incumbent, after beating Valdresfly and Helikopter Service in the auction. The following contract, valid from 1 April 2000, was awarded to Guard Air, but this company folded in 2001. Helikopter Service operated the route temporarily until Widerøe took it <b>over</b> <b>again</b> the same year.|$|E

She has played as an opener since then. Nitschke ended the series with 200 runs at 28.57. Her bowling was neither penetrative nor economical; she took seven wickets at 41.85 at an economy rate of 4.88.|$|R

5|$|First {{hinted at}} in December 1999, Resident Evil 4 {{underwent}} a long development {{time during which}} four proposed versions of the game were discarded. Initially developed for the PlayStation 2, the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami requested him {{to create a new}} entry in the Resident Evil series. Nevertheless, it was decided to start development <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> The game was intended to be a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but a PlayStation 2 version was announced before the game was released for the GameCube. Resident Evil 4 was subsequently released for Microsoft Windows, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and in downsized versions for iOS, Zeebo, and Android (exclusive to Samsung devices outside of Japan).|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for an interview}} with Splits Magazine, cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) demands that new cheerleader Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) lose ten pounds in a week. She reserves the school auditorium for cheer practice, so glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has to find the club a new rehearsal space. He visits a local roller rink where he finds former glee club member April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth), who tells him that she is the mistress of the wealthy eighty-year-old tycoon who owns the rink. Upon learning that Will is looking to sublet his apartment, April invites herself to visit. After spending the night sharing a bed, Will forbids April from staying <b>over</b> <b>again</b> and tells her she is worth more than being a mistress. April says she will break up with her tycoon.|$|E
5|$|Kingston had to {{genuinely}} slap Matt Smith {{several times}} in a scene because {{it was difficult to}} fake. Kingston recalled that after a few takes, Smith got red cheeked and grew frustrated at having to do the sequence over and <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> The Oval Office set was constructed at Upper Boat Studios in South Wales. Because the production crew had access to several pictures and plans of the real office, they were able to replicate it in almost every detail. The main problem for building the set was the plastering; the crew normally plaster one wall at a time for normal rooms, but because the Oval Office was round, they had to do the entire set at once. The American-style diner scene when the companions reunite with the Doctor in this episode is actually located in Cardiff Bay. The Laurel and Hardy film The Flying Deuces, in which the Doctor intruded, was done by Smith dancing in front of greenscreen.|$|E
