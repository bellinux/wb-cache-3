5|$|Climate in {{a narrow}} sense is usually defined as the “average weather”, or more rigorously, as the {{statistical}} description {{in terms of the}} mean and variability of relevant quantities <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind.

5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed {{with a number of}} potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is {{the head}} of the Government of the United Kingdom, and chairs Cabinet meetings. There is no {{specific}} date when the office of Prime Minister first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The term was used in the House of Commons in 1805 and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s, and in 1905 the post of Prime Minister was officially given recognition in the order of precedence. Modern historians generally consider Sir Robert Walpole, who led the government of Great Britain from 1721 to 1742, as the first Prime Minister. Walpole is also the longest-serving Prime Minister by this definition. However, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was the first Prime Minister and Margaret Thatcher the longest-serving Prime Minister to have been officially referred to as such.|$|E

These light curves have an average decay rate of 0.008magnitudes per day; {{much lower than the}} decay rate for TypeIa supernovae. Type II are sub-divided into two classes, depending on the shape of the light curve. The light curve for a TypeII-L supernova shows a steady (linear) decline following the peak brightness. By contrast, the light curve of a TypeII-P supernova has a distinctive flat stretch (called a plateau) during the decline; representing a period where the luminosity decays at a slower rate. The net luminosity decay rate is lower, at 0.0075magnitudes per day for TypeII-P, compared to 0.012magnitudes per day for TypeII-L.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{study by}} Kathryn Thomas and Sandra Carlson used teeth {{from the upper}} jaw of three {{individuals}} interpreted as a juvenile, a subadult, and an adult, recovered from a bone bed in the Hell Creek Formation of Corson County, South Dakota. In this study, successive teeth in columns in the edmontosaurs' dental batteries were sampled from multiple locations along each tooth using a microdrilling system. This sampling method {{takes advantage of the}} organization of hadrosaurid dental batteries to find variation in tooth isotopes <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> From their work, it appears that edmontosaur teeth took less than about 0.65years to form, slightly faster in younger edmontosaurs. The teeth of all three individuals appeared to show variation in oxygen isotope ratios that could correspond to warm/dry and cool/wet periods; Thomas and Carlson considered the possibility that the animals were migrating instead, but favored local seasonal variations because migration would have more likely led to ratio homogenization, as many animals migrate to stay within specific temperature ranges or near particular food sources.|$|E
5|$|The Story of Seasons {{video game}} series was {{originally}} produced by Victor Interactive Software (acquired by Marvelous Interactive in 2002), with Natsume handling the English translation and distribution in North America. The series debuted in Japan on August 9, 1996 with , which later {{was released in}} the North American and PAL regions as Harvest Moon. Story of Seasons {{is a series of}} farm simulation/role-playing video games where the main objective is to maintain a farm <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> tending the crops and livestock throughout the seasons, while befriending the nearby townsfolk and getting married in some games. Story of Seasons titles have been released on numerous different video game consoles and handheld game consoles. Several titles have been re-released on multiple platforms as special editions which include an updated gameplay. Fourteen spin-off titles have been released, featuring related elements. One of these titles, , was released to mark the 10th anniversary of the Story of Seasons series. One reason the Story of Seasons series has remained popular is because of the unchanged core system of the games. According to Yasuhiro Wada, Story of Seasons lead designer, it has been the development team's response to the audience's requests which have allowed the series to maintain its popularity.|$|E

5|$|Western {{observers}} such as James Emerson Tennent (1858) and Charles Gabriel Seligman (1911) have {{termed the}} social group Coast Veddahs, Coast Verdas or East Coast Veddas. Anthropologists have considered {{them to be}} at least partly descended from the Veddas of the interior of the island who had migrated at some unknown period in the past to the east coast, intermarrying with the local Tamils. Interior Veddas clans themselves have a number of divisions, each claiming either Sinhalese, Tamil, mixed, or pure Vedda lineages. Vedda identity also depends on whether these clans are hunter-gatherers or settled agriculturalists. Settled Veddas have tended <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to assume Sinhalese or Tamil identity based on the area of residence. If considered a subdivision of Veddas, then they are by far the largest sub-group amongst the Vedda people. Residents of Eastern Province consider those who maintain a primitive life style, or are partly dependent on hunting and gathering, as Vedar without any connotations of ethnic origins.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand {{in the form of the}} Penthrox inhaler. Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E
