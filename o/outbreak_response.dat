However, {{the performance and}} utility of rapid influenza tests under field conditions in rural Southeast Asia has not been evaluated. MethodsIn {{the context of a}} larger study on the causes of respiratory illness in rural Thailand, we used a rapid test to collect data on influenza burden, seasonality, and cost of illness. We compared the performance of the QuickVue® Influenza Test to tissue cell viral culture and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) among 1092 Thai patients meeting the World Health Organization case definition for influenza-like illness over a 12 -month period. ResultsThe sensitivity and specificity of the QuickVue test compared to viral culture were 77 % and 96 %, respectively. Rapid influenza tests were useful to describe the seasonality of influenza, estimate the cost of illness, increase the sensitivity of surveillance, conduct <b>outbreak</b> <b>responses,</b> and guide evaluation of suspected avian influenza virus infections.

40|$|Abstract The Central America Field Epidemiology Training Program (CA FETP) is {{a public}} health {{capacity-building}} training programme aimed at developing high-caliber field epidemiologists at various levels {{of the public health}} system. It began in 2000 as part of the effort to rebuild public health infrastructure in six Central American and Caribbean countries following the devastation of Hurricanes Mitch and Georges in late 1998. Since then, the CA FETP has evolved from one regional training programme managed by CDC to several national FETPs with each country assuming ownership of its domestic programme. The curriculum is competency-based, and is divided into a three-tiered training pyramid that corresponds to the needs at the local, district and central levels of the health system. Trainees at each tier spend about 20 % of their time in the classroom and 80 % in the field implementing what they have learned while being mentored by graduates of the programme. FETP trainees have responded to multiple natural disasters and conducted hundreds of investigations including surveillance evaluations, <b>outbreak</b> <b>responses</b> and planned studies. Also graduates of the CA FETP are assuming influential positions in their respective ministries. As countries meet the challenge of institutionalizing their programmes, the CA FETP concept will increasingly be recognized as a model for sustainable public health capacity development. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Influenza can be {{manifested}} as {{an acute}} febrile illness, with symptoms similar to many pathogens endemic to Cambodia. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the Quickvue influenza A+B rapid test to identify the etiology of acute febrile illness in Cambodia. During December 2006 –May 2008, patients enrolled in a study to identify the etiology of acute febrile illnesses were tested for influenza by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Quickvue influenza A+B rapid test. The prevalence of influenza was 19. 7 % by RT-PCR. Compared with RT-PCR, the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test were 52. 1 % and 92. 5 %, respectively. The influenza rapid test identified the etiology in 10. 2 % of enrollees and ≥ 35 % during peak times of influenza activity. This study suggests that rapid influenza tests may be useful during peak times of influenza activity in an area where several different etiologies can present as an acute febrile illness. Several studies have highlighted the use of rapid influenza testing to improve early detection of epidemics and conduct <b>outbreak</b> <b>responses.</b> 1, 2 Rapid influenza testing can be used to identify patients with influenza in a timely manner and influence clinical treatment. 3, 4 Although rapid testing for influenza has been demonstrated to be less sensitive when compared with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 5 it could be a...|$|R

40|$|Emergency {{management}} has {{been influenced by}} top-down approaches that prioritise the need for technocratic expertise and resource base in addressing acute situations. However of key importance in the processes of emergency management is the participation of affected communities, especially poor communities as these {{are most likely to}} experience severe adverse effects. In cholera <b>outbreaks,</b> <b>responses</b> to managing <b>outbreaks</b> have tended to be reactive rather than proactive, with a limited role for community participation, that is, some involvement in health education programmes. However community participation goes beyond “involvement” in programmes and requires active leadership to empower people to participate in emergency planning. A qualitative research study was conducted in Gadzema, a cholera-affected area in Chinhoyi town, Zimbabwe. This study draws on the community’s and local emergency actors’ perceptions about Cholera and the outbreak management in 2008. Utilising focus groups and key informant interviews, perceptions were analysed in relation to the literature on emergency management and the ladder of community participation framework. Although the findings suggest that the community was involved in the <b>response</b> to the <b>outbreak</b> through community health education campaigns and being recruited as community health volunteers, there is still more scope to enhance community participation in planning for future outbreaks.

There is need for engagement between the health clubs and the City Councils because these clubs are the custodians of household health and hygiene practices and norms and are key transmitters of hygiene messages in the community hence having a major impact in reducing disease prevalence.
