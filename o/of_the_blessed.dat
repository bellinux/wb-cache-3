25|$|It is {{customary}} that, {{once the}} Kohanim are assembled on the platform, the cantor or prayer leader will prompt them by reciting each word <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> and <b>the</b> Kohanim will then repeat that word. This custom is especially followed {{if only one}} Kohen is available to give <b>the</b> <b>blessing.</b> Apparently this prompting is done to avoid errors or embarrassment if any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kohanim should be ignorant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recitation. However, if {{there are a number}} of kohanim, they may say <b>the</b> first word <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> ("Yevorekhekhaw") without <b>the</b> prompting, presumably to demonstrate their familiarity with the ritual.|$|R
5|$|According to {{historian}} Gyula Kristó, Stephen's third (unnamed) {{daughter was}} {{the wife of}} Despot Jacob Svetoslav. Stephen's third (or fourth) daughter, Elizabeth, {{who was born in}} about 1260, became a Dominican nun in the Monastery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blessed</b> Virgin on Rabbits' Island. She was appointed prioress in 1277, but her brother, Ladislaus, kidnapped and married her to a Czech baron, Zavis of Falkenstein, in 1288. Stephen's youngest daughter, Anna, was born in about 1260. She married Andronikos Palaiologos, son and heir of the Byzantine Emperor, Michael VIII.|$|E
5|$|Ban Joachim Gutkeled kidnapped Stephen's ten-year-old son and heir, Ladislaus {{and imprisoned}} {{him in the}} castle of Koprivnica {{in the summer of}} 1272. Stephen besieged the fortress, but could not capture it. Stephen fell ill and was taken to the Csepel Island. He died on 6 August 1272. Stephen was buried near to the tomb of his sister, Margaret, in the Monastery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blessed</b> Virgin on Rabbits' Island.|$|E
5|$|Béla had {{originally}} planned {{to give his}} youngest daughter, Margaret, in marriage to King Ottokar. However, Margaret, who {{had been living in}} the Monastery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blessed</b> Virgin on Rabbits' Island, refused to yield. With the assistance of her Dominican confessor, she took her final religious vows which prevented her marriage. Infuriated by this act, the King, who had up to that time supported the Dominicans, favored the Franciscans in the subsequent years. He even became a Franciscan tertiary, according to the Greater Legend of his saintly sister, Elisabeth.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] many {{traditional}} Jewish communities {{it is the}} custom for congregants to spread their tallitot over their own heads during <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> and {{not look at the}} Kohanim. If a man has children, they will come under his tallit to be blessed, even if they are quite old. <b>The</b> (unattributed) basis <b>of</b> this custom is to emphasize <b>the</b> spiritual aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> over <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kohanim themselves; as per the scriptural verse, the Kohanim are simply a vehicle for <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blessing,</b> when they [...] "place My name upon <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> Israel".|$|R
2500|$|And the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch interprets God's {{words to}} Abraham in [...] "the {{father of a}} {{multitude}} of nations have I made you," [...] to mean that previously, Abram was father only to Aram, but from that point onward, {{he would be a}} father to all nations. Thus, the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch cites [...] to support the proposition that a convert may be included in a group of three or more (mezuman) for <b>the</b> purposes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> after meals ( [...] , Birkat Hamazon) and may say <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> and <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blessing,</b> [...] "for giving our ancestors as a heritage." ...|$|R
5|$|Béla's first son, Stephen {{was born}} in 1239. He succeeded his father. Béla's {{youngest}} daughter, Margaret was born during the Mongol invasion in 1242. Dedicated to God by her parents at birth, she spent her life in humility in the Monastery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blessed</b> Virgin on Rabbits' Island and died as a Dominican nun. The King's youngest (namesake) son, Béla was born between around 1243 and 1250.|$|E
5|$|Caro Martínez and {{his family}} lived in the Petrel area until the 1880s, when they moved to nearby village Quebrada del Nuevo Reino; he lived there until his death. Caro Martínez became {{an active member of}} the parish of Ciruelos. According to {{journalist}} José Arraño Acevedo, the archives of the Archiepiscopate of Santiago which are published yearly show he was elected as a steward of the Confraternity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blessed</b> Sacrament for the years of 1888, 1890, 1892, and 1900.|$|E
5|$|It {{was again}} the two archbishops who {{conducted}} the negotiations between Béla and his son. Their agreement was signed in the Dominican Monastery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blessed</b> Virgin on Rabbits' Island (Margaret Island, Budapest) on 23 March 1266. The new treaty confirmed {{the division of the}} country along the Danube and regulated many aspects of the co-existence of Béla's regnum and Stephen's regimen, including the collection of taxes and the commoners' right to free movement.|$|E

The project cost approximately $32 million. The funds were raised entirely from private donations and not from the Archdiocese's treasury. It lasted from 2004 until November 2006, and was finished in time for a celebration honoring the 200th anniversary of the groundbreaking. By the time the restoration was completed, the Basilica had been repaired and restored to its more original appearance.|$|E
5|$|Past the airport, Gratiot Avenue {{once again}} runs through {{residential}} neighborhoods while being immediately bordered by commercial properties.

Just before crossing M-102 (8Mile Road), Gratiot Avenue widens back to a boulevard. This intersection marks the transition from Detroit and Wayne County to Eastpointe in Macomb County.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} medieval foundation {{set up by}} Adam de Brome, {{under the}} patronage of Edward II, was called the House or Hall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blessed</b> Mary at Oxford.

During the English Civil War, Oriel played host to high-ranking members of the King's Oxford Parliament.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, to {{mark the}} seventh centenary {{of the birth of}} King James I, Gaudí {{designed}} a monument in his memory. It would have been situated in the Plaça del Rei, and would have also meant the renovation of the adjacent buildings: new roof for the cathedral, as well as the completion of its towers and cupola; placement of three vases above the buttresses of the Chapel of Santa Àgada, dedicated to the Litany <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blessed</b> Virgin Mary, as well as the figure of an angel on top of the chapel's tower; finally, the opening of a large square next to the walls (now the Plaça Ramon Berenguer el Grand). The project was not executed because the city council disliked it.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Vicars' Chapel is {{rubble masonry}} however the south face {{which can be}} seen from the close is of white Conglomerate quarried locally. The shields on the wall are those of Nicholas Bubwith, {{suggesting}} that construction was started during his reign as bishop between 1407 and 1424, and John Stafford who was bishop from 1424 until 1443 suggesting that construction was completed under his episcopate. The lower floor was a chapel, and a spiral stair led up to the library. The chapel was dedicated to the Assumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blessed</b> Virgin Mary and St Katherine. It is now used by the chaplain of Wells Cathedral School. The interior is decorated with 19th century gesso work by Heywood Sumner.|$|E
5|$|On {{the left}} side, the first chapel was {{dedicated}} to the Nativity of Mary. Since 1573 this chapel, the giuspatronato of the Milanese Carcano family, contained the stone reportedly used for Isaac's sacrifice. A Ricci painting {{of the birth of}} Mary was on its altar; on its vault were the Four Evangelists, and its walls were decorated with frescoes. The second chapel, dedicated to San Giacomo, had a statue (later replaced by a painting) of the saint above the altar and was the burial place for members of the Confraternity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blessed</b> Sacrament. The third chapel, dedicated to the Crucifixion, contained a large sculpture of Christ on the cross.|$|E
