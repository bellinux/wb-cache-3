5|$|After {{the article}} was published, over one hundred {{prominent}} intellectuals, {{including some of the}} people Szabó had denounced, published a letter of support for him. Szabó’s initial response to {{the article was}} that informing had been an act of bravery intended {{to save the life of}} former classmate Pál Gábor. When this claim turned <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be true, Szabó admitted that his true motive had been to prevent his own expulsion from the Academy.|$|E
5|$|By December 1943 the {{division}} {{had returned to}} England and begun training for operations in North-West Europe {{under the supervision of}} I Airborne Corps. Although the 1st Airborne Division was not scheduled {{to take part in the}} Normandy landings, a contingency plan, Operation Wasteage, was drawn up whereby {{the division}} would be parachuted in to support any of the five invasion beaches if serious delays were experienced. This plan turned <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be required.|$|E
5|$|The Einsatzgruppen had {{its origins}} in the ad hoc Einsatzkommando formed by Heydrich {{following}} the Anschluss in Austria in March 1938. Two units of Einsatzgruppen were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action turned <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be necessary because of the Munich Agreement, the Einsatzgruppen were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens. The Einsatzgruppen also followed Wehrmacht troops and killed potential partisans. Similar groups were used in 1939 for the occupation of Czechoslovakia.|$|E

5|$|The Einsatzgruppen {{were formed}} under the {{direction}} of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich and operated by the Schutzstaffel (SS) before and during World War II. The Einsatzgruppen had its origins in the ad hoc Einsatzkommando formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the Anschluss in Austria in March 1938. Originally part of the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police; SiPo), two units of Einsatzgruppen were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action turned <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be necessary due to the Munich Agreement, the Einsatzgruppen were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They also secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens. From September 1939, the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Main Security Office; RSHA) had overall command of the Einsatzgruppen.|$|E
5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he {{got home from work}} one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E

Progress was cut short by Alfandari's death in 1969 and the language was mostly forgotten.|$|R

25|$|Those to whom {{goods were}} {{delivered}} were often equally dissatisfied. Instructions were sometimes in Spanish or Chinese, {{making it difficult}} to use the product. Some products were shipped with plugs and internal wiring meant for the U.S. market, making them unusable in Britain (in a few cases, the company did provide a power converter, the FTC conceded). Even products usable in Britain turned <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have been manufactured for sale there, or in the European Union (EU) generally, meaning they were not covered by manufacturers' warranties.|$|E
25|$|In 1744 {{there was}} a riot in Puebla over a minor {{religious}} point. The viceroy, in order to dignify {{his visit to the}} bishop, had ordered the bells rung.

When that turned <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be the case, they rioted. The viceroy ordered the troops of the garrison to suppress the riot, and there were injuries. The viceroy was criticized for this decision.|$|E

None of the written records in Virginia and North Carolina line up with the Roots story until after the Civil War. Some elements of Haley's family story can be found in the written records, but the most likely genealogy would be different from the one described in Roots.|$|E

25|$|Murray {{resisted}} the second demand: {{that if he}} could not meet schedule, he must hire a second, senior editor to work in parallel to him, outside his supervision, on words from elsewhere in the alphabet. Murray did not want to share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience. That turned <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be so, and Philip Gell of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant Henry Bradley (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the British Museum in London beginning in 1888. In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.|$|E
25|$|Only {{five of the}} ten ships, the Junior N. Van Noy, Madison Jordan Manchester, Glenn Gerald Griswold, Thomas F. Farrel and Robert M. Emery made it to Europe in {{time for}} {{significant}} work. The remaining ships were not operational until 1945. Some of the modifications turned <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be as useful as anticipated. The distinctive forty ton capacity bow horn in particular was seldom used. Navy salvage units had been operational earlier for heavy lift and the most valuable function of the ships may have been to centralize support, heavy maintenance and facilities for Army Engineers conducting repairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{hoped that}} private shipyards {{would be able}} to build the ships on a fixed-cost basis. This turned <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be the case; the shipbuilding industry was less enthusiastic than anticipated. Moreover, none of the shipyards being considered for the work had the facilities to build the fast ferries. BC Ferries {{had no choice but to}} do the work itself on a cost-plus basis. It would have to act as project manager and assume the risk of the fast ferries. Catamaran Ferries International (CFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of BC Ferries, was incorporated in March 1996 to carry out the work and construction started later that year.|$|E
