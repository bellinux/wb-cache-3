60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> {{only they}} do not think in words, as we do.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not steal. Attract is the word. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> I'm good--I only attract ultramarine; {{but there}} are {{students}} who'd attract flake-white.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{not mean}} the wood of which the actual cross was made. They mean the thing of which the cross was a sign and token.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, walking away--behind {{the trees}} now. No, you can't see him. But we {{are sure to}} run into him," [...] which, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} he {{was alone in the}} turret-room. As for the shopkeepers, they had a kind of idea that they had dreamed {{something}} odd; but, as it went no further, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not talk about it, and nobody was any the wiser.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} when the burglars would come, nor the {{particular}} point of the mansion where the assault would be delivered; therefore Number 666 laid his plans like a wise general, posted his troops where there was most likelihood of their being required, and kept himself in reserve for contingencies.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Jordan, {{turning it}} over, adopted {{at last the}} plan of {{treating}} it with a smile. She wished to be liberal. [...] "Well, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> lay it out." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{not always}} succeed, but they seldom or never {{fail to do}} the very uttermost {{that it is in}} the power of strong and daring men to accomplish. Frequently they can tell of defeat and victory on the same battlefield.|$|E
6000|$|Decidedly {{this was}} bad form, and Mr Evans, pursing up {{his lips and}} raising his eyebrows, was silent. 'That's the worst of these half-educated people,' he said to himself; 'they get some idea in their heads which they don't understand, and, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> idiotic things....' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two of the pursuers who had outpaced {{the others}} crept up to him--lank, lean men of {{not more than}} thirty years of age. They had {{stabbing}} spears in their hands, such as are used at close quarters, and these <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not throw. One of them gained a little on the other.|$|R
60|$|But {{nothing would}} do; for he screamed and cried all {{day for a}} water-baby, to come and drive away the monsters; and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not try to find one, because <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not believe in them, and were {{thinking}} of nothing but Bumpsterhausen's blue follicles; having, as usual, set the cart before the horse, and taken the effect for the cause.|$|R
60|$|So {{the king}} told the {{soldiers}} {{that they might}} become his coachmen; but he made the boy his companion, and gave him rooms near his own. The soldiers were dreadfully angry when they heard this, for <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not know that the}} boy was really a prince; and they soon began to lay their heads together to plot his ruin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> Mrs. Bangster {{takes her}} half-pint of brandy {{every night for}} her health's sake, no doubt. Would you believe it, Mr. Bertram, the doctor {{absolutely}} had to take {{her out of the}} saloon one night in the 'Lahore'? Didn't he, Mrs. Price?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BURGE [shining at her] <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> Come! let me {{prove to}} you {{what we think of}} you. Shall we find you a first-rate {{constituency}} to contest at the next election? One that wont cost you a penny. A metropolitan seat. What {{do you say to the}} Strand? ...|$|E
60|$|Of an evening, {{if we have}} a halt, Jack {{sometimes}} dances. The band of the Punjaubees—between whom and {{the sailors}} there is a great friendship, although <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not understand a word of each other’s language—comes over to the sailors’ camp, and plays dance-music; and half-a-dozen couples of sailors stand up and execute quadrilles, waltzes, and polkas.|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} how often Mrs. Cliff had said to herself {{that it was really}} not a waste of money to keep this horse, for Willy was no longer young; and if she could save her any weary steps, she ought to do it, {{and at the same time}} relieve a little the {{congested}} state of her income.|$|R
60|$|On and on they went, {{and when}} at length the thread stopped the {{brothers}} knew that another day's journey would {{bring them to}} the Stalos' dwelling. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not dare to approach it openly, for the Stalos had the strength of giants, and besides, there were three of them; so the two Sodnos climbed into a big bushy tree which overhung a well.|$|R
60|$|Crack {{went the}} mighty whips, howl went the dogs, and the sledges were soon {{skimming}} {{over the sea}} {{at the rate of}} ten miles an hour. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not keep that pace up very long. It became necessary to rest at times, also, to give the dogs a little food. When this latter process had been completed, the teams became so lively that they tried to runaway.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> We {{are now in}} {{the great}} valley which runs right across England from {{south-west}} to north-east, from Axminster in Devonshire to Hunstanton in Norfolk, with the chalk always on your right hand, and the oolite hills on your left, till it ends by sinking into the sea, among the fens of Lincolnshire and Norfolk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our friends believe"? -- <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> -- as {{sheltered}} women may; [...] But {{have they}} seen the shrieking soul ripped from the quivering clay? [...] They! -- If their own front door is shut, [...] they'll swear the whole world's warm; [...] What {{do they know}} of dread of death or hanging fear of harm? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! don't {{be angry}} with me," [...] she said piteously. [...] "If only you understood. You are a {{wonderful}} medium, the most wonderful {{that any of us}} has ever known, and through you we have learned things; holy, marvellous things, which till now have not been heard of in the world. Your fame is already great among leading spiritualists of the earth, though <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not know who you are." ...|$|E
60|$|Business {{had been}} {{as good as they}} could have expected. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have such a rush as they had been favored with during the first two days that Paul was in {{partnership}} with them, because the news was not so exciting; but <b>they</b> <b>did</b> so well that their board was paid for a week before they had been at Mrs. Green's four days, and they had begun to think of adding to the theatrical fund.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want {{my brother}} to do {{anything}} shabby," [...] replied the girl; [...] "but I shouldn't be sorry, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> if <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very. They {{are really}} delicious. But the farmers {{did not like}} to lose their bees and so they tried to destroy me. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> couldn't <b>do</b> that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A junior lieutenant, and two midshipmen. The lieutenant, when I am alone, always messes with me. We {{are not so}} strict, {{among our}} small craft in the Company's service, {{as they are in}} the royal navy; and I think, myself, that it would be ridiculous for me to dine here by myself; Mr. Hardy, by himself; and the two midshipmen in a {{separate}} mess of their own. That <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> for they would not enjoy their meals with Hardy and myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. PRIOR.--Bless the man, how abrupt {{he is in}} his manner! He quite shocks a poor {{lady who}} has been used to better days. What's here? Invitations--ho! Bills for Lady Kicklebury! THEY are not paid. Where is Mr. M. going to dine, I wonder? Captain and Mrs. Hopkinson, Sir John and Lady Tomkinson, request the pleasure. Request the pleasure! <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> They are always asking Mr. M. to dinner. They have daughters to marry, and Mr. M. is a widower with three {{thousand}} a year, every shilling of it. I must tell Lady Kicklebury. He must never go to these places--never, never--mustn't be allowed. [While talking, she opens all the letters on the table, rummages the portfolio and writing-box, looks at cards on mantelpiece, work in work-basket, tries tea-box, and shows the greatest activity and curiosity.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you spoke}} {{as if you}} didn't, Stapleton; but {{you will see the}} fellows will fight when they are called upon. Just at present they are not only wet but they are disgusted. And I own it is disgusting after {{fighting}} as hard as we did yesterday to find it's all been of no use, and that instead of marching against the enemy we are marching away from them. Of course it can't be helped; and if we had waited another half-hour we should have had all the French army on us, and yesterday's work would have been mere child's play to it. Still I can quite enter into the soldier's feelings. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not understand the position, and regard it as simply a retreat instead of a mere shifting of ground to take up better position and fight again to-morrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "The story doesn't say. It stops just there," [...] {{said the}} Story Girl. [...] "But <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> I {{will tell you}} what I think. I don't think Aglaia {{swallowed}} the stone. I think it just fell to the ground; and after awhile they found it, {{and it turned out to}} be of such value that Glaucon could buy all the flocks and herds in the valley, and the sweetest cottage; and he and Aglaia were married right away." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> what <b>they</b> {{could for}} the poor wretch. They got him into the tent, and they made him swallow some tea. Then he slept; and in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> the {{afternoon}} he had so far recovered as {{to be able to}} eat a bit of meat. Then, when his companions were at their work, he carefully packed up his swag, and fastening it on to his back, appeared {{by the side of the}} hole. 'I'm come to bid you good-bye he said.|$|R
60|$|It took a {{good while}} for the king to get home again, and he was rather cross at having had so much trouble for nothing. Besides which, his courtiers made fun at his adventure, {{and he did not}} like being laughed at, though <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not dare to do it before his face. And the end of it was that very soon he started on his travels again, only {{allowing}} one equerry to accompany him, and even this attendant he managed to lose the moment he had left his own kingdom behind him.|$|R
6000|$|Many parents, perhaps indeed nearly all, seem, as we {{have already}} shown, {{to act as if}} they {{considered}} the duty of obedience on the part of their children as a matter <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>They</b> <b>do</b> not expect their children to read or to write without being taught; they do not expect a dog to fetch and carry, or a horse to draw and to understand commands and signals, without being trained. In all these cases they perceive the necessity of training and instruction, and understand that the initiative is with them. If a horse, endowed by nature with average good qualities, does not work well, the fault is attributed at once to the man who undertook to train him. But what mother, when her child, grown large and strong, becomes the trial and sorrow of her life by his ungovernable disobedience and insubordination, takes the blame to herself in reflecting that he was placed in her hands when all the powers and faculties of his soul were in embryo, tender, pliant, and unresisting, to be formed and fashioned at her will? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{twenty years}} past, my friend, I have been {{studying}} the question of hereditary transmission of qualities; and I have found vices and diseases descending more frequently to children than virtue and health. I don't stop to ask why: {{there is no end}} to that sort of curiosity. What I have observed is what I tell you; no more and no less. You will say this is a horribly discouraging result of experience, for it tends to show that children come into the world at a disadvantage on the day of their birth. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> Children are born deformed; children are born deaf, dumb, or blind; children are born with the seeds in them of deadly diseases. Who can account for the cruelties of creation? Why are we endowed with life--only to end in death? And does it ever strike you, when you are cutting your mutton at dinner, and your cat is catching its mouse, and your spider is suffocating its fly, that we are all, big and little together, born to one certain inheritance--the privilege of eating each other?" ...|$|E
60|$|These {{women were}} poor looking creatures, however. They had a subdued, humble look, like dogs {{that are used}} to being kicked; very {{different}} from the bold free bearing of the men. The reason of this was, that they were treated by the men more as beasts of burden than companions. Women among the North American Indians have a hard time of it, poor creatures. While their lords and masters are out at the chase, or idly smoking round the fire, the Indian women are employed in cutting firewood and drawing water. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> all the cooking, and, as the eating always continues, so the cooking never stops. When these more severe labours are over, they employ their time in making and ornamenting coats, leggings, and moccasins--and very beautiful work they can turn out of their hands. On the voyage, the women use the paddle as well as the men, and, in journeying through the woods, they always carry or drag the heaviest loads. For all this they get few thanks, and often when the husbands become jealous, they get severely beaten and kicked.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> can <b>do</b> that," [...] said Rollo. [...] "The ice, in that case, is {{just the}} same as a shore; I mean where there is not any shore at all." ...|$|R
60|$|At first, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> could <b>do</b> {{little else}} than make each other {{partially}} {{acquainted with the}} circumstances which had so strangely thrown them together, but Dominick soon {{put an end to}} this desultory talk.|$|R
6000|$|It first burst {{upon their}} senses {{as a new}} and grand idea when Bladud and Dromas, at the urgent request of their friends, stepped into the arena and gave a {{specimen}} of {{the manner in which}} the art was practised in Hellas. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not use what we call knuckle-dusters, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> even double their fists, except when moving round each other, and as [...] "gloves" [...] were unknown, they struck out with the hands half open, for they had no wish to bleed each other's noses or black each other's eyes for mere amusement.|$|R
