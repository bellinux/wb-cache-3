25|$|The {{operating}} frequency {{range of a}} RO depends on the input and <b>output</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The highest frequency of the input (controlling) signal {{is limited by the}} response of the RO light source to the change in the controlling current and by the response of the photoresistor to light; its typical value ranges between 1 and 250Hz. The response time of a photoresistor to switching off of the light typically varies between 2.5 and 1000 ms, whereas the response to switching the illumination on is about 10 times faster. As to the light source, its reaction time to a current pulse is in the nanosecond range for an LED, and is therefore neglected. However, for an incandescent lamp it is on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, which limits the frequency range of the respective ROs to a few Hz.|$|E

50|$|Fourth-order filters have an 80 dB/decade (or 24 dB/octave) slope. These {{filters are}} complex to design in passive form, because the {{components}} {{interact with each}} other. Steep-slope passive networks are less tolerant of parts value deviations or tolerances, and more sensitive to mis-termination with reactive driver loads. A 4th order crossover with −6 dB crossover point and flat summing {{is also known as}} a Linkwitz-Riley crossover (named after its inventors), and can be constructed in active form by cascading two 2nd order Butterworth filter sections. The output signals of this crossover order are in phase, thus avoiding partial phase inversion if the crossover bandpasses are electrically summed, as they would be within the output stage of a multiband compressor. Crossovers used in loudspeaker design do not require the filter sections to be in phase: smooth <b>output</b> <b>characteristics</b> are often achieved using non-ideal, asymmetric crossover filter characteristics.
