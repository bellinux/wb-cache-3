Conceived as a patient with a tumor condition who later develops diabetes, Henry Burton (Scott Foley) befriends Dr. Altman and eventually joins her in marriage only to get treated using her medical insurance, until he dies while undergoing heart surgery.|$|E
5|$|When Robbins wins {{a prestigious}} grant to help treat {{children}} in Malawi, a disgruntled Torres agrees to move there with her, as the position {{will last for}} three years; however, her lack of enthusiasm causes Robbins to end their relationship and go without her. A heartbroken Torres moves in with Sloan, {{and they have a}} one-night stand. Robbins returns for Torres, apologizing and hoping for forgiveness, but Torres initially rebuffs her, and later reveals that she is pregnant with Sloan's baby. Robbins agrees to raise the child with her, but dislikes that Sloan will be a permanent part of their lives. En route a weekend getaway, Robbins proposes to Torres, but before Torres can reply, the two are in a head-on collision with a truck, leaving Torres severely injured.

40|$|PURPOSE Obstetric {{practice}} among family physicians {{has declined}} in recent years. This study compared the practice patterns of family physicians and obste-trician-gynecologists {{with and without}} obstetric practices to provide objective information on one potential reason for this decline—the impact of obstetrics on physician lifestyle. METHODS In 2004, we surveyed all <b>obstetrician-gynecologists,</b> all rural fam-ily physicians, and {{a random sample of}} urban family physicians identifi ed from professional association lists (N = 2, 564) about demographics, practice character-istics, and obstetric practices. RESULTS A total of 1, 197 physicians (46. 7 %) overall responded to the survey (41. 5 % of urban family physicians, 54. 7 % of rural family physicians, and 55. 0 % of <b>obstetrician-gynecologists).</b> After exclusions, 991 were included in the fi nal data set. Twenty-seven percent of urban family physicians, 46 % of rural family physicians, and 79 % of <b>obstetrician-gynecologists</b> practiced obstetrics. The mean number of total professional hours worked per week was greater with obstetric practice than without for rural family physicians (55. 4 vs 50. 2, P =. 005) and for <b>obstetrician-gynecologists</b> (58. 3 vs 43. 5, P =. 000), but not for urban family physicians (47. 8 vs 49. 5, P =. 27). For all 3 groups, physicians practicing obstet-rics were more likely to provide inpatient care and take call than physicians not practicing obstetrics. Large proportions of family physicians, but not <b>obstetrician-gynecologists,</b> took their own call for obstetrics. Concerns about the litigation environment and personal issues were the most frequent reasons for stopping obstetric practice. CONCLUSIONS Practicing obstetrics is associated with an increased workload for family physicians.

500|$|On February 21, 2007, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that ABC was pursuing a spin-off medical drama television {{series for the}} series featuring Kate Walsh's character, Addison Montgomery. Subsequent reports confirmed the decision, stating that an expanded two-hour broadcast of Grey's Anatomy {{would serve as a}} backdoor pilot for the proposed spin-off. The cast was reportedly unhappy about the decision, as all hoped the spin-off would have been given to them. Pompeo commented that she felt, as the star, she should have been consulted, and Heigl, disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Izzie. The backdoor pilot that aired on May 3, 2007, sees Addison take [...] "a leave of absence" [...] from Seattle Grace Hospital, to visit her best friend from Los Angeles, Naomi Bennett, a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist, in order to get pregnant. While in Los Angeles, she meets Bennett's colleagues at the Oceanside Wellness Center and even becomes the clinic's <b>obstetrician-gynecologist</b> for the day. The two-hour broadcast served as the twenty-second and the twenty-third episodes of the third season, and was directed by Michael Grossman, according to Variety. The cast included Amy Brenneman, Paul Adelstein, Tim Daly, Taye Diggs, Chris Lowell and Merrin Dungey. ABC officially picked up Private Practice for its 2007 lineup on May 11, 2007. KaDee Strickland's character, Charlotte King, who would be introduced in the spin-off's first-season premiere, did not appear in the backdoor pilot. Her addition to the main cast was announced on July 11, 2007, prior to the commencement of the first season. She did not have to audition for the role, but was cast after a meeting with Rhimes. Also not present in the backdoor pilot was Audra McDonald, due to her character, Bennett, being portrayed by a different actress, Merrin Dungey. However, on June 29, 2007, ABC announced that Dungey would be replaced, with no reason given for the change. The premiere episode followed {{the second part of the}} season debut of Dancing with the Stars, and provided a lead-in to fellow freshman series, Dirty Sexy Money. Pushing Daisies, a third new series for the evening, rounded out the lineup as a lead-in to Private Practice. The series aired a total of six seasons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Abortion {{laws are}} {{extremely}} restrictive in Brazil. The knowledge, opinions of abortion laws, and abortion practices of <b>obstetrician-gynecologists</b> {{can have a}} significant impact on women's access to safe abortion. Methods We conducted a mail-in survey with a 10 % random sample of <b>obstetrician-gynecologists</b> affiliated with the Brazilian Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. We documented participants' experiences performing abortion under a range of legal and illegal circumstances, and asked about which abortion techniques they had experience with. We used chi-square tests and crude logistic regression models to determine which sociodemographic, knowledge-related, or practice-related variables were associated with physician opinion. Results Of the 1, 500 questionnaires that we mailed out, we received responses from 572 (38 %). Less than half (48 %) of the respondents reported accurate knowledge about abortion law and 77 % thought that the law should be more liberal. One-third of respondents reported having previous experience performing an abortion, and very few of these physicians reported having experience with manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) or with misoprostol with either mifepristone or methotrexate. Physicians that favored liberalization of the law were more likely to have correct knowledge about abortion law, and to be in favor of public funding for abortion services.

RESULTS: Certified nurse-midwives were less likely to use continuous electronic fetal monitoring and had lower rates of labor induction or augmentation than physicians. Certified nurse-midwives also were less likely than physicians to use epidural anesthesia. The cesarean section rate for patients of certified nurse-midwives was 8. 8 % vs 13. 6 % for obstetricians and 15. 1 % for family physicians. Certified nurse-midwives used 12. 2 % fewer resources.
