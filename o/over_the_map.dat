25|$|After the {{mechanical}} for the map was handed over in 1972, Vignelli had no further control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> Six further editions were produced from 1973 to 1978, with extensive changes. In 1974, William Ronan {{was replaced by}} David Yunich {{as chairman of the}} MTA. Yunich was formerly an executive at Macy's department store, and brought an explicit intention to 'sell' the subway to riders. He brought over from Macy's Fred Wilkinson who in 1975 formed the Subway Map Committee to design a new map to replace Vignelli's.|$|E
25|$|As in Peace Walker, The Phantom Pain {{features}} a base-building {{system that allows}} players to develop weapons and items from their home base. Recruitment of enemy soldiers and prisoners has also returned for this purpose, allowing the base to grow through organization. The player is given the option to access their base from their real-life smartphones and other devices via a companion app. Unlike in Peace Walker where players can only see Mother Base from the air, they can control Snake as he explores the complex on foot. The Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, an item introduced into gameplay in Peace Walker, returns as well, with players able to transport captured soldiers and other objects such as animals and vehicles back to Mother Base. Money for upgrading Mother Base's defenses and technology can be collected from objects found all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> such as diamonds, shipping containers, and special blueprint boxes, as well as sending recruited soldiers on combat missions around the world. The income is invested on upgrades to the appearance and abilities, weapons and equipment of Snake, his AI companions, and vehicles. For example, Snake's prosthetic arm can be modified with a taser, echolocation function, or remote controls that allow it to fly as a drone.|$|E

500|$|However, {{some critics}} found it inconsistent. Music {{journalist}} Peter Shapiro criticized its [...] "loose playing and bohemian self-indulgence", stating [...] "Voodoo drifted all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> in a blunted haze". Rolling Stones James Hunter disapproved {{of the experimental}} and loose-sounding structure, and viewed {{that it does not}} attain its potential, stating [...] "long stretches of it are unfocused and unabsorbing [...] Voodoo flatters the real {{at the expense of the}} thing. The result is superb smoke, but smoke nonetheless". Jon Caramanica wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), [...] "D'Angelo achieves through nuance what some singers with decades of experience and training never achieve: a throbbing, vital presence, that demands attention, even as it shuns it".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} praised for its {{political}} satire. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict called the episode a [...] "biting political satire {{in the guise}} of a children's oratory contest", that [...] "signifies that this season of the series will be all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> both emotionally and logically." [...] Gibron added: [...] "Everything, from the Reader's Digest rants to the formulaic speeches of the youths, has a resounding ring of truth. And once the story moves to Washington D.C, our nation's capital is in for a royal reaming as well." [...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said the episode solidified the series' politically satirical voice as it [...] "bitch slapped the Bush administration" [...] that would later badmouth The Simpsons. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, however, gave the episode a more negative review, stating that it [...] "has its moments but never seems like one of the series’ better programs. Part of that stems from its somewhat icky ending. The show exhibits a tone that feels more appropriate to a less biting and cynical series. It starts well with Homer’s obsession with Reading Digest. After that, the show seems more erratic, and it remains pretty average overall." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dardenne quickly {{endorsed}} Edwards for the November 21 {{runoff election}} against Vitter. Angelle remained {{silent on the}} race and refused to endorse either candidate. State Treasurer John Neely Kennedy, a 2004 Democratic opponent of Vitter, called upon Angelle {{to join him in}} endorsing Vitter. Remaining silent, said Kennedy, is the equivalent of an endorsement of Edwards. Angelle spokesman Ryan Cross responded to Kennedy's accusations saying “John Kennedy is confused. He is the eternal president of the RINO club. He endorsed John Kerry for President , who fought to kill the Keystone pipeline; he’s run statewide as a liberal Democrat twice; and he’s been all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> on issues like the minimum wage, abortion, and tax increases.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{degree of}} crater {{degradation}} {{is determined by}} qualitative assessment of their landforms such as rim crests, interior wall terraces and slumps, central peaks, continuous ejecta deposits, and secondary crater fields (see Malin and Dzurisin, 1977; McCauley and others, 1981). To the extent that degradational changes are systematic with increasing age, {{they can be used}} to correlate local and regional stratigraphic sequences <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> region. On the basis of this morphologic evaluation, five crater ages are defined and used to make stratigraphic assignments. However, the low sun angle at which images in the region were acquired may make craters appear younger than in other parts of Mercury where images were taken at higher sun angles.|$|E
2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Once Upon a Time's {{trend of}} setting up the next season in the finale {{continued}} with the final installments of Season 5.

The only hiccup – and it was a big one – was Henry's all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> behavior that caused all sorts of action. Two jam-packed episodes after a somewhat sleepy half season in the Underworld was jarring and made you realize how much story the show can churn through when it's not stretching out a [...] "themed" [...] plot."

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to the Chronicle postmarked July 24, 1970, the Zodiac took credit for Kathleen Johns' abduction, four months after the incident. In a July 26, 1970 letter, the Zodiac paraphrased a song from The Mikado, adding his own lyrics about making a [...] "little list" [...] of the ways he planned to torture his [...] "slaves" [...] in [...] "paradice". The letter was signed with a large, exaggerated cross circle symbol and a new score: [...] " [...] = 13, SFPD = 0". A final note {{at the bottom of the}} letter stated, [...] "P.S. The Mt. Diablo code {{concerns}} Radians + # inches along the radians." [...] In 1981, a close examination of the radian hint by Zodiac researcher Gareth Penn led to the discovery that a radian angle, when placed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> per Zodiac's instructions, pointed to the locations of two Zodiac attacks.|$|E
2500|$|Nightmerica was {{released}} March 21, 2006. Corey Apar of Allmusic called it [...] "way {{more interesting than}} their fake horror film façade would suggest ... Love Equals Death is really more like a multifaceted version of a late-'90s skate punk band ... promising and refreshing in its mix {{of old and new}} sounds, Nightmerica is {{a breath of fresh air}} among the ironic screamo bands of the world." [...] Chris Moran of Punknews.org complemented the range of Travis' vocals and the musicianship as [...] "extremely tight", but felt that the songs went in too many musical directions to give the band a firm identity: [...] "This record is just all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> One minute we've got some Goth Bay hardcore, the next we've got Morrissey ... Nightmerica has some really good songs. But the album itself lacks direction and seems almost rushed ... there's just too much going on for one album. Especially from a band that many are not too familiar with." [...] Both reviewers likened Nightmerica to the first four albums by AFI.|$|E
2500|$|A 3-cent stamp {{was issued}} on July 13, 1937, {{to commemorate the}} 150th anniversary of the Northwest Territory {{as defined by the}} Ordinance of 1787. The Territory {{consisted}} of lands north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River ceded by eastern states. The Ordinance established the Territory, banned slavery, and specified that land must be purchased from the Indians and offered for sale by the United States. It also made provision for temporary and permanent governments and eventual statehood of included regions based on population. The stamp shows a map of the Territory which is flanked by Manasseh Cutler who drafted the ordinance, and Rufus Putnam, superintendent of territorial settlement. The 150th anniversary of establishment of the Mississippi Territory was celebrated by a 3-cent stamp on April 7, 1948. The vignette shows an outline map of the region of today’s Mississippi and Alabama. The present Mississippi is shown in a darker tone. The map is divided into three sections with dates 1798, 1804, and 1812, showing the growth of the Territory. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> is the original seal of the Territory on which the second double [...] "s" [...] of Mississippi is written as a single [...] "s."

2500|$|With the line-up secured, Red {{entered a}} {{longtime}} association with producer, songwriter, and musician Rob Graves. After they had recorded four demos {{in a garage}} and a nursery that displayed their style of alternative, hard and Christian rock music. Rauch, who had worked as an intern in the same Nashville studio as Graves and supplied them with free equipment, invited Graves {{to listen to their}} music for his opinions. Graves recalled: [...] "It was really rough, all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> but I could hear the elements were there ... I told them it was really good, it had potential". Graves took them under his wing, and paid for studio time and the production of their first demos at Paragon Studios which happened across two years. Graves then signed Red to a development contract with his independent production company Six Feet Over, which led to a recording deal with Provident Label Group which then assigned them to its Christian label Essential Records after they liked their demo. Essential gave Red the green-light on a full length album. Speaking on their Christian influence, Barnes said: [...] "We are Christians in a band, but if people feel more comfortable and say that we are a Christian band, we do not to shy away from that". Hendrix parted ways with Red before recording began; he was replaced by drummer Hayden Lamb.|$|E
2500|$|A vital {{contribution}} to mapping {{the reality of}} the world came with a scientific estimate of the circumference of the earth. This event has been described as the first scientific attempt to give geographical studies a mathematical basis. The man credited for this achievement was Eratosthenes (275–195 BC). As described by [...] George Sarton, historian of science, [...] "there was among them [...] a man of genius but as he was working in a new field they were too stupid to recognize him". His work, including On the Measurement of the Earth and Geographica, has only survived in the writings of later philosophers such as Cleomedes and Strabo. He was a devoted geographer who set out to reform and perfect the map of the world. Eratosthenes argued that accurate mapping, even if in two dimensions only, depends upon the establishment of accurate linear measurements. He was the first to calculate the circumference of the Earth (within 0.5 percent accuracy) by calculating the heights of shadows at different points in Egypt at a given time. The first in Alexandria, the other further up the Nile, in the Ancient Egyptian city of Swenet (known in Greek as Syene) where reports of a well into which the sun shone only on the summer solstice, long existed. Proximity to the Tropic of Cancer being the dynamics creating the effect. [...] He had the distance between the two shadows calculated and then their height. From this he determined the difference in angle between the two points and calculated how large a circle would be made by adding {{in the rest of the}} degrees to 360. His great achievement in the field of cartography was the use of a new technique of charting with meridians, his imaginary north–south lines, and parallels, his imaginary west–east lines. These axis lines were placed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> of the earth with their origin in the city of Rhodes and divided the world into sectors. Then, Eratosthenes used these earth partitions to reference places on the map. He also divided Earth into five climatic regions: a torrid zone across the middle, two frigid zones at extreme north and south, and two temperate bands in between. He was also the first person to use the word [...] "geography".|$|E
