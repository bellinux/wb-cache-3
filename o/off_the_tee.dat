5|$|Maryland's {{special teams}} {{recorded}} one touchdown when Torrey Smith returned a kickoff for 99yards. After the first touchdown of the game, senior placekicker Obi Egekeze missed an extra {{point for the}} first time in his career. Early in the season, Egekeze missed his first five field goal attempts, but, prior to the Humanitarian Bowl, he had made all 64extra-point attempts of his career. After the first failed kick, Egekeze made the other five extra-point attempts of the game. The placekicker also erred when he attempted to kick the ball as it fell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tee,</b> resulting in a short 15-yard kick which was returned 36yards by Nevada to the Maryland nine-yard line.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Egekeze {{attempted}} {{to kick the}} ball as it fell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tee.</b> This resulted in an unintentional squib that was returned 36yards to the Terps' nine-yard line. Nevada's Kaepernick attempted to rush but was stopped for no gain. On the next play, he threw {{the ball into the}} end zone, but it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate, resulting in a touchback. The Terps started on their own 20-yard line, and running back Davin Meggett rushed for 13yards and a first down. Turner then linked up with freshman receiver Ronnie Tyler for another first down at the Maryland 49-yard line. After a false start penalty, the Terps were unable to gain a first down and punted the ball away. The ball rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Nevada started the final drive of the quarter at its 20-yard line. Kaepernick then passed for two first downs, picked up another due to a pass interference call against Maryland, and scrambled for yet another. He then handed off to Taua, who rushed 17yards for a touchdown. Nevada re-took the lead, 14–13, with 46 seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The game {{started with}} Maryland {{receiving}} the kick-off {{and on the}} first series, quarterback Chris Turner linked up with freshman Adrian Cannon for a 59-yard touchdown. However, placekicker Obi Egekeze missed the extra point. Nevada quarterback and Western Athletic Conference offensive player of the year, Colin Kaepernick, responded with a drive which included a 68-yard pass to the Maryland 3-yard line. The Terrapin defense stopped two rushing attempts by Vai Taua, but a short pass {{was good for the}} score, and with the extra point, Nevada took the lead 6–7. The Wolf Pack then kicked a 69-yard kick-off to Torrey Smith, who returned it 99yards for a second Maryland touchdown. Egekeze made good the extra point and Maryland regained the lead, 13–7. On the next kick-off, Egekeze attempted to kick the ball as it fell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tee,</b> resulting in a short squib, which was returned to the Terrapins' 9-yard line. Kaepernick threw into the endzone where it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate for a touchback, but the Terrapins were soon forced to punt. Kaepernick advanced the ball downfield before a Taua 17-yard touchdown run. In the next series, Maryland sophomore Morgan Green rushed for threeyards and then a 53-yard touchdown breakaway. Later, Turner converted on third down with a 16-yard toss to Ronnie Tyler and threw again to Tyler for a 14-yard touchdown. Turner tallied a two-point conversion with a throw to Davin Meggett, and Maryland led at halftime 28–14.|$|E

25|$|Hogan {{did this}} to prevent himself from ever hooking the ball <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tee.</b> By {{positioning}} his hands in this manner, he ensured that the club face would be slightly open upon impact, creating a fade (left to right ball flight) {{as opposed to a}} draw or hook (right to left ball flight).|$|E
25|$|At the 2006 Open Championship, Woods almost {{exclusively}} used long irons <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tee</b> (he hit driver only {{one time the}} entire week—the 16th hole of the first round), he missed just four fairways all week (hitting the fairway 92% of the time), and his score of −18 to par (three eagles, 19 birdies, 43 pars, and seven bogeys) was just one off of his major championship record −19, set at St Andrews in 2000 (since eclipsed by Jason Day). The victory was an emotional one for Woods, who dedicated his play to his father's memory.|$|E
25|$|Calm {{and sunny}} weather {{provided}} good scoring {{conditions for the}} opening round. Miguel Ángel Jiménez took the lead at 64 (−6), and past champions turned back the clock: five-time winner Tom Watson, age 59, carded a bogey-free 65, and both Mark Calcavecchia (1989, age 49) and Mark O'Meara (1998, 52) shot 67. Ben Curtis, 2003 champion, also opened with 65 to join Watson and Kenichi Kuboya, who was even par through 14 holes, but finished birdie, birdie, eagle, birdie. Steve Stricker, Stewart Cink, and Camilo Villegas started strong at 66, and notables at 67 included Calcavecchia, O'Meara, Retief Goosen, Jim Furyk, Mike Weir, and Vijay Singh. Two-time defending champion Pádraig Harrington had a quiet 69, while Tiger Woods struggled <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tee</b> for 71. Two-time champion Greg Norman, the previous year's Cinderella story, had a disappointing 77.|$|E
5000|$|... 11-4 - <b>Teeing</b> <b>off</b> {{from outside}} <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> ground {{is not a}} penalty in match play, but the {{opponent}} may require the stroke be cancelled and replayed from within <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> ground. <b>Teeing</b> <b>off</b> from outside <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> ground is a two-stroke penalty in stroke play and a ball must then be played from <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> area. <b>The</b> stroke made from outside <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> area and subsequent strokes made at that ball do not count.|$|R

500|$|When Woods first {{joined the}} PGA Tour in 1996, his long drives {{had a large}} impact on the world of golf. However, {{when he did not}} upgrade his {{equipment}} in the following years (insisting upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance), many opponents caught up to him. Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using [...] "inferior equipment", which did not sit well with Nike, Titleist or Woods. During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and graphite shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, {{made him one of the}} Tour's lengthiest players <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tee</b> once again.|$|E
2500|$|The young Hogan {{was badly}} afflicted by hooking the golf ball.

2500|$|Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, {{a modern}} PGA Tour tournament venue, {{is also known}} as [...] "Hogan's Alley" [...] and may have the better claim to the {{nickname}} as it was his home course after his retirement, and he was an active member of Colonial as well for many years.

2500|$|Many other {{innovative}} {{steps were}} taken by Travis throughout his career. [...] His use of the Schenectady center-shafted putter in his British Amateur victory attracted considerable comment and controversy. [...] Some six years later, the Royal and Ancient would issue a ban on all mallet-headed putters, including the Schenectady. [...] Travis conducted careful experiments with varying lengths of driver shafts, often using a driver with a shaft as long as 50inches in his search for greater distance <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tee.</b> [...] At his home course, Garden City Golf Club, Travis installed smaller sized cups on the practice green to help hone the accuracy of his putting.|$|E
2500|$|Marquis is an {{excellent}} hitter for his position. Though not unheard of for pitchers, Marquis is sometimes called upon to pinch hit, something that is extraordinarily rare for a modern-day pitcher. He constantly hits <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tee</b> in batting cages. His baserunning speed has also led to him {{being used as a}} pinch-runner. [...] "Watch Marquis take batting practice", wrote John Schlegel for MLB.com, [...] "and you think you're watching a left-handed slugger. He can ping baseballs off the bleachers with the best of them. Watch him run up the first-base line with the speed of an outfielder and the intensity of a linebacker, and you can't believe he's a pitcher." ...|$|E
2500|$|Norman had a {{bold and}} {{aggressive}} style of play. He {{is widely regarded}} as one of the best drivers of the golf ball in his era, and perhaps the greatest in golf history. In the fourteen seasons between 1984 and 1997, Norman finished in the top 20 in total driving on the PGA Tour twelve times and in the top 6 nine times (including first in 1988, 1989, and 1993). [...] When driving long and straight <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tee</b> with a persimmon (wood) clubhead in his prime, Norman intimidated many of his fellow professionals. His high ball flight enabled him to carry the ball very long distances. In 2009, Nick Price said: [...] "The best driver I ever saw was Greg Norman." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{fourth hole}} (Morse Pond) {{is one of}} the most {{demanding}} holes at University Ridge. This par 4 that plays 467 yards requires a carry over Morse Pond <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>tee.</b> On <b>the</b> uphill approach to the long narrow green, a collection of deep bunkers short right of the green must be taken into account.|$|R
50|$|The seventh hole (Starz) is the {{shortest}} par 4 on the course, measuring to just 321 yards from <b>the</b> back <b>tees.</b> Beginning at an elevated tee and ending at an elevated green, many players may take a crack at <b>the</b> green <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>tee,</b> though <b>the</b> safer play is to hit a layup {{down the middle of}} the fairway and then a wedge onto the large green.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Sabin's {{expression}} suddenly changed. His body, {{as though}} by instinct, fell into position. He scarcely altered his stand {{an inch from}} the position he had first taken up. Wolfenden, who had expected a half-swing, was amazed at the wonderfully lithe, graceful movement with which he stooped down and the club flew round his shoulder. Clean and true the ball flew <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tee</b> in a perfectly direct line--a capital drive only a little short of the two hundred yards. Master and servant watched it critically.|$|E
