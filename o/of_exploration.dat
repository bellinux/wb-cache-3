5|$|The {{expedition}} inferred {{the position}} of the South Magnetic Pole, and made substantial observations of the zoology and botany of the region, resulting in a monograph on the zoology, and a series of four detailed monographs by Hooker on the botany, collectively called Flora Antarctica and published in parts between 1843 and 1859. The expedition was the last major voyage <b>of</b> <b>exploration</b> made wholly under sail.|$|E

5|$|The {{revival of}} {{learning}} during the European Renaissance {{renewed interest in}} plants. The church, feudal aristocracy and an increasingly influential merchant class that supported science and the arts, now jostled {{in a world of}} increasing trade. Sea voyages <b>of</b> <b>exploration</b> returned botanical treasures to the large public, private, and newly established botanic gardens, and introduced an eager population to novel crops, drugs and spices from Asia, the East Indies and the New World.|$|E
5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent <b>of</b> <b>exploration</b> and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} show human use of ivory to date {{back more than}} 35,000 years. It has been exported to Europe since at least Classical antiquity, but exporting accelerated during the Age <b>of</b> <b>Exploration</b> and colonisation of Africa. At its peak, {{at the end of}} the 19th century and early 20th century, with the rise of mass production, well over 1000 tons of ivory were exported to Europe yearly. In the last quarter of the 19th century, the city of Sheffield, England alone imported 180 tons just for cutlery handles. In the 1970s, Japan became the largest consumer of ivory, accounting for about 40% of all trade worldwide, with Hong Kong acting as the largest trade hub.|$|E
5|$|Bloodlines is {{presented}} from first- and third-person perspectives. The player assigns their character {{to one of}} several vampire clanseach with unique powers, customizes their combat and dialog abilities and progresses through Bloodlines using violent and nonviolent methods. The selection of clan affects how the player is perceived in the game world, and which powers and abilities they possess; this opens up different avenues <b>of</b> <b>exploration</b> and methods of interacting with or manipulating other characters. The player is able to complete side missions away from the primary storyline by moving freely between the available hubs: Santa Monica, Hollywood, downtown Los Angeles, and Chinatown.|$|E
5|$|Bristol was a {{starting}} place for early voyages <b>of</b> <b>exploration</b> to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 John Cabot, a Venetian, {{became the first}} European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 William Weston, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At {{the height of the}} Bristol slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The Port of Bristol has since moved from Bristol Harbour in the city centre to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Dock.|$|E

In clear water conditions, the upturned hull can be seen reaching to within 5m of the surface. The brass letters that formed Royal Oaks name were removed as a keepsake by a recreational diver in the 1970s. They were returned almost twenty years later, and are now displayed in the Scapa Flow visitor centre in Lyness. Royal Oaks loss is commemorated in an annual ceremony in which Royal Navy divers place the White Ensign underwater at her stern.|$|E
5|$|Deus Exs {{gameplay}} combines {{elements of}} the first-person shooter with stealth elements, adventure, and role-playing genres, allowing for its tasks and missions {{to be completed in}} a variety of ways, that in turn lead to differing outcomes.

The player is able to complete side missions away from the primary storyline by moving freely around the available areas, which can reward the player with experience points to upgrade abilities and alternative ways to tackle main missions.|$|E
5|$|Human {{history of}} the Grand Teton region dates back at least 11,000years, when the first nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} Paleo-Indians began migrating into the region during warmer months pursuing food and supplies. In the early 19thcentury, the first White explorers encountered the eastern Shoshone natives. Between 1810 and 1840, the region attracted fur trading companies that vied {{for control of the}} lucrative beaver pelt trade. U.S. Government expeditions to the region commenced in the mid-19thcentury as an offshoot <b>of</b> <b>exploration</b> in Yellowstone, with the first permanent white settlers in Jackson Hole arriving in the 1880s.|$|E
