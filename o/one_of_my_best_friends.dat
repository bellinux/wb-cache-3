So, we had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E

I'm giving our commander in chief a chance before I start grabbing. So far, I'm cool with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dean Norris as Hank Schrader– Marie's husband, Walter and Skyler's {{brother-in-law}} and a DEA agent. At {{the beginning}} of the series, Hank was intended to be the [...] "comic relief." [...] Norris, who has played several cops before in film and television, stated: Having played so many cops, I've talked with a lot of technical advisers, so I've been able to pick up a lot. Coincidentally, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> growing up is a cop in Chicago, and one of my other best friends out in LA is a sheriff. So I get to see all the components of that culture.|$|E

Bill, I am sorry that the unpleasant incidents {{of the last}} gubernatorial campaign had to mar our long friendship. I hope that our differences have been resolved, and we may now renew our friendship." [...] Passman also issued a public statement saying that Dodd had not enriched himself while in public office, despite contrary reports presented to Passman. Such reports had come from Earl Long, who was then temporarily estranged from Dodd, but Passman never mentioned the source.|$|E
2500|$|Originally from Chicago, Illinois, Lewis {{had several}} run-ins {{with the law}} during the 1880s and early 90s. In 1880, Lewis was arrested for the {{shooting}} of Boston thief Billy Flynn in Detroit but was acquitted by a jury who ruled he had acted in self-defense. He later made the acquaintance of Gen. John A. Logan and, one night while dining {{with him at the}} Fifth Avenue Hotel, a hotel detective informed Logan of Lewis's identity. Logan scoffed at the detective's claim and remarked [...] "Why sir, that man is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friends.</b> You have made a terrible mistake here". Lewis excused himself after borrowing $500 from him and disappeared. He similarly befriended Charles Francis Adams and lured the elderly man into a Boston Common banco game where he and his friends swindled him out of several thousand dollars. Later in Philadelphia, he represented himself to Samuel J. Randall as the son of banker A.J. Drexel. He was apparently so convincing that, when the actual son of Drexel called on the house by chance, Ramsden believed the young man was the impostor and threw him out of his home. He and another noted banco man, [...] "Western Sam", spent an entire summer in Long Branch, New Jersey where they conned over $100,000 from residents. 3 May 1896 ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a topical}} 1973 storyline, Erica aborts the baby she conceives {{with her first}} husband, Jeff Martin (Charles Frank). This is the first legal {{abortion}} aired on American television since the landmark Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling. However, Maude Findlay had an abortion on Maude the year before, after New York legalized the practice. Erica was chosen for this storyline {{as a way to}} prevent controversy. Since she was a bad girl and not one of the heroines, her choice would not be viewed as something the show supported. The show also protected themselves from controversy by writing Erica as mentally blocking out the abortion and, for a time, believing she miscarried. Viewers loved the story and Erica became a symbol of free choice. Erica develops a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion. [...] "Erica's abortion was simply because she didn't want to have a child, and I think if you do that now, you would perhaps hurt your character," [...] said former All My Children head writer Megan McTavish. McTavish later rewrote the story so the doctor, Greg Madden (Ian Buchanan), transplants the aborted fetus into his infertile wife. They raise the child, Josh Madden (Colin Egglesfield), as their son without Erica's knowledge. Inkling Magazine pointed out how unrealistic this storyline was because [...] "the techniques by which abortion is performed don't exactly lend themselves to excising an embryo viable enough to survive in another woman's womb." [...] The magazine said more likelihood existed in the possibility that Madden harvested Erica's eggs during the procedure, though an invasive surgery like that going unnoticed appeared unlikely as well. Egglesfield gained different information on the probability of the story. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, he said, [...] "Actually, my father is an obstetrician/gynecologist and my brother is a doctor, as is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friends,</b> and their collective opinion is that this is possible; it is possible to take a fetus out of one woman and place it into the womb of another woman, but it's only possible within the first week of pregnancy, before the fetus actually starts attaching itself to the uterine lining." [...] In the storyline, Greg harbors an obsession with Erica, which motivates him to choose her for the transplant in the first place. Greg and Josh make their first appearances in 2005. Greg's wife recently died and he moves to Pine Valley for closer proximity to Erica under the guise of opening a clinic. Josh follows him soon afterward and, not knowing Erica is his mother, attempts to destroy Erica in order to steal her fame for himself. Erica discovers the truth and is eventually able to form a relationship with him. In 2009, All My Children let Egglesfield go and killed off Josh. Zach Slater (Thorsten Kaye) shoots him and Erica is then forced {{to decide whether or not}} to donate Josh's heart to a seriously ill Kendall. [...] "The first thought that came to my mind when I was told the storyline and read the script was Sophie's Choice," [...] said Lucci. Erica reluctantly agrees to the transplant. Lucci said she believed this decision would [...] "haunt" [...] Erica because, if Kendall's life was not in the balance, she would have put more effort into saving Josh.|$|E
