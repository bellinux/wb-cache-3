5|$|Despite his willing {{adherence}} to the Southern position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> were dividing the country, Mallory was not prominent in the secession movement. He advocated reconciliation almost up to the moment that Florida passed its ordnance of secession. That occurred on January 10, 1861, making Florida the third state (behind South Carolina and Mississippi) to leave the Union. On January 21, Mallory delivered his farewell speech in the United States Senate.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the advice}} of his older brother, Breckinridge {{obtained}} his law license on January 3, 1824, but the practice of law did not suit him. He instead decided to follow the family tradition and seek public office, campaigning for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. Even in his early political career, he began to articulate his stance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> would become his legacy.|$|E

All that you need to do to keep the South is for Reagan to run in place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> he's campaigned on since 1964, and that's fiscal conservatism, balancing the budget, cut taxes, you know, the whole cluster.|$|E
500|$|After {{the death}} of Pierre Trudeau in 2000, Harper wrote an {{editorial}} criticizing Trudeau's policies as they affected Western Canada.

Harper subsequently accused Trudeau of promoting [...] "unabashed socialism", and argued that Canadian governments between 1972 and 2002 had restricted economic growth through [...] "state corporatism".|$|E

500|$|Representing {{as he did}} a {{state in}} the Deep South, Mallory could hardly have avoided taking a public stance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> were tearing the nation apart. The {{occasion}} arose when the Senate considered the admission of Kansas to the Union. Its Lecompton Constitution would allow slavery in Kansas, and citizens who were against extending the practice into new territories seized upon the widespread irregularities in the adoption procedure to oppose it. Senator Preston King of New York mounted a two-hour attack on the constitution and Southern policy in general, following which Mallory replied in what his biographers describe as [...] "probably his most effective speech in the Senate." [...] One segment of his talk presented the rationale of the slave-holders in their unwillingness to accept majority rule. Addressing the question whether the constitution had been ratified by [...] "the people," [...] he said: [...] "States have conferred, and may at any time confer, their whole political power on a minority. They may make disqualifications dependent upon the tenure of freehold estate, upon the payment of tax, upon militia duty, or upon the color of skin; but whoever the State chooses to confer her political authority upon, are the people." [...] He foresaw the decline in relative power of the slave-holding states, although at this time {{he did not believe}} it would necessarily lead to secession. He concluded his remarks by a pledge to follow the South whatever happened: [...] "It is not for me to indicate the path she [...] may, in her wisdom, pursue; but, sir, ... my whole heart is with her, and she will find me treading it with undivided affections." ...|$|E

50|$|Raley's {{elective}} office career {{was cut short}} when a successful smear campaign falsely accused him of attempting to directly eliminate the very popular slot machines (gambling) that {{were all over the}} county at the time.

50|$|Some folklorists have {{analyzed}} Sleeping Beauty as {{indicating the}} replacement of the lunar year (with its thirteen months, symbolically depicted by the full thirteen fairies) by the solar year (which has twelve, symbolically the invited fairies).

2500|$|The {{complexity}} of family {{history and the}} uncovering of tragedy in that history is fundamental to the book.

Sharon Rattan, Acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Gender Affairs said the Gender Affairs Department wants to reach out more to men as previously they focused mostly on women issues. Rattan told WINN FM that it was their hope to use the opportunity to gather {{more information about the}} issues affecting men to guide their plan of action in the future.
