He notes the negative influence of the impersonality of virtual communities on offline interaction and the consequence of Internet addiction. Sherry Turkle states: [...] "We discovered the network - the world of connectivity - to be uniquely suited to the overworked and <b>overscheduled</b> life it makes possible. And now we look to the network to defend us against loneliness even as we want it to control the intensity of our connections".|$|E

5000|$|<b>Overscheduling</b> is a {{term used}} in {{describing}} the manipulation of capacity available for the transportation of electricity along power lines. Power lines have a defined maximum load. Lines must be booked (or scheduled) in advance for transporting bought-and-sold quantities of electricity. [...] "Overscheduling" [...] means a deliberate reservation of more line usage than is actually required and can create the appearance that the power lines are congested. <b>Overscheduling</b> {{was one of the}} building blocks of a number of scams. For example, the Death Star group of scams played on the market rules which required the state to pay [...] "congestion fees" [...] to alleviate congestion on major power lines. [...] "Congestion fees" [...] were a variety of financial incentives aimed at ensuring power providers solved the congestion problem. But in the Death Star scenario, the congestion was entirely illusory and the congestion fees would therefore simply increase profits.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} issues {{in the design of}} the concepts-of-operations for NEXTGEN is the {{equitable}} allocation of <b>overscheduled</b> National Airspace System (NAS) resources. Although federal regulations, Congressional policies, and modernization plans call for equitable allocation of publicly held resources, the mechanisms for equitable allocation, and the trade-offs that must be made between stakeholders, exhibit a high degree of social, political, and economic complexity. Further, the allocations that are routinely made in Traffic Flow Management (TFM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) are subject to widespread perceptions of systemic inequity and economic inefficiency. This paper describes the properties associated with the dynamic allocation of an <b>overscheduled</b> resource. The mathematical model demonstrates that (i) a natural equity asymmetry exists in the first-scheduled/first-allocated mechanism, (ii) this asymmetry results in a low probability (< 10 %) of an equitable allocation of resources amongst groups of flights (e. g. airlines), and (iii) increased competition reduces the likelihood of equitable allocations. These theoretical results establish the "feasible space " in which claims of equity can be made, suggests refinements of the existing allocation schemes, and establishes the framework for a regulatory role in proposed market-based mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract—Software crisis {{refers to}} the {{situation}} in which the developers are not able to complete the projects within time and budget constraints and moreover these <b>overscheduled</b> and over budget projects are of low quality as well. Several methodologies have been adopted form time to time to overcome this situation and now in the focus is component based software engineering. In this approach, emphasis is on reuse of already existing software artifacts. But the results can not be achieved just by preaching the principles; they need to be practiced as well. This paper highlights some of the very basic elements of this approach, which has to be in place to get the desired goals of high quality, low cost with shorter time-tomarket software products...|$|E

40|$|Students who {{participate}} in extracurricular activities generally benefit from the many opportunities afforded them. Benefits of participating in extracurricular activities included having better grades, having higher standardized test scores and higher educational attainment, attending school more regularly, and having higher a higher selfconcept.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Student athletes {{frequently}} report {{sleep disturbances}} due to <b>overscheduling</b> and balancing academics and athletics.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the National College Health Assessment of US college/university students from 2011 - 2014 (N= 8, 683 student athletes). Overall academic performance (GPA) was self-reported. Sleep difficulties included: report of "sleep difficulties" being "traumatic or very difficult to handle" over the past 12 months (SLEEP-DIFFICULTY), extreme difficulty falling asleep ≥ 3 nights/week (INSOMNIA), extreme daytime tiredness ≥ 3 days/week (TIREDNESS), nights/week of insufficient sleep (INSUFFICIENT-SLEEP), and whether sleep difficulties interfered with academics (INTERFERE). Multinomial regression analyses (Reference=A) were adjusted for age, sex, and survey year. RESULTS: Prevalence was 20...|$|R
30|$|Another {{issue that}} the client company may face is the {{difficulty}} of achieving points 1 and 2 at the same time. The most competent domain experts are usually the most overloaded people in the company, which makes it extremely difficult to take them away from their daily activities {{so that they can}} devote half of their time to the project. Consultants identified three approaches for the client companies to solve the issue of <b>overscheduling.</b> The first is to have the domain experts, being the key-users, work overtime {{for the duration of the}} project, which requires extremely high motivation. Another approach is to nominate people with less experience but more time as key-users and to grant them access to the domain experts when needed. This resolves overload of the experts but poses additional communication issues between the non-expert key-users and the domain experts. The third solution identified is to hire part-time, additional staff to perform the daily activities, so that the domain experts can concentrate on the project.|$|R
40|$|Integrating wind {{generation}} {{into power}} systems and wholesale electricity markets presents unique challenges {{due to the}} characteristics of wind power, including its limited dispatchability, variability in generation, difficulty in forecasting resource availability, and the geographic location of wind resources. Texas has {{had to deal with}} many of these issues beginning in 2002 when it restructured its electricity industry and introduced aggressive renewable portfolio standards that helped spur major investments in wind generation. In this paper we discuss the issues that have arisen in designing market protocols that take account of these special characteristics of wind generation and survey the regulatory and market rules that have been developed in Texas. We discuss the perverse incentives some of the rules gave wind generators to <b>overschedule</b> generation in order to receive balancing energy payments, and steps that have been taken to mitigate those incentive effects. Finally, we discuss more recent steps taken by the market operator and regulators to ensure transmission capacity is available for new wind generators that are expected to come online in the future.

40|$|Forty {{teams of}} three {{participants}} were recruited from the general public in the Boston area via internet advertising and invited to the laboratory for a session of up to five hours. Fiftyone {{percent of the participants}} were male, and they ranged in age from 18 to 66 (M= 32. 1, SD= 12. 33). All participants were paid for their participation.

40|$|Airport gates {{are one of}} the {{congestion}} {{points of}} the air transportation system. When an arriving flight lands on a runway, it is possible that it cannot pull into its gate. We define this phenomenon as gate-waiting delay. This paper analyzes the degree to which gate waiting is a problem and the functional causes of gate waiting. Analysis of flight performance data for the OEP 35 airportsa for the summer of 2007 identified that: (i) Significant gate-waiting delays, in which more than 30 % of arriving aircraft are delayed, occurred at 10 of the OEP 35 airports, (ii) major gate-waiting delays are rare events (e. g., once a month at ATL), (iii) Gate-waiting delays are usually different among major carriers due to different scheduling strategies. For example, Delta schedules more aggressively on their gate capacity (<b>overscheduling)</b> than JetBlue at JFK. (iv) Functional origins of gate-waiting delay included compressed arrivals, extended gate occupancy times, reduced number of gates, and inflexible queueing disciplines (across carriers and within one carrier). Many of these origins are related to schedule disruptions which are the main common factor identified in the worst days. The methodology for analysis, the results, and the implications of these results are discussed. I...|$|R
40|$|Plan B Paper. 2014. Master of Science in Education- Montessori [...] University of Wisconsin-River Falls. Teacher Education Department. 64 leaves. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 61 - 63). Children {{are inherently}} connected to nature and fascinated by living things; {{there is a}} significant body of research discussing the benefits of children interacting with nature on a regular basis. Due to a variety of factors, including increased academic pressures in schools, <b>overscheduling</b> of extracurricular activities, increased reliance on technology for entertainment, and fear of children being left alone outdoors, children are spending more time indoors than ever before in our history. Connection to nature and inspiring wonder {{are an integral part of}} the Montessori Philosophy and Method. The Montessori Method also stresses that immersion in nature is imperative for proper physical and psychological development. In Montessori classrooms, there is an intrinsic connection between nature and many of the primary materials. In an action research project with a class of 39 children ages 4 - 6, a Montessori guide studied ways to integrate nature exploration via a Montessori primary curriculum, inside and outside of the classroom. The guide incorporated daily outdoor exploration in or around the woods, seasonal nature-related activities, access to Montessori botany and zoology and materials, live insect and small animal observation opportunities, daily read alouds related to nature, and gardening in a greenhouse. Data was collected through two parent surveys, children?s nature journals, photos of the children interacting with nature inside and outside, and anecdotal records. The research showed that by providing regular access to the outdoors along with multiple opportunities inside the classroom to explore nature and nature-related materials, the children became more connected with nature. For the future, the research suggests that increasing children's interactions with nature will influence environmentally responsible lifestyles and support children's development as young naturalists...|$|R
