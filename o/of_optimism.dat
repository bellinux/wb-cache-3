5|$|Where would {{science fiction}} be without the Statue of Liberty? For decades it has towered or crumbled above the wastelands of deserted arth—giants have uprooted it, aliens {{have found it}} curious... the symbol of Liberty, <b>of</b> <b>optimism,</b> {{has become a symbol}} of science fiction's pessimistic view of the future.|$|E
5|$|After the {{six years}} of absolutism that {{followed}} Ferdinand's return to the throne on 1 January 1820, Rafael del Riego initiated an army revolt {{with the intent of}} restoring the 1812 Constitution. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after an unstable period, a French invasion supported by an alliance of the major powers had removed the constitutional government. The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824. Their balance <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> and cynicism makes it difficult to relate them directly to particular moments in these rapidly moving events.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} <b>of</b> unrealistic <b>optimism</b> {{with regard}} to a genetic risk situation was investigated within a group of female adults (study 1) {{and a group of}} adolescents (study 2). In both studies, the indirect method of measurement elicited a significant optimistic bias. Contrary to Weinstein (1982, 1987) we found no relation between the direct or indirect measures <b>of</b> unrealistic <b>optimism</b> and personal experience with the risk, perceived frequency of occurrence or perceived preventability of the risk. Trait-Anxiety was significantly related to the extent <b>of</b> unrealistic <b>optimism,</b> but only when the direct measure was used. Together {{with the fact that the}} indirect measure resulted in a much stronger bias than the direct one, this suggests that there exists an important difference between both measures. Further research on the measurement <b>of</b> unrealistic <b>optimism</b> and on its determinants in specific risk situations is needed. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Nedim Gürsel {{wrote his}} 2001 novel Le voyage de Candide à Istanbul about a minor passage in Candide during which its protagonist meets Ahmed III, the deposed Turkish sultan. This chance meeting {{on a ship}} from Venice to Istanbul is the setting of Gürsel's book. Terry Southern, in writing his popular novel Candy with Mason Hoffenberg adapted Candide for a modern {{audience}} and changed the protagonist from male to female. Candy deals with the rejection of a sort <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> which the author sees in women's magazines of the modern era; Candy also parodies pornography and popular psychology. This adaptation of Candide was itself adapted for the cinema by director Christian Marquand in 1968.|$|E
5|$|On {{the kickoff}} {{following}} the field goal, Georgia head coach Mark Richt ordered an unorthodox onside kick. Surprised by the unexpected play, the Virginia Tech coverage team {{was unable to}} recover the ball, which was leapt upon by the kicker, Brian Mimbs. With a new chance at offense and a sense <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> triggered by the successful onside kick, Georgia drove down the field. Aided by 20yards in penalties against Virginia Tech, the drive resulted in a six-yard touchdown pass to Martrez Milner. The touchdown and extra point boosted Georgia's morale and cut the score to 21–13, Virginia Tech leading by eight.|$|E
5|$|Some {{essential}} {{features of}} Modernisme were: an anticlassical language inherited from Romanticism with {{a tendency to}} lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that produced an overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; a strong sense <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> and faith in progress that produced an emphatic art that reflected the atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the esthetic of the bourgeoisie.|$|E

5|$|When Octavian {{returned}} to Rome {{two years after}} defeating Mark Antony, no one remained to oppose him. Decades of war had taken a terrible toll on the People of Rome. The political situation was unstable, {{and there was a}} constant threat of renewed warfare. Octavian's arrival alone caused a wave <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> to ripple throughout Italy. As soon as he arrived, he began addressing the problems that were plaguing Rome. Octavian's popularity soon reached new heights, which ultimately gave him the support he needed to implement his reforms. When Octavian deposed Mark Antony in 32 BC, he resigned his position as triumvir, but was probably vested with powers similar to those that he had given up.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{warnings}} given by Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup, {{commander of the}} ROK 1st Infantry Division, a general feeling <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> about {{the outcome of the}} war prevented {{the warnings}} from being taken seriously. With the fighting reached a stalemate at Unsan, General Walton Walker of the Eighth United States Army ordered the US 8th Cavalry Regiment of the US 1st Cavalry Division to resume offensives north by relieving the ROK 12th Regiment. By the time the US 8th Cavalry Regiment reached Unsan on 29 October, the ROK 11th Infantry Regiment of the ROK 1st Infantry Division was also pulling out of Unsan. At the same time, the Chinese had destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division on the east of Unsan. Unsan had now became a northern salient in the UN line containing only the US 8th Cavalry Regiment and the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season with a sense <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense that led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a Monday Night Football game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says {{he has never seen}} video of the play and never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} a new owner in Lerner and of manager Martin O'Neill marked {{the start of a}} new period <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> at Villa Park and {{sweeping}} changes occurred throughout the club including a new badge, a new kit sponsor and team changes in the summer of 2007. The first Cup final of the Lerner era came in 2010 when Villa were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup Final. Villa made a second trip to Wembley in that season losing 3–0 to Chelsea in the FA Cup semifinal. Just five days before the opening day of the 2010–11 season, O'Neill resigned as manager, and after one year with Gérard Houllier in charge, Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish, despite numerous protests from fans against his appointment; this was the first time that a manager had moved directly between the two rivals. McLeish's contract was terminated at the end of the 2011–12 season after Villa finished in 16th place, and he was replaced by Paul Lambert. In February 2012, the club announced a financial loss of £53.9million, and Lerner put the club up for sale three months later, with an estimated value of £200 million. With Lerner still on board, in the 2014–15 season Aston Villa scored just 12 goals in 25 league games, the lowest in Premier League history, and Lambert was sacked in February 2015. Tim Sherwood succeeded him, and steered the club away from relegation while also leading them to the 2015 FA Cup Final, but he was sacked in the 2015–16 season, as was his successor Rémi Garde, in a campaign ended with Villa relegated for the first time since 1987.|$|E
