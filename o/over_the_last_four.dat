40|$|Abstract. Here we re-examine the {{official}} Atlantic basin tropical cyclone (hurricane) database HURDAT (1851 – 2008) and quantify differences between wind speed distributions {{in the early}} historical (1851 – 1943) record and more recent observations.

At all three geographical levels of study, distributions of windspeeds <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two, <b>four</b> and six decades display negligible dispersion or systematic change <b>over</b> time.

25|$|Before {{the late}} 20th century, {{suffrage}} — {{the right to}} vote — was so limited in most nations that turnout figures have little relevance to today. One exception was the United States, which had near universal white male suffrage by 1840. The U.S. saw a steady rise in voter turnout during the century, reaching its peak in the years after the Civil War. Turnout declined from the 1890s until the 1930s, then increased again until 1960 before beginning its current long decline. In Europe, voter turnouts steadily increased from the introduction of universal suffrage before peaking in the mid-to-late 1960s, with modest declines since then. These declines have been smaller than those in the United States, and in some European countries turnouts have remained stable and even slightly increased. Globally, voter turnout has decreased by about five percentage points <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> decades.|$|E
40|$|The main {{statement}} of the article is that Polish-Jewish and Jewish-Polish biographies have an ambiguous ontological status. The status, which the article describes as spectral, is traced in Polish literature <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> twenty <b>four</b> years (from mid- 80 s till now). Three conventions have been identified, which, because of their openness to ontologically incomplete beings, are good expressions of complications of biography and identity. The conventions are romance, genealogy, and horror. The writers who use these conventions aim at representing a concrete Polish-Jewish or Jewish-Polish biography, but the phantasmatic quality of combination of what is Polish with what is Jewish leads to unreality of all elements of a novel. Consequently, not only Jewish characters and Jewish identity, but also Poles and Polish identity become phantasmatic. Poznańskie Studia Polonistyczne. Seria Literack...|$|R

25|$|The {{location}} of Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean {{has a certain}} appeal given the closely related names. Popular culture often places Atlantis there, perpetuating the original Platonic setting as they understand it. The Canary Islands and Madeira Islands {{have been identified as}} a possible location, west of the Straits of Gibraltar, but in relative proximity to the Mediterranean Sea. Detailed studies of their geomorphology and geology have demonstrated, however, that they have been steadily uplifted, without any significant periods of subsidence, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>four</b> million years, by geologic processes such as erosional unloading, gravitational unloading, lithospheric flexure induced by adjacent islands, and volcanic underplating. Various islands or island groups in the Atlantic were also identified as possible locations, notably the Azores. Similarly, cores of sediment covering the ocean bottom surrounding the Azores and other evidence demonstrate that it has been an undersea plateau for millions of years. The submerged island of Spartel near the Strait of Gibraltar has also been suggested.|$|E
