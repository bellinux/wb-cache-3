Weir led an active retirement, {{contributing}} to several religious, charitable and welfare organisations and activities. These included the Norwood and Maylands Churches of Christ, Benevolent and Stranger's Friend Society, the <b>Our</b> <b>Boys</b> Institute (OBI), the Masonic Lodge, Cheer Up Society, and YMCA. At various times he served as President of the Commonwealth Club, the Churches of Christ Union, the St. Peters Sub-Branch of the Returned and Services League, and the Cheer Up Society.|$|E

25|$|The first {{uniform of}} the corps was a grey tunic with green facings, and a peaked cap with cock's feathers; in 1863 this was changed for a green uniform with red facings, similar to that worn by the 60th Rifles, with the {{exception}} of a broad red stripe on the trousers. The trouser stripe was done away with in 1875, when also the cap and feathers gave place to the busby and glengarry, the latter in 1884 being exchanged for the regulation army helmet, and soon perhaps <b>our</b> <b>boys</b> will all be seen in scarlet like their brothers of the Staffordshire battalions. The annual balls did not become popular, the last taking place in 1864; bazaars were held 14–17 October 1863, and 24–27 October 1876; athletic displays had been given (the first in May 1865).|$|E
500|$|Joe Wilson {{was educated}} at Launceston Grammar School. A talented junior sportsman, he {{regularly}} represented {{the school in}} football and cricket. He is first recorded playing football for the school's firsts in 1885, which is {{around the same time}} he first played for Launceston Football Club's seconds. The following summer he played cricket for his school and the <b>Our</b> <b>Boys</b> Cricket Club first XI. In one match for <b>Our</b> <b>Boys,</b> his batting was described by the Launceston Examiner as [...] "the feature of the game". In March 1886, Wilson dominated a match between his school and Horton College—he made 154 runs in his team's first innings, at the time the second highest individual score ever recorded at the Launceston Cricket Ground, and then took 17 wickets, including a hat-trick, for only 28 runs in Horton's two innings. At the conclusion of the cricket season, Wilson won two trophies from the <b>Our</b> <b>Boys</b> club—for highest individual score and highest batting average.|$|E
500|$|In June 1886, Wilson {{played his}} first match for Launceston Football Club's senior team, in a non-premiership game against Latrobe. He {{spent most of}} the season in the seconds and kicked one goal for the year. The next cricket season he again played for <b>Our</b> <b>Boys</b> and his school. On Boxing Day 1886, Wilson {{represented}} Northern Tasmania in the annual North v South match in Hobart. After a match in February 1887, Launceston's Daily Telegraph described Wilson as [...] "from his present form, fit for any eleven in Tasmania". At the conclusion of the cricket season, Wilson again represented Northern Tasmania, this time against the touring Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC).|$|E

500|$|Meredith's {{performances}} for Northwich {{gained the}} attention of several other clubs in the Football League. Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith {{did not wish to}} abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: [...] "It is all very well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal <b>our</b> <b>boys</b> away... <b>Our</b> <b>boys</b> are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished." [...] Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.|$|E
500|$|Olympic gold medallist Steve Redgrave {{presented}} Cambridge {{with the}} Beefeater Trophy and both crews with their medals. [...] Oxford's coach Mijnders said [...] "After the big bend, Cambridge were actually flying ... the further the race went on, the better Cambridge rowed". Cambridge coach Williams noted [...] "Some of <b>our</b> <b>boys</b> took some {{stick in the}} press, but they responded to the pressure and were brilliant." [...] Oxford's stroke and Olympic bronze medallist Tim Foster told his crew [...] "We'll always remember we lost the Boat Race, but don't forget we are still good rowers." [...] Cadoux-Hudson stated {{in an interview that}} there were two occasions where the blades clashed: [...] "Cambridge were being warned on one occasion and Oxford on the other, so I think it equalled out at the end. I don't think it affected the outcome".|$|E
500|$|Trotter {{returned}} to the United States in July 1919 to learn of ongoing race riots at major cities across the country. Postwar economic and social tensions had erupted, and blacks fought back against white violence {{in cities such as}} Chicago and Omaha. Trotter quickly supported active resistance to white-on-black violence, writing, [...] "Unless the white American behaves, he will find that in teaching <b>our</b> <b>boys</b> to fight for him he was starting something that he {{will not be able to}} stop." [...] His writings prompted calls in Congress for the censorship of the Negro press: South Carolina Congressman James F. Byrnes accused Trotter of [...] "doing his utmost to incite riots and bloodshed." [...] Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge gave Trotter a chance to testify during Senate deliberations on ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, which Lodge opposed on grounds other than Trotter's. Lodge's opposition was successful: the Senate never ratified the treaty.|$|E

500|$|The Wessel family, {{influenced}} by {{the politics of the}} father, avidly supported the monarchist German National People's Party (DNVP), and when he was 15, Wessel joined the DNVP's youth group Bismarckjugend ("Bismarck Youth"), from which he resigned in 1925. He began to frequent low-life bars and hang out in flophouses, and also founded his own youth group, the Knappschaft, the purpose of which was to [...] "raise <b>our</b> <b>boys</b> to be real German men." [...] He also joined the Wiking League ("Viking League"), a paramilitary group founded by Hermann Ehrhardt [...] the stated goal of which was to effect [...] "the revival of Germany on a national and ethnic basis through the spiritual education of its members" [...] near the end of 1923. He soon became a local leader, engaging in street battles with youth members of their adversarial groups, such as the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Communist Party (KPD). Later, Wessel joined groups with a more sinister reputation, including the Black Reichswehr and the [...] "Olympia German Association for Physical Training", a powerful paramilitary group which was the successor of the disbanded Reinhard Regiment.|$|E
