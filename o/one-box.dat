40|$|Philosophers {{debate whether}} <b>one-boxing</b> or two-boxing is the {{rational}} {{act in a}} Newcomb situation. I shall argue that <b>one-boxing</b> is the only rational choice. This is so {{because there is no}} intelligible aim by reference to which you can justify the choice of two-boxing over <b>one-boxing</b> once you have come to think that you will two-box (whereas there is such an aim by reference to which you can justify <b>one-boxing).</b> The only aim by which the agent in the Newcomb situation can justify his two-boxing is the subjunctively described aim of ‘getting more than I would if I were to one-box’. But such a subjunctively described aim can justify an action only if it can be seen as generating, in conjunction with the agent’s beliefs, an indicatively describable aim which justifies the action. In the case of the Newcomb agent the aim of 'getting more than I would if I were to one-box’ cannot be seen in this way...|$|R

5000|$|An early alleged {{counterexample}} is Newcomb's problem. Because {{your choice}} {{of one or two}} boxes can't causally affect the Predictor's guess, causal decision theory recommends the two-boxing strategy. However, this results in getting only $1,000, not $1,000,000. Philosophers disagree whether <b>one-boxing</b> or two-boxing is the [...] "rational" [...] strategy. Similar concerns may arise even in seemingly-straightforward problems like the prisoner's dilemma, especially when playing opposite your [...] "twin" [...] whose choice to cooperate or defect correlates strongly, but is not caused by, your own choice.|$|R

40|$|The Newcomb {{problem is}} {{analysed}} {{here as a}} type of common cause problem. In relation to such problems, if you take the dominated option your expected outcome will be good and if you take the dominant option your expected outcome will be not so good. As is explained, however, these are not conventional conditional expected outcomes but 'conditional evidence expected outcomes' and while in the deliberation process, the evidence on which they are based is only hypothetical evidence. Conventional conditional expected outcomes are more sensitive to your current epistemic state in that they are based purely on actual evidence which is available to you during the deliberation process. So although they are conditional on a certain act being performed, they are not based on evidence that you would have only if that act is performed. Moreover, for any given epistemic state during the deliberation process, your conventional conditional expected outcome for the dominant option will be better than that for the dominated option. The principle of dominance is thus in perfect harmony with the conventional conditional expected outcomes. In relation to the Newcomb problem then, the evidence unequivocally supports two-boxing as the rational option. Yet what is advanced here is not simply a two-boxing strategy. To see why, two stages to the problem need to be recognised. The first stage is that which occurs before the information used by the predictor in making his predictions has been gained. The second stage is after this point. Provided that you are still in the first stage, you have an opportunity to influence whether or not the predictor places the $ 1 m in the opaque box. To maximise the probability that it is, you need to commit yourself to <b>one-boxing...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{sketch a}} decision-theoretic picture of {{instrumental}} rationality, which I call the Actual Value Conception: roughly, {{that you should}} align your preferences over your options to your best estimates of how the actual values of those options compare. Less roughly: for any options, q and 0, you are instrumentally rational {{if and only if}} you prefer q to / when, and only when, your best estimate {{of the extent to which}} O's actual value exceeds 's is greater than your best estimate of the extent to which O's actual value exceeds O's, where an option's actual value equals the value you assign to the outcome that would actually result from performing it. In the first chapter, I argue that this picture underlies causal decision theory by showing that, given some assumptions, the two are equivalent, and that the picture unifies and underlies the intuitive arguments offered for Two- Boxing over <b>One-Boxing</b> in the Newcomb Problem. I also show that the picture is incompatible with evidential decision theory. Evidential decision theory sometimes recommends preferring one option to another even though you are certain that the actual value of the latter exceeds the actual value of the former. In the second chapter, I develop a decision theory for agents with incomplete preferences - called Actual Value Decision Theory - that, unlike its more popular competitors, is consistent with, and motivated by, the picture of instrumental rationality sketched in the first chapter. I argue that, in addition to being a generalization of causal decision theory, Actual Value Decision Theory is supported by many of the same considerations. In the final chapter, I consider two powerful arguments against Actual Value Decision Theory - the Most Reason Argument and the Agglomeration Argument - and I argue that, while neither proves to be fatal, they each bring to light some interesting consequences of taking the Actual Value Conception seriously. In particular: that, first, we should reject the idea that instrumental rationality consists in doing what you have the most reason to do; and, second, that sometimes it is rationally permissible to have non-transitive (but not cyclic) instrumental preferences. by Ryan Doody.

Foregoing the previous two-box design, in a design similar to the European Ford Transit, the Aerostar used a <b>one-box</b> design with the hood and windshield sloped at a similar angle. After the 1997 model year, the Aerostar was discontinued; Ford had largely replaced by 1995 with the Ford Windstar and the Mercury Villager (the latter built in a joint venture with Nissan). The Windstar would largely follow the design set in place by Chrysler, adopting front-wheel drive and unit-body construction based on a car platform.|$|E

Much of the vehicle's mechanicals were based on the Toyota Hilux, including suspension components.

50|$|A {{fastback}} sedan is a two-box sedan, with continuous slope {{from the}} roof {{to the base of}} the decklid (trunk lid), but excludes the hatchback feature.Marketing terminology is often misleading in this area - for example, Daimler AG incorrectly calls the Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class sedan a four-door coupé because its semi-fastback design tries to give the impression of a coupé. Certain sedans are edging close to being <b>one-box</b> vehicles, where the windshield is steeply raked from the hood/bonnet and the rear window slopes toward almost the end of the car, leaving just a short rear deck that is part of the trunk lid — the 2006 4-door JDM Honda Civic is an example of this. They are not fastbacks because their bodyline changes {{from the roof}} to the rear deck. Their steeply raked rear windows end with a decklid that does not continue down to the bumper.

40|$|In vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions, the {{characteristics}} of a vehicle's frontal shape and structural stiffness have a significant influence on the kinematics and injury risk of the pedestrian's body regions. In the present study, the kinematic behaviour and injury risk of the pedestrians were investigated in collisions against vehicles with different frontal shapes. The THUMS (Total HUman Model for Safety) pedestrian finite element (FE) model was used and impacted by three different types of vehicle FE models (passenger car, <b>one-box</b> vehicle and sport-utility vehicle [SUV]) representing the different frontal shapes at 40 km/h. In the simulation with the passenger car-to-pedestrian impact, the pedestrian wrapped around the hood, and the resulting bending moment of the lower extremity and head injury criterion (HIC) value were high. In the simulation with the <b>one-box</b> vehicle-to-pedestrian impact, the pedestrian's upper torso was directly hit by {{the front end of the}} vehicle. The pelvis and chest had contact with the stiff vehicle frontal panel, resulting in a high stress being observed on the rib cage. In the simulation with the SUV-to-pedestrian impact, the force of the pelvis was high due to the contact with the vehicle hood's leading edge. The results indicated that the frontal shape of the vehicle has a large effect on the pedestrian kinematic behaviour, including the impact velocity of the pelvis, chest, and head against the vehicle. Moreover, the stiffness of the vehicle structure can affect the deformation mode of the human body segments, such as the lower extremities and the rib cage.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the effects of}} vehicle impact velocity, vehicle front-end shape, and pedestrian size on injury risk to pedestrians in collisions with passenger vehicles with various frontal shapes. Method: A series of parametric studies was carried out using 2 total human model for safety (THUMS) pedestrian models (177 and 165 cm) and 4 vehicle finite element (FE) models with different front-end shapes (medium-size sedan, minicar, <b>one-box</b> vehicle, and sport utility vehicle [SUV]). The effects of the impact velocity on pedestrian injury risk were analyzed at velocities of 20, 30, 40, and 50 km/h. The dynamic response of the pedestrian was investigated, and the injury risk to the head, chest, pelvis, and lower extremities was compared {{in terms of the}} injury parameters head injury criteria (HIC), chest deflection, and von Mises stress distribution of the rib cage, pelvis force, and bending moment diagram of the lower extremities. Result: Vehicle impact velocity has the most significant influence on injury severity for adult pedestrians. All injury parameters can be reduced in severity by decreasing vehicle impact velocities. The head and lower extremities are at greater risk of injury in medium-size sedan and SUV collisions. The chest injury risk was particularly high in <b>one-box</b> vehicle impacts. The fracture risk of the pelvis was also high in <b>one-box</b> vehicle and SUV collisions. In minicar collisions, the injury risk was the smallest if the head did not make contact with the A-pillar. Conclusion: The vehicle impact velocity and vehicle front-end shape are 2 dominant factors that influence the pedestrian kinematics and injury severity. A significant reduction of all injuries can be achieved for all vehicle types when the vehicle impact velocity is less than 30 km/h. Vehicle designs consisting of a short front-end and a wide windshield area can protect pedestrians from fatalities. The results also could be valuable in the design of a pedestrian-friendly vehicle front-end shape...|$|E
