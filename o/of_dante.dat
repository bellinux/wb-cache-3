5|$|Dante {{has become}} one of the most popular {{characters}} in gaming, having been recognized for his role in the Devil May Cry series and various characteristics that have attracted gamers such as his cocky attitude. However, Dante's redesign and characterization in the reboot was the subject of controversy amongst gamers as he comes across unlikable in comparison to original one as well as other characters. Nevertheless, video game publications have defended this version <b>of</b> <b>Dante.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{involvement}} <b>of</b> <b>Dante</b> and Petrarch {{in establishing}} the sestina form, together with the contributions {{of others in the}} country, account for its classification as an Italian verse form—despite not originating there. The result was that the sestina was re-imported into France from Italy in the 16th century. Pontus de Tyard was the first poet to attempt the form in French, and the only one to do so prior to the 19th century; he introduced a partial rhyme scheme in his sestina.|$|E
5|$|Many {{argue that}} the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th-century Florence, in {{particular}} with the writings <b>of</b> <b>Dante</b> Alighieri (1265–1321) and Petrarch (1304–1374), {{as well as the}} paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti won). Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance. Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Lives {{constitute}} {{the first two}} volumes of Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal. The poet, journalist, and literary historian James Montgomery contributed the biographies <b>of</b> <b>Dante,</b> Ariosto, and Tasso. Historian of science Sir David Brewster contributed that of Galileo. Mary Shelley contributed the rest: Petrarch, Boccaccio, Lorenzo de'Medici, Marsiglio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Angelo Poliziano, Bernardo Pulci, Luca Pulci, Luigi Pulci, Cieco Da Ferrara, Burchiello, Bojardo, Berni, Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Vittoria Colonna, Guarini, Chiabrera, Tassoni, Marini, Filicaja, Metastasio, Goldoni, Alfieri, Monti, and Ugo Foscolo. Although {{there has been some}} confusion regarding the attribution of these biographies, the Livess recent editor, Tilar Mazzeo, notes that Shelley claimed authorship of all of these and granted Montgomery and Brewster's authorship of the others in her letters.|$|E

5|$|During the High Middle Ages, {{which began}} after 1000, the {{population}} of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords {{in return for the}} right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised nation states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry <b>of</b> <b>Dante</b> and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} of the Italian Renaissance differed {{from those of the}} Northern Renaissance. Italian Renaissance artists {{were among the first to}} paint secular scenes, breaking away from the purely religious art of medieval painters. Northern Renaissance artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by Albrecht Dürer. Later, the works of Pieter Bruegel influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also during the Northern Renaissance that Flemish brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck perfected the oil painting technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for centuries. A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the decisive influence <b>of</b> <b>Dante</b> Alighieri on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin. The spread of the printing press technology boosted the Renaissance in Northern Europe as elsewhere, with Venice becoming a world center of printing.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to sumarize the elemets <b>of</b> <b>Dante's</b> {{political}} ideas, to order and to highlight them according to the evolution <b>of</b> <b>Dante's</b> political belief was evolving via the Divine Comedy where {{we can see the}} beggining of his political opinion, which is slowly taking form as he continues his work until the end when Dante forms his theory completely. Apart from the Divine Comedy which is the main book of this thesis we will also work with his important political treatise De Monarchia, where he gradually explains and defends his opinion. Whole thesis is divided into three key parts according to the evolution <b>of</b> <b>Dante's</b> political ideas; the city, the empire and the papacy. Each part includes brief political and historic context of the medieval Italy and then in each part we will focus on some of the important personalities. We will introduce them in short biographical openings and then with the help <b>of</b> <b>Dante's</b> references we described them, we determined his relation to these personalities and thus we stressed out their political profile and importance. At the end, we summed up the evolution <b>of</b> <b>Dante's</b> political idea and we compared it to the modern era. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
