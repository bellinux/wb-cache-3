With Tilson absent from the Manchester City line-up, Alec Herd moved across to Tilson's usual centre-forward position, and Bobby Marshall was selected at inside-right. For Everton, Albert Geldard who was injured for the semi-final was selected at outside right, and Ted Critchley who scored the winning goal in the FA Cup semi-final, was left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Keenor became {{significantly more}} involved in the first team at Ninian Park, missing the opening game of the season, a defeat to Watford, before playing in five consecutive matches due to an injury to Patrick Cassidy. Following Cassidy's return he dropped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> not appearing for the first team from October 1914 until a match on 2 January 1915, which led to Keenor featuring in 15 of the Bluebirds next 18 matches.|$|E

5|$|This was Arsenal's 16th Shield {{appearance}} and Liverpool's 20th. Arsenal was without several {{of their first}} choice players in midfield, who were absent through injury; this prompted a shuffle in the team which saw striker Sylvain Wiltord positioned on the left wing. For Liverpool, defender Markus Babbel was named as a substitute ater a lengthy period <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> through illness. New signing El Hadji Diouf started in a creative role, behind strikers Michael Owen and Emile Heskey to begin with.|$|E
5|$|After trials with League Two sides Darlington and Bradford City, Rhodes {{signed for}} the latter on a {{short-term}} deal. He made his debut in City's {{first game of the}} season when they drew 1–1 with Macclesfield Town in a team featuring six new players. He scored his first goal in a 2–1 win over Chester City on 6 November 2007. He extended his stay at Bradford City {{until the end of the}} season in January 2008. Despite signing a new contract, injury kept Rhodes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> at the start of 2008 until 23 February when he scored his second Bradford goal in a 3–1 victory at Notts County after coming on as substitute. His performance in the Notts County victory earned him a place in the starting side three days later when he again scored in a 3–2 win against Rotherham United. On 29 April, he was one of 13players released by manager Stuart McCall. Rhodes played a total of 30games for Bradford, but started only 11 of those, scoring three goals.|$|E
5|$|An ankle injury, which Brandon {{picked up}} in a {{pre-season}} tour game against Scottish side Motherwell kept Brandon <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> {{at the start of}} the 2008–09 season. This included a League Cup game against his old side Huddersfield Town on 12 August 2008, for which he was a spectator as Bradford lost 4–0. When he attempted to make a comeback, he injured his other ankle in a reserve game with Scunthorpe United and was forced to undergo the first operation of his career which kept him out until January 2009. Once he returned to training in January, his first team debut was again delayed after a shoulder injury suffered at home. He returned to action for the reserves against Doncaster Rovers in February, before making his long-awaited debut on 7 March 2009 against Aldershot Town with City three goals ahead in a game which finally finished 5–0. He finished the season playing seven games. However, City missed out on promotion and Brandon's future was cast into doubt because of the size of his contract and budget cuts at the club.|$|E

5|$|Between 2 October 1965 and 30 March 1966, Irvine {{scored in}} four {{consecutive}} international fixtures. The run {{started with a}} goal against Scotland in the British Home Championship, followed by a goal in the 1–2 loss to England on 10 November 1965. Two weeks later, he netted in a World Cup qualifier against Albania before scoring in the 4–1 win against Wales to complete the run. Irvine continued to play for Northern Ireland, winning caps against Mexico, England and Scotland, but it was almost two-and-a-half years before he scored again in international football. His two goals in a friendly match against Israel were his last for Northern Ireland, although he did win another five caps for his country. After leaving Burnley in 1968, his inclusion in the Northern Ireland squad became less frequent and between 1969 and 1972 he did not make an appearance for the team. After three years <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> he returned for the 0–2 loss to Scotland on 20 May 1972. He played against England three days later before winning his 23rd and final cap in the goal-less draw with Wales, the team against which {{he had made his}} international debut, on 27 May 1972.|$|E
5|$|Boulding {{started the}} first game of his second season with Bradford City, which ended with City losing 5–0 to Notts County, but he soon lost his place to new signings Gareth Evans and James Hanson and so had to wait another seven weeks for his second start which came against Northampton Town because Evans was suspended. He scored his first goal of the season in the game to give City a 2–0 lead, but his side conceded twice for the game to finish in a 2–2 draw. He scored in the club's {{following}} two games, but was then kept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> for two weeks by a virus. Upon his return, he scored his 100thcareer goal and his fourth goal in five games as a late consolation in an FA Cup defeat to Notts County. However, Boulding continued to struggle to maintain a first-team place and was released early from his contract in March 2010, along with his brother under mutual consent, after failing to make a single start under new manager Peter Taylor. He had played 71 games at City, although nearly one-third were as substitute, and scored 19 goals.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{spent much}} of the 1934 season troubled by sore throats and back {{problems}} which restricted his appearances for Gloucestershire. His form for his county was good and in all first-class matches, he scored 2,366 runs (average 76.32), although he took fewer wickets at a higher average than the previous season. Awarded a benefit match, which raised just over £2,600, Hammond was idolised by the press and public for his achievements. In Tests, it was a different story; according to Wisden, he failed badly. England lost the Ashes, 2–1, in a series overshadowed at times by the Bodyline controversy. Hammond played in all five Tests against Australia but his top score was 43; he scored 162 runs at an average of 20.25, and took five wickets at an average of 72.80. Although the press and selectors supported him, there were some suggestions he should be left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> and Hammond felt under great pressure.|$|E

5|$|In July 2006, Boulding {{returned}} to League Two side Mansfield Town, and after impressing manager Peter Shirtliff in pre-season training, {{he was offered}} a contract. His younger brother Rory Boulding also joined Mansfield at the same time. His first game back at Mansfield was on {{the opening day of}} the 2006–07 season in a 2–2 draw with Shrewsbury Town, before he scored in the following game as Mansfield defeated Milton Keynes Dons 2–1. At the end of September he was sidelined by a knee injury, which kept him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> for a month, and in January 2007 he was angry after he was dropped to the substitutes' bench in favour of fellow strikers Barry Conlon and Martin Gritton for a game against Hereford United. Mansfield won the game 3–1 with Boulding coming on to score one of the goals. He finished the season with just six goals from 45games, as Mansfield finished in 17thposition.|$|E
5|$|McCall {{stayed on}} {{for one more}} season before he was {{released}} by manager Nicky Law in May 2002, shortly before the club went into administration {{for the first time}} after finishing 15th in Division One. His playing career at Bradford City had looked uncertain in December 2001 before Law arrived, when previous manager Jim Jefferies had left McCall <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> in a 3–1 defeat at Manchester City following a training ground dispute. However, it was Jefferies who lost out in the dispute when he resigned his post a week later after summit talks with chairman Geoffrey Richmond. In April 2002, McCall's testimonial match against Rangers attracted a crowd of more than 21,000 to Valley Parade. McCall gave part of the proceeds from his testimonial to the Bradford burns research unit, which was set up following the 1985 fire. Two years after his benefit match, McCall played one more time in City colours in a Save Our City appeal match organised by Bradford's evening newspaper, the Telegraph & Argus, to raise funds for the club, who were now in administration for a second time.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August 2006, Horsfield {{signed for}} Championship club Leeds United on loan until Christmas {{with a view}} to a {{permanent}} move. He made his debut on the opening day of the season, against Norwich at Elland Road, and scored his first goal in a 2–2 draw away at Queens Park Rangers three days later. When Dennis Wise took over as Leeds manager, Horsfield was in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> and his loan was terminated in January 2007. At the end of the January 2007 transfer window, Leicester City took Horsfield on loan {{for the rest of the}} season. He made his debut for the club in their 1–1 draw with Luton Town on 3 February, and scored his first goals for them in their 3–0 victory over local rivals Coventry City two weeks later.|$|E

5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
5|$|Wetherall's {{start to}} the 2001–02 season was {{hampered}} by a groin injury and his first full game of the campaign came on 14 September 2001 when he scored in a 5–1 Division One victory over Gillingham, which put Bradford second in the table. A groin injury again kept Wetherall <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> for nearly five months, during which time he was linked with moves back to the Premier League at either Southampton or Manchester City, but he opted to stay at Valley Parade. He returned from injury for a reserve game in March after four months out with just over two months of the season left. He returned to the side against Burnley in a game noted for Paul Gascoigne's debut for Burnley, and scored in his next game as Bradford eased any relegation worries by defeating Crewe Alexandra 2–0. He played in the club's final seven games and was named club captain for the following season after Stuart McCall left the club.|$|E
5|$|Willis had thus {{earned a}} second season at Surrey, and in 1970 played 14 Championship matches, taking 40 {{first-class}} wickets at 28.37, and 31 one day wickets at 14.65. Surrey came {{fifth in the}} Championship that year. He achieved a noteworthy performance in the Gillette Cup quarter-final against Middlesex. In a high-scoring match, Surrey made 280 {{for the loss of}} five wickets. Middlesex appeared to be coasting to victory when they reached 240–3, but Willis turned the game, and they collapsed and finished on 272–9. Willis took 6–49 in his 12 overs and won the Man of the Match award. Despite this, Surrey's preference for Geoff Arnold and Robin Jackman kept Willis <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> on occasions. He prepared to spend the winter employed at the Crystal Palace Recreation Centre while playing as a goalkeeper for local football club Cobham. However, Ray Illingworth and Colin Cowdrey, captain and vice captain of England's Test side, contacted him via telephone to ask him to travel to Australia and join the current England tour there. Willis, who knew that Illingworth and Cowdrey had little knowledge of his bowling, later credited his call up to the influence of senior member of the touring party John Edrich, Willis' long-term friend, mentor and Surrey teammate.|$|E

The descriptive name for this creek was first applied to the municipal district in 1918 (M.D. of Springbank).

5|$|Barber {{was born}} on 18 April 1901 in Cleckheaton, Yorkshire. He did not appear for the Yorkshire Second XI until he was 25, in 1926, when he scored 600 runs, {{including}} a century, and averaged 40. The same season, he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Worcestershire without playing a single innings. He was scheduled to bat later in the innings and was not needed to bat as Yorkshire completed an easy victory. In the next season, he was chosen to play three matches, with a top score of 18. For the next few years, {{he was unable to}} attain a regular spot in the Yorkshire side as there were many batsmen competing for places. In the 1928 season, Barber played 16 matches, mainly when other batsmen were required in representative matches, passing fifty {{for the first time in}} an innings of 98 against the West Indians, and followed this with two other fifties. Next season, he scored his maiden first-class century against the South Africans in an innings of 108, out of a team total of 335, with no other batsman reaching fifty. In total, he played on 22 occasions and scored 857 runs at an average of 30.60, including a second century, against Glamorgan. However, Barber was in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> over the next two seasons. He did not play 20 matches or reach 500 runs in either season and passed fifty only four times in total.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, {{while at}} Witton, Whalley spent five weeks on trial at League One club Crewe Alexandra, {{but he was}} not offered a {{permanent}} contract. He subsequently joined League Two side Accrington Stanley on loan two months later. Whalley made his debut for the club in the 1–2 defeat to Hartlepool United at the Crown Ground. However, two weeks later, he was sent off in the Football League Trophy match against Doncaster Rovers following a high tackle on Theo Streete, although Accrington manager John Coleman felt that the challenge was not deserving of a red card. The subsequent suspension meant that Whalley spent almost a month <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> before returning in late December in the loss to Bristol Rovers. He made his transfer to Accrington permanent in January 2007, signing a two-year contract with the club, and the following week he scored a late winner in the 3–2 victory over Mansfield Town, his first goal for the team. Whalley remained a first-team regular {{for the rest of the}} 2006–07 season and retained his place in the starting line-up throughout most of the following season, and scored his first Accrington goal away from the Crown Ground in the 8–2 loss at Peterborough United on 15 January 2008. Whalley made a total of 51 league appearances for Accrington, scoring 5 goals, but in May 2008, he was one of 10 players released by the club.|$|E
