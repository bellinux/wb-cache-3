40|$|Britain* is {{fortunate}} in being relatively well endowed {{with a variety}} of mineral resources on which an extractive industry of considerable economic importance is based. The economic importance of individual industries, including the extractive industries, to the national economy is measured by their contribution of Gross Value Added (GVA). This is a key indicator of economic performance. The GVA of the minerals extractive industries as a whole is included in national accounts under the heading ‘Mining and quarrying’, which includes the extraction of oil and gas. The GVA for ‘Mining and quarrying’was £ 27 500 million in 2003, or 2. 8 per cent of national GVA. The extraction of oil and gas accounted for £ 24 862 million of the total for the extractive industries, the mining of coal £ 479 million and <b>other</b> <b>mining</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarrying</b> £ 2 160 million...|$|E
40|$|The {{minerals}} {{as natural}} resource very rapidly became a significant {{contributor to the}} industrial and overall economic development of Macedonia. The intensive development started in all spheres of mineral complex like: metal ores, non-metallic mineral products, <b>other</b> <b>mining</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarrying,</b> water etc. During the transition period from 1990 - 2002, almost all mining activities stagnated and consequently many of the current mine capacities were either closed or sold unsuccessfully. Recently, with creation of new ownership conditions, {{it is expected that}} the entire mining industry soon will recover and restart and that new mine capacities will be open or the already existing ones will restart the production process. This paper fully addresses the most important mine capacities in Macedonia which normally function or are currently in the transformation process. Furthermore, the paper presents variety of tables defining the major productions accordingly to the sector or the type of mineral ores. In addition the comparative analyses are present in several tables dealing with the evaluated growth and the potential strategic goals necessary for development of the mining industry in Macedonia...|$|E

50|$|The Marble Cliff Quarry Co., {{headquartered}} in Upper Arlington, Ohio, operated the largest limestone quarry in the United States from its {{opening in the}} mid-19th century until its sale in approximately 1985.

Such famous Columbus area landmarks as Ohio Stadium, the Ohio Statehouse, the LeVeque Tower, state and county airports and modern freeways were constructed from stone extracted from the <b>quarry</b> <b>and</b> built by Strawser Equipment and Leasing employees.

40|$|The future {{demand for}} land for <b>mining</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarrying</b> will be {{affected}} by a large number of economic, technological, environmental and social issues within the UK. Global developments also have a role to play. Although <b>mining</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarrying</b> account for only 0. 9 per cent of the land area of England, the impact of this activity is considerable. Minerals are essential to the economy, for energy, construction, infrastructure and manufacturing, while their extraction has effects on the environment and on public perception. This paper examines current scientific understanding of the context of <b>mining</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarrying,</b> with particular reference to its impact on land use, along with the spatial relationship between minerals – which can only be worked where they occur – and other forms of land use and designation in the ‘post-industrial’ landscape of Britain. Looking out to 2060 and beyond, developments which may influence demand for minerals include climate change mitigation and adaptation; energy, food and raw material security; and new construction, manufacturing, recycling and re-use technologies. Factors influencing the supply side include the structure and ownership of the <b>mining</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarrying</b> industry, new extraction, processing and environmental technologies, ecosystem service provision, societal attitudes and land access. Although prediction carries a high level of uncertainty, continuous development of the regulatory framework is, and will remain, a major and pervasive factor in the relationship between <b>mining</b> <b>and</b> <b>quarrying</b> <b>and</b> land use. ...|$|R
