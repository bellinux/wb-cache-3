AnonSec group also claimed gaining access of a Global Hawk Drone of NASA, and released some video footage purportedly from the drone's cameras. A part of the data was released by AnonSec on Pastebin service, as an Anon Zine. NASA has denied the hack, asserting that {{the control of the}} drones were never compromised, but has acknowledged that the photos released along with the content are real photographs of its employees, but that most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>data</b> are already available in the public domain.|$|E

Although the amount is small, about 10 parts {{in a thousand}} million, it has excited scientists to question its source.

25|$|On {{the basis}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>data</b> from the 6 {{existing}} populations of Newcomb's snails {{can be estimated}} a total population of approximately 6,000 to 7,000 individuals. The great majority of these snails, perhaps over 90%, were located in the two populations at Kalalau and Lumaha`i. Terrain occupied by Newcomb's snail populations is remote and extremely rugged. Three of the six populations can only be visited using helicopter transport, although the Kalalau Stream population potentially could be accessed in summer months with boat support and strenuous hiking. Because of the difficulty in accessing the sites, no comprehensive Newcomb's snail population census has been undertaken since 1995, and changes to the population since that time remain undocumented.|$|E
25|$|One approach, {{suggested}} by {{writers such as}} Stephen D. Unwin, is to treat (particular versions of) theism and naturalism {{as though they were}} two hypotheses in the Bayesian sense, to list certain data (or alleged data), about the world, and to suggest that the likelihoods <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>data</b> are significantly higher under one hypothesis than the other. Most of the arguments for, or against, the existence of God can be seen as pointing to particular aspects of the universe in this way. In almost all cases it is not seriously {{suggested by}} proponents of the arguments that they are irrefutable, merely that they make one worldview seem significantly more likely than the other. However, since an assessment of the weight of evidence depends on the prior probability that is assigned to each worldview, arguments that a theist finds convincing may seem thin to an atheist and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|The {{chronology}} of Holocene volcanic activity associated with Mount Ararat is poorly documented. However, either archaeological excavations, oral history, historical records, {{or a combination}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>data</b> provide evidence that volcanic eruptions of Mount Ararat occurred in 2500–2400 BC, 550 BC, possibly in 1450 AD and 1783 AD, and definitely in 1840 AD. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that explosive eruptions and pyroclastic flows from the northwest flank of Mount Ararat destroyed and buried at least one Kura–Araxes culture settlement and caused numerous fatalities in 2500–2400 BC. Oral histories indicated that a significant eruption of uncertain magnitude occurred in 550 BC and minor eruptions of uncertain nature might have occurred in 1450 AD and 1783 AD. According to the interpretation of historical and archaeological data, strong earthquakes not associated with volcanic eruptions also occurred the area of Mount Ararat in 139, 368, 851–893, and 1319 AD. During the 139 AD earthquake, a large landslide that caused many casualties and {{was similar to the}} 1840 AD landslide originated from the summit of Mount Ararat.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to these results, an uncontrolled clinical trial was carried out at the Petrov Research Institute of Oncology in St. Petersburg {{over a period of}} 17 years, and a controlled trial was carried out at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in California over period of 10 years, respectively. The Russian trial reported complete tumor regression in about 1% of cases, a partial response in about 3% of cases and some subjective improvement of symptoms in about half of the patients. The National Cancer Institute analysis of this trial notes that interpretation <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>data</b> is difficult, due to the absence of controls, the lack of information on prior treatment and the study's reliance on subjective assessments of symptoms (i.e. asking patients if the drug had made them feel any better). Overall, the trials in California saw no statistically significant effect on survival from hydrazine sulfate treatment, but noted increased calorie intake in treated patients versus controls. The authors also performed a post-hoc analysis on one or more subgroups of these patients, which they reported as suggesting a beneficial effect from treatment. The design and interpretation of this trial, and in particular the validity of this subgroup analysis, was criticized in detail in an editorial in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.|$|E

500|$|Miniopterus aelleni {{is known}} to live from [...] above sea level in {{northern}} and western Madagascar, at [...] on Montagne d'Ambre, northern Madagascar, and from [...] on Anjouan in the nearby Comoros. On Madagascar, it has been recorded in forest and caves in karst areas; its distribution broadly overlaps that of M.griveaudi and the two {{have been found in}} the same roost sites on several occasions. On Anjouan, M.aelleni is less common than M.griveaudi; there, it is known from four specimens only, all collected in 2006. These come from two nearby sites: a rocky area near a river and a disturbed forest. These animals, collected in late November, were in reproductive condition, with two females pregnant and a third lactating. M.griveaudi were reproductively active at the same time, suggesting that the reproductive seasons of the two do not differ significantly. Although some ecological and behavioral data has been published on Miniopterus manavi, the recognition of several cryptic species within this group, more than one of which may occur in any given locality, renders the association <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>data</b> with any of the individual species uncertain; however, species of Miniopterus generally feed on insects. Because M.aelleni is widespread and occurs in many protected areas on Madagascar, Goodman and colleagues inferred that its conservation status is secure.|$|E
