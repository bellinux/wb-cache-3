5|$|A {{memorial}} {{was erected}} at St Mary's Church and Grange Road cemetery in Gillingham, Kent. It was used from 1867 until 1973 when {{the site was}} largely cleared of memorials to provide a community open space for the local population. Then Woodlands Road Cemetery was used {{and this is the}} site of HMS Glatton's Memorial with the graves of <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> and 56 men.|$|E
5|$|From December 1945 to May 1946 No.75 Squadron was {{maintained}} as a cadre located at Deniliquin and manned by <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> and three airmen without any aircraft. In May 1946 the squadron moved to RAAF Station Schofields near Sydney, {{but was not}} issued with any aircraft or further personnel until it moved to RAAF Base Williamtown in September that year and was equipped with P-51Mustang fighters. No.75 Squadron used these aircraft for routine training and exercises until it was disbanded on 25March 1948.|$|E
5|$|In December 1943, the LRDG re-organised {{into two}} squadrons of eight patrols. Each patrol {{contained}} <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> and 10 other ranks. Major Moir Stormonth Darling was given {{command of the}} British Squadron and Major Kenneth Henry Lazarus the Rhodesian Squadron. Patrols were then parachuted north of Rome to obtain information about German troop movements, and also carried out raids on the Dalmatian Islands and Corfu.|$|E

5|$|The 55th Infantry Division {{guarding}} Sedan {{had little}} time for combat training, as its time had been spent in construction work. The division consisted mainly of reservists, most of who were {{over the age of}} 30. Little attempt was made to improve the poor combat quality of the division. <b>One</b> <b>officer,</b> First Lieutenant Delas of the 1st Battalion 147th Fortress Infantry Regiment was arrested and confined for 15 days for ordering firing practice with a 25mm anti-tank gun in a nearby quarry.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the mounted}} units to {{accompany}} Allenby on his formal entrance into Jerusalem were the 10th Light Horse Regiment and a New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade representative troop commanded by 2nd Lieutenant C.J.

5|$|At 08:45 Rivoli, {{which had}} been {{struggling}} to reach the harbour of Trieste, lost her mizzenmast under fire from both Victorious and Weasel. Nearly at the same moment, two of her 36-pounder long guns exploded, killing or wounding 60 men, greatly disorganising and demoralising the others, and forcing Barré to transfer gunners from the upper gun deck to man his lower battery. Fifteen minutes later, with his ship unmanageable and battered, Commodore Barré surrendered. Rivoli had suffered over 400 killed and wounded from her crew of over 800, who had only assembled {{for the first time}} a few days before and had never sailed their ship in open water. Losses aboard Victorious were also heavy, with <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> and 25 sailors and marines killed and six officers (including Captain Talbot) and 93 men wounded.|$|E

5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. <b>One</b> <b>officer</b> then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.|$|E
5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the {{regiment}} suffered {{a total of}} 686 casualties, including 134 killed, 430 wounded, and 111 captured. Five officers received the Distinguished Service Order.

5|$|For the {{eighteen}} months after its opening, the fort was manned by B {{company of the}} South Australian Volunteer Artillery but only on weekends. This changed in mid-1882 when South Australia's first permanent military force was formed. The fort became the headquarters for the South Australian Permanent Military Force, then the state's entire standing army of <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> and eighteen other ranks. Some of the unit was stationed at nearby Fort Largs from 1886; and, by 1889 the unit had grown to <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> and 45 other ranks. This force grew to 53 of all ranks by 1892 and was by then known as the Permanent Artillery. The unit trained 27 more non-commissioned officers and men who were sent to man the King George Sound batteries near Albany, Western Australia. Though some of the gunners served in the Second Boer War, the unit itself never saw action. Fort Glanville's section was called out in 1890, marching to assist the police with a waterside worker's strike in Port Adelaide. In this case no shots were fired and the strikers did not confront the police or troops. Additional defence acts were passed in 1886, 1890 and 1895 but, until defence passed into federal hands after 1901, the state's permanent military force was composed solely of artillery. Shortly after the federation of Australia, a regiment of the Royal Australian Artillery (RAA) was formed and {{what had been the}} Permanent Artillery became No.10 company RAA. The fort was manned to an extent during World War I, with one non-commissioned officer and 11 gunners stationed as of November 1914. Military reports and orders show the fort manned to at least mid-1918, though at this point it is doubtful if the guns were fit to engage targets.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 1915, {{after two}} weeks in reserve, the {{battalion}} relieved the 12th Battalion at Tasmanian Post, on the right on the Australian front line. On 31 July, a party of around 200 men led by Leane were ordered to capture a section of Turkish trenches {{in front of the}} battalion's position. After engineers detonated three mines prepared near Turkish communications trenches, the storming party captured the Turkish trench following a bayonet charge, with the loss of <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> and 36 other ranks killed. Seventy-three other members of the battalion were wounded during the attack, including Leane, who was mentioned in despatches. Turkish casualties were estimated by the battalion to be 60 killed.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November 1901, off Greece, {{one of her}} six-inch guns {{exploded}} {{when the}} breech was not fully closed, killing <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> and five Royal Marines and injuring <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> (Sir Robert Keith Arbuthnot, 4th Bt) and 19 seamen. Captain Frederick Inglefield was appointed in command on 26 November 1901. After being relieved in the Mediterranean by the battleship , Royal Sovereign departed Gibraltar on 9 July 1902, arriving at Portsmouth, England, on 14 July 1902 to pay off. She served as flagship to Sir Charles Frederick Hotham, Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, during the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. On 30 August 1902, she commissioned under Captain George Primrose as a coast guard ship there. From 5–9 August 1903, the ship participated in manoeuvres {{off the coast of}} Portugal. From 1903 to 1904, she underwent an extensive refit at Portsmouth during which six-inch armoured casemates were added for the six-inch guns. On 9 February 1907, Royal Sovereign commissioned as a special service vessel in reserve. As such, she was incorporated into the 4th Division of the Home Fleet with other such vessels in April 1909. In September 1909, Royal Sovereign was taken out of service and she was sold for scrap to G. Clarkson & Son for £40,000 on 7 October 1913. They resold her to GB Berterello of Genoa and the ship was demolished there.|$|E

5|$|The 4th Light Horse Brigade {{casualties}} were one other rank killed, <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> and nine other ranks wounded. These wounded soldiers were probably {{treated by the}} 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance {{which was in the}} field a couple of miles past Al-Faluja. The ambulance had itself suffered two casualties when subjected to artillery fire from the hills. But they halted and put up a tent and after dark took in eight more patients all hit by high-explosive shells from the 4th Light Horse Regiment. They were busy until midnight; two seriously wounded soldiers being evacuated to a Casualty Clearing Station and the rest were kept till morning.|$|E
5|$|The NWMP was {{commanded}} by {{a relatively small}} team of commissioned officers, having an establishment of 25 officers in its early years, of whom around a quarter were medical and veterinary officers, rising to 50 after 1885, a ratio of approximately <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> to every twenty enlisted men. The officers were usually from middle- or upper-class backgrounds, and were typically Canadian-born; deliberate {{attempts were made to}} reflect the different religious and ethnic groups that made up white Canadian society. They depended on political patronage from the government of the day in Ottawa for their appointment and career progression, and were typically {{selected on the basis of}} their military experience, service in the police ranks or previous study at the Royal Military College in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Second Army {{consisted}} of five infantry divisions: (5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th, the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000–90,000 men, and 500 tanks. Many {{of them were}} new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories. The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned. One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> for each 1,200 soldiers. Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.|$|E

5|$|The {{crew was}} {{likewise}} {{unprepared for the}} emergency, as lifeboat training had been minimal. Only one lifeboat drill had been conducted while the ship was docked at Southampton. It was a cursory effort, consisting of two boats being lowered, each manned by <b>one</b> <b>officer</b> and four men who merely rowed around the dock {{for a few minutes}} before returning to the ship. The boats were supposed to be stocked with emergency supplies, but Titanics passengers later found that they had only been partially provisioned despite the efforts of the ship's chief baker, Charles Joughin, and his staff to do so. No lifeboat or fire drills had been conducted since Titanic left Southampton. A lifeboat drill had been scheduled for the Sunday morning before the ship sank, but was cancelled for unknown reasons by Captain Smith.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew was}} ordered to abandon ship after about forty minutes of the {{bombardment}} using the only remaining operable motor lifeboat of the three stowed on board. <b>One</b> <b>officer</b> and four enlisted men were injured, {{but no one was}} killed. The Turks continued their bombardment for five hours until Ben-my-Chree listed to starboard and sank in shallow water. Later in the day, the captain and the chief engineer returned to the wreck to rescue the ship's mascots, a cat and dog which had both survived the attack.|$|E
5|$|The crowd {{eventually}} dispersed after Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson promised an inquiry, but {{the crowd}} re-formed the next day, prompting {{the withdrawal of the}} troops to Castle Island. Eight soldiers, <b>one</b> <b>officer,</b> and four civilians were arrested and charged with murder. Defended by lawyer and future American president John Adams, six of the soldiers were acquitted, while the other two were convicted of manslaughter and given reduced sentences. The men found guilty of manslaughter were sentenced to branding on their hand. Depictions, reports, and propaganda about the event, notably the colored engraving produced by Paul Revere (shown at top-right), further heightened tensions throughout the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E
