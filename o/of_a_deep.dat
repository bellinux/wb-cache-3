5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. The lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> convection zone {{would mean that the}} outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E

5|$|A {{fungus gnat}} from New Zealand, Arachnocampa luminosa, {{lives in the}} predator-free {{environment}} of caves and its larvae emit bluish-green light. They dangle silken threads that glow and attract flying insects, and wind in their fishing-lines when prey becomes entangled. The bioluminescence of the larvae of another fungus gnat from North America which lives on streambanks and under overhangs has a similar function. Orfelia fultoni builds sticky little webs and emits light <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> blue colour. It has an inbuilt biological clock and, even when kept in total darkness, turns its light on and off in a circadian rhythm.|$|E

5|$|By early 1896, {{many in the}} Democratic Party were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then {{in the third year}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E

Each of these spots has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The dorsal spots, which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side spots may break apart. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye is a dark streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark spots.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Roman Empire, Flanders became part of the Merovingian realm of Neustria. In the 9th century it became part of West Francia, forming a pagus within the kingdom of Charles the Bald. In 864, Cassel passed into the hands of Baldwin Ironarm, who expanded his holdings to become the first count of the County of Flanders. At the time, the town was on the edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> bay of the North Sea, making it vulnerable to raids by the Vikings, who attacked and destroyed it in the 9th century. It was rebuilt by Baldwin's grandson, Arnulf I, in the 10th century.|$|E

5|$|Living Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus {{micro-organisms}} {{have been}} found in Lake Vostok's deep ice core drillings; they are an extant surface-dwelling species.

Any confirmation of life in Lake Vostok could strengthen the prospect for the presence of life on icy moons.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} was already exhibiting persistent deep convection {{in the western}} portion of its circulation.

At 1500UTC on August14, the {{depression was}} upgraded to Tropical Storm Dean while still 1450mi (2300km) east of Barbados. Even as its convection waned slightly that afternoon, its intensity grew, and convection flared in the center that night. Dry air and cooler air inflow from the north slowed structural development; nevertheless, ragged bands began to form on August15. By mid-morning, a rough banding eye had formed, and {{by the next morning}} a full eye developed. The storm was upgraded to Hurricane Dean at 0900UTC August16, 550mi (890km) east of Barbados.|$|E

5|$|During September 12, the {{depression}} continued to develop quickly {{with both the}} JMA and the JTWC reporting that {{the depression}} had intensified into a Tropical Storm later that day, with the JMA assigning the international name of Choi-wan and the international designation of 0915. During September 13, Choi-wan gradually developed whilst moving west with the JMA reporting that Choi-wan had become a severe tropical storm late that day, before reporting along with the JTWC early the next day that Choi-wan had intensified further and had become a weak Typhoon with multiple spiral bands that had wrapped into the fully consolidated center to form a banding eye. During September 14, Choi-wan intensified further whilst moving along the southwestern edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> level subtropical ridge of the northeast, intensifying into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with 1-minute winds of 220km/h (140mph).|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 2003, {{an area of}} {{convection}} {{that was}} situated over land for roughly a week emerged over open waters along the northern coast of Australia. The strengthening <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep,</b> persistent monsoon trough contributed to cyclogenesis, and a low pressure area formed. By 25 February, the low developed a banding feature in which the highest winds were located. Though the storm was located {{in an area of}} unfavorable wind shear, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) began to issue gale warnings on the system at 0100 UTC the next day, while the low was located several hundred miles north-northeast of Port Hedland. The disturbance was initially nearly stationary as it showed signs of organization due to relaxed shear, and at 0700 UTC on 27 February, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the storm as Tropical Cyclone Graham, as it had attained 80km/h (50mph) 10-minute maximum sustained winds. The first warning was issued on Graham later that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Tropical Storm Earl {{is attributed to}} a low-latitude, vigorous tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa and into the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August10. As the disturbance moved towards the west, satellite imagery revealed a much better structure with much-improved banding features and fair upper-level outflow, leading to the {{formation of}} Tropical Depression Five at 1800UTC on August13, situated roughly 1000mi (1610km) east of the Lesser Antilles. The depression progressed rapidly towards the west-northwest the following day, embedded and under the influence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> easterly flow around the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the cyclone's north. A combination of improved banding features and satellite intensity estimates by the afternoon of August14 led to the subsequent upgrade of the system to Tropical Storm Earl. At this time, the cyclone was situated about 325mi (525km/h) east of Barbados.|$|E
