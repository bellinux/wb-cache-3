5|$|Returning to Churchill Downs on Derby Day, May 5, 2012, Shackleford raced in the $400,000 Grade 2 Churchill Downs Stakes {{at seven}} furlongs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt.</b> In that race, he beat the favorite, American Champion Sprint Horse Amazombie, by a length. The two horses {{separated}} {{themselves from the}} rest of the field by five lengths with Shackleford on the inside. Just inside the sixteenth pole, he edged away and beat Amazombie under jockey Mike Smith by a length. Gantry was another five and a half lengths back in the third. The time was 1:21 on a fast track.|$|E
5|$|On Memorial Day, May 28, 2012, Shackleford raced in what analysts {{called the}} deepest {{field of the}} year {{featuring}} favorites To Honor and Serve, Caleb's Posse, Jackson Bend and Caixa Eletronica in the $750,000 Grade 1 Metropolitan Handicap (known by most as the Met Mile run at one mile <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> at Belmont Park). Shackleford had just enough left to withstand the furious late rush of Caleb's Posse, stopping the clock in 1:33 1/5 over the fast track to win by a nose. Favorite To Honor and Serve was another three and half lengths back in third. With this win, Shackleford turned the tables on old rival Caleb's Posse, who beat him in the 2011 Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. The horses met each other four times, with each winning two races. However, Caleb's Posse retired soon after the Met Mile.|$|E

5|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{technology of}} the late 1970s featured engines with power in excess of what the frames and tires of the day could accommodate. Roberts' riding style, bred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> tracks of America, revolutionized road racing. Prior to his arrival in Europe, riders focused on attaining high entry speeds into corners, leaving braking until the last possible moment then, carving graceful arcs through the corners with both wheels in line. Roberts did just the opposite, braking early then, quickly applying the throttle {{which resulted in the}} rear tire breaking traction and spinning. The resulting tire spin caused the motorcycle to buck and shake as it continually lost then regained traction, creating a brutal, violent riding style that no one had ever seen before on the racetracks of Europe. His riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding, where sliding the rear tire to one side is used as a method to steer the motorcycle around a corner. Because of his early application of the throttle, he was able to attain top speed faster than his competitors.|$|E

25|$|Although Gremlins share {{numerous}} {{parts and}} components with other AMC models, finding parts for a restoration project can be difficult.

The body of choice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> circuit was the Gremlin and AMC Eagle. The subcompact bodies fit Modified chassis and of special interest was the Gremlin's slab top and sides with a contour that was easy to duplicate in sheet metal.|$|E
25|$|Widely imitated, {{the safety}} bicycle {{completely}} replaced the high-wheeler in North America and Western Europe by 1890. Meanwhile, John Dunlop's reinvention of the pneumatic bicycle tire in 1888 {{had made for}} a much smoother ride on paved streets; the previous type were quite smooth-riding, when used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> roads common at the time. As with the original velocipede, safety bicycles had been much less comfortable than high-wheelers {{precisely because of the}} smaller wheel size, and frames were often buttressed with complicated bicycle suspension spring assemblies. The pneumatic tire made all of these obsolete, and frame designers found a diamond pattern to be the strongest and most efficient design.|$|E

25|$|For {{the next}} five years, Fisher held a number of jobs. He worked in a grocery and a bookstore, then later he sold newspapers, books, tobacco, candy, and other items on trains departing Indianapolis, a major {{railroad}} center not far from Greensburg. He opened a bicycle repair shop in 1891 with his two brothers. A successful entrepreneur, he expanded his business and became involved in bicycle racing and later, automobile racing. During his many promotional stunts, he was frequently injured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> and gravel roadways, leading him {{to become one of}} the early developers of automotive safety features. A highly publicized stunt involved dropping a bicycle from the roof of the tallest building in Indianapolis, which brought on a confrontation with the police.|$|E

500|$|Before the turnpike, {{there were}} other forms of {{transportation}} across the Appalachians.

500|$|After the Marlboro Cup, the {{original}} plan was to enter Riva Ridge in the [...] mile Woodward Stakes, just two weeks later, while Secretariat put in some slow workouts on the turf {{in preparation for the}} Man o' War Stakes in October. It rained before the Woodward and the track was sloppy, which Riva Ridge could not handle, so Secretariat was entered in his place. Secretariat led into the straight but was overtaken by the Allen Jerkens-trained four-year-old Prove Out, who pulled clear to win by [...] lengths. Prove Out ran the race of his life that day: his time was the second-fastest mile-and-a-half <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> in Belmont history despite the sloppy conditions. Prove Out went on to beat Riva Ridge in that year's Jockey Club Gold Cup.|$|E
500|$|It rained {{the night}} before, but the track dried out by race time. Secretariat stalked a fast pace in fifth, while Riva Ridge rated just behind Onion and Kennedy Road. Around the turn, Secretariat raced wide {{and started to}} make up ground. Coming into the stretch, Secretariat overtook Riva Ridge, while the other early leaders dropped back. Secretariat drew away to win, {{completing}} [...] miles in 1:45, then a world record <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> for the distance. Riva Ridge ran second with Cougar II in third and Onion in fourth. Turcotte said, [...] "Today he was the old Secretariat {{and he did it}} on his own." [...] The purse for the Marlboro Cup was $250,000, then the highest prize money offered: the win made Secretariat the 13th Thoroughbred millionaire in history.|$|E
500|$|The peloton {{chose not}} to run stage four {{competitively}} following Weylandt's death; instead the stage was ridden as a procession in his memory.

Stage 5 was held <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> roads of Tuscany, which had provided {{for one of the}} more spectacular stages in the 2010 Giro d'Italia. Dutch rider Pieter Weening won the stage with an 8-second time gap against the field. That, coupled with the 20-second time bonus for winning the day, gave him the pink jersey. There was some stability in the overall standings at this point, as the race's top riders finished together, or nearly so, in the next three stages.|$|E
