5|$|During {{the night}} of Saturday 23–24 January, the rebels met at the Mission church in Mbombwe, where Chilembwe gave a speech {{stressing}} that none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> expect to survive the reprisals that would follow the revolt but that the uprising would draw greater attention to their conditions and destabilise the colonial system. This, Chilembwe believed, {{was the only way}} change would ever occur.|$|E
5|$|Greene {{wants to}} open his own restaurant, and asks Shondor Birns to help him. Birns {{arranges}} a $70,000 loan from the Gambinos, but Birns' courier buys cocaine with the money and gets arrested. Birns and Greene argue over which <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> pay back the money; when Greene refuses to pay, Birns hires a hitman to kill him. Greene narrowly escapes, and later kills Birns with a car bomb.|$|E
5|$|According to Islamic belief Muhammad is {{credited}} with setting the Black Stone in the current place in {{the wall of the}} Kaaba. A story found in Ibn Ishaq's Sirah Rasul Allah tells how the clans of Mecca renovated the Kaaba following a major fire which had partly destroyed the structure. The Black Stone had been temporarily removed to facilitate the rebuilding work. The clans could not agree on which one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place.|$|E

5|$|As time passes, {{with no sign}} of land {{or other}} ships, Parker {{suggests}} that one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> be killed as food for the others. They draw straws, following the Custom of the Sea and Parker is sacrificed. This gives the others a reprieve, but Augustus soon dies from wounds received when they reclaimed the Grampus, and several more storms batter the already badly damaged ship. Pym and Peters float on the upturned hull and are close to death when they are rescued by the Jane Guy, a ship out of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Further {{works were}} carried out to repair, rebuild and improve the defences around the Waterport Front, which {{incorporated}} the old Waterport Gate. New casemates, counterguards, tenailles and lunettes {{were built in the}} area and the Montagu and Orange Bastions were enlarged. The work was carried out amidst considerable controversy, as there were vigorous disagreements between the governors and senior engineers of the time over how the works should be carried out and indeed whether some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> be pursued at all.|$|E
5|$|Later in Monk's Café, Jerry {{goes back}} on the deal and decides {{not to take the}} place because George wants it. The two {{continue}} to argue about who should own it, and decided that neither <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> take it. A waitress, Carolyn, played by Anita Wise, overhears them and George offers the place to her, which she accepts. The waitress invites them and Elaine to her housewarming, {{but it is clear that}} Jerry, George, and Elaine are not enjoying themselves. They overhear two people having a conversation about someone else moving out of their apartment, to which all three ask what the apartment's rent is.|$|E

5|$|On May 5, 1974 {{author and}} {{journalist}} Arthur Koestler published {{a letter from}} reader Nigel Parker in The Sunday Times of a striking coincidence between a scene in Poe's novel and an actual event that happened decades later: In 1884, the yacht Mignonette sank, with four men cast adrift. After weeks without food, they decided that one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> be sacrificed as food for the other three, just as in Poe's novel. The loser was a young cabin boy named Richard Parker, coincidentally the same name as Poe's fictional character. Parker's shipmates, Tom Dudley and Edwin Stephens, were later tried for murder in a precedent-setting common law trial, the renowned R v Dudley and Stephens.|$|E
5|$|The group became {{lost and}} confused. After {{two more days}} without food, Patrick Dolan {{proposed}} that one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> volunteer to die in order to feed the others. Some suggested a duel, while another account describes an {{attempt to create a}} lottery to choose a member to sacrifice. Eddy suggested that they keep moving until someone simply fell, but a blizzard forced the group to halt. Antonio the animal handler was the first to die; Franklin Graves was the next casualty.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E

5|$|In 1021/22, however, Xiphias, now {{posted at}} Caesarea as strategos of the Anatolic Theme, fell out with Basil II {{because he was}} not allowed to {{accompany}} the Emperor on his campaign against the Kingdom of Georgia. Xiphias allied himself against the Emperor with the magnate Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos, whose father had risen in revolt {{in the early years of}} Basil II's reign. The two men planned to kill Basil, and that one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> take his place; who it would be remained undecided, but it was mainly Phokas' name and followers that lent the conspiracy weight. The conspiracy was apparently also known and supported by King George I of Georgia, who thus hoped to force Basil to abandon his invasion. When the emperor learned of the plot, however, he did not turn back, but instead sent letters to the two rebel leaders separately, aiming to sow distrust between them. Basil's ploy bore fruit very soon, for on 15 August 1022, Xiphias assassinated Phokas. The latter's supporters dispersed, and the nascent rebellion collapsed. Xiphias was then forced to surrender to the Emperor's envoy, Theophylact Dalassenos, who became the new strategos of the Anatolics.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
25|$|Pope Sergius I (8 September 701) was Pope from December 15, 687 to {{his death}} in 701. He was elected {{at a time when}} two rivals, the Archdeacon Paschal and the Archpriest Theodore, were locked in dispute about which <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> become pope.|$|E

25|$|On 13 July 1971, Saint Phalle and Tinguely legally became married, {{though the}} {{immediate}} reason {{may have been}} tax savings, as Saint Phalle thus became a Swiss citizen. Their marriage did give the two artists mutual control over each other's artistic estate, if one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> die. That same year, she designed her first pieces of jewelry.|$|E
25|$|Bland {{noted that}} it was fitting to have a Mandarin-medium school given that three fourts of the {{population}} of China spoke Mandarin, three fourts {{of the population of}} the Straits Settlements were ethnically Chinese, and that whether Straits-Born or China-Born, all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> have the opportunity of learning Mandarin. He commended a knowledge of Chinese Classics to those students in the Colony and trusted that, should they return to China, they would take with them the idea of freedom as imparted to them in that British Colony of the Straits Settlements.|$|E
25|$|Original scriptures of the Ājīvika {{school of}} {{philosophy}} may once have existed, {{but these are}} currently unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ajivikas in the secondary sources of ancient Indian literature. Scholars question whether Ājīvika philosophy has been fairly and completely summarized in these secondary sources, as they were written by groups (such as the Buddhists and Jains) competing with and adversarial to the philosophy and religious practices of the Ajivikas. It is therefore likely {{that much of the}} information available about the Ājīvikas is inaccurate to some degree, and characterisations <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> be regarded carefully and critically.|$|E

25|$|Two Athenians, Theseus and Pirithous, {{thought that}} {{since they were}} both sons of gods, both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> have divine wives; they thus pledged {{to help each other}} abduct two daughters of Zeus. Theseus chose Helen, and Pirithous vowed to marry Persephone, the wife of Hades. Theseus took Helen and left her with his mother Aethra or his {{associate}} Aphidnus at Aphidnae or Athens. Theseus and Pirithous then traveled to the underworld, the domain of Hades, to kidnap Persephone. Hades pretended to offer them hospitality and set a feast, but, as soon as the pair sat down, snakes coiled around their feet and held them there. Helen's abduction caused an invasion of Athens by Castor and Pollux, who captured Aethra in revenge, and returned their sister to Sparta.|$|E
25|$|That same year, {{a fire in}} {{his studio}} {{destroyed}} numerous original paintings, costumes, and props. Because the period costumes and props were irreplaceable, the fire split his career into two phases, the second phase depicting modern characters and situations. Rockwell was contacted by writer Elliott Caplin, brother of cartoonist Al Capp, with {{the suggestion that the}} three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> make a daily comic strip together, with Caplin and his brother writing and Rockwell drawing. King Features Syndicate is reported to have promised a $1,000 per week deal, knowing that a Capp-Rockwell collaboration would gain strong public interest. The project was ultimately aborted, however, as it turned out that Rockwell, known for his perfectionism as an artist, could not deliver material so quickly as would be required of him for a daily comic strip.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{and past}} the {{construction}} there was a disagreement between Southern Follo Fire Department and the Public Roads Administration regarding the installation of camera surveillance for fire protection. The former stated that the installation would be required in relation to national regulations, while the latter stated that the fire chief lacked technical qualifications to assess fire protection in tunnels. The installation would cost between NOK3 and 10 million. The issue was resolved by the Directorate of Public Roads in December 1999, in favor of not installing surveillance. On the other hand, the tunnel {{was the first to}} receive a system which automatically detects vehicles carrying hazardous materials and can inform the fire departments of all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>should</b> an incident occur. It can also keep track of the numbers of vehicles in the tunnel at any given time.|$|E
