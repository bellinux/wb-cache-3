40|$|AbstractThe {{geological}} {{record of}} the Western Andean Escarpment (WARP) reveals episodes of uplift, erosion, volcanism and sedimentation. The lithological sequence at 18 °S comprises a thick pile of Azapa Conglomerates (25 – 19 Ma), an <b>overlying</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> widespread rhyodacitic Oxaya Ignimbrites (up to 900 m thick, ca. 19 Ma), which are in turn covered by a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> mafic andesite shield volcanoes. Between 19 and 12 Ma, {{the surface of the}} Oxaya Ignimbrites evolved into a large monocline on the western slope of the Andes. A giant antithetically rotated block (Oxaya Block, 80 km× 20 km) formed on this slope at about 10 – 12 Ma and resulted in an easterly dip and a reversed drainage on the block's surface. Morphology, topography and stratigraphic observations argue for a gravitational cause of this rotation. A “secondary” gravitational collapse (50 km 3), extending 25 km to the west occurred on the steep western front of the Oxaya Block. Alluvial and fluvial sediments (11 – 2. 7 Ma) accumulated in a half graben to the east of the tilted block and were later thrust over by the rocks of the escarpment wall, indicating further shortening between 8 and 6 Ma. Flatlying Upper Miocene sediments (< 5. 5 Ma) and the 2. 7 Ma Lauca–Peréz Ignimbrite have not been significantly shortened since 6 Ma, suggesting that recent uplift is at least partly caused by regional tilting of the Western Andean slope...|$|R

6000|$|Now {{this belief}} that {{geologic}} [...] "systems" [...] are universal, {{is no more}} tenable than the other. It is just as absurd when considered a priori; and it is equally inconsistent with the facts. Though some <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> classed together as Oolite, may range over a wider district than any one <b>stratum</b> <b>of</b> the series; yet we have but to ask what were {{the circumstances under which}} it was deposited, to see that the Oolitic <b>series,</b> like one <b>of</b> its individual <b>strata,</b> must be <b>of</b> local origin; and that there {{is not likely to be}} anywhere else, a series which corresponds, either in its characters or in its commencement and termination. For the formation <b>of</b> such a <b>series</b> implies an area of subsidence, in which its component beds were thrown down. Every area of subsidence is necessarily limited; and to suppose that there exist elsewhere groups of beds completely answering to those known as Oolite, is to suppose that, in contemporaneous areas of subsidence, like processes were going on. There is no reason to suppose this; but good reason to suppose the reverse. That in contemporaneous areas of subsidence throughout the globe, the conditions would cause the formation of Oolite, is an assumption which no modern geologist would openly make. He would say that the equivalent <b>series</b> <b>of</b> beds found elsewhere, would probably be of dissimilar mineral character. Moreover, in these contemporaneous areas of subsidence, the processes going on would not only be different in kind; but in no two cases would they be likely to agree in their commencements and terminations. The probabilities are greatly against separate portions of the Earth's surface beginning to subside at the same time, and ceasing to subside at the same time--a coincidence which alone could produce equivalent groups <b>of</b> <b>strata.</b> Subsidences in different places begin and end with utter irregularity; and hence the groups <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> thrown down in them can but rarely correspond. Measured against each other in time, their limits must disagree. On turning to the evidence, we find that it daily tends more and more to justify these a priori positions. Take, as an example, the Old Red Sandstone system. In the north of England this is represented by a single <b>stratum</b> <b>of</b> conglomerate. In Herefordshire, Worcestershire, and Shropshire, it expands into a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> from eight to ten thousand feet thick, made up of conglomerates, red, green, and white sandstones, red, green, and spotted marls, and concretionary limestones. To the south-west, as between Caermarthen and Pembroke, these Old Red Sandstone strata exhibit considerable lithological changes; on the other side of the Bristol Channel, they display further changes in mineral characters; while in South Devon and Cornwall, the equivalent <b>strata,</b> consisting chiefly <b>of</b> slates, schists, and limestones, are so wholly different, that they were for a long time classed as Silurian. When we thus see that in certain directions the whole group of deposits thins out, and that its mineral characters change within moderate distances; does it not become clear that the whole group of deposits was a local one? And when we find, in other regions, formations analogous to these Old Red Sandstone or Devonian formations, is it certain--is it even probable--that they severally began and ended at the same time with them? Should it not require overwhelming evidence to make us believe as much? ...|$|R

60|$|When {{from the}} Earth itself {{we turn to}} the plants and animals that have lived, or still live, upon its surface, we find {{ourselves}} in some difficulty from lack of facts. That every existing organism has been developed out of the simple into the complex, is indeed the first established truth of all; and that every organism that has existed was similarly developed, is an inference which no physiologist will hesitate to draw. But when we pass from individual forms of life to Life in general, and inquire whether the same law is seen in the ensemble of its manifestations,--whether modern plants and animals are of more heterogeneous structure than ancient ones, and whether the earth's present Flora and Fauna are more heterogeneous than the Flora and Fauna of the past,--we find the evidence so fragmentary, that every conclusion is open to dispute. Two-thirds of the Earth's surface being covered by water; a great part of the exposed land being inaccessible to, or untravelled by, the geologist; the greater part of the remainder having been scarcely more than glanced at; and even the most familiar portions, as England, having been so imperfectly explored that a new <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> has been added within these four years,--it is manifestly impossible for us to say with any certainty what creatures have, and what have not, existed at any particular period.
