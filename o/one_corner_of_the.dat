5|$|Initially {{the chapel}} was {{believed}} to be of Anglo-Saxon origin and to have been buried under the earthworks when they were first constructed. An argument then ensued between the antiquarian William Taylor, who championed the Anglo-Saxon dating for the site, and Harrod, who insisted that the chapel was in fact Norman in origin; the issue was not settled until later in the 20th century, when the Norman date was confirmed. By 1900 the castle was open to the public, overseen by a caretaker who lived in <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keep, the section of which had been reroofed and turned into an apartment.|$|E

D'Sora arrives at Data's cabin where he is painting. She tells him to continue, but is then annoyed when he does so, causing him some confusion. The ship arrives at the coordinates for the planet but finds nothing there. Then it suddenly appears as the ship's computer warns of a depressurization in the observation lounge. The crew investigate and find all the furniture piled in <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|E
50|$|Kormakssaga {{states that}} the holmgang was fought on an ox hide or cloak with sides that were three meters long. It was staked {{on the ground with}} stakes used just for that purpose and placed in a {{specific}} manner now unknown. After that the area was marked by drawing three borders around the square hide, each about one foot from <b>the</b> previous <b>one.</b> <b>Corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outermost border were marked with hazel staves. Combatants had to fight inside these borders. Stepping out of borders meant forfeiture, running away meant cowardice.|$|R

5|$|Repairs {{were made}} to the castle between 1610 and 1611 by the captain, Sir George Bampfield, at a cost of £211. A survey in 1623 carried out by Sir Richard Morryson showed the castle to be {{equipped}} with ten iron guns – one culverin, five demi-culverins, two sakers, a minion and a falcon – and garrisoned by its captain, five gunners and three soldiers. It was in a poor condition, and <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gun platform had been undermined by the sea; Morryson's team estimated the likely costs of repairs to amount to £459.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name is unclear as it was not built until long after the reign of King John, who died in 1216. Its present name first {{appeared}} in a 1915 publication, The Heart of Mendip by Francis Knight, when it was being run as a saddler's shop. The royal part of the name {{may have come from}} {{the fact that there was}} a carved king's head on the building, from a time when The King's Head Inn occupied part of the premises, but whether this represented King John or another king is not known. The head was attached to <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exterior, but is now inside the building, and a replica placed on the outside.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque, {{located along}} Skudai Road, {{is the main}} and the oldest mosque in the state. It was built with a {{combination}} of Victorian, Moorish and Malay architectures. The Johor Bahru Old Chinese temple, located on the Trus Road, hosts the Gods of five Chinese dialects spoken in the city. It was built in 1875 and renovated by the Persekutuan Tiong Hua Johor Bahru (Johor Bahru Tiong Hua Association) in 1994–95 {{with the addition of a}} small L-shaped museum in <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> square premises. The Wong Ah Fook Mansion, the home of the late Wong Ah Fook, was a former historical attraction. It stood for more than 150 years but was demolished illegally by its owner in 2014 to make way for a commercial housing development without informing the state government. Other historical religious buildings include the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Hindu Temple, Sri Raja Mariamman Hindu Temple, Gurdwara Sahib and Church of the Immaculate Conception.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} {{exhibited a}} contrast of bare nave walls against the paintings {{drawn on the}} metal ceilings leading to the main altar and retablo mayor.

An acknowledgment on the initiative of the San Tarcisio Martir Maribojoc Catholic Association 'Comité de Obras' could also be seen painted before the crossing. Several paintings by Francia on metal had deteriorated even before the total destruction of the church by earthquake in 2013. The Francia paintings were never touched up nor repainted. The new church dome (or cimborrio) was constructed in June 1889. Ray Francia was again commissioned to do mural works on the cimborrio by painting the Epistles of The Four Apostles, namely the saints John, Matthew, Luke and Mark.|$|E

25|$|While {{this took}} place, in April the new Chief of Air Corps, Maj. Gen. James Fechet, {{appointed}} {{a committee of}} senior officers headed by Brig. Gen. Benjamin D. Foulois to approve a design. In July it rejected the circular layout proposed for the new base and put forth a plan that placed all buildings in <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property. Just prior to acceptance of the property, Lahm sharply criticized the revision to Fechet and a reconsideration, also on August 16, 1928, approved the original circular design. Clark was then detailed for special duty in Washington D.C. as Lahm's liaison with the Construction Service, Quartermaster Corps, which would build the base.|$|E
25|$|Dublin {{has many}} {{landmarks}} and monuments dating back hundreds of years. One {{of the oldest}} is Dublin Castle, which was first founded as a major defensive work on the orders of England's King John in 1204, shortly after the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, when it was commanded that a castle be built with strong walls and good ditches for the defence of the city, the administration of justice, {{and the protection of}} the King's treasure. Largely complete by 1230, the castle was of typical Norman courtyard design, with a central square without a keep, bounded on all sides by tall defensive walls and protected at each corner by a circular tower. Sited to the south-east of Norman Dublin, the castle formed <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer perimeter of the city, using the River Poddle as a natural means of defence.|$|E

25|$|Rhode-Island, July 26. This Day, 26 of the Pirates {{taken by}} his Majesty Ship the Greyhound, Captain Solgard, were {{executed}} here.

Their black Flag, under which they had committed abundance of Pyracies and Murders, was affix'd to <b>one</b> <b>Corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gallows. It had in it the Portraiture of Death, with an Hour-Glass in one Hand, and a Dart in the other, striking into a Heart, and three Drops of Blood delineated as falling from it.

25|$|Rust {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of bridge accidents. As rust has a much higher volume than the {{originating}} mass of iron, its build-up can also cause failure by forcing apart adjacent parts. It was the cause of the collapse of the Mianus river bridge in 1983, when the bearings rusted internally and pushed <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road slab off its support. Three drivers on the roadway at the time died as the slab fell into the river below. The following NTSB investigation showed that a drain in the road had been blocked for road re-surfacing, and had not been unblocked; as a result, runoff water penetrated the support hangers. Rust was also an important factor in the Silver Bridge disaster of 1967 in West Virginia, when a steel suspension bridge collapsed within a minute, killing 46 drivers and passengers on the bridge at the time.|$|E
25|$|Other {{evidence}} {{supported this}} theory. During {{the investigation of}} Mrs. Muncey's murder, the doctor who performed the autopsy passed the vials to two local law enforcement officers who transported it to the FBI, where further testing occurred. The blood was contained in four vials, evidently with neither preservative nor a proper seal. The vials, in turn, were stored in a foam box, but nothing indicates the box was kept cool. Rather, in violation of proper procedure, the foam box was packed in the same cardboard box as other evidence, including House's pants and other clothing. The cardboard box was carried in the officers' car, and transported while they made the 10-hour journey from Tennessee to the FBI lab. Blood vials in hot conditions (such as a car trunk in the summer) can blow open. By the time the blood reached the FBI it had hemolyzed, or spoiled, due to heat exposure. By the time the blood passed from the FBI to a defense expert, roughly a vial and a half were empty, though the agent who had analyzed it testified he used at most a quarter of one vial. Blood, moreover, {{was found to have}} seeped onto <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foam box and onto packing gauze inside the box below the vials.|$|E
