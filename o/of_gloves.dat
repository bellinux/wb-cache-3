5|$|In 1400 {{a revolt}} {{broke out in}} North Wales against English rule, led by Owain Glyndŵr. By 1403 {{only a handful of}} castles, {{including}} Harlech, still stood against the rebels, but the castle was under-equipped and under-staffed to withstand a siege, the garrison having just three shields, eight helmets, six lances, ten pairs <b>of</b> <b>gloves,</b> and four guns. At the end of 1404, the castle fell to Glyndŵr. Harlech became his residence, family home and military headquarters for four years; he held his second parliament in Harlech in August 1405. In 1408 English forces under the command of the future Henry V placed Harlech and its commander, Edmund Mortimer, under siege, conducting a bombardment with cannon, probably destroying the south and east parts of the outer walls. When this failed to take the castle, Henry left John Talbot in charge of the siege and moved on to deal with Aberystwyth Castle. Supplies finally ran short, Mortimer and many of his men died of exhaustion, and Harlech fell in February 1409.|$|E

25|$|Since boxing {{involves}} forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must {{be taken}} to prevent damage to bones in the hand. Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without wrist wraps and boxing gloves. Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not utilise them. Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. Prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight <b>of</b> <b>gloves</b> {{to be used in the}} bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. The brand <b>of</b> <b>gloves</b> can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. Both sides are allowed to inspect the wraps and gloves of the opponent to help ensure both are within agreed upon specifications and no tampering has taken place.|$|E

25|$|Gloves {{appear to}} be of great antiquity. According to some {{translations}} of Homer's The Odyssey, Laërtes is described as wearing gloves while walking in his garden {{so as to avoid}} the brambles. (Other translations, however, insist that Laertes pulled his long sleeves over his hands.) Herodotus, in The History of Herodotus (440BC), tells how Leotychides was incriminated by a glove (gauntlet) full of silver that he received as a bribe. There are occasional references to the use <b>of</b> <b>gloves</b> among the Romans as well. Pliny the Younger (c.100), his uncle's shorthand writer wore gloves in winter so as not to impede the elder Pliny's work.|$|E

25|$|The impact <b>of</b> <b>gloves</b> on the {{injuries}} caused during a fight is a controversial issue.

Gloves reduce the number of cuts caused, but British Medical Association research has stated that gloves do not reduce brain injuries and may even increase them, because the main cause of injury is acceleration and deceleration of the head, and fighters wearing gloves are able to punch harder to the head. Gloves may reduce the amount of eye injuries, especially if they are thumbless, but retinal tears and detached retinas still occur to boxers wearing modern gloves.|$|E

For example, many attack players wear larger and more protective elbow pads {{to protect themselves from}} checks thrown at them while defenders typically wear smaller and less protective pads due to their smaller possibility of being checked. A goalkeeper must also wear a large protective chest pad to cover their stomach and chest and a plastic neck guard that connects to the chin of their helmet to protect them from shots hitting their windpipe. In addition, male goalkeepers are required to wear a protective cup.|$|E
25|$|A glove (Middle English from Old English glof) is {{a garment}} {{covering}} the whole hand. Gloves have separate sheaths or openings for each finger and the thumb; {{if there is}} an opening but no (or a short) covering sheath for each finger they are called fingerless gloves. Fingerless gloves having one large opening rather than individual openings for each finger are sometimes called gauntlets, though gauntlets are not necessarily fingerless. Gloves which cover the entire hand or fist but do not have separate finger openings or sheaths are called mittens. Mittens are warmer than other styles <b>of</b> <b>gloves</b> made of the same material because fingers maintain their warmth better when they are in contact with each other. Reduced surface area reduces heat loss.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} of the 1930s through early 1960s, the evening glove was adapted for wear with certain high end {{lounging}} and sleeping outfits, or peignoir sets. Such gloves were typically made out of the same lightweight sheer nylon, rayon, or silk as of the lingerie set in a matching or complementary color and always of above elbow length. These gloves were introduced to bring the fashion for covered hands into the bedroom, protect skin during sleep and leisure time, and provide modesty for women during times of travel, visitation, or shared accommodation. While never widespread, these sleeping gloves were a desired component of the most expensive bedroom ensembles. Given the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>gloves</b> in mid-20th century women's fashion, a woman who added sleeping gloves to her wardrobe would have been gloved virtually at all times.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to advance understanding of factors influencing the transmission <b>of</b> vibration through <b>glove</b> materials to the hand and to the fingers. The transmissibility <b>of</b> a <b>glove</b> to the hand depends on two primary factors: the biodynamic response of the hand and the dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>glove</b> material. Although some of the factors affecting the biodynamic response of the hand and the dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>glove</b> materials have been investigated previously, there is insufficient understanding to be able to predict glove transmissibilities. The apparent mass of the hand, the dynamic stiffness <b>of</b> three <b>glove</b> materials (Foam A, Foam B, and Gel A), and their transmissibilities to the hand were measured with five variables: (a) material thickness (6. 4, 12. 8, and 19. 2 mm), (b) push force (10, 15, and 20 N), (c) contact area (with diameters 12. 5. 25. 0, and 37. 5 mm), (d) vibration magnitude (1, 2, and 4 m/s 2 r. m. s.), (e) with and without arm support, and (f) different frequency ranges (10 to 300 Hz and 2 to 50 Hz). With the hand pushing down on a flat surface and vertical vibration, measurements were obtained at the palm of the hand, the thenar eminence, and the index finger. It is concluded that the apparent mass of the hand and the dynamic stiffnesses <b>of</b> the <b>glove</b> materials at high frequencies are predominantly affected by contact area and contact force. A change in contact area or contact force can therefore increase or decrease glove transmissibility. At frequencies greater than 20 Hz, the apparent mass at the palm and the transmissibilities <b>of</b> the <b>glove</b> materials to the palm were similar with and without arm support. At frequencies between 20 and 100 Hz, as the dynamic stiffness of the material decreased, the transmissibility of the material to the palm decreased whereas the transmissibility to the index finger increased. Changes in the vibration magnitude will not have a large effect on glove transmissibility. Using the measured apparent mass of the hand and the measured dynamic stiffnesses <b>of</b> the <b>glove</b> materials, the transmissibility of the materials to the hand were predicted using an impedance model. The predicted transmissibilities were similar to, and showed similar trends to, the measured transmissibilities. The predicted transmissibilities seemed to reflect individual changes in the dynamic response of the hand, suggesting a method of predicting inter-subject variability in glove transmissibility. Simple lumped parameter models of the hand were developed (with two and four degrees-of-freedom) and combined with the dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>glove</b> material (represented by a standard linear viscoelastic model) to predict glove transmissibility to the palm of the hand. The two degree-of-freedom model (representing the material and the hand) consistently provided a prediction <b>of</b> <b>glove</b> transmissibility to the palm that was inferior to the predictions of the four degree-of-freedom model (representing the material, the hand, and the arm), suggesting the exclusion of the dynamic response of the arm affects the ability of a model to predict glove transmissibility to the palm. The research shows that the transmission of vibration through a glove to the palm of the hand or to the finger can be predicted from the dynamic stiffness <b>of</b> the <b>glove</b> material and the apparent mass of the hand. Such predictions will assist the optimisation <b>of</b> <b>glove</b> dynamics, reduce the time to assess the performance <b>of</b> a <b>glove,</b> and reduce the need for testing with human subjects...|$|R
