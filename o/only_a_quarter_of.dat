5|$|Emperors of the {{proceeding}} Song dynasty (960–1279) {{tended to}} marry from {{within their own}} borders. Tang emperors, mainly took their wives from high-ranking bureaucratic families, but the Song dynasty did not consider rank important {{when it came to}} selecting their consorts. It has been estimated that <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> Song consorts were from such families, with the rest being from lower status backgrounds. For example, Liu, consort of Emperor Zhenzong, had been a street performer and consort Miao, wife of Emperor Renzong was the daughter of his own wet nurse.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} tackle {{financial}} burdens {{resulting from the}} Hussite wars and military campaigns against the Ottoman Empire, Sigismund of Luxemburg put lower value silver coins into circulation in 1432. The new pennies were known as quarting because they contained <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the silver content of the old currency. Bishop Lépes, who knew that pennies of higher value would again be minted in a few years, suspended {{the collection of the}} tithe in 1434.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{the attackers}} lost six bombers and 12 Bf 109s, some 12.5% of its strength. However, the British claimed 81 aircraft, 26 by the Duxford Wing. Zehbe's Dornier alone was claimed nine times. Among the German {{casualties}} {{that day was}} Rolf Heitsch and his flame throwing Dornier; the device had not been tested at high altitude and when used, squirted black oil over Holmes' windshield and {{attracted the attention of}} British fighters. Park would not have been pleased that despite being stripped of protection the small force of bombers lost <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> its strength while surrounded by 100 fighters. Still, the operation had been a victory. Fighter Command lost 13 fighters, eight were claimed by JG 52.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Europeans formed {{only about}} {{a tenth of the}} royalist armies in Spanish America, and only about half of the expeditionary units, once they were {{deployed}} in the Americas. Since each European soldier casualty was replaced by a Spanish American soldier, over time, there were more and more Spanish American soldiers in the expeditionary units. For example, Pablo Morillo, {{commander in chief of the}} expeditionary force sent to South America, reported that he had only 2,000 European soldiers under his command in 1820; in other words, only half the soldiers of his expeditionary force were European. It is estimated that in the Battle of Maipú <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the royalist forces were European soldiers, in the Battle of Carabobo about a fifth, and in the Battle of Ayacucho less than 1% was European.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{assurances that}} change would be forthcoming, Holmlund came under {{considerable}} pressure from {{some members of}} parliament, particularly those in the Left Alliance, to resign for not acting sooner. Leading the call for her deposition was Anneli Lapintie; Tarja Filatov, parliamentary group {{leader of the opposition}} Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) also questioned the government over what it had done since the Jokela incident. Vanhanen launched a defence of the government by saying that iniquiries were ongoing, even into the Jokela case. A survey by pollster Taloustutkimus for YLE showed that dissension towards Holmlund was not widespread: <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> members from smaller parties felt she should step down, only 10% of SDP members (with 80% supporting her to stay on), and 90% of the government's partners wanted her to hold onto her ministry. Amongst the population, 82% felt she should continue.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev {{sought to}} {{reconstruct}} Ukraine, but also desired {{to complete the}} interrupted work of imposing the Soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur. As Ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed, and 750,000men aged between nineteen and fifty were given minimal military training and sent to join the Red Army. Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent Ukraine. Khrushchev rushed from district to district through Ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. He made a short visit to his birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with {{only a third of}} the men who had joined the Red Army having returned. Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown. Despite Khrushchev's efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of Ukraine had not yet been retaken.|$|E
5|$|The soldier's sole {{substantial}} {{disposable income}} {{came from the}} donativa, or cash bonuses handed out periodically by the emperors, as these were paid in gold solidi (which were never debased), or in pure silver. There was a regular donative of 5 solidi every five years of an Augustus reign (i.e. one solidus p.a.) Also, on the accession of a new Augustus, 5 solidi plus a pound of silver (worth 4 solidi, totaling 9 solidi) were paid. The 12 Augusti that ruled the West between 284 and 395 averaged about nine years per reign. Thus the accession donatives would have averaged about 1 solidus p.a. The late soldier's disposable income would thus have averaged at least 2 solidi per annum. It is also possible, but undocumented, that the accession bonus was paid for each Augustus and/or a bonus for each Caesar. The documented income of 2 solidi was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the disposable income of a 2nd-century legionary (which {{was the equivalent of}} c. 8 solidi). The late soldier's discharge package (which included a small plot of land) was also minuscule compared with a 2nd-century legionary's, worth just a tenth of the latter's.|$|E
25|$|Although Ukrainian still {{remained}} the native language {{for the majority}} in the nation on the eve of Ukrainian independence, a significant share of ethnic Ukrainians were russified.

Copper cladding offers additional opportunities to reduce the weight of copper structures (For more details, see: Copper cladding and Wall cladding).|$|E
25|$|The {{early days}} for fledged juveniles are more hazardous; {{during its first}} dives into water, about four days after leaving the nest, a fledgling may become {{waterlogged}} and drown. Many young will not have learned to fish {{by the time they}} are driven out of their parents' territory, and only about half survive more than a week or two. Most kingfishers die of cold or lack of food, and a severe winter can kill a high percentage of the birds. Summer floods can destroy nests or make fishing difficult, resulting in starvation of the brood. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the young survive to breed the following year, but this is enough to maintain the population. Likewise, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> adult birds survive from one breeding season to the next. Very few birds live longer than one breeding season. The oldest bird on record was 21 years.|$|E

25|$|There also existed an unequal {{distribution}} of health resources.

Public opinion polls since the 1990s consistently show that <b>only</b> about <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> Americans support democracy promotion.

25|$|Hindus {{believe that}} human civilization degenerates spiritually during the Kali Yuga, which is {{referred}} to as the Dark Age because in it people are as far away as possible from God.
