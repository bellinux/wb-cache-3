In this album, Living Sacrifice switched from thrash metal to down-tuned death metal, and D.J. started experimenting with a death growl in his vocal approach.

25|$|Actress Björk, who {{is known}} {{primarily}} as a contemporary composer, had rarely acted before, and has described the process <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>this</b> film as so emotionally taxing {{that she would not}} appear in any film ever again (although in 2005, she appeared in Matthew Barney's Drawing Restraint 9). She had disagreements with the director over the content of the film, wanting the ending to be more uplifting. She later called von Trier sexist. Deneuve and others have described her performance as feeling rather than acting. Björk has said that it is a misunderstanding that she was put off acting by this film; rather, she never wanted to act but made an exception for Lars von Trier.|$|E

The prospect <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>this</b> incarnation of Kain playable left the development team [...] "very excited", and was agreed upon very early in pre-production. Recognizing that he is [...] "the most important character in the series", designer Kyle Mannerberg named several parallels and influences concerning his development up to that point, citing Neo and John Murdoch (the protagonists of The Matrix and Dark City respectively), the archetypal Fisher King of Arthurian legend, the story of Oedipus, and Gnostic myth as inspirations (with both latter sources being reaffirmed as strong influences by Hennig in a later interview). The spells he obtains {{over the course of}} his levels were intended to pay homage to the original Blood Omen.|$|E

Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly was also critical of Leigh's early appearances, referring to her as [...] "awkward". However, Armstrong later noted that the [...] "sparkling" [...] friendship development between Lexie and O'Malley [...] "won her over". The character's transition from season four to five was positively reviewed, with Keen of The Trades writing: [...] "Her presence and confidence have increased quite a bit since last season, and actress, Chyler Leigh, does a fantastic job <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>this</b> progression feel seamless. Since the series has defused the tension between Little Grey and Big Grey (aka Meredith), Lexie has clear sailing through the season and steals the show {{as one of the best}} current characters on the series." ...|$|E

According to Mos Def, the phrase [...] "the ecstatic" [...] was [...] "used in the 17th and 18th centuries to describe people who were either mad or divinely inspired and consequently dismissed as kooks". The phrase resonated with him, as he believed {{no one else in}} hip hop had ever recorded an album like The Ecstatic. [...] "I feel like I was the only person who was capable <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>this</b> type of music in this type of way", he claimed. [...] "I don't rap like nobody, I don't try to sound like nobody." [...] He said [...] "the ecstatic" [...] also referred to [...] "a type of devotional energy, an impossible dream that becomes reality but is discredited before it's realized. The airplane, a nutty idea. The telephone, the Internet. People who envisioned those were considered radical or extreme." ...|$|E

[...] If the curve (hyperbola, parabola, ellipse, etc.) is not situated conveniently with respect to the axes, the coordinate system should be changed to place the curve at a convenient and familiar location and orientation.
