50|$|The <b>offline</b> <b>data</b> {{processing}} system {{is located in}} Kenkyuto and is connected to Super-Kamiokande detector with 4 km FDDI optical fiber link. Data flow from online system is 450 kbytes s−1 on average, corresponding to 40 Gbytes day−1 or 14 Tbytes yr−1. Magnetic tapes are used in offline system to store data {{and most of the}} analysis is accomplished here. The offline {{processing system}} is designed platform-independent because different computer architectures are used for data analysis. Because of this, the data structures are based on ZEBRA bank system developed in CERN as well as the ZEBRA exchange system.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between netnography and digital etnography {{could be seen}} in several ways, but the most obvious one is the research motivation and methodology determined by the purpose. Netnography believe in internet users forming an online community which is highlighted from the substantial daily life, while digital ethnography only treat the digital world as a place to extend their <b>offline</b> <b>data</b> collection to complement the ethnographic research. The methodological framework between them are not typically different, since Netnography mainly use online qualitative techniques and use online quantitative research as a supplement occasionally, while digital ethnography combines both quantitative (e.g. network and co-word analysis) and qualitative (e.g. sentiment and content analysis).|$|E

It is compiled from <b>offline</b> <b>data</b> provided by record labels and distributors such as LOEN Entertainment, CJ E&M Music, Genie Music, Sony Music Korea, Pony Canyon Korea, Universal Music Korea, and Warner Music Korea. The Gaon Digital Chart ranks best-selling non-physical, digital music sales, {{and is an}} aggregate of downloads, streaming and background music. It excludes radio airplay, and different versions of a song are listed as separate entries. It is compiled from online data provided by web-based music providers such as genie, Melon, Mnet, Soribada, Naver Music, KakaoMusic and Bugs. There is no digital album chart because each song is a separate digital download.|$|E
