50|$|Following the Lehman collapse, large {{hedge funds}} in {{particular}} became more wary of allowing their collateral to be rehypothecated, {{and even in}} the UK they would insist on contracts that limit the amount of their assets that can be reposted, or even prohibit rehypothecation completely. In 2009 the IMF estimated that the funds available to US banks due to rehypothecation had declined by more than half to $2.1 trillion - due to both less <b>original</b> <b>collateral</b> being available for rehypothecation {{in the first place and}} a lower churn factor.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, {{rehypothecation}} {{accounted for}} half the activity in the shadow banking system. Because the collateral is not cash it does not show up on conventional balance sheet accounting. Before the Lehman collapse, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) calculated that US banks were receiving over $4 trillion worth of funding by rehypothecation, much of it sourced from the UK {{where there are no}} statutory limits governing the reuse of a client's collateral. It is estimated that only $1 trillion of <b>original</b> <b>collateral</b> was being used, meaning that collateral was being rehypothecated several times over, with an estimated churn factor of 4.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the extent of {{security}} interests in property. A security interest is a right of a creditor to resort to an asset with priority to at least some other creditors of the grantor of security when debt or defaults on the secured obligation. This works examines to what extent the secured creditor’s right is, or ought to be, affected when the encumbered asset undergoes changes that result in a new derived asset. Three scenarios are looked at: where new assets (“fruits”) are derived from the original collateral; where the <b>original</b> <b>collateral</b> is substituted for another asset or where it is incorporated or mixed with other assets into a new product. The question has attracted little judicial or academic attention. In the key case Buhr v Barclays Bank Plc [2001] EWCA 1223 it was held that that the secured creditor had a right to sale proceeds of collateral by virtue of its property right. This was termed as a “principle of substitutions” encompassing accretions, fruits and proceeds of the <b>original</b> <b>collateral.</b> It is suggested that this “principle” does not exist in current English law. This is so whether the security is fixed or floating. If a security interest is to extend to derived assets, parties ought to bargain for it. If new assets are a result of dispositions unauthorised by the secured creditor the creditor may claim the proceeds by asserting a new right based on unjust enrichment, not by virtue of the original property right. English law contrasts with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the US, where the secured creditor automatically acquires right to proceeds. Law and economics analysis suggests that extending security to proceeds promotes efficiency of secured credit but only if proceeds are understood narrowly and do not include fruits...|$|E

40|$|The {{new world}} is upon us. Repent. Revised Article 9 {{is the law}} in every state. Commercial deposit {{accounts}} are now available as <b>original</b> <b>collateral.</b> Bringing commercial deposit accounts into the Article 9 fold significantly complicates the planning of an Article 9 secured transaction.

40|$|In {{connection}} with a troubled debt restructuring, a debtor, with the creditor's approval, sells the collateral (real estate) on a contract for deed for a purchase price, the present value {{is less than the}} creditor's net investment in the related loan. The creditor does not release its lien on the property. The seller-debtor provides 100 percent financing for the third-party purchaser, with payment terms identical to the seller-debtor's obligation under the restructured terms. The thirdparty purchaser must make the monthly payments directly to the creditor and not to the sellerdebtor. The issue is whether the sale of collateral and related requirement for the purchaser to make payments directly to the creditor warrant the creditor's recognition of a loss related to the amount by which the net investment in the loan exceeds the fair value of the payments to be received from the purchaser. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that the creditor should recognize a loss on the disposition of the original loan and record an asset for the fair value of the payments to be received from the purchaser. Under paragraph 28 of Statement 15, the loss would be measured as the amount by which the creditor's net investment in the loan exceeds the fair value of the assets received in full Copyright © 1987, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistribution age 1 satisfaction of the debt. Some Task Force members considered the transaction to be an insubstance foreclosure or settlement of the loan pursuant to paragraph 34 of Statement 15. Others viewed it as the addition or substitution of a debtor pursuant to paragraph 42 of Statement 15. Some Task Force members commented that the creditor should not be able to avoid loss recognition by refraining from legal foreclosure even though the creditor has effectively repossessed the <b>original</b> <b>collateral</b> by approving its sale and requiring the purchaser's payments to be made directly to the creditor...|$|E
