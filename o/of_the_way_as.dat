5|$|Cid {{is confronted}} by Vaan, Balthier and {{company at the}} Draklor Laboratory, which results in a fight that Cid loses. Cid survives the {{encounter}} and flees. Cid goes to the Pharos lighthouse to invoke the Sun-Cryst's full power, revealing himself to the main characters there once Gabranth is defeated. Enraged, Gabranth tries to attack Cid, who teleports out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> Venat throws the judge against a wall. Cid fights Vaan, Balthier {{and the rest of}} the party once again, and again loses. Cid dies after the battle, dissolving into energy absorbed by the Sun-Cryst before it is destroyed and fully activates his final airship, the Bahamut. A character named Cid appears or is mentioned in every main Final Fantasy. He made his debut appearance in Final Fantasy II, though this appearance is the first Final Fantasy game to feature a Cid character as a villain. Cid was voiced by John Rafter Lee in English and by Chikao Ōtsuka in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The season {{came down}} to a two-game set with the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, with the home team one game behind and needing to win both. Stengel, during the 1949 season, had shown himself more apt than his peers {{to bring in a}} relief pitcher, and when during the first game, starter Allie Reynolds gave up the first two runs in the third inning, the manager brought in Joe Page. Though Page walked in two more runs, he shut out the Red Sox the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> the Yankees came back to win, 5–4. This set up a winner-take-all game for the league title. The Yankees took a 5–0 lead before Boston scored three in the ninth, but Vic Raschi was able to prevent further damage, giving the Yankees the pennant, Stengel's first as a major league manager.|$|E
5|$|That season, Brodeur won 43 {{games for}} the second time in his career, and the Devils {{finished}} with the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference after losing the division to the Flyers by two points. Brodeur helped the Devils sweep the Florida Panthers in the first round, giving up only six goals in four games. In the next round against the Toronto Maple Leafs he recorded two shutouts, including one in the final game of the series as the Devils went on to win four games to two, setting up a showdown with rival Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Flyers took a 3–1 series lead and had home ice to close out the series, but Brodeur gave up only one goal in each of the remaining three games of the series, propelling the Devils to a comeback series victory in 7 games. They went on to play the Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup Final, who had a higher seed but fewer regular season points, giving the Devils home ice advantage in the series. After taking game one with a 7-goal rally against Dallas, the Devils were led by Brodeur the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> he gave up only six goals in the next five games, giving the team their second Stanley Cup Championship in six years.|$|E

25|$|Seleucus {{nominated}} his son Antiochus I as his co-ruler and viceroy of {{the eastern}} provinces in 292 BC, the vast extent of the empire seeming to require a double government. In 294 BC Stratonice married her stepson Antiochus. Seleucus reportedly instigated the marriage after discovering that his son {{was in danger of}} dying of lovesickness. Seleucus was thus able to get Stratonice out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>as</b> her father Demetrius had now become king of Macedonia.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Vito Genovese was angling {{to become}} boss of all bosses, and {{believed}} that Gambino would support him. Gambino, however, had his own mind. He secretly joined forces with Charles Luciano and Frank Costello to get Genovese out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> well. Gambino helped trick Genovese into a lucrative drug deal, then paid a small-time Puerto Rican dealer to testify against him. In April 1959, Genovese was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, where he died in 1969.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, a major {{incident}} occurred during their first concert at the Oakland Coliseum on 23 July 1977. Upon arrival at the stadium, it was alleged that Bindon pushed a member of promoter Bill Graham's stage crew out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> the band entered the stadium via a backstage ramp. Tension had been simmering between Graham's staff and Led Zeppelin's security team during the day, and as Grant and Bindon were walking down the ramp near {{the end of the}} concert, words were exchanged with stage crew chief Jim Downey, which resulted in Bindon knocking Downey unconscious.|$|E
25|$|With {{no other}} recourse, Charles Heidsieck {{set out for}} New Orleans seeking {{repayment}} directly from the merchants that received the Champagne. With the conflict of war, Heidsieck had to travel in secrecy into the South. This meant going as far out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> Kansas to avoid detection by the Union Army. Upon his arrival in April 1862, he found the city to be nearly bankrupt and incapable of paying their debts financially. One merchant did have a warehouse full of cotton that was in high demand in Europe due to the shortages caused by the Union blockade. Heidsieck accepted the cotton as payment and attempted to smuggle the cotton out of the port in Mobile, Alabama {{with the use of}} two blockade runners. Despite ordering the ships to take different routes in hopes that at least one would make it past the blockade, both ships were intercepted and sunk with all cargo destroyed.|$|E
25|$|At Wimbledon, Davenport was the {{top seed}} and made it easily to the fourth round, where she was tested again by Clijsters, but came through in three sets to win her second {{successive}} match against the Belgian. Davenport then reached the semifinals, where her match against Amélie Mauresmo was interrupted by rain and was completed {{over the course of}} two days. Davenport eventually defeated Mauresmo and faced 14th-seeded Venus Williams in an all-American final. Davenport led most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>as</b> she served for the match at 6–5 in the second set, and had a match point at 5–4 in the third set. Williams went on to win, 4–6, 7–6, 9–7, in the longest (in terms of time) women's Wimbledon final in history. In that match, Davenport sustained a serious back injury while leading 4–2 (40–15) in the final set, although she acknowledged after the match that the injury did not cause her defeat and that Williams was the superior mentally strong player on the day. The injury forced Davenport to withdraw from Fed Cup competition. She returned to the tour at the Stanford tournament. After reinjuring her back in a warmup just hours before her match, Davenport retired while trailing 0–5 in the first set. This back injury then forced her to withdraw from other hard-court events in San Diego and Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|From Harbor Springs on, M-119 is the Tunnel of Trees Scenic Heritage Route, {{one of the}} Pure Michigan Byways in the state. Bluff Drive becomes Lake Shore Drive {{near the}} Harbor Point Golf Course, and M-119 turns northward to follow the Lake Michigan {{shoreline}} {{at the mouth of}} Little Traverse Bay. The roadway meanders through oaks, maples, birch and cedars along an old Ottawa trail. The writers at National Geographic said that [...] "only sometimes can you catch glimmers of Lake Michigan through the trees, but the dense foliage lends beauty to the winding road." [...] Along this area of the routing, the highway narrows in width and continues through the forest without a centerline most of the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>As</b> the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) states on their website, [...] "M-119 is not a road for those in a hurry." [...] the trunkline continues through the community of Good Hart up the Lake Michigan shoreline to the community of Cross Village. M-119, and state maintenance, end at the intersection between Lake Shore Drive and C-66/C-77 (State Road) in the middle of town.|$|E
500|$|Unusually, Small Heath led at half-time {{at home to}} Sheffield United. Charlie Letherbarrow, in {{only his}} second {{appearance}} for the club, scored after ten minutes and again approaching the interval to regain the lead. Between the two legitimate scores, he hit a swerving shot which looped up off the chest of goalkeeper William Foulke and into the net, but the referee judged that the ball had been played in from behind the goal-line. In the second half, Wheldon converted a penalty kick when Foulke pushed Hallam out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> he attempted to reach a cross from Tommy Hands, and Letherbarrow completed his hat-trick as Small Heath won 4–1. Jack Oliver received a good reception {{when he returned to}} his former club– Small Heath were introduced as [...] "Oliver's team"– but Sunderland took no pity, winning 7–1. At Liverpool, an exciting game produced a 3–1 defeat. The three home forwards worked as one, putting extra pressure on the centre of the visiting midfield, and the defence was unable to hold them out. The game was rough at times, Liverpool's Joe McQue attracting particular attention because of an incident in the corresponding match the previous season when Caesar Jenkyns was sent off for his violent reaction to McQue kicking Frank Mobley in the abdomen.|$|E
500|$|Her ice castle, {{which she}} creates while singing [...] "Let It Go", was {{designed}} to illustrate the maturing of her powers {{as well as to}} be [...] "a manifestation of her feelings to the world". The palace is initially beautiful; however, after she is made aware of the destruction she has inadvertently caused, and as she is increasingly vilified and hunted by others, it becomes darker and more distorted, with jagged icicles forming on the walls. The film's design team was uncertain about how it should look and drew out designs for various ice castles filled with snow. Lasseter suggested basing the structure and patterns on snowflakes. For example, an enormous snowflake would serve as the foundation, and the palace would be hexagon-shaped. Lasseter also wanted snowflake patterns to influence the manner in which Elsa creates the palace. [...] "Snowflakes are these tiny little ice crystals that form in mid-air. And when there are changes in temperature and humidity, these snowflakes start growing in a pattern that's known as branching and plating," [...] said co-effects supervisor Dale Mayeda. [...] " [...] said 'You know, when Elsa builds her ice palace, it would be so amazing if—every step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> this castle forms out of thin air—it's just branching and plating, branching and plating all along the way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even {{before the}} war, Nazi Germany {{maintained}} {{a supply of}} slave labour.

Prisoners of war and civilian [...] "undesirables" [...] were brought in from occupied territories. Hundreds of thousands of Poles, Jews, Slavs and other conquered peoples were used as slave labourers by German corporations such as Thyssen, Krupp, IG Farben and even Fordwerke—a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company. By 1944, slave labour made up one quarter of Germany's entire work force, and the majority of German factories had a contingent of prisoners.

The image of Schrader peering into Earnhardt's car, only to jump back and frantically signal for assistance, is etched into the minds of many racing fans; his interview with Jeanne Zelasko during Fox Sports' post-race show was the first sign to many that something was wrong with the seven-time Winston Cup champion, as he appeared visibly shaken and upon being asked if Earnhardt was okay, he said [...] "I don't really know. I'm not a doctor. I got the heck out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> soon as they got there."
