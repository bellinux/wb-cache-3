5|$|Geology is {{the science}} and study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> and liquid matter that {{constitutes}} the Earth.

The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.|$|E
5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-energy solids and low-energy types. The relative {{energy of a}} solid {{has to do with}} the bulk nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> itself. Solids such as metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine {{perchlorate}} (ClOClO3) is a {{pale yellow}} liquid {{that is less}} stable than ClO2 and decomposes at room temperature to form chlorine, oxygen, and dichlorine hexoxide (Cl2O6). Chlorine perchlorate may also be considered a chlorine derivative of perchloric acid (HOClO3), similar to the thermally unstable chlorine derivatives of other oxoacids: examples include chlorine nitrate (ClONO2, vigorously reactive and explosive), and chlorine fluorosulfate (ClOSO2F, more stable but still moisture-sensitive and highly reactive). Dichlorine hexoxide is a dark-red liquid that freezes to form a solid which turns yellow at −180°C: it is usually made by reaction of chlorine dioxide with oxygen. Despite attempts to rationalise it as the dimer of ClO3, it reacts more {{as though it were}} chloryl perchlorate, +−, which has been confirmed to be the correct structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid.</b> It hydrolyses in water to give a mixture of chloric and perchloric acids: the analogous reaction with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride does not proceed to completion.|$|E

5|$|Exmoor is an upland area formed almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Devonian and early Carboniferous periods. The name of the geological period and system, 'Devonian', comes from Devon, as rocks of that age were first studied and described here. With {{the exception of a}} suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks forming the lower ground between Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde (within Exmoor National Park but peripheral to the moor itself), all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> rocks of Exmoor are assigned to the Exmoor Group, which comprises a mix of gritstones, sandstones, slates, shales, limestone, siltstones and mudstones. Quartz and iron mineralisation can be detected in outcrops and subsoil. The Glenthorne area demonstrates the Trentishoe Member (formerly 'Formation') of the Hangman Sandstone Formation (formerly 'Group'). The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle Devonian sequence of North Devon and Somerset. These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman Grits were mainly formed in desert conditions. As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation, the plateau remains as a remarkably old landform. The bedrock and more recent superficial deposits are covered in part by moorland which is supported by wet, acid soil.|$|E
5|$|Most turbellarians have pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), {{one pair}} in most species, but two or even three pairs in some. A few large species have many eyes in {{clusters}} over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly {{around the edge}} of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming and enable the animals to avoid it. A few groups have statocysts, fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts are thought to be balance and acceleration sensors, as that is the function they perform in cnidarian medusae and in ctenophores. However, turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, and how they sense the movements and positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> particles is unknown. On the other hand, most have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are probably smell sensors.|$|E
5|$|Togusa tracks {{down one}} of the missing children, now {{assigned}} to an elderly man in the Noble Rot program. As Togusa tries to take the child, the man awakens and demands the child be left with him as he had named the child as his sole heir. He would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death. The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solid</b> State. Later, Togusa receives a call from the Puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter. The Puppeteer and Togusa converse, and Togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the Solid State or commit suicide. He chooses suicide but is saved by Kusanagi who then identifies the Puppeteer as a rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens located in a welfare center.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> a semi-batch {{process for}} <b>the</b> {{intermittent}} treatment <b>of</b> effluent containing dissolved heavy metals was proposed. Like the high density sludge (HDS) process, heavy metals are removed by precipitation in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> other <b>solids.</b> <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> cycling, neutralization rate, temperature, and solution composition were investigated. Sludge density, percent solids, sludge viscosity, and settling velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solids</b> generated {{were used to}} characterize the system. Experiments were performed on iron (III) and zinc solutions. For the iron system, it was shown that <b>the</b> <b>solids</b> generated were in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> aggregates rather than discrete particles. Both cycling and lower neutralization rates tended to improve <b>the</b> <b>solids</b> settling velocity. This was attributed to aggregate restructuring under turbulent mixing conditions, and to the local supersaturation conditions created under different neutralization rates. A critical addition rate of 7. 5 mL/min was identified, below which little benefit was realized. A modified form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Richardson-Zaki correlation was developed. With this function, it was shown that <b>the</b> settling velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solids</b> could be described using volume fraction as the single independent variable. This was unexpected, and identifies particle interactions as the dominant factor in determining <b>the</b> settling characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solids.</b> <b>The</b> zinc system exhibited improvements in the settling velocity with mixing time, while none were realized with <b>the</b> iron <b>solids.</b> <b>The</b> main effect <b>of</b> higher temperatures was to decrease <b>the</b> viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suspending fluid, giving increases in <b>the</b> <b>solids</b> settling velocity.
