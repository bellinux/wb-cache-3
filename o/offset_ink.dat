50|$|<b>Offset</b> <b>ink</b> is a {{specific}} type of ink used in conjunction with offset printing presses such as those used to produce letterpress or lithography prints. Such ink must be specially formulated to resist other chemicals it will come in contact with on the printing press. It is crucial that <b>offset</b> <b>ink</b> resist water-in-ink emulsification (e.g. repel rather than absorb water). It should also withstand degradation by the fountain solution which covers the non-printing areas of the engraved plate.|$|E
5000|$|A {{masterpiece}} of cartography, this Soviet atlas {{was published in}} Moscow in 1967 by the Chief Directorate of Geodesy and Cartography under the Council of Ministers of the USSR (GUGK; Главное управление геодезии и картографии (ГУГК) при Совете министров СССР). [...] This was the second edition of The World Atlas, first published in 1954. Although {{a lot of other}} atlases were published during the years in the Soviet Union under the name [...] "Atlas Mira" [...] (including pocket atlases), this one is the biggest and most detailed and might be probably denoted as [...] "Great Atlas of the World" [...] to distinguish it from all other smaller editions. Still on the cover it simply reads The World Atlas below the coat of arms of the Soviet Union in relief. It was published simultaneously in Russian and English in 25,000 copies and was priced at 42 Soviet rubles. Special cartographic paper and special cartographic <b>offset</b> <b>ink</b> were used. The Atlas was dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The Atlas has a full 250 pages of colour maps, majority of them physical, the index being a separate book, comprising some 200,000 entries. The size of the Atlas is 55 x 32 cm. [...] The maps in the Atlas are arranged in groups starting with general world maps, maps of the Soviet Union and maps of the continents. The world maps are in the 1:50,000,000 scale. The Soviet Union is treated basically as a separate continent with its own physical, political, transportation and time zone maps. It is mentioned in the preface that the number of the maps of the Soviet Union is decreased compared to the previous edition, because of the interim publishing of a separate atlas specifically dedicated to the Soviet Union. For each continent there is a general physical map as an introduction (1:10,000,000 to 1:25,000,000), followed by political and communications maps. This is followed by a number of general regional maps (1:1,500,000 to 1:750,000) and supplemented for important areas by large scale maps (1:250,000 to 1:750,000). 18 different colours are used from deep blue for the ocean deeps to dark brown and white for the highest mountains and glaciers. Relief shading is used for delineating relief along with contour lines. All scales are metric. Tint for elevation is predominately used in larger scale maps: 1:1,500,000 and higher. The shadows and colours combined give an almost stereo impression, the relief popping up out of the pages. Many major cities in the world are shown on separate maps or insets, typically in 1:250,000 scale as well as important areas like the Panama Canal or Palestine, along with detailed maps of small islands in the world oceans.|$|E

50|$|Waterless {{printing}} is an offset {{lithographic printing}} process that eliminates {{the water or}} dampening system used in conventional printing. It uses silicone rubber coated printing plates and specially formulated inks, and typically a temperature-control system is integrated into waterless presses. Waterless offset presses do not use dampening solution to keep the plate's nonimage areas free of ink. These presses function because the plate's nonimage areas consist of a layer of silicon that repels ink. A waterless press resembles a conventional offset press, except the dampening system might be missing. A more common design, however, includes a dampening system to allow the press to function conventionally when needed. Direct imaging (digital) offset presses are waterless, with no dampening system.Waterless <b>offset</b> <b>inks</b> have a higher tack and viscosity (thickness) and are generally stiffer than conventional <b>offset</b> <b>inks.</b> The temperature of the inks must be strictly controlled to maintain the correct viscosity because the plate surface is designed to repel inks of a specific viscosity. This temperature distinction is achieved by running chilled water through tubing in the hollow cores {{of two or more}} vibrating rollers in the ink train on the printing press.|$|R

40|$|Some of the {{advantageous}} {{characteristics of}} ultra violet ink {{are said to}} be the absence of pollution and reasonable energy consumption as well as rapid drying (curing). Little is published about physical properties or print quality. Printers require information in this regard because the reports which are presently available are not clear and lack in detail. If the printability of UV inks were equal to that of conventional <b>offset</b> <b>ink,</b> this ink would be close to an ideal ink. This work was under taken so as to compare the properties of ultraviolet ink with conventional <b>offset</b> <b>ink.</b> The inks selected for study were black sheet-fed offset. One type of ultraviolet ink and a similar type of conventional <b>offset</b> <b>ink</b> were used for comparison. Comparisons were made as to tack, specific gravity, density, printing sharpness, slur, resolution, gloss and dot gain. Since it was learned that the ultra violet ink rendered a lower print density than conventional <b>offset</b> <b>ink</b> when using the same amount of ink, the on-press experiment was performed in order to: 1. Compare both inks at equal solid ink density. 2. Compare both inks under equal press conditions. All variables applied to both inks were the same {{in order to make the}} conditions as similar as possible. The experimental results indicated that the tack of ultraviolet ink at 400 rpm. 90 F was about the same as the tack of conventional <b>offset</b> <b>ink</b> during the first two minutes, but with increased time, the tack of ultraviolet ink increased more rapidly. The misting and flying of both inks were judged to be equal at 400 rpm. 2 ̆ 7 The specific gravity of UV ink was higher than conventional <b>offset</b> <b>ink</b> and the optical density was shown to be lower when using the same amount of ink. This experimental result indicated that more volume and more weight of UV ink had to be used to produce an optical density equal to conventional <b>offset</b> <b>ink.</b> At equal solid ink density, UV ink had much more dot gain than conventional ink at both low and high ink film thickness. The two inks were significantly different in terms of printing sharpness, slur, resolution and gloss. Printing sharpness, resolution and gloss were significantly effected by changing ink film thickness. The conventional <b>offset</b> <b>ink</b> provided better printing sharpness, gloss, resolution and less slur than UV ink at both low and high ink levels, with the exception that the slur values were approximately equal at low ink level. At equal press conditions (unequal solid ink density), the dot gain of the two inks was not much different. But it was obvious that the more ink film thickness or density, the more dot gain with UV ink. The two inks were significantly different in printing sharpness and gloss but not significantly different in slur and resolution. The change in ink film thickness affected printing sharpness, gloss and resolution. At high ink film thickness, the UV ink had lower printing sharpness, gloss and resolution than the conventional <b>offset</b> <b>ink.</b> The change in ink film thickness did not have much effect on slur. This study indicates that UV ink needs further development in order to be comparable with the conventional <b>offset</b> <b>ink</b> in terms of print quality...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{claims a}} {{relationship}} between the film splitting sound emission from the printing press nip and the dynamic interaction occurring there between ink, fountain solution and substrate in offset lithography. The film splitting sound derives from the cavitation formed by the pressure drop {{in the second half of}} the print nip flow passage. As the ink film is strained, the cavities expand and eventually implode into breaking filaments at the nip exit, while emitting a partly audible, broadband, high frequency, noisy sound. A free-field microphone, A/D-converter and laptop computer were used to record pressure signals in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 50 kHz emitted by a variety of printing instruments and presses for a range of <b>offset</b> <b>ink</b> and paper types. After signal acquisition and filtering two signal averages of power and frequency were estimated. This average power increased with increasing loads of sheet-fed <b>offset</b> <b>ink</b> on an ink distributor, in accordance with a mass-conservation model developed. The behaviour of average frequency and power over different ink load ranges indicated transitions between different flow regimes. A glossy fine-coated paper gave higher average power than a corresponding matte paper during printing with such inks on a laboratory device, possibly due to an air sealing effect. The sound from tack measurements with the Deltack instrument during setting of heat-set offset inks printed on MWC papers showed a relation between the measured tack rise and average power, reflecting changes in splitting mechanism during the course of setting. With the Hydroscope instrument the interaction between these heat-set inks and fountain solution was studied, with the measured tack and sound emission displaying a clear, but non-linear, correlation. A heat-set offset pilot trial showed that the acoustic response from the printing nip sensitively and systematically detected changes in (LWC) paper type, optical density, ink-fount balance, and press stability. Pilot trials of cold-set offset inks on newsprint by sheet-fed presses indicated a strong correlation between evolution in average power, optical density and fountain solution consumption during the first thousand sheets normally needed for stabilisation. Acoustic measurements of ink film splitting have, aside from the laboratory studies performed by one Japanese group, previously received little attention, with the current study showing that a great deal of information useful to the printer can be accessed from this sound emission. Although the detailed mechanisms for ink film splitting have to be further studied and supported by mathematical simulation, the sensitivity of the acoustic method recommends its implementation for monitoring and control of offset printing.

Data is obtained using a standard <b>offset</b> <b>ink</b> in combination with several different kinds of paper. Several, different known ink film thicknesses are tested as well as various pigment concentrations. Samples are tested on the IGT printability tester. Using an opacimeter, a reflection densitometer, and a spectrophotometer, the show through for each printed sample is determined In terms of the opacity of the paper used, the reflection density of the ink film, and the reflective spectrum of the ink film. Correlation between the variables in the research is established. The resulting data is analysed using various statistical techniques. It is concluded from the resulting data and analysis that there are several variables that will contribute to show through. A change in pigment concentration or ink film thickness will result in a change in the show through of a particular ink on a particular paper. There is a correlation between the weight and type of paper and the show through of ink on those papers. Some instruments are adequate for determining show through, while others are not. It is recommended that reflection density of an ink film be used as a simple indication of show through. Problems regarding accuracy of instrumentation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Papers are {{coated in}} order to improve the {{properties}} of the surface, to improve printability and to include new functionalities like barriers properties. Typical coating formulation contains a high number of components, some are made from minerals and others are manufactured from petroleum. The barrier properties of today's paper based packages are plastics and/or aluminum             foil. Environmentally friendly substitutie of these nonrenewable materials are needed.   Nanocellulose is a promising material                 and of a growing interest as an alternative to petroleum-based materials, since nanocellulose films/coatings have been shown to have excellent mechanical and barrier properties.   This project aimed to evaluate nanocellulose in combination with minerals in paper coatings. The project had two approaches. One was to evaluate the barrier properties of MFC coatings with mineral included. The second part was about coatings for           printing matters, and evaluation of the possibility to replace petroleum-based binders in the coating color with MFC. Barrier properties were evaluated by measuring the air permeability of the coatings. The properties of the coating affecting the         printability in offset printing examined was the surface energy, the gloss, the roughness of the coatings, the strength and the <b>offset</b> <b>ink</b> setting.   Carboxymethylated nanocellulose formed denser films and had superior barrier properties compared with enzymatically pretreated nanocellulose. Adding of minerals did not affect the barrier properties of the MFC coatings to a significant extent.         Therefore, minerals cannot be added to enhance the barrier but it can be added to reduce the cost of the coating process without losing any barrier properties.                                  The print quality depends on how the ink interacts with the coating. These coatings did have a relatively high surface energy, which is preferable for printing with waterborne ink. It was also shown that the absorption abilities increased when the amount of MFC was increased. However, offset printing demands high surface strength and addition of MFC in the coating color                     drastically decreased the strength. This means that the coatings produced in this work are not strong enough and thereby not           suitable for offset printing. However other printing technologies put lower demand on surface strength and are still possible. ...|$|E
40|$|Comunicación presentada en 36 th IARIGAI International Research Conference, Stockholm, September 2009. Nanopigments are a {{new type}} of pigment. They are hybrid {{materials}} consisting of organic dyes and layered silicate nanoparticles. Nanopigments are already applied to make polymeric coatings and they had shown improvement in mechanical, thermal and stability properties of the substrate and dyes (Batenburg and Fischer, 2001). In this work, nanopigments had been synthesized to be applied in the manufacture of <b>offset</b> printing <b>inks.</b> Therefore, four different nanopigments are pursuit: cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K), in order to obtain primary colour for a four-colour-process system...|$|R
40|$|The {{printing}} {{industry has been}} using computerised ink colour matching for a long time. The problem of ink formulation is to match a given standard colour with {{only three or four}} inks from a basis of about twelve inks. This is generally achieved by calculations based on the well-known Kubelka-Munk turbid media theory, which gives excellent results in many industrial situations. However, some hypotheses are necessary to apply the Kubelka-Munk model and corrections to the measured reflectance are often required (Saunderson’s correction coefficients, for example). One limitation in the resolution of this method of formulation may arise {{from the fact that the}} characterisation of the basic inks is made on one standard substrate, which may differ a lot from the real printing substrate. The aim of this work is precisely to study the contribution of the substrate to the colour matching procedure. The properties of the substrate which intervene in the process are physical properties (thickness, absorbency…) and optical properties (brightness and gloss). Five different papers were chosen to make the characterisations of the basic <b>offset</b> <b>inks.</b> The reflectance measurements were performed with spectrophotometer X-Rite with the D/ 0 ° geometry, specular excluded or included, coupled with a coloured matching software (X-Rite Inkmaster). A special emphasis was put on the influence on the calculation of the ink film thickness, estimated for the different substrates, and on the choice of the correction coefficients for the Kubelka-Munk theory...|$|R
50|$|Acid-based {{fountain}} {{solutions are}} still the most common variety and yield the best quality results by means of superior protection of the printing plate, lower dot gains, and longer plate life. Acids are also the most versatile; capable of running with all types of <b>offset</b> litho <b>inks.</b> However, because these products require more active ingredients to run well than do neutrals and alkalines, {{they are also the}} most expensive to produce. However, neutrals and, to a lesser degree, alkalines are still an industry staple {{and will continue to be}} used for most newspapers and many lower-quality inserts. In recent years alternatives have been developed which do not use fountain solutions at all (waterless printing).|$|R
5000|$|... {{dry offset}} {{printing}}, a printing process {{which uses a}} metal backed photopolymer relief plate, similar to a letterpress plate, but, unlike letterpress printing where the ink is transferred directly from the plate to the substrate, in dry <b>offset</b> printing the <b>ink</b> is transferred to a rubber blanket before being transferred to the substrate. This method is used for printing on injection moulded rigid plastic buckets, tubs, cups and flowerpots.|$|R
