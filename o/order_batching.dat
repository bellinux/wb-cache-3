40|$|Order picking is a {{warehouse}} function {{dealing with the}} retrieval of articles from their storage location {{in order to satisfy}} a given demand specified by customer orders. Of all warehouse operations, order picking is considered to include the most cost-intensive ones. Even though there have been different attempts to automate the picking process, manual order picking systems are still prevalent in practice. This article will focus on <b>order</b> <b>batching,</b> one of the main planning issues in order picking systems. <b>Order</b> <b>Batching</b> has been proven to be pivotal for the efficiency of order picking operations. With respect to the availability of information about the customer orders, <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> can be distinguished into static batching and dynamic batching. Improved <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> reduces the total picking time required to collect the requested articles. According to experience from practice, this can result in significant savings of labor cost and into a reduction of the customer order's delivery lead time. The aim of this contribution is to provide comprehensive insights into <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> by giving a detailed state-of-the-art overview of the different solution approaches which have been suggested in the literature. Corresponding to the available publications, the emphasis will be on static <b>order</b> <b>batching.</b> In addition to this, the paper will also review the existing literature for variants and extensions of static <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> (e. g. due dates, alternative objective functions).

40|$|In manual {{order picking}} systems, order pickers walk or ride through a {{distribution}} warehouse {{in order to}} collect items required by (internal or external) customers. <b>Order</b> <b>batching</b> consists of combining these – indivisible – customer orders into picking orders. With respect to <b>order</b> <b>batching,</b> two problem types can be distinguished: In off-line (static) batching all customer orders are known in advance. In on-line (dynamic) batching customer orders become available dynamically over time. This report considers an on-line <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> problem in which the total completion time of all customer orders arriving within a certain time period has to be minimized. The author shows how heuristic approaches for the off-line <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> can be modified {{in order to deal}} with the on-line situation. A competitive analysis shows that every on-line algorithm for this problem is at least 2 -competitive. Moreover, this bound is tight if an optimal batching algorithm is used. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in a series of extensive numerical experiments. It is demonstrated that the choice of an appropriate batching method can lead to a substantial reduction of the completion time of a set of customer orders.

40|$|Existing on-line <b>order</b> <b>{{batching}}</b> rules, namely fixed {{time window}} batching (FTWB) and variable time window batching (VTWB), try {{to choose the}} fixed time window {{in the case of}} FTWB or the fixed number of orders in the case of VTWB. However, these solutions are not appropriate for the fluctuating order environment. The reasonable assignment of batches to order pickers is also an important issue in order picking systems. Motivated by these issues, we study the problem of integrating on-line <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> and the assignment of the batches, which is called the on-line <b>order</b> <b>batching</b> and sequencing problem with multiple pickers (OOBSPMP). The objective is to minimize the turnover time. To solve the problem, a hybrid rule-based algorithm, referred to FTWB, is proposed in order to form batches and assign them to appropriate pickers under a fluctuating order environment. Three batching situations (off-peak, normal and peak arrival time) and two assigning situations (assigning to one busy picker and assigning to one idle picker) are distinguished. Through a series of experiments, we discover several enlightening findings: (i) the rule-based algorithm demonstrates high effectiveness and efficiency in turnover time with multiple pickers; (ii) the rule-based algorithm leads to an impressive improvement in both saving time and wage costs under different arrival rates, picking devices and time intervals compared with VTWB; (iii) to obtain both good warehouse performance and a reasonable workload distribution, the factors, such as the fixed time window, the average workload per picker and the average idle time per picker are also important issues in analysing the efficiency of order picking systems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{batching}} orders in a warehouse, with the objective of minimizing the total travel time. <b>Order</b> <b>batching</b> is an NP-hard optimization problem that is very difficult to solve exactly in practice. Thus, most implemented solutions are based on elementary heuristic methods that perform a relatively limited exploration of the solution space. As an alternative, we propose a heuristic based on variable neighborhood search, where the emphasis is placed on performing an intensive exploration of the most promising regions of the solution space. Simulations are conducted to study the performance of the method with different warehouse configurations, and an exhaustive comparative analysis, which considers all the best known heuristics, is carried out. The results obtained show that the proposed heuristic is competitive and that it provides a suitable method which can be used in practice. Additionally, since the performance of the algorithms depends heavily on factors such as storage policy, routing strategies, or the structure of the orders, we have developed an ANOVA in order to consider the effect of all the above factors on the different methods tested.
