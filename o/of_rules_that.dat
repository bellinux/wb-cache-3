5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of the war had forced the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and {{he was allowed to}} leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages {{can be described as}} closed structural systems consisting <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> relate particular signs to particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, MMA had {{a number}} of {{different}} rule sets, with each one differing in ruling on downward elbow strikes (12-6 elbows). In UFC 1, the first UFC event where there were very few rules, Kevin Rosier used 12-6 elbows on Zane Frazier. In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were drawn up {{to try to make the}} sport more mainstream. The meeting consisted of representatives of a number of major MMA organisations including Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Pride Fighting Championships and International Fighting Championships (IFC) as well as doctors and referees in New Jersey, United States. In the meeting, doctors raised concerns about 12-6 elbows after seeing an IFC match where 12-6 elbows were used to the back of a fighter's head. One doctor argued that they could be life-threatening, and refused to sanction any set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> didn't prohibit them.|$|E
40|$|Empire is best {{understood}} {{not as a}} singular territorial or economic entity or an arrangement of flows and accumulation of stocks but, rather, as a type <b>of</b> <b>rule.</b> <b>That</b> is, it is the relationships between ruler and ruled, and the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>rule,</b> <b>that</b> are important in contemporary discussions of "empire.

5|$|Generally, {{performances}} can {{be classified}} as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> would govern playing and it usually involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict rules that normally govern play are often ignored and the performers are usually between people well acquainted with one another, usually close family members. These performances usually were times when amateurs practiced on the instruments, young boys and girls gathered the instruments, substituting the kulintang with the saronay and inubab. Ensembles didn’t necessary have to have five instruments like formal performances: they could be composed of only four instruments (three gandingan gongs, a kulintang, an agung, and a dabakan), three instruments (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).|$|E
5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E
5|$|The ICSID {{does not}} conduct {{arbitration}} or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers institutional and procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has two sets <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> determine how cases will be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. To be processed {{in accordance with}} the ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's contracting member states and a national of another contracting member state. It must also be of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of the parties to the dispute is either not a contracting member state or a national of a contracting member state. However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention. Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary. However, once the parties have consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither party can unilaterally withdraw its consent.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century the atom– long {{believed}} to be the smallest building-block of matter– was proven to consist of even smaller components called protons, neutrons and electrons, which are known as subatomic particles. Starting in the 1960s, other subatomic particles began being discovered. In the 1970s, it was discovered that protons and neutrons (and other hadrons) are themselves made up of smaller particles called quarks. The Standard Model is the set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> describes the interactions of these particles.|$|E

However, the enforcement of this directive principle became a matter of debate since this principle held obvious emotive and practical value, and was legally the only directive principle within the Indian constitution to have a time limit.|$|E
25|$|As yet an {{alternative}} set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> takes this into account {{has not been}} fully developed.

For every stellation of some polyhedron, there is a dual facetting of the dual polyhedron, and vice versa. By studying facettings of the dual, we gain insights into the stellations of the original. Bridge found his new stellation of the icosahedron by studying the facettings of its dual, the dodecahedron.|$|E

25|$|If a tableau {{calculus}} is complete, every unsatisfiable set of formulae has {{an associated}} closed tableau.

As a result, completeness does not automatically imply the existence of a feasible policy of application <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> always leads to a closed tableau for every given unsatisfiable set of formulae. While a fair proof procedure is complete for ground tableau and tableau without unification, {{this is not the case}} for tableau with unification.|$|E

25|$|The idea to {{transform}} the UK programme into a global franchise was conceived by British television producer Paul Smith.

However, some of Smith's rules have been slightly relaxed over the years as the franchise's history has progressed.|$|E
