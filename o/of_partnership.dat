5|$|A {{string of}} new {{peacekeeping}} missions were launched in Namibia, Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Angola by the Security Council which also triggered {{interest in the}} reform of the 15-member body. Germany and Japan in particular, as well as India and Brazil, launched efforts to gain permanent seats and veto rights at the Council. In the late 1990s, Secretary-General Kofi Annan improved the coherence of the United Nations, with a better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures. The fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic was energized, and a new concept <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> between the United Nations and international business developed under the Global Compact. Other reforms included the revamping of peacekeeping operations following the Brahimi Report. The World Summit in 2005 recognized, albeit mainly symbolically, an international ‘responsibility to protect’ populations from genocide and the Human Rights Council replaced the discredited Commission on Human Rights.|$|E

Fifthly, the commitment to building a Partnership which would be tailored to the different needs of individual Partners was reaffirmed. In this respect, NATO's intention to place a special focus on relations with {{the states of the}} Caucasus and Central Asia was welcomed, including the decision by the Alliance to appoint one liaison officer for each region. They also welcomed the launching of the Individual Partnership Action Plan process by several states of these two regions. Sixthly, NATO's Policy on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, which was developed in consultation with the EAPC partners, was endorsed.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{to report}} by March 2006, the group {{presented}} its {{report to the}} Government in November 2006. They recommended that a civil partnership scheme would resolve most of the issues for same-sex and cohabiting couples, while providing less benefits than marriage. Offering civil marriage to same-sex couples {{would be open to}} constitutional challenge. They also recommended a legal presumption <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> for couples which have lived together for three years, or have children together. No recommendations were made for couples in non-conjugal relationships due to lack of research. The cabinet reviewed the report, but no legislation was introduced before the 2007 general election, and in the intervening period the Government rejected opposition legislation, saying that legislation should await the Supreme Court appeal in Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners.|$|E

A statewide study <b>of</b> business-education <b>partnerships</b> in Illinois public schools was designed and implemented to determine the number <b>of</b> <b>partnerships</b> and to examine the characteristics related to the development and perceived success <b>of</b> <b>partnerships.</b> The study used two surveys to collect data from school officials. Seventy-five percent of the districts in Illinois responded to the first survey; 160 districts participated in <b>partnerships.</b> <b>Of</b> those who did not have partnerships, 78 percent were interested in developing partnerships. A second survey, mailed to a subpopulation of the first survey, determined the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>partnerships.</b> Most partnerships were 1 -year-old, and they served elementary students. They were initiated by school and business personnel together using verbal agreements rather than written contracts. The most common activities <b>of</b> <b>partnerships</b> included mentoring, tutoring, sponsoring field trips, and providing awards. The second survey collected data to determine factors related to the development <b>of</b> <b>partnerships.</b> School enrollment, school location, and school district type were significant. Larger schools {{were more likely to have}} activities with longer time involvements such as professional and policy development activities. The major support for small city schools was financial. Written contracts were characteristic <b>of</b> suburban <b>partnerships.</b> Significantly more high school districts had professional or business organizations as partners. They had a higher concentration of management support activities. Significantly more rural districts perceived their partnerships as successful if they provided awards, team and club sponsors, and money for short-term projects. The study concluded: (1) Many school district officials want to be involved in partnerships. (2) All levels of program activities are important in partnership involvement. (3) The perceived success <b>of</b> a <b>partnership</b> does not depend on a formal policy statement. (4) The location of a school is associated with the existence <b>of</b> <b>partnerships.</b> (5) Partnerships may be considered successful by their participants even when they do not meet the criteria <b>of</b> successful <b>partnerships</b> identified in the literature...|$|R

25|$|The {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> minyanim was {{preceded by}} an opinion by Modern Orthodox Rabbi Mendel Shapiro in 2001, subsequently joined by Bar-Ilan University Talmud Professor Rabbi Daniel Sperber, claiming that halakha (Jewish law) permits Orthodox women to be called to, and to read from, the Torah on Shabbat under certain conditions. These opinions rely on earlier authorities including the Magen Avraham. Dr. Joel B. Wolowelsky also expressed an opinion which, while not offering a formal opinion on the halachic issues, suggested that the partnership minyan enterprise was not necessarily inconsistent with an Orthodox hashkafah (outlook).|$|E
