This {{issue has}} been discussed extensively, with some research pointing to net benefits while others find a net negative impact. Insight can be gained by careful analysis of several sub-questions. For example, for two countries with the same social <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures,</b> will increased social <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures</b> in one lead to different economic growth rates? What is the channel by which such expenditures impact economic growth? What is the function of social <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures?</b> This paper adopts simultaneous equations with three-stage least squares to investigate the relationships among social <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures,</b> human capital, and economic growth using data on Taiwan between 1952 and 2003.

Specifically, it intends to find answers to three questions: first, who are the demographic groups that are most harmed in the recessive cycles; second, if economic growth in itself sufficient to benefit the groups most associated with poverty; third, which are the macroeconomic policies most associated with poverty and with its alleviation. The study used an interaction of micro data form PNAD with macroeconomic data from sources such as IPEA-DATA, Brazilian Central Bank and Secretariat of the Federal Revenue of Brazil. Using logistical regressions with pooled micro-data banks, the work found two main results. First, recession and economic downturns, are more harmful to people with less schooling. Second, tax policy significantly affects poverty: firstly the primary surplus is associated {{with lower levels of}} well-being of the population and, on the <b>other</b> hand, the <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditure</b> of the Union may be used to alleviate poverty during the critical stages of the cycles.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and absorbing questions of our time is whether governments should extend or retrench their efforts toward assisting people who {{do not seem to be}} able to make it on their own. Those who believe that governments should expand their programs to help the needy argue that a compassionate and affluent society has both the ability and the responsibility to do so; those who believe that governments have already pushed too far and too fast argue that the advance of the welfare state must be halted. Closely related to this basic disagreement is the question whether society must sacrifice in one area in order to build in another, that is whether one government program must come at the expense of another. Those who argue that governments should do more for their less fortunate people tend to believe that high levels of defense spending are a hindrance to expanding welfare programs. Conversely, those who believe defense needs are under funded generally feel that <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures</b> are a limitation on national security. This essay focuses on this warfare-welfare dichotomy by measuring and comparing warfare and <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures</b> over an extended period of time in two countries: The United States and the United Kingdom. The main object of this essay is to show the long-term trends of warfare and welfare spending in these two countries in order to determine 1) whether either or both are rising or falling, 2) whether <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures</b> are inversely related to defense expenditures, and 3) whether the welfare-warfare experience in a foreign country comparable with the United States can offer important insights into our present predicaments and help us anticipate certain problems we might face in the future. The United Kingdom was chosen for comparison with the United States because its defense policies and expenditures have closely paralleled ours for the past 30 years and because American <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures</b> have tended, usually with a lag of about 20 years, to follow those of Great Britain more than any other country.

40|$|Certain {{governments have}} been faster than others in {{relaxing}} their {{restrictions on the}} cross-border movement of capital. How can we explain the timing and extent of financial liberalization across countries since the 1970 s? We argue that IMF stabilization programs provide {{a window of opportunity}} for governments to initiate financial reforms, but that policymakers are more likely to seize this opportunity when <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures</b> are high. Large loans from the IMF shield policy makers from the costs of financial reform, while <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures</b> provide credibility to the government’s ex ante promises of compensation to individuals who are harmed by the reforms. We test this hypothesis on data for 87 countries from 1975 to 2002.

The results provide strong support for the interactive effect of IMF programs and domestic <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures</b> on financial liberalization.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with public finance and social welfare in Australia.

Second it examines the methods used by the Commonwealth Grants Commission {{and the implications of}} these methods in determining relativities among the States in the distribution process of federal funds. Third it examines methods of assessing social welfare need and social <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the States. Fourth it shows how the structure and pattern of federal grants has changed over the past decade. (1973 – 1983) The data reported here allow comparison between the States on a reasonably standard basis, and show some interesting results in the levels of distribution of social service and social <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Social services (broadly defined) involve a major cash flow in Australian society. Annual social <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditure,</b> (a small part only of the States' social services expenditures, but a large proportion of Commonwealth expenditures) for 1982 - 83 alone, would buy BHP, CRA, MIM, Westpac, CSR, Comalco and the ANZ Banking Group, and there would still be some change. In this paper we are certainly not dealing with trifling matters. We have attempted to look at broad issues of public finance, and relate these to social welfare. Chapter 1 outlines the roles and responsibilities of the Commonwealth and State governments in providing and funding social welfare. Chapter 2 deals with the role and methods of the Commonwealth Grants Commission review of tax sharing and its analysis of relative needs and costs in social welfare. Chapter 3 uses the standard budgets worked out by the Commonwealth Grants Commission to shed light on the relative levels and structures of social <b>welfare</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the States.
