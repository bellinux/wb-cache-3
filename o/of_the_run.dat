5|$|In 1986, {{the success}} of A Real American Hero lead Marvel to produce a second title: G.I. Joe: Special Missions which lasted 28 issues. Herb Trimpe was the artist for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run,</b> with Dave Cockrum {{providing}} pencils on several issues. Spinning out of G.I. Joe #50 and set in the same continuity, the series presented more intense violence and a more ambiguous morality than the main title, and the Joes faced enemies who were not related to Cobra. Each issue usually featured a stand-alone mission focusing on {{a small group of}} Joes.|$|E
5|$|Press Gang is a British children's {{television}} comedy-drama {{consisting of}} 43 episodes across five series that were broadcast from 1989 to 1993. It {{was produced by}} Richmond Film & Television for Central, and screened on the ITV network in its regular weekday afternoon children's strand, Children's ITV, typically in a 4:45pm slot (days varied over the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run).</b>|$|E
5|$|The Cagneys had run-of-the-play contracts, {{which lasted}} {{as long as}} the play did. Vernon was in the chorus line of the show, and with help from the Actors' Equity Association, Cagney understudied Tracy on the Broadway show, {{providing}} them with a desperately needed steady income. Cagney also established a dance school for professionals, then landed a part in the play Women Go On Forever, directed by John Cromwell, which ran for four months. By the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run,</b> Cagney was exhausted from acting and running the dance school.|$|E

5|$|The {{bobsleigh}} run (Pista Olimpica di Bob – Eugenio Monti), {{was originally}} constructed in 1928. The track was rebuilt and expanded {{several times during}} the years leading up to the Olympics. A state-of-the-art signal board was installed displaying a diagram <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run</b> with the position of each sleigh on the run shown with lights.|$|E
5|$|The part became Hordern's first paid role as {{an actor}} for a theatre company. The play was an instant hit and ran at the People's Theatre in Mile End for two weeks. It also starred the English actor Stephen Murray in the title role, but he became contractually obliged {{elsewhere}} towards the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run.</b> This allowed Hordern {{to take his place}} for which Daltry paid Hordern an extra £1 a week.|$|E
5|$|The price {{began as}} 1/6 (one {{shilling}} and six pence); {{the price was}} raised to two shillings with issue 60, February 1955, and stayed at that price until the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run.</b> Interior artwork was not used for the first issues, which contained no fiction other than a single novel; illustrations began to appear with issue 29.

5|$|Day-Lewis {{returned}} to the stage in 1989 to work with Richard Eyre, in Hamlet at the National Theatre, London, but collapsed during the scene where the ghost of Hamlet's father appears before him. He began sobbing uncontrollably and refused {{to go back on}} stage; he was replaced by Jeremy Northam who finished the performance word-and-action-perfect and received a standing ovation. Ian Charleson then formally replaced Day-Lewis for the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run,</b> except that Charleson's ill-health forced Northam to stand in again many times. Although the incident was officially attributed to exhaustion, Day-Lewis later claimed to have seen the ghost of his own father. He has not appeared on stage since. The media attention following his breakdown on-stage contributed to his decision to eventually move from England to Ireland in the mid-1990s to regain a sense of privacy amidst his increasing fame.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 the {{producer}} Basil Dean offered Gielgud the lead role, Lewis Dodd, in a dramatisation of Margaret Kennedy's best-selling novel, The Constant Nymph. Before rehearsals began Dean {{found that a}} bigger star than Gielgud was available, namely Coward, to whom he gave the part. Gielgud had an enforceable contractual claim to the role, but Dean, a notorious bully, was a powerful force in British theatre. Intimidated, Gielgud accepted the position of understudy, with a guarantee {{that he would take}} over the lead from Coward when the latter, who disliked playing in long runs, left. In the event Coward, who had been overworking, suffered a nervous collapse three weeks after the opening night, and Gielgud played the lead for the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run.</b> The play ran for nearly a year in London and then went on tour.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, under Albery's management, John Gielgud staged Romeo and Juliet at the New Theatre, co-starring with Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans and Olivier. Gielgud {{had seen}} Olivier in Queen of Scots, spotted his potential, and now {{gave him a}} major step up in his career. For the first weeks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run</b> Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they {{exchanged}} roles. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, contrasting it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry. The friendship {{between the two men}} was prickly, on Olivier's side, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

It has no road access: access is by a double chairlift from a south-southwest orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runs,</b> which often suffer from lack of snowpack. This area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resort, which lacks snowmaking, is often closed when the other areas are open.|$|R

5|$|In September 2015, Cumberbatch {{condemned}} the UK government's {{response to the}} migrant crisis {{in a speech to}} theatregoers during a curtain call at a performance of Hamlet, for which he stars. He also fronted a video campaign to help the charity Save The Children in its mission to aid young Syrian refugees. He was one of the signatories of an open letter, published in The Guardian, criticising the government for its actions regarding the refugee problem. He also gave nightly speeches after his curtain call as Hamlet at the Barbican in London, asking for donations to help Syrian refugees. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run,</b> the audience contributed more than £150,000 for Save the Children.|$|E
5|$|In a rare change, Milligan's run on {{the title}} starts with John living in {{domestic}} bliss with a nurse, Phoebe. Over {{the course of the}} first storyline, several new characters are introduced, including Epiphany Greaves, the alchemist daughter of a notorious London gangster, and Julian, a Babylonian demon. Over the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run,</b> John dealt with a demon taking revenge on people involved in the Liverpool dockers' strike gone insane and sought help from Shade, The Changing Man, after chopping off his own thumb, seen Phoebe die at the hands of Julian, and traveled to India {{to try to find a}} way of saving her. Following this, he realised that he was in love with Epiphany, and married her in the 275th issue. However, the events of this wedding turned Constantine's niece Gemma against him, due to the Demon Constantine sexually assaulting her in the restroom. The strain of this traumatic incident turned her against John, and she enlisted the help of a coven of witches to kill him, which later came to a head when John was forced to fight off a brutal Demon summoned by them using John's iconic trenchcoat to target him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the game}} with Auburn, Tech piled up 472 yards {{on the ground in}} 84 rushes and 145 yards in the air. Guyon scored four {{touchdown}}s, and Strupper had a 65-yard touchdown run. According to the Atlanta Journal,It was not the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run</b> that featured it was the brilliance of it. After getting through the first line, Stroop was tackled squarely by two secondary men, and yet he squirmed and jerked loosed from them, only to face the safety man and another Tiger, coming at him from different angles. Without checking his speed Everett knifed the two men completely, running between them and dashing on to a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Its premiere at the Queen's Theatre on 24 February 1711, {{possibly}} under Handel's direction, was {{a triumphant}} success. A further 12 performances were immediately scheduled; {{at the end}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run,</b> popular demand was such that two more were added. Notwithstanding this enthusiasm, the financial strains of such a grand production led to legal actions against Hill from unpaid craftsmen. Nine days after the premiere the Lord Chamberlain's Office revoked the impresario's licence. Under Hill's successors the opera was played at the theatre in most seasons until 1716–17, by which time it had totalled 47 performances, far {{more than any other}} opera at the Queen's.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{contacted}} by Atlas via radio, and is guided to safety from the Splicers and the perils <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run</b> down city. Atlas requests Jack's help in stopping Ryan, directing {{him to a}} docked bathysphere where he claims Ryan has trapped his family. When Jack encounters a wandering Little Sister and its fallen Big Daddy, Atlas urges Jack to kill the Little Sister to harvest her ADAM for himself; Dr. Tenenbaum overhears this and intercepts Jack before he harms the Little Sister, urging him to spare the child and any other Little Sisters he encounters, providing him with a plasmid that would force the sea slug out of her body. Jack eventually works {{his way to the}} bathysphere, but Ryan destroys it before Jack can reach it. Enraged, Atlas directs Jack towards Ryan's mansion through Ryan's army of Splicers and Big Daddies. At times, Jack is forced to travel through areas controlled by Ryan's allies that have now become deranged, such as Sander Cohen, a former musician that now takes enjoyment in watching the death and misery of others.|$|E
5|$|Most of the highest-scoring games {{happened}} before the 1995–96 season, when the average scoring (points per game) per team {{was always in}} the 100s. Since that season, the average has dropped down to the 90s. Only two post-1995 games make the top-ten lists of both the regular season and playoffs: a May 10, 2003 game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Sacramento Kings and a December 7, 2006 game between the Phoenix Suns and New Jersey Nets. Both the Mavericks and the Suns were coached by Nelson and Mike D'Antoni respectively, both of whom also made use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run</b> and gun style.|$|E
40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main {{problems}} in free range husbandry of laying hens is <b>the</b> uneven use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hen <b>run.</b> Several former experiments {{showed that a}} good and manifold structuring is necessary to achieve a better use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hen <b>run</b> and better dispersion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animals. Methodology: <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> these experiments were implemented on eight farms and the effect was successfully tested with control groups on the same farms. Results, conclusion, state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> art: Especially <b>the</b> middle part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hen <b>run</b> was used more often. However the nearest part to the hen house will always be frequently used as the hens have to pass it to reach <b>the</b> distant parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hen <b>run.</b> Alternating use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hen <b>run</b> near <b>the</b> hen house and good and manifold structuring in the distant parts are appropriate measurements to enhance <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hen <b>run</b> and to conserve a good turf quality...|$|R

5|$|Sam Mendes {{directed}} a 1993 RSC production in which Simon Russell Beale's Ariel was openly resentful {{of the control}} exercised by Alec McCowen's Prospero. Controversially, in the early performances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run,</b> Ariel spat at Prospero, once granted his freedom. An entirely different effect was achieved by George C. Wolfe in the outdoor New York Shakespeare Festival production of 1995, where the casting of Aunjanue Ellis as Ariel opposite Patrick Stewart's Prospero charged the production with erotic tensions. Productions in the late 20th-century have gradually increased the focus placed on sexual tensions between the characters, including Prospero/Miranda, Prospero/Ariel, Miranda/Caliban, Miranda/Ferdinand and Caliban/Trinculo.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1907 – {{also known}} as the 1907 Bankers' Panic or Knickerbocker Crisis – was a United States {{financial}} crisis that took place over a three-week period starting in mid-October, when the New York Stock Exchange fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. Panic occurred, as this was during a time of economic recession, and there were numerous runs on banks and trust companies. The 1907 panic eventually spread throughout the nation when many state and local banks and businesses entered bankruptcy. Primary causes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>run</b> included a retraction of market liquidity by a number of New York City banks and a loss of confidence among depositors, exacerbated by unregulated side bets at bucket shops.|$|E
