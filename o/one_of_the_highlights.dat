5|$|Kingdom Hearts was wildly successful, {{shipping}} {{more than}} four million copies worldwide; Shimomura's music was frequently cited as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> of the game, and the title track has been ranked as the fourth-best role-playing game title track of all time.

5|$|On their {{donation}} to the South Kensington Museum, the nine works donated by Watts were hung on the staircase leading to the library, but Hope proved a popular loan to other institutions {{as a symbol of}} current British art. At the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887 in Manchester, an entire wall was dedicated to the works of Watts. Hope, only recently completed but already the most famous of Watts's works, was placed at the centre of this display. It was then exhibited at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial Exhibition and the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris, before being moved to Munich for display at the Glaspalast. In 1897 {{it was one of the}} 17 Watts works transferred to the newly created National Gallery of British Art (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain); at the time, Watts was so highly regarded that an entire room of the new museum was dedicated to his works. The Tate Gallery considered Hope <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> of their collection and did not continue the South Kensington Museum's practice of lending the piece to overseas exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{year after}} the Olympics, Dix began {{the season with a}} world-leading time of 10.00seconds in Tallahassee in April. He also set a world-leading relay time of 37.92seconds with Travis Padgett, Shawn Crawford and Darvis Patton at the Penn Relays. However, he failed to {{maintain}} this strong form through the rest of 2009. Coach Teddy Long planned to improve Dix's start and acceleration in his races, but the two parted company in April. He placed third behind Michael Rodgers and Asafa Powell at the Prefontaine Classic but, unusually, this proved to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> of a low-profile year for Dix. He competed at the US Championships, but injuries forced him out of both the 100m and 200m races and he did not qualify for the World Championships. Furthermore, he entered a legal battle with his management company, regarding whether they merited the 20% portion of his multimillion-dollar sponsorship contract with Nike. The dispute with his agent Kimberly Holland was resolved in July: although the terms were undisclosed, Dix left Holland's Icon Management and decided to be his own agent. With his father as his coach, a legal battle and no major races to prepare for, Dix ran only a handful of local meetings in the rest of 2009.|$|E

30|$|Those {{urban road}} user {{charging}} schemes which {{have aimed to}} reduce traffic have typically reduced traffic entering the charged zone by between 14 % and 23 % [6, 7, 68, 74].

Changes in the Norwegian Toll Rings, which aimed to generate revenue rather than reduce traffic, have been much smaller [47]. Effects on speeds and congestion have been more variable. The London scheme reduced congestion by 30 % initially, but this has since been eroded by extraneous factors which have temporarily reduced road network capacity, and by intentional reallocation of road space [33, 74]. Stockholm experienced a one third reduction in delay in the charged area, which has been sustained subsequently [68].|$|R
