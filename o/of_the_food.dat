5|$|Frogs are primary {{predators and}} an {{important}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> web. Being cold-blooded, they make efficient use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they {{play a part in}} increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The FBI arrives to take Marvin back to Ethiopia, but Marvin tricks {{them into}} taking Cartman instead. Cartman, who had {{previously}} cared little for the impoverished in Africa, is unable to bear the lack of food and poor living conditions there; furthermore, he attempts to convince the Red Cross there that he's {{not one of the}} Africans, but it fails. While praying to God in Addis Ababa, Cartman says he is sorry he made fun of poor people. He eventually finds a Red Cross shack, where Sally Struthers is hoarding all the food meant for charity. After a brief argument, Cartman exposes all of Miss Struthers's hoarding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply to the Ethiopians, who then take control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply.|$|E

5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, {{the purpose}} of kashrut was to help Jews {{maintain}} a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; {{he says that the}} effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Wenham argued that since the impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E
5|$|Across Ulithi, 29homes were destroyed, 64were damaged, and the {{remaining}} 33were intact. Of the 79non-residential structures, only 4were left standing.

Agriculture saw extensive losses with nearly the entire taro crop devastated and more than 75% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> crop was ruined. Roughly 23% of the coconut trees were destroyed and 45% were damaged. It took approximately two years for the coconut crop to return to normal.

The most common amphibians recognized were frogs (Rana and Hyla). Specific species of reptiles and amphibians prey include: boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata); Canadian toads (Bufo hemiophrys); wood frogs (Rana sylvatica); bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana); green frogs (Rana clamitans); northwestern salamanders (Ambystoma gracile); Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus); rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa); and garter snakes (Thamnophis).|$|E
5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may {{have been at the}} top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> chain in its local ecosystem. While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E
5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus {{was at the}} top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> chain, {{probably}} {{preying on}} large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus. In some areas, Daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Gorgosaurus, though there is some evidence of niche differentiation between the two. While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including social behavior, diet and life history.|$|E

5|$|As {{animals at}} the summit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> chain, bears do not have many predators. The most {{important}} are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came {{in conflict with the}} bears that raided them.

The tiger is the only four-legged predator that regularly preys on adult bears, including brown bears, sloth bears, Asiatic black bears, and sun bears.|$|E
5|$|As {{the most}} {{abundant}} large predator in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus {{was at the top}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> chain, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a hatchet.|$|E
