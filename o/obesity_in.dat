The total annual direct cost of overweight and <b>obesity</b> <b>in</b> Australia in 2005 was A$21 billion. Overweight and obese Australians also received A$35.6 billion in government subsidies.

5|$|<b>Obesity</b> <b>in</b> pets {{is common}} in many countries. In the United States, 23–41% of dogs are overweight, and about 5.1% are obese. The rate of <b>obesity</b> <b>in</b> cats was {{slightly}} higher at 6.4%. In Australia the rate of obesity among dogs in a veterinary setting {{has been found to}} be 7.6%. The risk of <b>obesity</b> <b>in</b> dogs is related to whether or not their owners are obese; however, there is no similar correlation between cats and their owners.|$|E
5|$|The healthy BMI range {{varies with}} the age and sex of the child. <b>Obesity</b> <b>in</b> {{children}} and adolescents {{is defined as a}} BMI greater than the 95thpercentile. The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity. Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21stcentury, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates of <b>obesity</b> <b>in</b> Canadian boys have increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.|$|E

5|$|As with <b>obesity</b> <b>in</b> adults, {{many factors}} {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to <b>obesity.</b> <b>In</b> obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} trends <b>in</b> <b>obesity</b> {{rates and}} education-related absolute and relative inequalities <b>in</b> <b>obesity</b> {{over the last}} 40 years in France. Data are drawn from the French Decennial Health Surveys of 1970, 1980, 1991 and 2003. The difference <b>in</b> <b>obesity</b> rates between the least- and most-educated, the Slope Index of Inequality, is used to estimate absolute inequalities <b>in</b> <b>obesity.</b> The ratio of the corresponding rates, the Relative Index of Inequality, reveals the relative inequalities <b>in</b> <b>obesity.</b> Obesity rates were similar in men and women, but educational inequalities were greater <b>in</b> women. <b>Obesity</b> rates were similar over the first three surveys but increased for all in the 2003 survey. This increase was accompanied by increases in absolute inequalities in men (P = 0. 04) from a Slope Index of Inequality of 4. 80 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 2. 27, 7. 32) to 8. 64 % (95 % CI = 5. 97, 11. 32) and women (P = 0. 004) from 8. 90 % (95 % CI = 6. 18, 11. 63) to 14. 57 % (95 % CI = 11. 83, 17. 32). Relative inequalities <b>in</b> <b>obesity</b> remained stable over the 40 years. Recent increase <b>in</b> <b>obesity</b> rates <b>in</b> France is accompanied by increases in absolute education-related inequalities, while relative inequalities have remained stable; this suggests that obesity rates have increased at a much faster rate in the low-education groups...|$|R

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition {{and infectious diseases}} as the most significant cause of poor health. Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of <b>obesity</b> <b>in</b> the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools.

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution it was {{realized}} that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers.

Height and weight thus both increased through the 19thcentury in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in <b>obesity.</b> <b>In</b> the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common.|$|E
