5|$|A {{total of}} 343 figures were painted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
5|$|The seven prophets of Israel {{chosen for}} {{depiction}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> include the four so-called Major prophets: Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel. Of the remaining possibilities among the Twelve Minor Prophets, the three represented are Joel, Zechariah and Jonah.|$|E
5|$|There {{was hardly}} a design element <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> that was not {{subsequently}} imitated: the fictive architecture, the muscular anatomy, the foreshortening, the dynamic motion, the luminous colouration, the haunting expressions of the figures in the lunettes, the abundance of putti.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> was renovated and mural {{paintings}} were painted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The HUD {{standard}} {{requires a}} flame spread of 75 or less <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R

5|$|That {{part of the}} {{restoration}} in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, the work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once the ceiling was completed.|$|E
5|$|The restorers {{took for}} granted {{that all of the}} layers of grease and soot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> were the result of candle smoke. Contrary to this view, James Beck and {{numerous}} artists have suggested that Michelangelo used carbon black in a wash of glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, a secco. If this is the case, then the greater part was removed in the restoration.|$|E
5|$|The second floor, {{reserved}} as {{the chamber}} for the Senate, was more ornate and adorned with heavy red drapes. By 1796, the room featured 32 secretary desks {{very similar to}} the desks that are still used in the current Senate chamber in the United States Capitol; 28 of the desks at Congress Hall are original. Portraits of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, presented as gifts from the French monarch following the American Revolution, hang in adjoining committee rooms. A fresco of an American bald eagle is painted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> holding the traditional olive branch to symbolize peace. Also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> a plaster medallion {{in the form of a}} sunburst features 13 stars to represent the original colonies. The design mirrors a similar pattern on the floor, where a carpet made by William Sprague, a local weaver, features the shields of each of the 13 original states. The carpet seen today is a reproduction of the original.|$|E

5000|$|The Balinese Hindu-era Court of Justice {{pavilion}} and the [...] "floating pavilion" [...] of Klungkung palace ruins are {{notable for}} painted babirusa raksasa (grotesques) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
5|$|Their {{painting}} demonstrates, {{more than}} any other figures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> Michelangelo's mastery of anatomy and foreshortening and his enormous powers of invention. In their reflection of classical antiquity they resonate with Pope Julius' aspirations to lead Italy towards a new 'age of gold'; at the same time, they staked Michelangelo's claim to greatness. However, a number of critics were angered by their presence and nudity, including Pope Adrian VI who wanted the ceiling stripped.|$|E
5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in four and a half years spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E
5|$|After several failed {{attempts}} by Homer, Marge convinces Bart {{to take the}} medication and his behavior immediately improves, paying attention in school, being respectful to his parents, and tutoring a Navajo boy in his spare time. One night, however, Marge and Homer come home from a date to find Bart in his room wrapped in aluminum foil and coat hangers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Suffering from drug psychosis and Paranoia, he claims Major League Baseball is spying on the town using a satellite. The doctors recommend that Bart go off Focusyn, but he refuses, swallows several handfuls of Focusyn and runs away.|$|E
50|$|Helictites: It's a rear kind of stalactite {{which is}} {{developed}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sides, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floors even <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of <b>the</b> caves, towards many directions (up, side and down).|$|R

50|$|The {{house is}} architecturally notable for the {{remarkable}} decorative plaster work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of many rooms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor. In 1970 {{the property was}} declared a National Historic Landmark.|$|R
5|$|All {{the figures}} are adorned with carved {{ornaments}} and surrounded by borders with reliefs of animals and birds. The lotus design is a common theme. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> are images of the Vidyadhara couples as well as couples in courtship and erotic Mithuna scenes. Through a cleft in {{the back wall of}} the cave is a square sanctuary with more carved images. In the mandapa is a seated Nandi facing the garbha ghriya (sacrum sanctum) containing a Shiva linga.|$|E
5|$|Between 1710 and 1713 {{a further}} {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and less attention was paid to the lunettes.|$|E
5|$|Cave 10 {{is located}} {{at a higher level}} than cave 9 and is {{difficult}} to reach as its front is broken. An open veranda with a broken ceiling and floor leads to a middle room through a grooved broken door, which has windows on either side. The right wall of the hall has a recess with a seat. A cell {{to the left of the}} room has a seat in a recess. A door from the cell leads to a half-cell which has a recess and seat. Traces of painting are seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Outside the veranda to the left is a cistern.|$|E
50|$|The manor has a {{representative}} hall {{as well as}} a well-preserved former floor plan. The elements worth mentioning include a period fireplace in the Hall and stucco <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kawahara used watercolor-coloured {{pencil drawing}} on paper for his {{biological}} work. For other works he also painted on silk and wood, like his paintings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of several temples in Japan.|$|R
50|$|Bikaner - Devi Kund near Bikaner is {{the royal}} crematorium {{place with a}} number of cenotaphs. The chhatri of Maharaja Surat Singh is most imposing. It has the {{spectacular}} Rajput paintings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|Lacke, who {{has lost}} {{everything}} because of Eli, tracks Eli down to the closed-off apartment. Breaking in, he discovers Eli asleep in the bathtub. He prepares to kill her, but Oskar, who was hiding inside the apartment, interferes; Eli immediately wakes up, jumps on Lacke and kills him, feeding on his blood. Eli thanks Oskar and kisses him in gratitude. However, an upstairs neighbor is angrily knocking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> due to the disturbance the fight has caused. Eli realizes {{that it is no}} longer safe to stay and leaves the same night.|$|E
5|$|McLeansboro in {{particular}} experienced minor damage over an extensive area. Its {{local high school}} reported 19broken windows in the girls' gymnasium, along with cracked plaster walls. Most of the high school's classrooms sustained fractured walls. The facade of the town's First United Methodist Church was damaged, and a brick and concrete block fell off the top. Hamilton County Courthouse withstood several structural cracks, including one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> above the judge's seat. The town's residents also reported collapsing chimneys; three chimneys toppled at one home, leading to further damage.|$|E

5000|$|... 1945. The Army {{attempted}} {{to return the}} house to civilian use in good order after the war. The interior was painted the colour of weak tea on all walls, doorways, window-frames and <b>the</b> plasterwork <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{hotel is}} three-story high. Its facade has two Doric columns {{supporting}} the balcony overlooking <b>the</b> Cours Mirabeau <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor. Inside, {{there is a}} grand staircase with a wrought-iron railing. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings,</b> there is ornamental plasterwork representing angels.|$|R
5|$|Michelangelo, {{who was not}} {{primarily}} a painter but a sculptor, was reluctant {{to take on the}} work. Also, he was occupied with a very large sculptural commission for the pope's own tomb. The pope was adamant, leaving Michelangelo no choice but to accept. But a war with the French broke out, diverting the attention of the pope, and Michelangelo fled from Rome to continue sculpting. The tomb sculptures, however, were never to be finished because in 1508 the pope returned to Rome victorious and summoned Michelangelo to begin work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The contract was signed on 10 May 1508.|$|E
5|$|The Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} system was retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to the lifts in above-ground stations. LED displays that blink to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in the upper middle section of the door. Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and grabpoles were located near the doors and at both ends of each carriage. The air-conditioning system was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with air-conditioning vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Mars as a wandering {{object in the}} night sky was recorded by ancient Egyptian astronomers. By the 2nd millennium BCE they were familiar with the apparent retrograde motion of the planet, in which it appears to move in the opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression. Mars was portrayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the tomb of Seti I, on the Ramesseum ceiling, and in the Senenmut star map. The last is the oldest known star map, being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets.|$|E
