5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination. Because he had destroyed all his output <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> years, he {{had little choice but}} to present new works. He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E
5|$|Controversy erupted around Fowler {{after he}} {{reportedly}} refused {{to play against}} the Brisbane Roar on 23 January after being named on the interchange bench for the clash.

5|$|Fingleton {{finished}} the series with centuries in each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> Tests, all in consecutive innings; 112 at Cape Town, 108 at Johannesburg and 118 in Durban. In the Third Test, Fingleton and Brown {{set a new}} Australian Test record opening stand of 233, which {{laid the foundation for}} a total of 8/362 declared and an innings victory. It was Australia's first double-century opening stand in Test cricket, and remains a national record for the first wicket against South Africa. On a rain-affected wicket, Fingleton reached his maiden Test century in only 180 minutes before wickets began falling steadily.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Maria began wrestling and was {{defeated}} in her first official match on the January 10, 2005 episode of Raw by Christy Hemme in a Lingerie Pillow Fight. On the March 14 episode of Raw, one of Maria's fillings legitimately fell out after she was slapped by Trish Stratus. She also competed in a Fulfill Your Fantasy Diva Battle Royal at Taboo Tuesday for the WWE Women's Championship, but {{was the first to}} be eliminated. On November 14, Maria competed in a non-title Diva Battle Royal at the Eddie Guerrero tribute Raw show, where she was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> women left but was eliminated by Melina and Trish Stratus.|$|E
5|$|After the 1934 tour, Woodfull and Ponsford—Australia's first-choice opening pair—retired, leaving {{vacancies}} in the Test team. Fingleton scored {{four centuries}} {{and was the}} leading run-scorer during the 1934–35 domestic season to earn a recall to the Australian team for the 1935–36 tour of South Africa. From that point onwards until the outbreak of World War II, he opened the batting with his New South Wales partner Bill Brown. With Bradman absent due to illness, it was the happiest time of Fingleton's career, and he scored centuries in three consecutive innings as Australia won each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> Tests by an innings. In the Fourth Test, he and Brown put on the first double century opening partnership for Australia in a Test.|$|E

5|$|Jaruzelski's Poland {{depended}} on low-cost deliveries of industrial staple commodities from the Soviet Union and meaningful Polish reforms, economic or political, were not feasible during the rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> conservative Soviet general secretaries. The perestroika and glasnost {{policies of the}} Soviet Union's new leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, were therefore a crucial factor in stimulating reform in Poland. Gorbachev essentially repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had stipulated that attempts by its Eastern European satellite states to abandon the communist bloc would be countered by the Soviet Union with force. The developments in the Soviet Union altered the international situation and provided a historical opportunity for independent reforms in Poland. The hardline stance of US President Ronald Reagan was also helpful. David Ost stressed the constructive influence of Gorbachev. With his support for Polish and Hungarian membership in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and for the East European pluralistic evolution in general, the Soviet leader effectively pushed East Europe toward the West.|$|E
5|$|Miller then {{played for}} Tasmania Combined XI—which {{consisted}} mainly of Victorians—against Hammond's tourists in Hobart. He scored 70 and 30, {{opening in the}} second innings, and took a wicket in each innings, removing Evans and Ikin as the match ended in a draw. This {{was followed by a}} match against Queensland in Brisbane in which Miller scored 81 batting at No. 3, featuring in a 93-run stand with Meuleman as Victoria amassed 466. He then took 3/21 in the hosts' first innings, removing opener Geoff Cook before returning late in the innings to take two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> wickets. Hassett asked the Queenslanders to follow on and Miller took 1/20 and two catches as the hosts were defeated by an innings and 13 runs. Miller had a light workload with the ball as Hassett asked him to deliver only 15.4 eight-ball overs.|$|E
5|$|Poulton had {{her most}} {{productive}} {{season in the}} WNCL in 2008–09 ahead of the 2009 World Cup, scoring 376 runs at 41.77. She posted two half-centuries {{in the first four}} matches, resulting in eight-wicket wins over Queensland and Western Australia respectively. She then made fifties in each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> round-robin matches. This included 60 and 53 against Victoria in the last two games, which New South Wales won win by nine and three wickets respectively. New South Wales thus earned the right to host the final against the same team, and Poulton made 43 as they chased down 118 and won the title by six wickets. Poulton totalled 0/48 from 11 overs during the WNCL. She also played in two Twenty20 interstate matches, scoring 23 and 35. New South Wales won the first before losing by one wicket to Victoria in the second.|$|E

5|$|Soon, all {{the bodies}} except that of Alexey, which was never found, had been recovered. Those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> to die—De Long, Ambler and Ah Sam—were some {{distance}} from the rest, where they had evidently attempted to set up a final camp on higher ground. Melville's party wrapped all the bodies in canvas, and carried them to a hill high enough to be safe from seasonal flooding. There they placed them in a large coffin improvised from driftwood, which they covered with rocks surmounted by a large wooden cross, inscribed with the names of the lost men. Melville's group left the site on April 7, 1882, then spent a further month in the delta, searching without success for signs of Chipp and his crew.|$|E
5|$|The Financial Times {{poll was}} the result of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old and that have produced at least 30 graduates in each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent response rate. The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the Financial Times. The survey responses are audited by KPMG.|$|E
5|$|The Minerals Management Service (renamed on 18 June 2010 to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or Bureau of Ocean Energy (BOE)) is the {{regulatory}} and inspecting body for {{offshore oil drilling}} and rigs in the United States of America. According to an Associated Press investigation, certain safety documentation and emergency procedure information, including documentation for the exact incident that later occurred, was absent. The exact number of required monthly inspections performed varied over time; the inspections were carried out as required for the first 40 months, but after that around 25% of inspections were omitted, although the investigation notes this is partly expected, since there are circumstances such as weather and movement which preclude an inspection. Reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> inspections for 2010 were provided under Freedom of Information legislation. Each of these inspections had taken two hours or less.|$|E

5|$|The {{reign of}} the first four kings was {{distinct}} from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> kings. The first kings were elected. Between the reigns of the final three kings, however, the monarchy became hereditary, and as such, the senate became subordinated to the king. This breach in the senate's sovereignty, rather than an intolerable tyranny, was probably what led the Patricians {{in the senate to}} overthrow the last king. The king may have sought the support of the Plebeians; however, the Plebeians were no doubt exhausted from their continued military service, and from their forced labor in the construction of public works. They were probably also embittered by their lack of political power, and therefore did not come to the aide of either the king or the senate.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Loxton {{served with}} the 2nd Armoured Division. He enlisted on 31 July 1942 at Oakleigh, Victoria and was {{discharged}} on 7 November 1945 with the rank of sergeant, having {{spent most of his}} time at the division headquarters. The war ended Loxton and Miller’s partnership at St Kilda. Miller was deployed to South Australia for training before becoming a fighter pilot in England, while his St Kilda colleague served in a reserve unit in Melbourne, enabling him to continue his football career when granted leave. In 1943, Loxton played in only the last four matches of the season, all of which were lost, kicking seven goals, and St Kilda finished last with a solitary victory from ten games. He managed three goals each against Essendon and South Melbourne but was held goal-less against Melbourne. The following year, Loxton played in all 18 matches and topped St Kilda’s goal-kicking aggregates with 52. After making a slow start to the season, aggregating only four goals in the first four matches, including two goal-less outings, he began to score more heavily. The St Kilda forward registered a six-goal haul against Geelong in round eight, helping to secure an away win, and scored 23 goals in the last six matches, including five in each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> matches. However, St Kilda won only one of these three matches. Loxton's efforts helped his club to finish ninth out of 12 teams, and he came second in the club Best and Fairest. He played a solitary match in 1945, which St Kilda lost, and went goal-less.|$|E
5|$|The second epoch saw the reigns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> legendary kings. The second epoch {{was more}} {{consequential}} {{than was the}} first, which was {{in part due to}} the significant degree of territorial expansion which occurred during this period. Regardless of how true these legends were, it is likely that, as the legends suggest, a series of conquests did occur during the late monarchy. As a result of these conquests, it became necessary to determine what was to be done with the conquered people. Often, individuals whose towns had been conquered remained in those towns, while other such individuals came to Rome. To acquire legal and economic standing, these newcomers adopted a condition of dependency toward either a Patrician family, or toward the king. Eventually, the individuals who were dependents of the king were released from their state of dependency, and became the first Plebeians. As Rome grew, it needed more soldiers to continue its conquests. When the Plebeians were released from their dependency, they were released from their Curia. When this occurred, while they were no longer required to serve in the army, they also lost their political and economic standing. To bring these new Plebeians back into the army, the Patricians were forced to make concessions. While it is not known exactly what concessions were made, {{the fact that they were}} not granted any political power set the stage for what history knows as the Conflict of the Orders.|$|E
