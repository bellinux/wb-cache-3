5|$|There {{are over}} two dozen public transit {{agencies}} in the Bay Area with <b>overlapping</b> <b>service</b> areas that utilize different modes, with designated connection points between the various operators. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), a heavy rail/metro system, operates in four counties and connects San Francisco and Oakland via an underwater tube. Other commuter rail systems link San Francisco with the Peninsula and San Jose (Caltrain), San Jose with the Tri-Valley Area and San Joaquin county (ACE), and Sonoma with Marin county (SMART). In addition, Amtrak provides frequent commuter service between and San Jose and the East Bay with Sacramento, and long distance service {{to other parts of}} the United States. Muni Metro operates a hybrid streetcar/subway system within the city of San Francisco, and VTA operates a light rail system in Santa Clara county. These rail systems are supplemented by numerous bus agencies and transbay ferries such as Golden Gate Ferry and the San Francisco Bay Water Transit Authority. Most of these agencies accept the Clipper Card, a reloadable contactless smart card, as a universal electronic payment system.|$|E

40|$|SOAP is the {{standard}} protocol for message exchange in web service environments. As an XML-based protocol, SOAP is not suitable for the transmission of large amounts of binary data. This fact has been addressed by the SOAP Messages with Attachments specification, which regulates the transfer of a SOAP message together with an arbitrary number of binary attachments composed within a MIME multipart/related message. Although {{this leads to a}} reduction of transmission overhead, web service communication using SOAP Messages with Attachments still lacks communication and processing flexibility. In this paper, we present a novel and more flexible way of handling attachments in SOAP-based web service environments. In contrast to SOAP Messages with Attachments, our approach offers message forwarding without additional communication cost and demand-driven evaluation and transmission of binary data, thus providing the opportunity to save time by <b>overlapping</b> <b>service</b> execution and data transmission. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} alliances between banks and {{insurance}} companies. Our perspective {{is that of}} the top management of a financial enterprise, and we constrain ourselves to the retail market. We define six different structure models for financial alliances. The parameters of the models are the closeness of the alliance in terms of mutual ownership, and the question of whether alliance partners have <b>overlapping</b> <b>service</b> channels. Examples are given of the models in the Finnish banking and insurance market. We also characterize nine criteria according to which the previously defined models are to be compared to achieve the most attractive alliance model. Thus, we obtain a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. In the design of the criteria, representatives of the top management of Finnish banks and insurance companies have been consulted.

40|$|This thesis proposes, {{describes}} and validates {{solutions to}} enhance mobility in heterogeneous access networks. Wireless access networks have become available almost everywhere and current research strives {{to make them}} pervasive. Users having wireless access to the Internet are driving the demand for mobile and heterogeneous solutions where services could be accessed from anywhere, any time and from any device. Future wireless connectivity will be provided through a mix of coexisting heterogeneous access network technologies. To enhance mobility in heterogeneous networks this thesis focuses on mobility management systems and connectivity of wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks to the Internet. In a wireless environment with <b>overlapping</b> <b>service</b> areas, mobile nodes need to select which gateway(s) to use to access the wireless infrastructure. The metrics used to select the point of attachment within an access technology are insufficient to compare the capacity of different technologies or multi-hop routes. This thesi...|$|E
40|$|This study uses a risk {{management}} perspective to analyze compliance costs arising from <b>overlapping</b> <b>service</b> tax (ST) jurisdictions. We study {{the case of}} an engineering company providing services to the Companhia de Saneamento Básico do Estado de São Paulo [São Paulo State Sanitation Company] – SABESP, a public entity. The engineering company was contracted under public law 8. 666 / 93, to provide engineering service in several townships in São Paulo’s metropolitan area. Because the laws governing bidding do not permit later modification in price or provider, subsequent double taxation by one municipality cut into the firm’s margins, and should other local governments follow suit, multiple taxation would render the contract untenable for the provider. Our paper models the impact of conflicting jurisdictions on administrative burden, psychological costs and profit constriction and discusses project management techniques for decision making and management in similar situations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Large {{wireless}} network infrastructures experience concurrent or <b>overlapping</b> <b>service</b> outages due to equipment and link failures. The frequency, duration, {{and impact of}} such episodes are of interest to users and network operators alike. Here, a research project which investigates through simulation the characteristics of concurrent network outages in large {{wireless network}} infrastructures is presented. The dependability attributes used to gain a perspective on this issue are network reliability, availability, maintainability and survivability. To assess these attributes in this setting, a new term, called an “impact epoch”, is introduced. Epochs are defined as single, concurrent, or overlapping outages in time, consisting of n different outages. A wireless network is expanded in size and epochs observed as the network grows. The new proposed metrics offer valuable insights into the management of restoration resources. Simulations proved invaluable in identifying multi-outage epochs, as well as modeling their occurrence, frequency, duration, and size – results which are analytically intractable for assessing large networks...|$|E
40|$|Planning {{agencies}} do {{not have}} control over health care resources in the community. Resources are concentrated {{in a number of}} provider organizations, associations, and government agencies, which have common goals as well as a diversity of individual objectives, and therefore enter into networks of relationships to accomplish their <b>overlapping</b> <b>service</b> missions. Interorganizational research shows {{that it is important to}} enhance the interdependence and benefits of cooperation between organizations and at the same time maintain the identity and distinctive qualities of each organization. Thus, in addition to the important role to provide information for decisions, planners have a role to manage the interdependencies and identities among organizations in the health system. Research shows that in situations where only methods, data, and analysis were emphasized by health planners, they had less impact on community decisions than in situations where planners also emphasized the development of the interorganizational system of decision-making. In a neutral position with respect to competing forces, planners can more effectively use their leverage from their information processing role and from their regulatory powers to facilitate the balancing of interorganizational interests and to enhance cooperative benefits to the community...|$|E

Distribution {{and variety of}} spatial condition influence traditional markets’ planning both physically and non-physically. Therefore, this research aimed to conduct a mapping of traditional markets’ spatial distribution and variety as potential factors to improve spatial-based management. Analysis methods including: (1) Mapping by employing Geographic Information System, (2) Category Based Analysis (CBA), and (3) Interactive Analysis were applied in Surakarta City as the research location. The result of this research signifies that spatial variety and distribution of traditional markets in Surakarta had similar pattern between one market to others; <b>overlapping</b> <b>service</b> function; specific commodity types {{in accordance with the}} market’s characteristics; diverse operating hours. Spatial variety and distribution could be potential factors to improve traditional market management as shopping service.

Therefore, distance toward the service center is not considered as the main factor in traditional market management. The main factor in managing and controlling traditional markets’ development includes service function, commodity specification, and operating hour’s flexibility...|$|E
40|$|International audience—Performance of {{heterogeneous}} network is strongly {{limited by the}} interference due to multiple access points operating in the same geographical area, with <b>overlapping</b> <b>service</b> cover-age. The common understanding is that interference, classically processed as additive noise, compromises the transmission and therefore must be ideally avoided or at least strongly limited. However, recent investigations {{in the domain of}} information theory and successive interference cancellation (SIC) techniques have proved that interference may not necessarily be treated as an opponent, but may become an ally. In this paper, we propose a novel interference aware resource management algorithm, where the system may only control its interference perception. In a system consisting of a couple of downlink users and access points with overlapping coverage, we aim to define the most spectral-efficient way to process interference at each receiver. Based on a 3 -regimes interference classifier, both users in the system may either treat interference as noise, orthogonalize transmissions so that interference may be avoided, or cancel interference out of the received signal via SIC-based techniques. Our study shows that, when aiming at maximizing total spectral efficiency, ignoring or avoiding interference is not always the best option. Based on our theoritical study, we propose an interference classification algorithm, with only 2 admissible regimes for each user. Finally, we assess its notable performance improvement by simulation results...|$|E

A physician profile was formulated to aid in evaluating their preference of a hospital given alternative choices. The questionnaire survey was utilized to collect data pertaining to the study. The descriptive method of research was used to determine: (1) the relationship between physician age and size of practice; (2) the relationship between a physician's number of hospital memberships and number of admissions; (3) the relationship between physician hospital utilization and the number of admissions; (4) admission rates of physicians by specialty; (5) physician referral rate by specialty; (6) relationship of physician financial interest in a hospital and their rate of admissions; (7) physician preference for hospital size in relation to the rate of admissions; (8) physician preference for hospital location; and (9) physician ranking of influential factors in selecting a hospital for admission of patients.
