A year later, the Spaniards from St. Louis raided Fort St. Joseph and brought the captured British flag back to St. Louis.|$|E
5|$|All of the 22nd Battalion, bar Elliott's platoon, {{were killed}} <b>or</b> <b>captured</b> during the {{fighting}} at Ruweisat Ridge. Some {{of the other}} battalions that participated in the battle also incurred heavy losses. Elliott managed to link up with elements of the 21st Battalion, the commander of which recommended him for the VC. Elliott was evacuated to hospital where he spent three months recovering from his various wounds before {{he returned to his}} battalion in September.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{casualty}} {{figures for}} the battle as a whole were not produced but can be inferred by examining the two operations. The accepted toll for Operation Atlantic is 1,349, with about 300 fatalities. Operation Spring's losses were about 500 killed with a further 1,000 captured or wounded. Working from these figures, historians estimate around 800 Canadian dead and 2,000 wounded <b>or</b> <b>captured.</b> The Canadian dead are buried in Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, between Caen and Falaise.|$|E

5|$|At {{the battle}} itself, Johnson's forces {{were the first}} to attack. One {{battalion}} of five hundred men, under Johnson's elder brother, James Johnson, engaged the British force of eight hundred regulars; simultaneously, Richard Johnson, with the other, now somewhat smaller battalion, attacked the fifteen hundred Indians led by Tecumseh. There was too much tree cover for the British volleys to be effective against James Johnson; three quarters of the regulars were killed <b>or</b> <b>captured.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cane later {{explains}} to Rose that Polk {{had been his}} commander of an artillery battery at a battle {{which could have been}} a victory but that Polk panicked and ran, depressing his men, with those who didn't desert their positions being decimated, including Cane's brothers, <b>or</b> <b>captured</b> like Cane himself. Rose makes Cane promise not to harm Polk, but still has Polk placed in protective custody.|$|E
5|$|Home Army {{arms and}} {{equipment}} came mostly from four sources: arms {{that had been}} buried by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 invasion of Poland; arms purchased <b>or</b> <b>captured</b> from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.|$|E

5|$|On 14 November, the Navy {{blockade}} of Dalmatian ports was challenged by civilian ships. The confrontation {{culminated in the}} Battle of the Dalmatian channels, when Croatian coastal and island based artillery damaged, sank, <b>or</b> <b>captured</b> a number of Yugoslav navy vessels, including Mukos PČ 176, later rechristened PB 62 Šolta. After the battle, the Yugoslav naval operations were effectively limited to the southern Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|On {{this same}} road, closer to Yongdong, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, which {{was trying to}} help the cutoff units of the 8th Cavalry, was itself {{attacked}} by strong North Korean units. Through some error, the US battalion's F Company advanced to the wrong hill and stumbled into a concentration of North Korean soldiers. Only 26 men from F Company returned, the rest were killed <b>or</b> <b>captured</b> in the subsequent ambush. Altogether, the 5th Cavalry Regiment suffered 275 casualties on July 25.|$|E
5|$|Operation Brevity {{failed to}} achieve most of its objectives, {{succeeding}} only in retaking the Halfaya Pass. The British lost five tanks destroyed and a further 13 were damaged but the tank regiments suffered no losses in personnel. Total casualties amounted to at least 206 men. The 1st Durham Light Infantry suffered the most during the operation losing 196 men killed, wounded <b>or</b> <b>captured.</b> The 2nd Scots Guards lost one man killed and four wounded, the 3rd Coldstream Guards lost one man killed and the 11th Hussars suffered four men wounded.

5|$|The Austrians {{fell back}} into Alessandria, having lost about half the forces they had committed. The Austrians had lost heavily in the 12 hours of fighting: 15 colours, 40 guns, almost 8,000 taken prisoner, and 6,500 dead or wounded. French {{casualties}} (killed and wounded) were {{on the order of}} 4,700 and 900 missing <b>or</b> <b>captured,</b> but they retained the battlefield and the strategic initiative. Desaix's body was found among the slain.|$|E

5|$|The {{estimated}} number of Malagasy casualties varies {{from a low}} of 11,000 to a high of over 100,000. The nationalists killed approximately 550 French nationals, as well as 1,900 supporters of PADESM, a pro-France Malagasy political party created with support from the colonial authorities to compete with MDRM. By August 1948, the majority of the nationalist leaders were killed <b>or</b> <b>captured,</b> and the Uprising was effectively put down by December 1948.|$|E
5|$|The main beaches, codenamed White and Red, lay {{in front}} of Dieppe itself. Making only minor gains, the {{majority}} of the 4th and 6th Brigades became pinned down on the beach, and despite the arrival of an armoured squadron from the Calgary Tank Regiment, casualties were heavy. Reinforcements from the Mont Royals had little effect, and surviving forces were withdrawn by 11:00. Of the nearly 5,000 Canadian troops that participated, more than half were killed, wounded <b>or</b> <b>captured.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{total loss}} of life {{resulting}} from Pontiac's War is unknown. About 400 British soldiers were killed in action and perhaps 50 were captured and tortured to death. George Croghan estimated that 2,000 settlers had been killed <b>or</b> <b>captured,</b> a figure sometimes repeated as 2,000 settlers killed. The violence compelled approximately 4,000 settlers from Pennsylvania and Virginia to flee their homes. Native American losses went mostly unrecorded.|$|E
