50|$|The Crayford focuser is a {{simplified}} focusing mechanism for amateur astronomical telescopes. Crayford focusers are considered superior to entry-level {{rack and pinion}} focusers, normally found {{in this type of}} device. Instead of the rack and pinion, they have a smooth spring-loaded shaft which holds the focus tube against four <b>opposing</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces, and controls its movement. It is named after the Crayford Manor House Astronomical Society, Crayford, London, England where it was invented by John Wall, a member of the astronomical society which meets there. The original Crayford Focuser is on display there.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research project is the investigation of multirecess hydrostatic journal bearings with active hybrid (hydrostatic and hydrodynamic) lubrication. This paper gives a theoretical contribution to the modeling {{of this kind of}} bearing, combining computational fluid dynamics and control techniques. The feasibility of influencing the dynamic fluid film coefficients (stiffness and damping) by means of a controllable fluid injection into <b>opposed</b> <b>bearing</b> recesses is investigated. By controlling the pressure and flow injection using servo control systems, it is possible to obtain significant modifications of active hybrid forces, which can be useful while reducing vibration and stabilizing rotating machines...|$|R

40|$|Egg-laying {{females of}} the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus {{discriminate}} against occupied (egg-laden) seeds, and thus reduce competition among larvae within seeds. Two strains (S and B) differed genetically in this trait. A factorial experiment {{was performed to}} distinguish whether greater avoidance of occupied hosts by S-strain females {{was caused by a}} stronger chemical deterrent associated with S-strain eggs, a keener response to the presence of eggs by S-strain females, or both. The degree of host discrimination depended on both the source of eggs and the source of test females; the strongest avoidance of egg-laden seeds was exhibited by S-strain females presented with clean seeds as <b>opposed</b> to seeds <b>bearing</b> S-strain eggs, whereas the weakest host discrimination was exhibited by B-strain females presented clean seeds as <b>opposed</b> to seeds <b>bearing</b> B-strain eggs. When presented with only egg-laden seeds, females from both strains added more eggs to seeds bearing B-strain eggs than to seeds bearing S-strain eggs, but the degree of discrimination between the two kinds of egg-laden seeds was stronger among S-strain females. Population differences in host discrimination appear to reflect differential costs associated with multiple larvae/seed; the more discriminating S strain has been associated with a relatively small host and its larvae engage in exceptionally strong interference competition...|$|R

50|$|The moving steam imparts both a {{tangential}} and {{axial thrust}} on the turbine shaft, but the axial thrust {{in a simple}} turbine is unopposed. To maintain the correct rotor position and balancing, this force must be counteracted by an <b>opposing</b> force. Thrust <b>bearings</b> {{can be used for}} the shaft bearings, the rotor can use dummy pistons, it can be double flow- the steam enters {{in the middle of the}} shaft and exits at both ends, or a combination of any of these. In a double flow rotor, the blades in each half face opposite ways, so that the axial forces negate each other but the tangential forces act together. This design of rotor is also called two-flow, double-axial-flow, or double-exhaust. This arrangement is common in low-pressure casings of a compound turbine.|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{programs}} {{with the aim}} to enhance yield productivity under abiotic stress conditions during the reproductive stage of crops is a top priority {{in the era of}} climate change. However, the choice of exploring stay-green or senescence phenotypes, which represent an <b>opposing</b> physiological <b>bearing,</b> are explored in cereal breeding programs for enhanced yield stability to a different extent. Thus, the consideration of stay-green or senescence phenotypes is still an ongoing debate and has not been comprehensively addressed. In this review, we provide arguments for designing a target phenotype needed to encounter mitigate abiotic stresses during pre- and post-anthesis in cereals with a focus on hormonal balances regulating stay-green phenotype versus remobilization. The two major hypothesis for grain yield improvement are (i) the importance of the stay-green trait to elevate grain number under pre-anthesis and anthesis stress and (ii) fine tuning the regulatory and molecular physiological mechanisms to accelerate nutrient remobilization to optimize grain quality and seed weight under post-anthesis stress. We highlight why a cautious balance in the phenotype design is essential. While stay-green phenotypes promise to be ideal for developing stress-tolerant lines during pre-anthesis and fertilization to enhance grain number and yield per se, fine-tuning efficient remobilizing behaviour during seed filling might optimize grain weight, grain quality and nutrient efficiency. The proposed model provides novel and focused directions for cereal stress breeding programs to ensure better seed-set and efficient grain-filling in cereals under terminal drought and heat stress exposure...|$|R
40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings (AMB) {{are very}} often {{presented as a}} progressive alternative of bearing for High Speed Cutting (HSC) applications. However, AMBs have also several significant disadvantages. One of the most crucial is very high complexity, which results in relatively high probability of failures. Properties of the AMBs are completely dependent {{on the quality of}} the control system. To improve properties of the overall system a multi level control system for HSC spindle with AMBs was proposed. The top level of such system (supervision level) performs several tasks, which allow us to eliminate negative properties of AMBs. This paper deals with modeling both rigid and elastic structures in active magnetic bearings as a part of the supervision system. Simple lumped mass, rigid beam, rigid rotor, elastic beam and elastic rotor models are presented. Simulation models in MATLAB were developed to be a part of above mentioned supervision system. Models were partly experimentally verified on two test rigs: (1) rigid rotor with one axial and two radial active magnetic bearings, and (2) elastic beam supported on one side by rolling element bearing and by the active magnetic <b>bearing</b> (<b>opposed</b> electromagnets). ...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives. Among B-cell malignancies, {{follicular}} lymphomas (FL) {{more frequently}} show acquired, potential N-glycosylation sites (AGS) within tumor-specific immunoglobulin. The {{aim of this}} study was to extend this observation and to evaluate the pattern of presentation of AGS within five different forms of B-cell lymphoma. Design and Methods. We sequenced the tumor-specific immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region fragment, including complementarity-determining regions 2 and 3, of forty-seven consecutive patients with a B-cell malignancy enrolled in idiotype vaccine clinical trials. This sequencing approach is known to allow the identification of most AGS. We then statistically analyzed differences in presentation pattern, in terms of tumor histology, immunoglobulin isotype, AGS location and amino acid composition. Results. All twenty-four FL cases presented with at least one AGS, whereas the vast majority of four B-cell lymphoma types other than FL did not. The non- FL group of tumors included four cases of Burkitt’s lymphoma, six of diffuse large cell lymphoma, seven mantle cell lymphomas and six small lymphocytic lymphomas. Most IgM-bearing follicular lymphoma cases featured their AGS within complementarity-determining region 2, as <b>opposed</b> to those <b>bearing</b> an IgG, which mostly displayed the AGS within complementarity- determining region 3. The vast majority of AGS located within either complementarity- determining region ended with a serine residue, whereas those located within framework regions mostly featured threonine as the last amino acid residue. Interpretation and Conclusions. In our series, all cases of FL had AGS within their tumor-specific immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions. In contrast, most B-cell malignancies other than FL did not. Further studies are warranted in order to establish the possible meaning of these findings in terms of disease pathogenesis, their diagnostic value in doubtful cases and their potential implications for immunotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Current {{compression}} perpendicular-to-grain (c-perp) {{design values}} for wood members {{are based on}} mean stress using the ASTM D 143 specimen. Base design value, as determined from 0. 04 -in deformation in the ASTM specimen, is applied to all c-perp applications. While the standard ASTM test was presumably believed to adequately reflect relevant c-perp applications {{at the time it}} was developed (likely railroad cross-ties, wall plates and similar cross-sections), the specimen has limited applicability to many of today's c-perp bearing applications. Previous work has shown that wood-on-wood c-perp bearing is a more severe case as <b>opposed</b> to metal-on-wood <b>bearing.</b> End bearing conditions have been shown to represent a more severe c-perp loading scenario as opposed to load applied over central area. Research has shown that c-perp behavior of wood members is dependant on angle of applied load to annual ring orientation and that the most severe loading case is usually at an angle between 30 and 60 degrees to direction of applied load. Past studies also suggest that depth of member affects c-perp MOE and that higher aspect ratio may lead to instability of the member. As the c-perp behavior observed in the ASTM testing procedure is that of continually increasing stress with increasing deflection and densification, c-perp is generally believed to be serviceability rather than a life safety issue. However, in engineered wood applications, c-perp bearing may occur at areas where structural cohesiveness of a member is necessary to transmit forces through fasteners, such as truss plates. In such scenarios, c-perp has the potential to be a life safety issue. A study was designed to evaluate c-perp behavior of typical as-constructed assemblies in which members experience c-perp stresses near their longitudinal end through wood-on-wood contact. The study included both finite element analysis and experimental testing. Two as-constructed assemblies were evaluated in the study. These included assembly of the bottom chord of a truss bearing on the top plate of a wall (BC assembly) and assembly of the compression chord of a shear wall bearing on the bottom plate (BP assembly) of a wall. Finite element analysis modeled wood material as a composite with alternating earlywood and latewood layers with infinite radius of curvature. BC, BP and ASTM configurations were modeled both with load applied perpendicular and parallel to annual rings. Three BC assemblies were tested. These included BC- 2 X 4, BC- 2 X 8, and BC- 2 X 12, which had nominal 2 X 4, 2 X 8, and 2 X 12 members as bottom chord members, respectively. Therefore, within BC test assemblies aspect ratio of the bottom chord members varied greatly. The three BC geometries were each tested with both Douglas-fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir top plate material. BP configuration was also tested with both Douglas-fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir bottom plate material. For each test assembly, paired ASTM tests of the main member (bottom chord member in BC tests, and bottom plate member in BP tests) were conducted. Results were analyzed utilizing a variety of statistical methods. Finite element analysis revealed that strain was more uniform throughout depth of the bottom chord member when loaded perpendicular to annual rings than when loaded parallel to annual rings. In BC tests majority of deflection was found to occur in the bottom chord member. In BP test, the majority of deflection was found to occur within the bottom plate with only minimal deflection occurring in the longitudinally loaded compression chord. Due to varying assembly depths, 0. 04 -in, deflection was found to be a poor criterion for determining c-perp stress values. In order to account for assembly depth, stress values were based on system strain. As 0. 04 -in, deflection corresponds to two percent strain in the 2 -in, deep ASTM specimen, it was determined that stress determination be based on 2 -percent system strain. Due to large settlement effects observed in the tested wood-onwood assemblies, an offset strain was adopted as the method for determining and comparing stress values across differing assemblies and configurations tested. Within BC tests, the species of top plate material was not found to significantly affect assembly performance. This was due to the overwhelming influence of bottom chord behavior on system behavior. Within BP tests there was suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a significant difference between Douglas-fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir tests. It was recommended that further BP tests be conducted with larger sample sizes in order to determine the influence of wood species on c-perp behavior of bottom plate members. Mean stress values of BC and BP assembly tests were found to be significantly lower than that of corresponding ASTM tests of the main member. This finding lends justification to the Canadian 2 / 3 reduction factor for these scenarios as well as to the design procedures suggested by German researchers. It was determined that the ASTM c-perp test does not adequately represent these bearing scenarios. Adjustment factors are recommended for wood-on-wood bearing and opposite side end bearing. Aspect ratio was found to affect c-perp failure mode and led to high potential for sudden and catastrophic failure of members. Fifteen percent of 2 X 12 members tested failed prior to NDS design stresses due to premature failure of the nominal 2 X 12 bottom chord member. It was estimated that the odds of a 2 X 1 2 failing catastrophically are at least 16 times that of a 2 X 8 failing catastrophically. It was determined that as aspect ratio increases c-perp becomes a life safety as well as a serviceability issue and an adjustment factor for aspect ratio is recommended...|$|R
