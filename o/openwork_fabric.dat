60|$|Wisbech came to {{the brink}} of a gorge which rent the steep hillside. He could not tell how deep it was, but it made him dizzy to look down upon the streak of {{frothing}} water far below. The gorge was spanned by the usual Western trestle bridge, an <b>openwork</b> <b>fabric</b> of timber just wide enough to carry the single track rising out of the chasm on tapering piers that looked ethereally fragile in that wilderness of towering trees and tremendous slopes of rock. The chunk of axes and ringing of hammers jarred through the roar of the stream, and he could see men clinging in mid-air to little stages slung about the piers, and moving among the pines below. A man in a ragged duck suit strode by him with an axe on his shoulder, and Wisbech half-diffidently ventured to inquire if he could tell where Derrick Nasmyth could be found. The man, who paid no attention to him, stopped close by, and shouted to some of his comrades below.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we applied, in a {{complementary}} way, techniques of {{digital image processing}} and reflectance spectroscopy to perform cover factor (CF) measurements in monochrome <b>openwork</b> <b>fabrics.</b> To evaluate the results provided by both techniques, we used the average CF obtained {{by a group of}} 18 expert observers as a reference. IMAGE PROCESSING PART: We developed a new, automatic and objective method for measuring both total and partial CF, and the width of the threads, from the digital image of the fabric. Two algorithms were developed for total and partial CF determinations. The image processing technique used to measure the total CF was the segmentation of the holes from the fabric threads. Conventional methods of segmentation did not lead to similar results than those of the total visual CF. Therefore, we designed a new algorithm (MSSQ) to measure the total CF of fabrics, independently of their degree of coverage. All the CF obtained in 81 typified textile samples were correlated with the CF obtained visually. The best fit to the Stevens' psychophysical law was achieved with the method MSSQ. These results were also consistent with the construction parameters of fabrics. The determination of partial CF in the warp and weft directions was performed by filtering in the Fourier space the warp and weft threads of the sample. For the design of these filters we applied the Radon transform to the power spectrum of the image of the fabric, {{in order to determine the}} direction of the warp and weft harmonics. The values of partial CF were consistent with the parameters that characterize the threads and were logical, expected and confirmed the robustness of the method. The values of the diameters of the threads were also consistent with the parameters of the yarn manufacturing and with the manual measurement performed on the image of the same fabric. This method is easily implementable in a laboratory of textile analysis. REFLECTANCE PART: We modelled the reflectance of a flat layer of fabric arranged on a support of known reflectance using the Kubelka-Munk theory. For this purpose we assumed that the optical behaviour of a layer of fabric could be determined by the superposition of two ideal elements: a neutral density filter with no thickness and with different values of transmittance depending on both the direction of the beam (input or output) and whether the beam passes through the covered part of the yarns or through the holes, plus a uniform and homogeneous layer of a material that meets the assumptions of the theory of Kubelka-Munk. The final model contained CF as a parameter. For a set of different samples of fabrics, the integrated spectral reflectance of a stack of increasing number of layers was experimentally measured with a spectroradiometer, up to stabilize the measure. The experimental reflectances were introduced in the generalized model to calculate the values of the parameters involved, particularly the CF. We solved the resulting system of 101 ¿ (m - 1) equations using the least squares method, where m is the total number of stacked layers of fabric, with 103 unknowns. This yielded a couple of estimates of CF. We established correlations between the measured CF (obtained as the solution of these equations) and the visual CF and analyzed the effect of perturbations in the reflectance measurements to explain the discrepancies between these two estimates of CF. Even if we observed problems of precision in one of the estimates and inaccuracy in the other, arising from an unknown parameter in the model, the intervention of the CF in the described model has been proven.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Mainly used for decorative purpose in the textile industry, lace {{is a type of}} lightweight, <b>openwork</b> <b>fabric.</b> The process of lace manufacturing is complex but much of it has been highly automated with the advancement of modern technology. One exception is the lace cutting operation which is used to cut the wide lace webs (as wide as 3. 8 m) knitted from automatic knitting machines into individual lace breadths. Currently, lace cutting IS carried out by skilled operators or a low speed mechanical cutting system, leading to high cost and increased product lead times. Therefore the lace cutting operation has become a bottleneck of the whole process oflace manufacturing and its automation is highly desired. Based on the combination of machine vision and laser cutting technology, two automatic lace cutting systems have been developed in Loughborough University, which have fully demonstrated the feasibility of replacing the slow and expensive traditional lace cutting methods. However, the edge quality of the lace cut by these systems is not satisfactory enough to meet the requirements of demanding lace markets. In this thesis, based on the investigation of the effect of handling tension on lace cutting edge quality and the microstructure of lace, a strategic lace cutting solution has been presented. The cutting strategy is aimed at tensioning and exposing the loop thread by strategically tensioning and cutting individual threads. The loop thread is considered critical to cutting lace with a high quality finish. To automatically implement the cutting strategy, a machine vision system has been developed. An automatic lace transport and tensioning rig has been designed and manufactured. The long term aim of this rig {{is to be able to}} transport and tension lace continuously for lace cutting and apply localised tension on individual threads with the vision system providing feedback for tension control. The work in this thesis has been limited to manual adjustment of the rig to prove the initial ideas for this concept. An integrated vision guided, pulsed laser cutting system for lace cutting has been developed, based on which two types of representative lace have been cut. According to the assessment results of using a combination of user trials, microscopic and newly developed measurement techniques, the lace cut by this newly developed system has shown significant improvement in cutting edge quality, when compared to the lace cut by the previous laser cutting systems...|$|E
