The firm’s library of manufacturing modules represents its current store of technical knowledge. It is simultaneously the foundation for future innovation and the set of constraints that limits the reach of innovative efforts. When the firm moves far from its existing knowledge base, it incurs increasing development costs that hamper its success. The firm is anchored to its history by these increasing costs that guide its long-run path of technology development. Investment in a new module represents a real option on reusing the module in future technology and on developing a “neighboring” module at lower cost...|$|E

The activities of undergraduate entrepreneurs were also investigated by using the general SWOT analysis method. The key factors for these high-tech start-ups were derived, including decision-making efficiency of the entrepreneurial team, the rationality and efficiency of space-time opportunities in the market, the construction of entrepreneurial team, the legal provisions for relevant high-tech products, the technical innovation and security, and financial guarantee. Based on the modelling analysis, a recommended roadmap for high-tech start-ups were proposed in accordance with current undergraduate entrepreneurs in Chinese colleges.
