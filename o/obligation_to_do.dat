This duty applies when a landlord ought to have known of a defect, not just when he has been informed of a defect.

5|$|Modern {{historians have}} also re-examined {{the role of}} the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the {{accession}} process. Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed, and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950. He points out that the mergers and cession of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the Instruments of Accession, and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes. Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element of coercion. Copland disagrees, on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign, and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements. He also criticises Mountbatten's role, saying that while he stayed within the letter of the law, he was at least under a moral <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something for the princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place, and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence. Both Copland and Ramusack argue that, in the ultimate analysis, {{one of the reasons why}} the princes consented to the demise of their states was that they felt abandoned by the British, and saw themselves as having little other option. Older historians such as Lumby, in contrast, take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power, and that their demise was inevitable. They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India as a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten, and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes, who jointly achieved in a few months what the Empire had attempted, unsuccessfully, to do for over a century—unite all of India under one rule.|$|E

It was a long, arduous journey and he was sick much of the time, mostly from a cold and a carbuncle. The first part of the itinerary took him across northern America to British Columbia, Canada, until the second half of August. For the second part, he sailed across the Pacific Ocean. His scheduled lecture in Honolulu, Hawaii had to be cancelled due to a cholera epidemic. Twain went on to Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, India, Mauritius, and South Africa. His three months in India became the centerpiece of his 712-page book Following the Equator. In the second half of July 1896, he sailed back to England, completing his circumnavigation of the world begun 14 months before.|$|E
25|$|EU {{legislation}} currently {{states that}} there are total allowable catches for each species, which are sub-divided between European Union member states, the intention {{of which is to}} conserve fish stocks. The individual countries then use this figure as a basis for quota allocation to individual fishermen or fishermens organisations. The quota rules however require that any fish which is caught outside quota allowances or below minimum landing size be discarded and that it is an offence for a fishing vessel to be carrying on board any fish for which it does not have a valid quota or which is outside regulated size limits. This is an example of discarding practice being driven by political considerations. Years after difficult negotiations between stakeholders and member states, the EU updated the Common Fisheries Policy and included in Article 15 the Landing Obligation (Discard ban). Until 2019 the law will be implemented progressively. The Landing Obligation does not allow the fisher to land bycatches, it is the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. All species subject to an regulation like catch quotas or minimum sizes, have to be landed. However, these landings are not feasible for direct human consumption and are therefore expected {{to be used in the}} fishmeal industry. The reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is based on regulation formats in Norway and Iceland.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between commitment and obligation from a logical viewpoint. The principle of commitment implying obligation is proven in a specific logic of action preference which is a generalization of Meyer’s dynamic deontic logic. In the proposed formalism, an agent’s commitment to goals is considered as {{a special kind of}} actions which can change her deontic preference and her <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> some action is based on the preference and the effects of the action. In the logic, it is shown that an agent has the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> any action which is necessary for achieving as many committed goals as possible. The semantics of our logic is based on the possible world models for dynamic logic of actions. Abinary preference relation between possible worlds is associated with the model. Then the preference between actions are determined by comparing that of their consequences. According to the semantics, while the preference will influence the agent’s choice of actions, commitment is a kind of actions that will change the agent’s preference. Thus we can show how obligations arise from commitments via updating of deontic preference. The integrated semantics make it possible to express and reasoning about the mutual relationship among these mental attitudes in a common logic...|$|R

40|$|One way to {{allocate}} tasks to agents is by ascribing them <b>obligations.</b> From <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> be, agents are able to infer what are the forbidden, permitted and obligatory actions they may perform, by using the well-known Meyer’s reduction from <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> be <b>to</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> However, we show through an example that this method is not completely adequate to guide agents’ decisions. We then propose a solution using, instead of obligations, the concept of ‘responsibility’. To formalise responsibility we use a multiagent extension of propositional dynamic logic as framework, and then we define some basic concepts, such as ‘agent ability’, also briefly discussing the problem of uniform strategies and a possible solution. In the last part, we show that our framework {{can be used in}} the specification of normative multiagent systems, by presenting an extensive running example...|$|R

500|$|They {{met with}} Katzenberg {{at a conference}} table in the Team Disney {{building}} at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. Catmull and Smith considered {{it would be difficult}} to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant. Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: [...] "Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I am a tyrant. But I'm usually right." [...] He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: [...] "John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way." [...] He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators—"ask them anything at all"—and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations. Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney. Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused. In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused. Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July. Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues. It had the option (but not the <b>obligation)</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film. Disney could also kill the film at any time with only a small penalty. These early negotiations would become a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.|$|E
