40|$|Abstract. The {{compaction}} of rod concrete mixes is a {{very complex}} process, envisaging a rapid increase of linear pressures, taking into account constant change in physical-mechanical properties of compacted material. Several hundred models of compacting equipment have been manufactured to date in the world; however, {{for a long period of}} time the models and types of rollers have been created and continue to be so, by the trial and error method, without accounting for the theoretical fundamentals of the process of compaction and specific features of mechanics of the force interaction of a <b>operating</b> <b>element</b> (drum, tire) with the material compacted. Contemporary directions of development of pavement equipment necessitate the creation of machines of the multipurpose use; designing the constructions, the working processes in which incorporate new technologies, ensuring the growing production yield and labor productivity; and careful treatment of economical and material resources. To improve the quality, reliability and competitiveness of the pavement equipment, it is important to create universal pavement roller, capable of compacting the different types of surfacing, automatically changing contact pressures, having wide range of regulation of compacting impacts and designed for work at all stages of the process of compaction of rod concrete mixes. Pavement roller with perforated drums meets these requirements. Key words: Rod concrete mix Pavement roller Compaction Perforated <b>operating</b> <b>element...</b>|$|E
40|$|The basic <b>operating</b> <b>element</b> of {{standard}} quantum computation is the qubit, an isolated two-level {{system that can}} be accurately controlled, initialized and measured. However, the majority of proposed physical architectures for quantum computation are built from systems that contain much more complicated Hilbert space structures. Hence, defining a qubit requires the identification of an appropriate controllable two-dimensional sub-system. This prompts the obvious question of how well a qubit, thus defined, is confined to this subspace, and whether we can experimentally quantify the potential leakage into states outside the qubit subspace. We demonstrate how subspace leakage can be characterized using minimal theoretical assumptions by examining the Fourier spectrum of the oscillation experiment...|$|E

The construction of areas of energy concentration as confocal cylindrical caustic surfaces to the internal surface of bubble-type vehicle {{is caused by the}} present aberration of sound-waves, generated in the casing, {{as well as by the}} construction of the proper wave-size vehicle. In addition, the amount of energy concentration areas of working liquid motion can be increased under certain conditions at the expense of additional flat radial caustic surfaces.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{developing}} wet cohesive soils (especially at cold temperatures) sticking and freezing of soil on the operating elements essentially reduces the machines performance. The performance decrease happens due to the reduction in the useful capacity of the scoops and due to incomplete unloading, the growth of frontal resistance at cutting (digging) as a result of wet ground sticking to a working part and also the resistance of the input into the scoop and increase of machine downtime due to the need to clean the operating elements. One of the most effective ways to reduce the adhesion of soils at the temperatures below zero is effecting with thermal and vibrothermal intensifiers. The article presents the analysis of shovels performance and soil frictional resistance inside the scoop. The proportionality coefficient or reduced friction coefficient takes into account the shift peculiarities when determining the soil friction force on metal surface, and its value includes deformation and adhesive components and depends on the same parameters as the shear resistance, namely, the time and the contact pressure, humidity and dispersity of soil, temperature in the shear plane, the surface state of the metal. Experimentally {{with the use of a}} special bench shift values the proportionality factor was determined depending on the temperature in the shear plane without affecting intensifiers, which reduce adhesion, and also at thermoacoustic and thermal impact.
