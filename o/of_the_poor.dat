5|$|The workhouse {{movement}} {{began at}} the end of the 17th century with the establishment of the Bristol Corporation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Poor,</b> founded by Act of Parliament in 1696. The corporation established a workhouse which combined housing and care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> with a house of correction for petty offenders. Following the example of Bristol, some twelve further towns and cities established similar corporations in the next two decades. As these corporations required a private Act, they were not suitable for smaller towns and individual parishes.|$|E

She joined the Dominican convent at Töss where she died a nun on 5May 1338. She is now venerated as Blessed Elizabeth of Töss. Andrew's second wife, Agnes of Austria, was born in 1280.

Then, we split the right-hand side into the components corresponding to the labor income and <b>the</b> non-labor income <b>of</b> <b>the</b> richest quintile. After that, we divide the numerator and denominator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first term (the per capita labor income <b>of</b> <b>the</b> richest quintile over the per capita total income <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> quintile) by <b>the</b> per capita labor income <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> quintile.

5|$|As the 19th century wore on, workhouses {{increasingly}} became refuges for the elderly, infirm {{and sick}} {{rather than the}} able-bodied poor, and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals. Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930, many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions {{under the control of}} local authorities.
