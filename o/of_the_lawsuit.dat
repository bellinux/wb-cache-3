5|$|The {{theme of}} a young lawyer being fed up with a giant law firm and bolting away to a less lucrative but more {{satisfying}} career is shared with The Associate. The theme of a lawsuit against a giant corporation appeared in The Runaway Jury, but in the present book, the corporation is vindicated and proven to have been unjustly maligned (at least on the specific drug which is the subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawsuit)</b> and the mass tort lawyers are seen as greedy and unscrupulous, ultimately bolting and leaving the protagonist's tiny Chicago firm in the lurch.|$|E
5|$|At {{various times}} during his law career, Flournoy was {{appointed}} special master, arbitrator, or commissioner for several high-profile court cases. In 1932, Flournoy was appointed special master {{in a suit}} involving the estate of MercyJ. Keller, the widow of Benjamin Franklin Keller, a judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. Flournoy authored a report allowing for the distribution of funds to Keller's heirs and beneficiaries from Charleston National Bank. In December 1932, Flournoy provided mediation for several business and home owners who sued the city of Charleston over the widening of Virginia Street between Summers and Capitol Streets.

5|$|Because {{the names}} of the eight players had been kept secret, the general public was not {{informed}} that Bruce Smith, who had developed into one of the best defensive players in the country, {{would not be able to}} participate in the 1984 Independence Bowl.

5|$|Also {{contained}} in Hemming's {{work is a}} description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawsuit</b> between the diocese of Worcester and Evesham Abbey, which took place between 1078 and 1085. Although only Hemming relates {{the course of the}} proceedings, the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, or Evesham Chronicle, also gives background information on the dispute. The litigation involved lands that the abbey held in Hampton and Bengeworth in Worcestershire, but that the diocese maintained were actually part of one of the bishopric's manors. Ownership became disputed under the abbacy of Æthelwig, when the abbot managed to acquire the allegiance of a number of the new owners of lands previously held from the diocese. After Æthelwig's death, most of these lands passed to Odo of Bayeux, but Evesham managed to retain Hampton and Bengeworth, which became the basis of the dispute. The lawsuit was complicated because part of the land had been granted by an earlier bishop, Beorhtheah, to a kinsman, Azur. After the Conquest, Azur's lands were given to Urse d'Abetot, the Sheriff of Worcester. Following Æthelwig's death, Wulfstan was able to secure a settlement with Æthelwig's successor Walter. The settlement, which was concluded in 1086, granted the lands to the abbey, but the diocese was the overlord of the lands, for which the abbey owed military service.|$|E
5|$|Urse {{was also}} {{involved}} in a dispute between Wulfstan and Evesham Abbey over lands in Worcestershire as, after the Conquest, Urse acquired the lands of Azur, a kinsman of an earlier Bishop of Worcester, Beorhtheah. Azur had originally leased the lands from the diocese, but after Urse confiscated the lands, the sheriff did not return the lands to the bishop, and instead kept them for himself. The Worcester monk Hemming recorded {{the loss of the}} lands to Urse in Hemming's Cartulary, a cartulary written about 1095 recording lands and charters belonging to the diocese of Worcester. Hemmings' Cartulary mentions not just Azur's lands, but others at Acton Beauchamp, Clopton, and Redmarley as taken from the diocese of Worcester by Urse. After Abbot Æthelwig's death, Urse also acquired lands that Æthelwig had seized through less than legal means, when William I's half-brother Odo of Bayeux, the Bishop of Bayeux, presided at the lawsuit brought to determine the ownership of the lands. Odo gave a number of the disputed estates to Urse during the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawsuit.</b>|$|E

40|$|Article {{available}} from www. scielo. br/rsp Legal suits: pharmaceutical industry strategies to introduce new {{drugs in the}} Brazilian public healthcare system OBJECTIVE: To assess <b>the</b> distribution rate <b>of</b> legal suits according to drug (manufacturer), prescribing physician, and attorney fi ling <b>the</b> <b>lawsuit.</b> METHODS: A descriptive study was carried out to assess <b>the</b> <b>lawsuits</b> in <b>the</b> São Paulo State (Southeastern Brazil) courts registry in 2006, and amounts spent in complying with these lawsuits, and total costs with medication thus resulting. RESULTS: In 2006, the São Paulo State Administration spent 65 million Brazilian reais in compliance with court decisions to provide medication to approximately 3, 600 individuals. <b>The</b> total cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medication was 1. 2 billion Brazilian reais. In the period studied, 2, 927 lawsuits were examined. These lawsuits were fi led by 565 legal professionals, among which 549 were attorneys engaged by private individuals (97. 17 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total legal professionals). <b>The</b> drugs scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawsuits</b> had been prescribed by 878 different physicians.
