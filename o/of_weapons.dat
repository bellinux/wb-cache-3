5|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{response}} to the demand for the surrender <b>of</b> <b>weapons,</b> the deadline was extended several times until a date of 8 July was fixed. On 17 May, court-martials were established to try those that were arrested in possession <b>of</b> <b>weapons,</b> and those found guilty were immediately executed by firing squad. The precedent for this brutal repressive measure against Serbs had already been established by the Germans. It {{was clear from the}} outset that the NDH weapons laws were not being enforced as strictly against Croats as they were against Serbs. Securing the border between eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro was considered a high priority due to concerns that the Montenegrin Federalist Party had revived Montenegrin claims to parts of the NDH that had been promised to the Kingdom of Montenegro in the 1915 Treaty of London.|$|E
5|$|Following the Dunkirk {{evacuation}} in 1940, Britain faced {{a shortage}} <b>of</b> <b>weapons.</b> In particular, {{there was a}} severe scarcity of anti-tank weapons, many of {{which had to be}} left behind in France.

5|$|In {{the modern}} world, dance {{has come to}} be {{regarded}} as something one does for recreation, thus distancing dance from the important place it has held in many human cultures throughout history—that is, a method of expression, preservation and transmission of the culture and history of a people. Many of the activities that humans have engaged in for millennia (religion and courtship, for example) have traditionally found expression in various kinds of dance. Another activity—combat—has obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, one expects to find dances that celebrate skill in the use <b>of</b> <b>weapons.</b> Indeed, there is a wide range of such weapon dances in the world; they vary from general displays of prowess in the use <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> to reenactments of real episodes of combat specific to a given culture.|$|E
5|$|Interesting, perhaps, {{in the use}} <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> {{in these}} recent “revolutionary” works is that they are, {{generally}} speaking, not reenactments of traditional folk dances.

5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude a large number <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the bullet, and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly {{to the type of}} barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} empirically, for the first time in France, the prevalence <b>of</b> adolescent <b>weapon</b> carrying with particular focus on the contribution of a broad range of social bonding, strain, social learning, and sociodemographic predictors. A multivariate logistic regression model was conducted using a backward elimination procedure to identify the significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>weapon</b> carrying controlling for age, gender, and SES in a sample of 12, 706 French youth aged 11 – 19 years. Results revealed that the odds <b>of</b> <b>weapon</b> carrying increased among adolescents who suffered from past victimization, who had a negative relationship with their mother, and who repeated a grade at school. Moreover, holding pro-delinquent beliefs and having delinquent peers also increased the odds <b>of</b> <b>weapon</b> carrying. Our findings highlight the importance of the interpersonal and social context when examining the determinants <b>of</b> <b>weapon</b> carrying and showed a unique contribution of components of social bonding, strain, and social learning in weapon carrying among adolescents...|$|R

5|$|The arms {{flow from}} Anatolia ended in June, either {{due to a}} direct French {{diplomatic}} request or the diversion of arms and fighters to combat the Greek offensive against the Turks in western Anatolia. In any case, the stopping <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> shipments {{had a significant impact}} on both the military aspect of the rebellion and morale, as Hananu and the revolt's backers in Aleppo felt abandoned by the Turks, who later concluded a final peace arrangement with France, known as the Treaty of Ankara, in October. In need of funds, Hananu hired local bandits to extort money and supplies from Jabal Zawiya's inhabitants. His main sources <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> became limited to the towns of Maarrat al-Nu'man and Hama. With the previous blows dealt to the rebels by French forces, the waning support for the revolt by the local inhabitants and the lack <b>of</b> <b>weapons,</b> Hananu's revolt largely dissipated during the spring of 1921, although rebel operations against the French still continued at a reduced pace during this period.|$|E

5|$|The mace or club {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} types <b>of</b> <b>weapons.</b> The {{popularity}} of the weapons with Vishnu worshippers may have led to its depiction with the deity.
