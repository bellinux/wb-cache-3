25|$|When {{the main}} {{electron}} gun writes an image to the screen, the {{energy in the}} main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily {{to turn off the}} flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The 7JP4 is {{an early}} black and white or {{monochrome}} cathode ray tube (also called picture tube and kinescope).

5000|$|The {{alternative}} form {{of memory}} {{was known as}} [...] "electrostatic". This was a cathode ray tube memory, similar in many aspects to an early TV picture tube or <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>tube.</b> An electron gun sent a beam of electrons {{to the far end}} of the tube, where they impacted a screen. The beam would be deflected to land at a particular spot on the screen. The beam could then build up a negative charge at that point, or change a charge that was already there. By measuring the beam current it could be determined whether the spot was originally a zero or a one, and a new value could be stored by the beam.|$|E
40|$|Red {{and green}} triangular-wave {{intensity}} distributions were generated on cathoderay <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>tubes.</b> When these patterns are viewed separately, {{light and dark}} Mach bands appear at the peaks and troughs of the intensity distribution. The perceived brightness distribution was quantified by matching {{the brightness of the}} pattern with a narrow slit of light of the same color positioned in varying positions just below the triangular-wave field. The sensations produced by gradients of color rather than luminance have been investigated by interlacing equiluminous red and green triangular gratings 180 [deg] out-of-phase (dark bands in one field correspond to bright bands in other field). An illuminated slit just below the chromatic gradients was adjusted in color and brightness to produce satisfactory matches to different parts of the interlaced red and green patterns. Our measurements show that bright red and green bands appear in light distributions of constant luminance and varying chromaticity...|$|R
50|$|Active scope probes use a {{high-impedance}} high-frequency amplifier {{mounted in}} the probe head, and a screened lead. The purpose of the amplifier is not gain, but isolation (buffering) between the circuit under test and the oscilloscope and cable, loading the circuit with only a low capacitance and high DC resistance, and matching the oscilloscope input. Active probes are commonly seen by the circuit under test as a capacitance of 1 picofarad or less in parallel with 1 megohm resistance.

40|$|A new optical {{oscilloscope}} {{has been}} developed {{on the basis of}} the image-converter tube camera technology. Optical or electrical pulses in single or repetitive mode can be tested. When single pulse without time dependence on the sweep circuit is tested, an optical-fiber delay unit is adopted to ensure the pulse is captured.

A newly designed photocathode optical <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>tube,</b> control circuits, and a linear charge-coupled device readout system have been incorporated into the optical oscilloscope.

40|$|Summary. -A novel {{method for}} {{estimating}} constancy is described, which {{is applied to}} the estimation of size constancy during motion of observers moved passively on a swing in darkness. Ss viewed a circle traced on an <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>tube</b> and arranged to shrink as S approached it and to expand as he moved away. The variation in size of the display was adjusted by E until it appeared of constant size to S during his movement. Constancy was greater during forward than backward movement. This experiment was undertaken in an attempt to discover whether visual size constancy during movement of an observer is the same whether he is moving forward or backward. The problem, as well as the technique we have developed to try to answer it, arose from the observation that after-images viewed in complete darkness may change their size or shape with movements of the observer, much as they change when projected on a visible screen, according to Emmert's Law (Gregory, Wallace, & Campbell, 1959). The usual method of measuring size constancy-by comparing one shap...|$|E

Every transducer (made of 70  kHz frequency piezoelectric ceramic) can act both as transmitter (T) and as receiver (R) when connected to a generator or oscilloscope.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University N. B. : page viii {{is missing}} from the {{original}} thesis. An airborne telephotometric device (haze recorder) is now being constructed at the Boston University Physical Research Laboratory to collect the data necessary {{for a study of}} atmospheric haze. It is expected that this present study will indicate the existence of correlations between haze light intensity and parameters significant in aerial photography. The purpose of this thesis is the provide an operational plan including data reduction and preliminary analysis for the first exploratory test flights. 	The haze recorder is being constructed to measure up-welling light intensity in a narrow path from horizon through nadir to horizon. The plane of this sweep rotates in 450 intervals relative to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, and a filter wheel synchronized with the sweep from horizon to horizon passes light alternately through blue, green, and red filters. Thus a three-dimensional plot of up-welling light is formed for each of three spectral ranges. A photomultiplier tube transforms this intensity into an electrical signal which, after amplification, is displayed on an <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>tube</b> and photographed. 	[TRUNCATED...|$|E

50|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the history and}} development of oscilloscope technology. The modern day digital oscilloscope grew out of multiple developments of analog oscilloscopes, which in turn {{grew out of the}} older oscillograph. The oscillograph started as a hand drawn chart which was later slightly automated. This then grew into galvanometer driven recorders and photographic recorders. Eventually, the cathode ray tube came along and displaced the oscillograph, eventually taking over the majority of the market when advancements such as triggers were added to them. With the lowering costs of digital circuitry, the digital oscilloscope has taken over the majority of the modern oscilloscope sales, with almost no makers offering analog cathode ray <b>tube</b> <b>oscilloscopes.</b> However, the oscillograph lives on to a degree in pen chart recorders for electrical signals.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} use for this {{technique}} is controlling {{the path of a}} stream of electrons in a vacuum. One application is in small cathode ray <b>tubes</b> for <b>oscilloscopes.</b> In these <b>tubes</b> the electric field is created by two sets of paired electrodes, mounted at right angles, that the electron stream flows between. This arrangement allows independent deflection of the beam in two dimensions (usually perceived as up/down (vertical) and right/left (horizontal)). The electrodes are commonly called deflection plates. Traditionally, the electrons pass through the vertical deflection plates first, yielding slightly higher sensitivity because of the longer travel time from the vertical deflection plates to the phosphor screen as compared to the horizontal deflection plates. In very high speed oscilloscopes, the deflection plates were often complex structures, combining a series of sub-plates with an electrical delay line. By matching the propagation speed of the electrical signal with the transit speed of the electrons, maximum bandwidth (frequency response) was achieved.|$|R

To make the problem clearer, the present author utilized a special fluid electrode after Sugi (so-called Sugi 2 ̆ 7 s insulating vessel). The muscle was connected to a load which could be suddenly released to stretch the muscle with a special equipment. The potential difference across the separating wall was led through the electrodes placed in compartments to an amplifier and Braun <b>tube</b> <b>oscilloscope.</b> 1) The muscle showed negative potential of a few millivolt {{at the time of}} sudden stretch (Fig. 3). 2) The size of this potential was proportional to the degree of stretching not to the tension (Fig. 4). 3) The negative potential developed at the initial phase of stretching decreased gradually in the course of time, while the length of muscle still continued to increase. The mechanisms underlying the phenomena are not identical in the initial and delayed phases. 4) Action potential of the stretched muscle was smaller than that of the control muscle. 5) The stretching potential increased {{at the side of the}} muscle applied with anodic current, decreased at the side of cathodic current. 6) Influences of various salts, ions and their concentrations on the stretching potential were investigated with the result that the size of the potential were arranged in order K > Rb > NH_ 4; Na > Li; though partially an accordance with Hofmeister 2 ̆ 7 s series, and that the potentialities of monovalent cations were superior to that of bivalent cations. 7) From the observations that these factor 2 ̆ 7 s interfere with the stretching potential, some speculative insight into the mechanism of the stretching potential was indicated.
