5|$|Dirks' work in {{computational}} chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational {{tools for}} the analysis of nucleic acid thermodynamics and nucleic acid structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statistical</b> partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{confluence}} of these problems, the Census was completed and tabulated several months behind schedule to much popular criticism, and led indirectly to a deterioration in Walker's health {{during the spring of}} 1871. Walker took leave to travel to England with Bowles that summer to recuperate and upon return that fall, despite an offer from The New York Times to join their editorial board with an annual salary of $8,000 ($ in 2016), accepted Secretary Columbus Delano's offer to become the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs in November 1871. The appointment was simultaneously a go-around to continue to fund Walker's federal responsibilities as Census superintendent despite Congress' cessation of appropriations for the position as well as a political opportunity to replace a scandal-ridden predecessor. Walker continued to work on the Census for several years thereafter, culminating in the publication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Statistical</b> Atlas of the United States that was unprecedented in its use of visual statistics and maps to report the results of the Census. The Atlas won him praise from both the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as well as a First Class medal from the International Geographical Congress.|$|E

25|$|As for {{the lower}} middle class, other less prestigious occupations, many sales positions, {{entry-level}} management, secretaries, etc., would be included. In addition to professionals whose work is largely self-directed and includes managerial duties, many other less privileged members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statistical</b> middle class would find themselves in semi-independent to independent white collar positions. Many {{of those in the}} statistical middle class might work in what are called the professional support fields. These fields include occupations such as dental hygienists, and other professional and sales support.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{also argued}} that Rind et al.'s {{statistical}} approach for controlling for family environment {{as a cause of}} maladjustment was conceptually and methodologically invalid. Spiegel stated that inferring the source of maladjustment from analyzing the shared variance between CSA and family environment does not answer the question of which variable explains maladjustment better; the authors answered that this statement shows a misunderstanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statistical</b> procedure used their meta-analysis. Dallam, however, addressed the topic of several prior studies having found statistically significant relations between CSA and maladjustment even after controlling for family environment.|$|E
25|$|Markov {{chains are}} used {{throughout}} information processing. Claude Shannon's famous 1948 paper A Mathematical Theory of Communication, {{which in a}} single step created the field of information theory, opens by introducing the concept of entropy through Markov modeling of the English language. Such idealized models can capture many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statistical</b> regularities of systems. Even without describing the full structure of the system perfectly, such signal models can make possible very effective data compression through entropy encoding techniques such as arithmetic coding. They also allow effective state estimation and pattern recognition. Markov chains also {{play an important role}} in reinforcement learning.|$|E

25|$|In {{statistical}} mechanics, for {{a closed}} system (no transfer of matter), heat is the energy transfer {{associated with a}} disordered, microscopic action on the system, associated with jumps in occupation numbers of the energy levels of the system, without change in {{the values of the}} energy levels themselves. It is possible for macroscopic thermodynamic work to alter the occupation numbers without change in the values of the system energy levels themselves, but what distinguishes transfer as heat is that the transfer is entirely due to disordered, microscopic action, including radiative transfer. A mathematical definition can be formulated for small increments of quasi-static adiabatic work in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statistical</b> distribution of an ensemble of microstates.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another reason}} is the {{economic}} clout generated by this class. In 2005 according to U.S.Census statistics, the top third of society, excluding the top 5%, controlled the largest share of income in the United States. Although some in the statistical middle class (for example, police officers and fire fighters in the more affluent suburbs in the San Francisco Bay Area) may have lifestyles as comfortable as those found among {{the ranks of the}} professional middle class, only few have the same degree of autonomy and influence over society as those in the professional middle class. Other white-collar members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>statistical</b> middle class may not only be unable to afford the middle-class lifestyle but also lack the influence found in the professional middle class.|$|E
25|$|In the Crimean War against Russia, Nightingale was {{appointed}} to oversee the introduction of female nurses into the military hospitals in Turkey, after criticisms in the British press. In November 1854, Nightingale arrived at the barrack hospital near Constantinople, with a party of 38 nurses. Initially the doctors {{did not want the}} nurses there and did not ask for their help, but within ten days fresh casualties arrived from the Battle of Inkermann and the nurses were fully stretched. When Nightingale returned from the Crimean War in August 1856, she hid herself away from the public's attention. For her contribution to Army statistics and comparative hospital statistics in 1860, Nightingale became the first woman to be elected a Fellow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Statistical</b> Society.|$|E
