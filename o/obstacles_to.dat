5|$|In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a {{more solid}} operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep {{a place in the}} {{international}} repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892.|$|E
5|$|In late 1943, Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{in charge}} of {{improving}} the coastal defences along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion, expected to take place sometime in 1944. Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In the immediate area of Gold, between Le Hamel and La Rivière, seven defensive strongpoints designed to hold 50 men apiece were constructed. Two major concrete-reinforced coastal artillery emplacements (a battery of four 122mm guns at Mont Fleury and the Longues-sur-Mer battery, with four 150mm guns) were only partially completed by D-Day. Rommel ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> {{be placed on the}} beach to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> be placed at the high tide mark. Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} {{parallelism}} is transparent to the programmer, {{such as in}} bit-level or instruction-level parallelism, but explicitly parallel algorithms, particularly those that use concurrency, {{are more difficult to}} write than sequential ones, because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race conditions are the most common. Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> getting good parallel program performance.|$|E

5|$|Rommel {{believed}} that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, he ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> {{be placed on the}} beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> be placed at the high water mark. Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry. On Rommel's order, the number of mines along the coast was tripled. The Allied air offensive over Germany had crippled the Luftwaffe and established air supremacy over western Europe, so Rommel knew he could not expect effective air support. The Luftwaffe could muster only 815 aircraft over Normandy in comparison to the Allies' 9,543. Rommel arranged for booby-trapped stakes known as Rommelspargel (Rommel's asparagus) to be installed in meadows and fields to deter airborne landings.|$|E

Given the Allied air supremacy (4,029 Allied aircraft assigned to operations in Normandy plus 5,514 aircraft assigned to bombing and defence, versus 570 Luftwaffe planes stationed in France and the Low Countries), booby-trapped stakes known as Rommelspargel (Rommel's asparagus) were set up in meadows and fields to deter airborne landings.|$|E

5|$|When {{referring}} to cannon, the term gun {{is often used}} incorrectly. In military usage, a gun is a cannon with a high muzzle velocity and a flat trajectory, useful for hitting the sides of targets such as walls, as opposed to howitzers or mortars, which have lower muzzle velocities, and fire indirectly, lobbing shells up and over <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> hit the target from above.|$|E
5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said that African American art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> other forms of documentation. She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members of a culture that has experienced extensive negativity. In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects of the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} undeciphered scripts, {{there are many}} fanciful interpretations and claimed {{translations}} of rongorongo. However, apart from a portion of one tablet which {{has been shown to}} have to do with a lunar Rapa Nui calendar, none of the texts are understood. There are three serious <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> decipherment, assuming rongorongo is truly writing: the small number of remaining texts, the lack of context such as illustrations in which to interpret them, and the poor attestation of the Old Rapanui language, since modern Rapanui is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is therefore unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets.|$|E

5|$|Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, overall {{commander}} on the Western Front, {{reported to}} Hitler in October 1943 regarding the weak defences in France. This {{led to the}} appointment of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel to oversee the construction of enhanced fortifications along the Atlantic Wall, with special emphasis on the most likely invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg. Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, he ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> {{be placed on the}} beach to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> be placed at the high-tide mark. The terrain at Utah is flat, offering no high ground on which to place fortifications. The shallow beach varies in depth from almost nothing to , depending on the tides.

Moreover, during his tenure in Dalian, Bo caused resentment for the amount of 'special favours' that he procured for the coastal city {{at the expense of the}} rest of the province.

Mega Man's primary weapon is an arm cannon that has unlimited ammunition. Destroyed enemies typically leave items that replenish Mega Man's health or extra lives. At {{the end of every}} stage is a boss battle with a robot master, and defeating it earns the player its special weapon. Each boss is weak to another's weapon, allowing the player to strategize the order in which they are beaten.|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to England the {{expedition}} was coolly received by London's geographical establishment which was resentful of the pre-emption {{of a role}} they envisaged for their own National Antarctic (Discovery) Expedition. There were also questions about Borchgrevink's leadership qualities, and criticism of the limited amounts of scientific information which the expedition provided. Despite the groundbreaking achievements in Antarctic survival and travel, Borchgrevink was never accorded the heroic status of Scott or Shackleton, and his expedition was soon forgotten in the dramas which surrounded these and other Heroic Age explorers. However, Roald Amundsen, conqueror of the South Pole in 1911, acknowledged that Borchgrevink's expedition had removed the greatest <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> Antarctic travel, and had {{opened the way for}} all the expeditions that followed.|$|E
