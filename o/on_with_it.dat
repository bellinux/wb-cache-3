Illinois served with the North Atlantic Squadron and the European Squadron early in her career, while Wisconsin served as the flagship of the Pacific Fleet and then in the Asiatic Fleet. Illinois and Alabama started the cruise of the Great White Fleet in December 1907 from the east coast of the United States, though by the time they had rounded South America and stopped in California, Alabama was forced to leave the fleet due to machinery problems. Wisconsin joined the fleet there and continued <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> to the conclusion of its tour in February 1909. All three ships were modernized in 1909 and served in the Atlantic Fleet for a short time.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|However, {{she became}} {{dissatisfied}} with Cochrane, who was openly committing adultery and constantly insulting Gardnerians, even {{at one point}} calling for [...] "a Night of the Long Knives of the Gardnerians", at which point Valiente openly criticised him and then left his Clan. In her own words, she [...] "rose up and challenged him {{in the presence of}} the rest of the coven. I told him that I was fed up with listening to all this senseless malice, and that, if a 'Night of the Long Knives' was what his sick little soul craved, he could get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> but he could get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> alone, because I had better things to do". Shortly after, Cochrane committed ritual suicide on Midsummer 1966; she authored the poem [...] "Elegy for a Dead Witch" [...] in his memory. She remained in contact with his widow and other members of the Clan, as well as with Gray, and proceeded to work on occasion with The Regency, a group founded by former members of the Clan.|$|E

The {{movie is}} about a man named Eddie (Lynch), who is hounded by social services and branded a paedophile after an innocent bathtime game with his children is taken out of context. About two years later and shortly before entering teenagehood, Thompson successfully auditioned to feature in the BBC children's comedy programme Stupid!. Out of around 400 hopeful youngsters, {{he was one of}} only a few to be selected to appear in the show.

Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song [...] "a more analogue sound" [...] than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as [...] "refreshing". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on the album, but was unable due to budget constraints and other artists' unfamiliarity with her work. She chose to perform all the vocals herself, saying, [...] "I just quietly got <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it...</b> I didn't wanna convince anyone it was good.

[...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves."

[...] The BBC Holby City homepage describes Maddy as: [...] "enthusiastic and eager to learn. Being with her is fun. She doesn't moan, she loves her job and gets <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> She just wants to be happy". Comparing the character's personality to her own, [...] Lewington commented: [...] "My good pal, Sir Robert Powell (Mark Williams) has said that a character is often only yourself turned 3 degrees. I think this to be true of Maddy and I. There are similarities. Although she's smarter than me, she does the daftest things! She's says things I wouldn't. But when she cries, I cry and when she smiles, I smile".|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{was drafted}} by the Baltimore Orioles {{in the second round}} of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was {{selected}} with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, [...] "When the colleges started coming around, Dad and I talked about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> and if it didn't work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26." [...] Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again.|$|E

Donner {{compared}} the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, [...] "First Class is similar to Batman Begins, {{where you have the}} fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, [...] "I {{thought it would be fun}} to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about [...] "changing history" [...] in an interview with Empire magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past [...] "erasing" [...] the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.|$|E
500|$|The {{arrival of}} Chrissie Watts was {{announced}} barely {{a month before}} she was set to first appear on-screen, and {{came at a time}} when EastEnders was undergoing immense media criticism and falling ratings. The rush of casting meant Oberman had little time to process the enormity of the part she had taken on, declaring: [...] "my feet haven't even touched the ground yet. [...] I haven't had time to think about what this role is going to do to my life! I'm very excited to be part of such a fantastic show and one I have been a fan of for many years." [...] She admitted, however, to being [...] "slightly intimidated" [...] by the high media profile and press interest surrounding the show at the time. Indeed, joining EastEnders [...] "proved to be something of a baptism of fire for Oberman", as she was playing opposite Leslie Grantham whose recent return to the show had been a highly publicised event. Twenty-four hours after Chrissie's first episode went to air a scandal surrounding Grantham hit the tabloid papers. According to Oberman, the atmosphere on set the next day [...] "was a bit tense" [...] but, she added, [...] "the Watts are pulling together and we're getting <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and working". However Oberman was also reportedly finding things difficult, having walked into a highly complicated situation: [...] "Tracy-Ann is still really finding her feet on the show... she feels really left out because all the cast are blackballing Grantham and refusing to talk to him. Since most of her scenes are with Grantham, it's really hard for her." [...] Looking back on the incident after she had left EastEnders, Oberman remarked, [...] "I respect Leslie for fronting it out; he emerged from his dressing room and started working. No one mentioned the story. That's life in EastEnders; the machine never stops." ...|$|E
