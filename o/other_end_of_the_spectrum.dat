5|$|Many {{tropical}} cyclones develop {{when the}} atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance {{in the atmosphere}} are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye. On the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses. A tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E

25|$|On the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> {{there is}} the green-light {{approach}} derived from the utilitarian school of thought associated with legal philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. The green-light approach regards state involvement as an effective means to facilitate the delivery of communitarian goals. Hence, ouster clauses are regarded as useful devices to keep a conservatively inclined judiciary at bay. One such communitarian goal achieved by ouster clauses is that it results in consistency and finality {{in the implementation of}} policy considerations by encouraging specialist bodies to act as adjudicators in certain areas of administration.|$|E
25|$|Most ornithischians were herbivorous. In fact, most of {{the unifying}} {{characters}} of Ornithischia {{are thought to be}} related to this herbivory. For example, the shift to an opisthopubic pelvis is thought {{to be related to the}} development of a large stomach or stomachs and gut which would allow ornithischians to digest plant matter better. The smallest known Ornithischians are Fruitadens haagarorum. The largest Fruitadens individuals reached just 65–75cm. Previously, only carnivorous, saurischian theropods were known to reach such small sizes. At the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> the largest known ornithischians reach about 15 meters (smaller than the largest saurischians).|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{masks are}} a dancer’s prized possession. Most dancers {{try to keep}} their mask in new {{condition}} and will take masks in to be cleaned and repainted. In a number of communities, such as the Chontals in Tabasco, masks are generally kept in the local church when not in use. At the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> the masking, wearing and destruction of a mask is part of Holy Week rituals among the Cora, Yaqui and Mayo. The Cora destroy their paper mache masks by immersing them in a local river while the Yaqui and Mayo burn them. In both cases, it {{is an act of}} purification.|$|E
25|$|On the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> {{though the}} port of Tonkin in {{northern}} Vietnam {{played an important role}} in the region's silk trade, the local Trinh authorities actively discouraged the formation of a Nihonmachi there. This is believed to have largely been the result of concerns over the martial nature of the Japanese in the region (many were samurai serving as pirates and mercenaries), and over the shipments of weapons and munitions from Japan to Siam and southern Vietnam. In order to avoid potential violence within their chief port, the Trịnh Lords sought to avoid any significant permanent Japanese presence, though many notable and prominent Japanese merchants did frequently make port there.|$|E

25|$|The late 1950s and 1960s also {{witnessed}} {{a reaction to}} the then still dominant position of Alvar Aalto in Finnish architecture, though some, most significantly Heikki and Kaija Siren (e.g. Otaniemi Chapel, 1956–57), Keijo Petäjä (e.g. Lauttasaari Church, Helsinki, 1958), Viljo Revell (e.g. Toronto City Hall, Canada, 1958–65), Timo Penttilä (e.g. Helsinki City Theatre, 1967), Marjatta and Martti Jaatinen (e.g. Kannelmäki church, 1962–68), and brothers Timo and Tuomo Suomalainen (e.g. Temppeliaukio Church, Helsinki, 1961–69) developed their own interpretation of a non-rationalist modernist architecture. Taking architecture in an even more idiosyncratic organic line than Aalto was Reima Pietilä, while at the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> was a rationalist line epitomized in the works of Aarne Ervi, Aulis Blomstedt, Aarno Ruusuvuori, Kirmo Mikkola, Kristian Gullichsen, Matti K.

25|$|Retailing {{services}} may {{also include the}} provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, exchange/ return services, product demonstration, special orders, customer loyalty programs, limited-scale trial, advisory services {{and a range of}} other supporting services. Retail stores often seek to differentiate along customer service lines. For example, some department stores offer the services of a stylist; a fashion advisor, to assist customers selecting a fashionable wardrobe for the forthcoming season, while smaller boutiques may allow regular customers to take goods home on approval, enabling the customer to try out goods before making the final purchase. The variety of supporting services offered is known as the service type. At one end of the spectrum, self-service operators offer few basic support services. At the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> full-service operators offer a broad range of highly personalised customer services to augment the retail experience.|$|E

25|$|Universities in France {{tended to}} serve a downplayed role in the {{development}} of science during the Enlightenment; that role was dominated by the scientific academies, such as the French Academy of Sciences. The contributions of universities in Britain were mixed. On the one hand, the University of Cambridge began teaching Newtonianism early in the Enlightenment, but failed to become a central force behind the advancement of science. On the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> were Scottish universities, which had strong medical faculties and became centres of scientific development. Under Frederick II, German universities began to promote the sciences. Christian Wolff's unique blend of Cartesian-Leibnizian physics began to be adopted in universities outside of Halle. The University of Göttingen, founded in 1734, was far more liberal than its counterparts, allowing professors to plan their own courses and select their own textbooks. Göttingen also emphasized research and publication. A further influential development in German universities was the abandonment of Latin in favour of the German vernacular.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{is unusual}} in that it has only {{slightly}} modified its coinage system (except for the images and symbols on the coins, which have changed a number of times) to accommodate two centuries of inflation. The one-cent coin has changed little since 1856 (though its composition was changed in 1982 to remove virtually all copper from the coin) and still remains in circulation, despite a greatly reduced purchasing power. On the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> the largest coin in common circulation is valued at 25 cents, a very low value for the largest denomination coin compared to many other countries. Increases in the prices of copper, nickel, and zinc meant that both the US one- and five-cent coins became worth more for their raw metal content than their face (fiat) value. In particular, copper one-cent pieces (those dated prior to 1982 and some 1982-dated coins) contained about two cents' worth of copper.|$|E
25|$|Extended cadential trills were by far most {{frequent}} in Mozart's music, {{and although they}} were also found in early Romantic music, their use was restricted chiefly to piano concerti (and to a lesser extent, violin concerti) because they were most easily played and most effective on the piano and violin; the cadential trill and resolution would be generally followed by an orchestral coda. Beethoven was {{a good example of}} this, limiting it almost entirely to his concerti, and most other Romantic composers including Chopin and Schumann followed suit; Schubert, who never wrote concerti, hardly used it at all (the Adagio and Rondo Concertante D. 487, a chamber work, being one prominent exception). At the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> even Mozart rarely used the trill in symphonies. Because the music generally became louder and more dramatic leading up to it, a cadence was used for climactic effect, and was often embellished by Romantic composers. Later on in the Romantic era, however, other dramatic virtuosic movements were often used to close sections instead.|$|E
