50|$|In {{programming}} languages, octal literals {{are typically}} {{identified with a}} variety of prefixes, including the digit 0, the letters o or q, the digit-letter combination 0o, or the symbol & or $. In Motorola convention, <b>octal</b> <b>numbers</b> are prefixed with @, whereas a small letter o is added as a postfix following the Intel convention. DR-DOS DEBUG uses \ to prefix <b>octal</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European word for [...] "nine" [...] might be related to the PIE word for [...] "new". Based on this, some have speculated that proto-Indo-Europeans used an <b>octal</b> <b>number</b> system, though the evidence supporting this is slim.|$|E
5000|$|Octets {{are often}} {{expressed}} and displayed {{using a variety}} of representations, for example in the hexadecimal, decimal, or <b>octal</b> <b>number</b> systems. The binary value of all eight bits set (or activated) is , equal to the hexadecimal value , the decimal value , and the octal value [...] One octet can be used to represent decimal values ranging from 0 to 255.|$|E
50|$|If {{fewer than}} 4 digits are entered, leading zeros are assumed. An error will result if the {{argument}} is not a valid <b>octal</b> <b>number</b> or if {{it has more than}} 4 digits. The three rightmost octal digits address the 'owner', 'group' and 'other' user classes, respectively. If a fourth digit is present, the leftmost (high-order) digit addresses three additional attributes, the setuid bit, the setgid bit and the sticky bit.|$|E
50|$|For double-digit <b>octal</b> <b>numbers</b> {{this method}} amounts to {{multiplying}} the lead digit by 8 and adding the second digit {{to get the}} total.|$|R

5000|$|The base b {{may also}} be {{indicated}} by the phrase [...] "base-b". So binary numbers are [...] "base-2"; <b>octal</b> <b>numbers</b> are [...] "base-8"; decimal numbers are [...] "base-10"; and so on.|$|R
50|$|The {{checksum}} {{is calculated}} {{by taking the}} sum of the unsigned byte values of the header record with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii spaces (decimal value 32). It is stored as a six digit <b>octal</b> <b>number</b> with leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility, ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and take the first six digits. In addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed. Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included checksum.|$|E

The {{code word}} is a 23-bit Golay (23,12) code {{which has the}} ability to detect and correct errors of 3 or fewer bits. The word consists of 12 data bits followed by 11 check bits. The last 3 data bits are a fixed '001', this leaves 9 code bits (512 possibilities) which are conventionally represented as a 3-digit <b>octal</b> <b>number.</b> Note that the first bit transmitted is the LSB, so the code is [...] "backwards" [...] from the transmitted bit order. Only 83 of the 512 possible codes are available, to prevent falsing due to alignment collisions.|$|E
50|$|BASIC was {{provided}} on disk {{rather than in}} the system ROMs, partially to give the Model II a more professional and less of a home-computer appearance. The Model II BASIC was similar to Level III Disk BASIC on the Model I/III, but had cassette support removed and incorporated several enhancements from the then-latest version of Microsoft BASIC-80, which included enhanced string-handling features, an improved editor, <b>octal</b> <b>number</b> conversion, and error-trapping. On the downside, the PEEK and POKE commands were removed from Model II BASIC which made it less hacker-friendly. However, if CP/M was used, the user had access to MBASIC for CP/M which was very similar to Model II BASIC and did allow PEEK/POKE.|$|E
50|$|Numbers were {{represented}} in ones' complement, single and double precision. The TRIM assembly source code used <b>octal</b> <b>numbers</b> {{as opposed to}} more common hexadecimal because the 18-bit words are evenly divisible by 3, but not by 4.|$|R
50|$|The <b>octal</b> <b>numbering</b> {{system is}} also used as another way to {{represent}} binary numbers. In this case the base is 8 and therefore only digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are used. When converting from binary to octal every 3 bits relate to one and only one octal digit.|$|R
50|$|<b>Octal</b> <b>numbers</b> {{that are}} used in some {{programming}} languages (C, Perl, PostScript…) for textual/graphical representations of byte strings when some byte values (unrepresented in a code page, non-graphical, having special meaning in current context or otherwise undesired) have to be to escaped as \nnn. Octal representation may be particularly handy with non-ASCII bytes of UTF-8, which encodes groups of 6 bits, and where any start byte has octal value \3nn and any continuation byte has octal value \2nn.|$|R

40|$|The {{transformational}} programming paradigm {{denotes the}} development of a program from a formal specification via the application of a series of correctness-preserving transformations. In this report I describe the PAL-system, an interactive environment currently under development at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, that supports the transformation of programs using partial deduction as the basic transformation steps. In addition to support the application of single transformation steps, the system includes a rudimentary mechanism for recording and replaying of the derivation-plan (i. e. the history of the derivation). I provide a thorough example of {{the development of}} a program that computes the decimal value of a binary number. Then I show that by making minor changes to the specification, I can automatically obtain a program that computes the decimal value of an <b>octal</b> <b>number,</b> using the recording and replaying capabilities included in the system.

40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} a closed-loop EEG-based learning environment, that adapts instructional learning material online, to improve learning success in students during arithmetic learning. The amount of cognitive workload during learning {{is crucial for}} successful learning and should {{be held in the}} optimal range for each learner. Based on EEG data from 10 subjects, we created a prediction model that estimates the learner's workload to obtain an unobtrusive workload measure. Furthermore, we developed an interactive learning environment that uses the prediction model to estimate the learner's workload online based on the EEG data and adapt the difficulty of the learning material to keep the learner's workload in an optimal range. The EEG-based learning environment was used by 13 subjects to learn arithmetic addition in the <b>octal</b> <b>number</b> system, leading to a significant learning effect. The results suggest that it is feasible to use EEG as an unobtrusive measure of cognitive workload to adapt the learning content. Further it demonstrates that a promptly workload prediction is possible using a generalized prediction model without the need for a user-specific calibration...|$|E
50|$|The CPU {{microcode}} {{includes a}} debugger: firmware with a direct serial interface (RS-232 or current loop) to a terminal. This let the operator do debugging by typing commands and reading <b>octal</b> <b>numbers,</b> rather than operating switches and reading lights, the typical debugging method at the time. The operator can thus examine and modify the computer's registers, memory, and input/output devices, diagnosing and perhaps correcting failures in software and peripherals (unless a failure disables the microcode itself). The operator can also specify which disk to boot from.|$|R

Binary <b>numbers</b> (base 2), <b>octal</b> <b>numbers</b> (base 8), and hexadecimal numbers (base 16) are the most familiar because of their importance in relating computation to computer architecture. But any base larger than 1 is possible. For bases up to 10, the ordinary digits suffice. Beyond 10, other characters are needed. For base 16, it is conventional to add the letters a, b, … f, with the correspondence between characters and numerical values as follows: 0 1 … 9 a b …...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Any {{system that}} is used for naming or {{representing}} numbers is a number system, also known as numeral system. The modern civilization is familiar with decimal number system using ten digits. However digital devices and computers use binary number system instead of decimal number system, using only two digits namely, 0 and 1 based on the fundamental concept of the decimal number system. Various other number systems also used this fundamental concept of decimal number system, for example <b>octal</b> <b>number</b> system and hexadecimal number systems using eight and sixteen digits respectively. The knowledge of number systems and their inter conversion is essential for understanding of computers. More over, successful programming for digital devices requires a precise understanding of data formats, number systems and their inter conversion. The inter conversion (a process in which things are each converted into the other) of number system requires allot of time and techniques to expertise. In this paper the interconversion of four most common number systems is taken under the consideration in tabulated form.

40|$|The {{number is}} a symbol or a word used to {{represent}} a numeral, while a system is a functionally related group of elements, so as whole, a number is set/group of symbols to represent numbers/numerals. In other words, any system that is used for naming or representing numbers is a number system, also known as numeral system. Almost everyone is familiar with decimal number system using ten digits. However digital devices and computers use binary number system instead of decimal number system, having only two digits i. e. 0 and 1. Binary number system {{is based on the}} same fundamental concept of decimal number system. Various other number systems also use the same fundamental concept of decimal number system, e. g. <b>octal</b> <b>number</b> system (using eight digits) and hexadecimal number systems (using sixteen digits). The knowledge of number systems, their limitations, data formats, arithmetic, inter conversion and other related terms is essential for understanding of computers and successful programming for digital devices. Understanding all these number systems and particularly their inter conversion (such process in which things are each converted into the other) of number system requires allot of time and a large number of techniques to expertise. In this particular paper the intercom version of four well-known number systems is taken under the consideration in tabulated as well as graphical form. It is simply a shorthand to the inter conversion of these number systems to understand as well as memorise it. The well-known number systems to be discussed are binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal. Index term...|$|E
40|$|MICRO-ID (General Diagnostics, Morris Plains, N. J.) {{is a new}} kit system {{designed}} for the identification of Enterobacteriaceae in 4 h. It consists of 15 biochemical tests of paper disks. Each test is in its own compartment in a molded plastic tray. Only one reagent need {{be added to the}} system (2 drops of 20 % KOH, which is added to the Voges-Proskauer test). Based on the pattern of positive and negative biochemical test results, a five-digit octal code number is calculated. An identification is derived from a computer-generated identification manual. A study was conducted to compare three systems—the MICRO-ID 4 -h and the API 20 E (Analytab Products Inc., Plainview, N. Y.) 18 - to 24 -h systems and a conventional media system—to measure the ability of each to identify members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Comparison tables, rather than simple percentage agreement tables, were generated to define the particular strengths and weaknesses of each system and allow the laboratory to best use the data. The MICRO-ID compared quite favorably with conventional media. MICRO-ID yielded incorrect identifications with 1. 5 % of the isolates tested (API 20 E, 4. 7 % misidentification rate). Half the MICRO-ID misidentifications occurred when the system identified a Citrobacter diversus as a lysine-negative Escherichia coli; all gave one <b>octal</b> <b>number.</b> A direct comparison of the MICRO-ID and API 20 E was of limited value because percentage agreements were merely the sums of the errors of each. The ease of inoculation, the requirement for the addition of only one reagent, and the 4 -h capability make the MICRO-ID system an extremely attractive development in the field of bacterial identification...|$|E
50|$|Numeric {{values are}} encoded in <b>octal</b> <b>numbers</b> using ASCII digits, with leading zeroes. For {{historical}} reasons, a final NUL or space character {{should also be}} used. Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored. This gives a maximum file size of 8 gigabytes on archived files. To overcome this limitation, star in 2001 introduced a base-256 coding that is indicated by setting the high-order bit of the leftmost byte of a numeric field. GNU-tar and BSD-tar followed this idea. Additionally, versions of tar from before the first POSIX standard from 1988 pad the values with spaces instead of zeroes.|$|R

The convolutional encoder uses a constraint length of and code generator polynomials of 133 and 171 (in <b>octal</b> <b>numbers).</b> The puncturing matrices for the relevant coding rates (1 / 2, 2 / 3, 3 / 4) are specified in [28]. All transmissions consisted of a 24 -byte header which includes a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) modulated with BPSK and bits were coded at rate 1 / 2. The header carries a fixed channel training sequence [17] and a payload of 1 KB is followed by a 4 -byte CRC check.|$|R
5000|$|Releases {{have been}} <b>numbered</b> using the <b>octal</b> base system.

If the environment variable is undefined, it falls back to send the sequence [...] instead. Specifying other sequences {{can be used to}} control various screen settings after a CLS. Due to the difficulties to define environment variables containing binary data COMMAND.COM also accepts a special \nnn notation for <b>octal</b> <b>numbers.</b> For example, to send an alternative control sequence like [...] (for 1Bh 2Bh as used by ASCII terminals), one could define the variable as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|... : This {{variable}} {{defines the}} control sequence {{to be sent}} to the console driver to clear the screen when the [...] command is issued, thereby overriding the internal default ("" [...] under DR-DOS, [...] "" [...] under DOS Plus 1.2 on Amstrad machines as well as under Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, and REAL/32 for VT52 terminals, or [...] "" [...] under Multiuser DOS for ASCII terminals). If the variable is not defined and no [...] console driver is detected, the DR-DOS [...] will directly clear the screen via [...] BIOS function, like MS-DOS/PC DOS [...] does. A special -notation for <b>octal</b> <b>numbers</b> is supported to allow the definition of special characters like ESC (ASCII-27 = [...] "←" [...] = 1Bh = 33o), as f.e. in [...] To send the backslash ("") itself, it can be doubled [...] "".|$|R
5000|$|A prefix [...] {{is used in}} C {{to specify}} string {{representations}} of <b>octal</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{as required by the}} ANSI C standard for the [...] "strtol" [...] function (the string to long integer converter) in the [...] "stdlib.h" [...] library. Many other programming languages, such as Python 2, Perl, Ruby, PHP, and the Unix shell bash also follow this specification for converting strings to numbers. As an example, [...] "" [...] does not represent 2010 (2×101 + 0×100), but rather 208 = 1610 (2×81 + 0×80 = 1×101 + 6×100). Decimal numbers written with leading zeros will be interpreted as octal by languages that follow this convention and will generate errors (not just unexpected results) if they contain [...] "8" [...] or [...] "9", since these digits do not exist in octal. This behavior can be quite a nuisance when working with sequences of strings with embedded, zero-padded decimal numbers (typically file names) to facilitate alphabetical sorting (see above) or when validating inputs from users who would not know that adding a leading zero triggers this base conversion.|$|R
