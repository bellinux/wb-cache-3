In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it council housing. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E

A report was prepared in 1903 which noted the population in Northwood—2,700 by that time, with 530 houses—compared with the largely rural character of the rest of Ruislip parish. The Metropolitan Railway extension from Harrow to Uxbridge was also discussed at the meeting on 28 October 1903, as a station was to be opened in Ruislip on the line. Kings College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish, were planning to sell some for development in light of the new line. As a result of these events, the council voted in favour of becoming an {{urban district}}.|$|E

The coyote's pre-Columbian range {{was limited to the}} Southwest and Plains regions of the United States and Canada, and northern and central Mexico. By the 19th century, the species expanded north and east, expanding further after 1900, coinciding with land conversion and the extirpation of wolves. By this time, its range encompassed all of the United States and Mexico, southward into Central America, and northward into most of Canada and Alaska.

In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. In the same year, the first multi-party elections were held in Croatia, with Franjo Tuđman's win raising nationalist tensions further.

40|$|One of the {{foundational}} students’ misconceptions <b>of</b> <b>area</b> measurement is conceiving area as {{the length of}} a line, instead the size of a surface. They do not see area as the number of measurement units covering a surface. Therefore, this study intends to develop learning activities and materials that support students in developing their understanding <b>of</b> <b>area</b> as the number of measurement units covering a surface. This research is conducted based on the view of the design research approach consisting of two cycles. The subjects of the study are taken from the third grade students of two primary schools in Surabaya. Meanwhile, the learning activities in this study are based on the view of PMRI (Indonesia realistic mathematics education). We found that student need to understand physically quantity <b>of</b> <b>area</b> and the measurement unit <b>of</b> <b>area</b> before they are introduced to the meaning <b>of</b> <b>area</b> as the number of measurement units covering a surface. Learning activity that provides students with the experience of covering activity and comparing area problems could lead to the discussion on the physically quantity <b>of</b> <b>area,</b> the measurement unit <b>of</b> <b>area,</b> and its properties (no gap, no overlapping, and unit consistency); meanwhile, learning activity that engaging students in comparing <b>area</b> <b>of</b> tiled floors can be used to develop students’ understanding <b>of</b> measuring <b>area</b> as the process of finding the number of measurement units.
