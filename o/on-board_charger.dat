External charging facilities are usually bulky and expensive due {{to the use of}} low frequency modulation technique. For this reason, EV <b>on-board</b> <b>charging</b> system becomes a popular concept in nowadays due the improvement of high frequency (HF) power electronics [1]. The EV's <b>on-board</b> <b>charging</b> system requires high power density and a HF transformer to fulfill the design requirements of a light-weight, compact, and high power density [2].

5000|$|Most {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) have an <b>on-board</b> <b>charger</b> {{that uses a}} rectifier circuit to transform alternating current from the electrical grid (mains AC) to direct current (DC) suitable for recharging the EV's battery pack.

Given these limits, most conventional charging solutions are based on either 240V/30A service in the USA and Japan, 240 V, 70 A service in Canada or the 230 V, 15 A or 3Φ, 400 V, 32 A service in Europe and Australia.

The grid voltages are analyzed according to the probabilistic and deterministic limits of the EN 50160 standard, for a 100 % EV penetration rate. The impact on the EV user comfort is evaluated in terms of charging time and electrically driven distances. The chosen voltage droop charging eliminates critical voltages below 0. 85 pu and reduces voltage unbalance, with a limited impact on the total charging time.
