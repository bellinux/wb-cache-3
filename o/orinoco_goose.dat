50|$|Neochen debilis is an {{extinct species}} of goose from the Middle Pleistocene of Argentina. Argentine {{paleontologist}} Florentino Ameghino described the species from a tarsometatarsus discovered in La Plata. It {{was smaller than}} the living <b>Orinoco</b> <b>goose.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Orinoco</b> <b>goose</b> {{is a very}} {{territorial}} {{species in}} the breeding season, and usually nests in hollow trees, only occasionally on the ground.The male has a high pitched whistling call, and the female cackles like the related Egyptian goose.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Orinoco</b> <b>goose</b> (Neochen jubata) is {{a member}} of the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae. It is in the {{shelduck}} subfamily Tadorninae, and placed in the genus Neochen. Three fossil relatives have been described from Pleistocene sites: Neochen pugil from Brazil, Neochen debilis from Argentina and Neochen barbadiana from Barbados.|$|E
50|$|More exotic animals include crested screamers, Patagonian maras (cavies), <b>Orinoco</b> <b>geese,</b> flamingos, bush dogs, red pandas, Indian muntjac, yaks, Chacoan peccaries, and rheas.|$|R
50|$|<b>Orinoco</b> <b>geese</b> are 61 to 76 cm {{long and}} are {{resident}} breeders {{in the forests}} of tropical South America. Its preference is forest lakes or marshes with access to open woodland or savanna.|$|R
25|$|The current Aquatic Bird House {{opened on}} September 24, 1964, on the {{foundation}} of the original house, which was opened on November 8, 1899, {{with the rest of the}} zoo. The building features a multitude of mostly open-fronted enclosures mainly focusing on coastal and wetland habitats and the species that rely on them. Scarlet ibises, roseate spoonbills, a Madagascar crested ibis, giant wood rail, pied avocets, Baer's pochards, common terns, African spoonbills, silver teals and Forster's terns are among the residents here. The exhibit also features an outdoor pond home to a flock of American flamingos and <b>Orinoco</b> <b>geese,</b> and a large aviary home to lesser adjutant storks. The zoo is one of only three zoos in North America working with the endangered storks and has bred them several times, including the hatching of two chicks on June 27 and August 15, 2015. The Aquatic Bird House is also home to another endangered stork species: the Storm's stork. The zoo is one of only two in the United States working with this species; the other being the San Diego Zoo. In May 2014, the zoo opened a new nocturnal enclosure for a North Island brown kiwi in the building, and in May 2015, a colony of little blue penguins from the Taronga Zoo were added.|$|R
50|$|The swamp {{forests are}} home to species that include Orinoco {{crocodile}} (Crocodylus intermedius), Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), jaguar (Panthera onca), bush dog (Speothos venaticus), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), <b>Orinoco</b> <b>goose</b> (Neochen jubata) and harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja).Endangered species include the Orinoco crocodile, giant otter and yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis).|$|E
50|$|Neochen pugil is an {{extinct species}} of goose from the Late Pleistocene or {{possibly}} the Early Holocene of Brazil. The fossils were discovered by Danish paleontologist Peter Wilhelm Lund near Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais state, and described by Danish ornithologist Oluf Winge in 1888. It {{was related to}} the living <b>Orinoco</b> <b>goose,</b> but much larger.|$|E
50|$|The {{stands of}} morichi palm (Mauritia flexosa) are {{important}} sources {{of food for}} many species of primates, rodents and parrots, and are used by many birds for nesting.Threatened species include the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), Orinoco crocodile (Crocodylus intermedius), Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), jaguar (Panthera onca) , bush dog (Speothos venaticus), <b>Orinoco</b> <b>goose</b> (Neochen jubata), and harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja).Endangered birds also include the yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis).|$|E
50|$|There is a {{wide range}} of mammals in the park {{including}} marsh deer, other species of deer, peccary, capybara, giant anteater, maned wolf, jaguar, giant otter and armadillo. The reptiles present include the anaconda, spectacled caiman, black caiman and South American river turtle, and the rivers are home to many freshwater fish as well as Amazon river dolphins and Tucuxi dolphins. There are plenty of birds too, including the common toucan, anhinga, greater rhea, quail, partridge, osprey, <b>Orinoco</b> <b>goose,</b> heron. egret, Spix's macaw, hoatzin and musician wren.|$|E
40|$|DAVENPORT, Lisa C., NOLE Bazán, Inés y CARLOS Erazo, Nancy. East {{with the}} night: {{longitudinal}} migration of the <b>Orinoco</b> <b>goose</b> (Neochen jubata) between Manú National Park, Peru and the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia. PLOS ONE [en línea]. 2012, vol. 7, no. 10, p. 1 - 6. ISSN 1932 - 6203. We {{report on the}} intra-Amazonian migration {{of a pair of}} Orinoco Geese (Neochen jubata) from Manú National Park, Peru. The species is Critically Endangered in Peru, so a major aim {{of the study was to}} aid conservation planning by learning the wet season location of the country's last known breeding population. We captured a breeding pair on October 27, 2010, and fitted the birds with Microwave Telemetry, Inc. GPS/Argos satellite PTT's. The pair migrated ~ 655 km from Manú National Park to the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia (Dept. of Bení) in a predominantly longitudinal migration, reaching their final destination on December 23, 2010. Major movements (> 5 km per time period) were almost exclusively at night and were undertaken with and without moonlight. Foraging areas used at stopovers in the Llanos de Moxos were remarkably limited, suggesting the importance of grazing lawns maintained by the geese and other herbivores, possibly including cattle. Orinoco Geese are resident in the Llanos de Moxos year-round, so the Manú geese represent a partial migration from the Bení region. We hypothesize that cavity nest limitation explains the partial migration of Orinoco Geese from the Llanos de Moxos...|$|E

This group of 14 species has a worldwide distribution except for North America. The typical sheldgeese are grazing birds, the ecological counterparts of the true geese, while the shelducks are mostly wading and dabbling birds, frequently feeding {{to a large extent}} on aquatic invertebrates. In all of the species the adult male has an enlarged bony bulla in the syrinx, which is evidently responsible for the whistling or whistlelike sounds that are important in sexual and aggressive displays. The females of all species have more reedy and typically gooselike or ducklike notes. In all species the males are larger than the females, and often differ appreciably from them in plumage. Although pair bonds are sometimes said to be permanent in the group, in some species at least they may be ruptured through interactions with outside males, and a premium is placed on male aggressiveness during sexual competition for mates. The wings are used in fighting and in most species they are strongly patterned, with white coverts and iridescent coloration on the secondaries or their greater coverts. The downy young are also typically patterned contrastingly in the shelducks and sheldgeese, a characteristic shared with various other cavity-nesting waterfowl...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to test and evaluate the various taxonomic arrangements of the family, to discover some of the trends of behavioral evolution, {{and to provide a}} basis for future workers to use in naming, describing, and evaluating the behavioral patterns observed in waterfowl. The major sexual behavior patterns of the species of Anatidae are reviewed and summarized, for the purpose of clarifying evolutionary relationships in the family, tracing the evolution of behavior patterns through various taxa, and evaluating the importance of certain behavior patterns as potential isolating mechanisms.
