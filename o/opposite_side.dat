5|$|A wetland reserve {{has been}} created at Heron's Green Pool on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the {{causeway}} to the lake. A shallow pool fringed with sedges (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae) and reedgrasses (Calamagrostis) and surrounded by lightly grazed, rough grassland may also prove attractive to snipe and lapwings.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the ball, Texas' {{receiving}} corps {{was led by}} Mike Adams, who had six grabs for 92 yards. Tight end Pat Fitzgerald had the Longhorns' only receiving touchdown, and {{he finished}} the game with three catches for 21 yards. Three other players had two or fewer receptions.|$|E
5000|$|A square is {{a special}} case of a rhombus (equal <b>sides,</b> <b>opposite</b> equal angles), a kite (two pairs of {{adjacent}} equal sides), a trapezoid (one pair of <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> parallel), a parallelogram (all <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> parallel), a quadrilateral or tetragon (four-sided polygon), and a rectangle (<b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> equal, right-angles) and therefore has all the properties of all these shapes, namely: ...|$|R
50|$|Crossed rectangle: an antiparallelogram whose <b>sides</b> are two <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> {{and the two}} diagonals of a rectangle, hence {{having one}} pair of <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> parallel.|$|R
50|$|These {{equations}} {{are closely}} related to the Pitot theorem for tangential quadrilaterals, where the sums of <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> are equal for the two pairs of <b>opposite</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
5|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the Hanlon Expressway, Hanlon Road existed as far north as College Avenue. Edinburgh Road was the westernmost crossing of the Speed River. On the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the valley, Silvercreek Road continued, as it does today, along the same right-of-way as Hanlon Road.|$|E
5|$|Roxy Ann Peak's {{southern}} foothills {{are also}} home to the RoxyAnn Winery, a Rogue Valley AVA winery founded in 2002.

5|$|The B had a goods depot at Pylle Hill (south of the station) from 1850, and the MR had an {{independent}} yard at Avonside Wharf on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the Floating Harbour from 1858.|$|E

25|$|If the {{extensions}} of <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> in a tangential quadrilateral intersect at J and K, and the {{extensions of}} <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> in its contact quadrilateral intersect at L and M, then the four points J, L, K and M are collinear.|$|R
50|$|The {{center of}} a {{rectangle}} is equidistant from all four vertices, and it is equidistant from two <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> and also equidistant from the other two <b>opposite</b> <b>sides.</b> A point on the axis of symmetry of a kite is equidistant between two sides.|$|R
5|$|A {{site for}} the {{replacement}} terminus was bought by the LSWR in 1899, south of the existing site and on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of Westminster Bridge Road. It was completed on 8 February 1902, and the LSWR viaduct was widened to serve a greatly enlarged Waterloo station, destroying all traces of the original LNC terminus.|$|E
5|$|After {{the journey}} restarts, the train enters a tunnel through the Splash Mountain log flume attraction, crosses a trestle {{bridge over the}} Critter Country section, wraps around the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, and rolls through another tunnel before {{reaching}} Mickey's Toontown Depot between the Mickey's Toontown and Fantasyland sections. While the train is stopped at this station, a non-functioning water tower {{can be seen on}} the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the track to the station's depot building.|$|E
5|$|Behemoth is a steel {{roller coaster}} at Canada's Wonderland in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. It is a Hypercoaster {{designed}} and developed by Swiss manufacturer, Bolliger & Mabillard. Behemoth was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in Canada until 2012 when Leviathan, {{a roller coaster}} also manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, was built at the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of Canada's Wonderland, claiming these titles. Behemoth is similar to Diamondback (Kings Island), Goliath (La Ronde) and Nitro (Six Flags Great Adventure).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Self-crossing hexagon , {{inscribed in}} a circle. Its sides are {{extended}} so that pairs of <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> intersect on Pascal's line. Each pair of extended <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> {{has its own}} color: one red, one yellow, one blue. Pascal's line is shown in white.|$|R
50|$|<b>Opposite</b> <b>sides</b> {{are equal}} in length.|$|R
50|$|The result generalizes to any 2n-gon with <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> parallel. Since {{the sum of}} {{distances}} between any pair of <b>opposite</b> parallel <b>sides</b> is constant, {{it follows that the}} sum of all pairwise sums between the pairs of parallel sides, is also constant. The converse in general is not true, as the result holds for an equilateral hexagon, which does not necessarily have <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> parallel.|$|R
5|$|Built at {{the same}} was Lam Tin Bus Terminus, located on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of Lei Yue Mun Road and housing {{platforms}} for franchised buses, minibuses, taxis and cross-border buses. It is also connected to Sceneway Plaza by staircases and escalators. Following the construction of these new facilities, Lam Tin gradually became a major transport interchange in Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, {{the club}} {{completed}} {{construction of a}} state-of-the-art 26,828 seater stadium {{on the site of}} the now-demolished old Cardiff Athletics Stadium at a cost of £48million. The project required the rebuilding of the athletics stadium, to be known as Cardiff International Sports Stadium, on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of Leckwith Road in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|In his 1874 paper, {{entitled}} Note sur les propriétés du centre des médianes antiparallèles dans un triangle, Lemoine {{proved the}} concurrency of the symmedians of a triangle; the {{reflections of the}} medians of the triangle over the angle bisectors. Other results in the paper included {{the idea that the}} symmedian from a vertex of the triangle divides the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> into segments whose ratio is equal to the ratio of the squares of the other two sides.|$|E

2500|$|If {{exactly one}} pair of <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the hexagon are parallel, then the {{conclusion}} of the theorem is that the [...] "Pascal line" [...] determined by the two points of intersection is parallel to the parallel sides of the hexagon. If two pairs of <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> are parallel, then all three pairs of <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> form pairs of parallel lines and there is no Pascal line in the Euclidean plane (in this case, the line at infinity of the extended Euclidean plane is the Pascal line of the hexagon).|$|R
5|$|In {{recognition}} of their performance in a losing effort, NC State quarterback Erik Kramer was named the game's offensive most valuable player, while on defense, NC State cornerback Derrick Taylor won the honor. Kramer finished the game having completed 12 of his 19passes for 155yards. On the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the field, Virginia Tech quarterback Eric Chapman finished with 20completions out of 30attempts for twotouchdowns and 200passing yards.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{run of the}} men's doubles luge {{competition}} on 17 February 2010, Austria's team of Tobias Schiegl and Markus Schiegl survived a crash on turn 16 where they came in at too high of an elevation. Tobias tried to correct the oversteer {{only to have the}} cousins collide on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the ice wall, causing both to go airborne momentarily. Neither suffered any injury.|$|E

Thanks to John Silvester from the Dept. of Mathematics, King’s College, London for the following projective proof.

Three Mexican scouts from Sesma's army were captured by Sherman's men, and although Sherman argued for an attack on Sesma's troops, Houston was not ready.|$|E
