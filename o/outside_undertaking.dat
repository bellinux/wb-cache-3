500|$|Wheeler was keen to {{continue}} archaeological fieldwork <b>outside</b> London, <b>undertaking</b> excavations {{every year from}} 1926 to 1939.

It was during these investigations that Wheeler personally discovered the Lydney Hoard of coinage. Wheeler and his wife jointly published their excavation report in 1932 as Report on the Excavation of the Prehistoric, Roman and Post-Roman Site in Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, which Piggott noted had [...] "set the pattern" [...] for all Wheeler's future excavation reports.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze whether firms located inside a hypothetic cluster have a {{different}} performance in terms of technical efficiency from firms located <b>outside.</b> To <b>undertake</b> this analysis we present a methodology to overcome the restrictions suffered by this kind of studies, basically the radial efficiency measures. The methodological approach we propose is based on non-radial efficiency measures, also referred as the Russell measure. We present the main results obtained on a sample of small and middle-sized industrial firms located in the Valencian Community (Spain) to show the advantages of this methodology. Furthermore, we assess the links between the spatial location and some management characteristics at firm level. ...|$|R

Anything concerning this must thus be based on guesswork.|$|R

No charges were brought after the Whig government fell from power, and Mackworth set up a new company in 1713, the Company of Mineral Manufacturers. This ceased operations in 1719.|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{cerebrospinal}} {{venous insufficiency}} (CCSVI) was recently proposed as {{a contributing factor}} in the pathology of multiple sclerosis. This concept has gained remarkable attention, partly because endovascular neurointervention has been suggested as a treatment strategy. This review summarizes available evidence and provides a critical analysis of the published data. Currently, there is inconclusive evidence to support CCSVI as an etiological factor in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Second, a measure of exploitation by universities is calculated indicating that approximately one-third of salaries are 'earned' outside normal working hours. ...|$|R
