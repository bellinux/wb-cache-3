5|$|Periyar {{spent over}} fifty years giving speeches, {{propagating}} the realisation {{that everyone is}} an equal citizen and the differences on basis <b>of</b> <b>caste</b> and creeds were man-made to keep the innocent and ignorant as underdogs in the society. Although Periyar's speeches were targeted towards the illiterate and more mundane mass, scores of educated people were also swayed. Periyar viewed reasoning as a special tool. According to him, all were blessed with this tool, but very few used it. Thus Periyar used reasoning, with respect to subjects of social interest, in his presentations to his audiences. Communal differences in Tamil society were {{considered by many to}} be deep-rooted features until Periyar came to the scene.|$|E
5|$|In the Kingdom of Mysore, the Veerashaiva {{literary}} {{school was}} {{challenged by the}} growing influence of the Srivaishnava intelligentsia in the Wodeyar court. The Srivaishnava writers (followers of a sect of Vaishnavism) of Kannada literature were also in competition with Telugu and Sanskrit writers, their predominance continuing into the English colonial rule over the princely state of Mysore. Meanwhile, the radical writings of 16th-century poet Ratnakaravarni had made way for {{a new kind of}} poetry heralded by those who were not poets in the traditional courtly sense, rather itinerant poets who travelled across the Kannada-speaking region, cutting across court and monastery, writing poems (in the tripadi metre) and influencing the lives of people with their humanistic values which overcame the social barriers <b>of</b> <b>caste</b> and religion. Sarvajna (often compared to Telugu poet Vemana), Sisunala Sherif, Mupina Sadakshari, Navalingayogi and Kadakolada Madivalappa are the best-known among them. These maverick poets heralded yet another epoch of unconventional literature in Kannada language, free of courtly conservatism and established literary tastes.|$|E
5|$|The Mangalorean Catholics {{constituted}} {{a small community}} widely scattered across the South Canara district. Rather than being a closely knit and united group, the Goan Catholic immigrants and their progeny did not associate with the native Catholics on account <b>of</b> <b>caste,</b> origin, and language, and even among themselves were strongly divided by caste. The Hindus, including the indigenous Brahmins (mostly belonging to the Shivalli, Havyaka, and Kota sub-groups) and Bunts did not associate with the Catholics and would not admit them into their houses on account of their religion. However, a close contact was kept by the Catholics with the Hindus of the same caste who were refugees from Goa. Catholics would invite their Hindu cousins to festivities such as birth celebrations, weddings, and funeral feasts. The Hindus accepted such invitations. Unlike his Hindu counterpart, a high-caste Mangalorean Catholic did not consider himself polluted upon physical contact {{with a member of}} the lower caste, but members of different castes did not fraternise or invite each other home for dinner.|$|E

5|$|The larvae grow {{through a}} series of four or five moults and enter the pupal stage. The pupa has the {{appendages}} free and not fused to the body as in a butterfly pupa. The differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different castes of workers, is influenced in some species by the nutrition the larvae obtain. Genetic influences and the control of gene expression by the developmental environment are complex and the determination <b>of</b> <b>caste</b> continues to be a subject of research. Winged male ants, called drones, emerge from pupae along with the usually winged breeding females. Some species, such as army ants, have wingless queens. Larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development, and so often, are moved around among the various brood chambers within the colony.|$|E
5|$|The tale of Nandanar is retold {{numerous}} times in folk tales, folk music, plays, films and literature in Tamil society. While Nandanar {{is included in}} Nayanar list since the 8th century CE, the 12th century CE Periya Puranam gives a full hagiographical account of his life. The tale focuses on two miracles attributed to him. In Sivalokanathar Temple, Tirupunkur; his prayers {{are said to have}} moved a giant stone bull, which still appears in the moved position in the temple. Nandanar is said to have ritually purified himself by fire at Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram. Nandar's tale features in temple lore and religious literature related to both these temples. Gopalakrishna Bharati's 19th century retelling of the saint's life remains the basis of many later retellings. It expands the original narrative adding elements of oppression of the Dalit saint by higher castes. While higher caste retellings of the tale focus on the saint's observance <b>of</b> <b>caste</b> norms, Dalits emphasize his exploitation and superior religiosity.|$|E
5|$|Khandoba (IAST: Khaṇḍobā), Martanda Bhairava or Malhari, is a Hindu deity worshipped as {{a manifestation}} of Shiva mainly in the Deccan plateau of India, {{especially}} in the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka. He is the most popular Kuladaivat (family deity) in Maharashtra. He is also the patron deity of select warrior, farming, herding and Brahmin (priestly) castes as well as several of the hunter/gatherer tribes that are native to the hills and forests of this region. The cult of Khandoba has linkages with Vaishnava and Jain traditions, and also assimilates all communities irrespective <b>of</b> <b>caste,</b> including Muslims. The worship of Khandoba developed during the 9th and 10th centuries from a folk deity into a composite god possessing the attributes of Shiva, Bhairava, Surya and Karttikeya (Skanda). He is depicted either {{in the form of a}} Lingam, or as an image of a warrior riding on a bull or a horse. The foremost centre of Khandoba worship is Jejuri in Maharashtra. The legends of Khandoba, found in the text Malhari Mahatmya and also narrated in folk songs, revolve around his victory over demons Mani-malla and his marriages.|$|E
