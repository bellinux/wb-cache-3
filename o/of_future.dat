40|$|Some {{students}} <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> markets {{believe that}} the volatility <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> prices increases as the futures contract nears maturity (see Telser, 1956; Segall, 1956; and Samuelson, 1965). Samuelson offers {{an explanation for the}} existence of the variability effect as reviewed in Section 1 of the paper. His hypothesis about the behavior <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> prices requires that the stochastic process characteriz-ing spot prices must be of a particular kind; other processes will yield different relations between the variability and maturity <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> con-tracts. Section 2 of the paper examines the behavior of a sample <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> returns for existence of a systematic volatility effect. Evidence, in this particular case, supports the view that such an effect exists. Section 3 examines the underlying spot-return series to see if its properties are consistent with the empirical results for the sample <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> returns ex-amined in Section 2. Although the process generating the spot returns is consistent with the implications of Samuelson's hypothesis, there is a discrepancy between the observed pattern <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> return volatility and the pattern implied by the Samuelson relationship. Whether or not sam-pling variability could account for the discrepancy is discussed briefly {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} {{predictability}} <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> returns {{is due to}} weak-form market inefficiency or to rational variation in the return required by investors over time. Market efficiency is tested {{with respect to the}} hypothesis that a conditional multifactor model that allows for shifts in the systematic risk <b>of</b> the <b>futures</b> contract captures the predictability <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> returns. On average 86 % of the predictability <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> returns is explained in terms of conditional risk and only 12 % of the predictable variance of returns is relegated to the conditional residuals. It follows that the predictability <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> returns most likely results from rational variation in the preferences of economic agents for consumption and investment. ...|$|R

40|$|Donald Lien and Yan Wang (this issue) {{suggest an}} {{alternative}} test for different specifications {{of the term}} structure <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> prices, as used in our recently published paper in The Journal <b>of</b> <b>Futures</b> Markets. Our paper (Y. V. Veld-Merkoulova and F.

One of the preliminary steps underlying this strategy was to compare linear and log-linear term structures <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> prices in order to choose an appropriate specification. Although {{this is not the}} main issue of our paper, it is certainly important to use the correct econometric procedure in testing alternative model specifications. The results found by Lien and Wang do not contradict our conclusion that a linear term structure <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> yields is superior to a linear term structure <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> prices.

30|$|To {{trace the}} {{possibility}} of such mode 3 orientation, {{it is necessary to}} reveal the reasons for and sources <b>of</b> divergence <b>of</b> <b>futures.</b> What is crucial here is the diagnosis of an “immanence of the present” in which futures studies and reflections are trapped as well [17, 21]. Visions <b>of</b> the <b>future</b> are social constructs, created and “manufactured” by people, groups and organisations at respectively determined points in time [26]. Visions <b>of</b> the <b>future</b> result from a composition of ingredients in certain processes (e.g. the methods <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> research). In this way the respective current knowledge bases, but also contemporary diagnoses, values and other forms of perception of the world are adopted in these pictures <b>of</b> the <b>future.</b> Divergence <b>of</b> visions <b>of</b> the <b>future</b> is, as briefly mentioned above, the result of the consideration of controversial and divergent knowledge bases and disputed values during their creation: the divergence <b>of</b> <b>futures</b> mirrors the differences of contemporary positions and reflects today’s pluralism.
