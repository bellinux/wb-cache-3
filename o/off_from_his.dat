5|$|The {{loss of his}} {{security}} clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations {{of those who had}} testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The brief period when scientists were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists working within the government were on notice that dissent was no longer tolerated.|$|E
5|$|Amid this {{environment}} of intense internal pressure {{for the band}} to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to Marietta, Georgia in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer. The decision to record {{so far away from}} their hometown was motivated partly by the band's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> known drug connections. The recording environment for Siamese Dream was quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with Gish, Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment. The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant. Corgan's depression, meanwhile, had deepened {{to the point where he}} contemplated suicide, and he compensated by practically living in the studio. Meanwhile, Chamberlin quickly managed to find new connections and was often absent without any contact for days at a time. In all, it took over four months to complete the record, with the budget exceeding $250,000.|$|E
5|$|Angered {{over his}} electoral loss, Randolph harangued anti-Harrison supporters, even {{challenging}} {{one to a}} duel. He was stabbed three times, but recovered and challenged Jennings in his bid for reelection in 1810. Harrison came out to personally stump on Randolph's behalf. Jennings focused on the slavery issue and tied Randolph to Harrison's continued attempts to legalize the institution. The congressional election coincided with the first popular election of delegates to the territorial legislature. In 1809, a year prior to the election, the territory's pro-slavery faction suffered a significant setback when Illinois was separated from the Indiana Territory, cutting Harrison <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> supporters in the western portion of the territory. Harrison suggested that Jennings further expanded his political base by stumping among the disaffected French residents of the territory. Jennings's defeat of Randolph in 1810 repudiated Harrison's pro-slavery policies. Following his triumph in the election, Jennings's and his anti-slavery allies were successful in enacting a legislative agenda that limited the territorial governor's authority and repealed an 1805 act regarding indentured service.|$|E

5|$|At {{the midway}} point the {{following}} season, Daniel {{was named to}} his second consecutive NHL All-Star Game in January 2012. He {{was one of four}} players representing the Canucks, including Henrik, Alexander Edler and Cody Hodgson. Chosen to Team Alfredsson in the All-Star Fantasy Draft, he recorded a goal and an assist in a 12–9 loss to Team Chara. Later in the season, Daniel sustained a concussion after receiving a hit from Blackhawks defenceman Duncan Keith during a game on 21 March 2012. With Daniel in the neutral zone and without possession of the puck, Keith hit him in the head with his elbow. After being helped off the ice by a trainer, Daniel remained in the game for a shift before leaving the contest entirely. Two days later, Keith was suspended five games for his hit by the League. Sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} regular season, Daniel finished 2011–12 with 30 goals and 67 points over 72 games, a drop <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> League-leading total from the previous season.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{strength}} of Malvern Hill, as demonstrated in the battle, McClellan felt he needed to continue with his planned withdrawal to Harrison's Landing, to Fitz John Porter's chagrin. Porter felt that the Army of the Potomac should remain atop the hill or perhaps even continue their advance to Richmond. McClellan however insisted that Confederate troops greatly outnumbered his own, felt he could not protect Harrison's Landing from his current position at Malvern Hill, and feared being cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> supply depot. McClellan's mentality prevailed. The Union batteries and McClellan's engineers began moving to Harrison's Landing soon {{after the end of}} the Battle of Malvern Hill. Starting at about 11p.m. unit after unit began to follow. Within hours, nearly all of McClellan's Army of the Potomac was marching towards Harrison's Landing. Once the last of these men had crossed the Turkey Island Bridge, they destroyed the bridge and felled trees over it to stymie any pursuit, leaving the James River between the Union and Confederate armies.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Stephen V in 1272 {{meant that he}} was succeeded by his infant son Ladislaus IV, with the widowed consort and mother of the boy, Elizabeth, as his regent. At the time, Jacob Svetoslav still held Vidin as a Hungarian vassal. Possibly in 1273, Hungarian rule in Braničevo, west of Jacob's domain, was put to an end by two Cuman–Bulgarian nobles, Darman and Kudelin. Cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> Hungarian suzerains and facing the menace of a Bulgarian attack from the east, Jacob Svetoslav once again {{submitted}} to Bulgarian rule. He arrived in the capital Tarnovo to negotiate his submission with Constantine's consort Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene, who was the dominant figure in the empire at the time due to the Tsar's paralysis. There, Jacob was formally adopted by the much younger Maria as her second son, after the infant heir Michael Asen II. This adoption solidified Jacob's ties to the court and meant that he could safely retain his autonomous domain as a Bulgarian vassal. He also harboured hopes to ascend to the throne by ousting Michael when Constantine died. Suspicious of these disloyal intentions of Jacob's, Constantine's consort Maria {{is thought to have}} poisoned him, and he died in 1275 or 1276/1777, shortly before the Uprising of Ivaylo.|$|E

He claims {{his time on}} a pig farm {{will allow him to}} not emotionally connect with the dogs being held there, but he quickly names all of the dogs and adopts the many dogs scheduled to be euthanized that day. Kenneth asks for someone at TGS to adopt the dogs and Tracy quickly brings them all to Liz's apartment to continue annoying her. Liz and Tracy go to Jack to finally resolve their conflict. Jack decides that, because Liz ruined Tracy's life with her book, Tracy should be given the right to ruin her life, and he orders Liz to sign over her life rights to Tracy. Jack tells Liz a story about an accident he had ice climbing, falling into a crevasse. He broke his leg and was unable to climb upwards to escape, but by going deeper down into the crevasse he found a path out. Liz applies this story to her situation with Tracy and stops resisting him, instead suggesting that Tracy make a pornographic film based on her life. Tracy agrees and moves out of Liz's apartment. In addition, Jenna and Liz resolve their issues when they see two adult stars acting out a scene of Jenna (Caitlin Fowler) and Liz (Savanna Samson) apologizing to one another.|$|E

He {{then worked}} in Investment Management at ScotiaMcLeod from 2007 to 2010, where he managed {{portfolios}} of high-net-worth clients that were worth {{a total of}} about $120 million. After taking time <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> career to earn a Master of Business Administration, Vipond worked in Strategy and Corporate Development at the Vancouver-based Goldcorp Inc. from 2012 to 2015 where he made a $2.6 billion unsolicited bid to buy Osisko Mining. In 2013, while working at Goldcorp, Vipond founded Mathers Pacific Capital Inc., which is based in Vancouver. Mathers Pacific Capital works with Vancouver-area companies to help them raise capital, complete mergers and acquisitions, and grow their businesses. In March 2015, Vipond became Vice President of Corporate Finance at Shoes.com, while also continuing to run Mathers Pacific Capital and the Corporate Finance Institute, which is a subdivision of Mathers Pacific Capital.

These purchases helped bring Shoes.com into the online shoe-selling business and shortly after joining Shoes.com, he oversaw the completion of a non-brokered $45 million private placement. It was the largest such private placement ever completed by a Canadian e-commerce company. In 2014, Vipond taught a one-day course on mining valuation at Sauder School of Business that involved working through a mining acquisition opportunity and the impact on such an mining investment.|$|E
