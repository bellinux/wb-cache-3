The first complete evolutionary model was first formulated in 1946, by USGS geologist and hydrologist Harold T. Stearns.

But, starting in July 2001 the CPS increased its monthly sample size from 50, 000 + households to 60, 000 + households. These changes had virtually no effect on the characteristics of respondents in the sample or the overall composition of the sample. The 1996 changes reduced the total number <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> for small demographic groups, such as Arab and Islamic Americans, while the 2001 changes increased the total number <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> small demographic groups.

5|$|Klein's {{division}} {{was part of}} the decisive defeat of the Austrian and Russian force at the subsequent Battle of Austerlitz three weeks later. Initially, his dragoons, assigned to support Friant's division, occupied a position <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> on the Marchfeld. The rest of his dragoons remained near Stockerau, just to the west of Vienna, and these dragoons, plus Louis-Nicolas Davout's, François Antoine Louis Bourcier's and Marc Antoine Beaumont's divisions of dragoons, formed a cordon between Pohrlitz and Pressburg, and could move either west or east, depending on the actions of the Archduke Charles or the Russian commander Kutuzov. Consequently, Klein's dragoons, held the road between Austerlitz and Vienna, eliminating a possible Austrian retreat.|$|E
5|$|On 19 July, {{reconnaissance}} aircraft located a Turkish {{force in the}} desert moving west. The regiment and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade were ordered to establish a line <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> posts in their path. They were to send out patrols to locate them, but withdraw if attacked. If possible, they were to retire towards Romani, enticing the Turks to follow them. At dawn on 20 July the regiment located the Turks digging trenches near Ogratina. Rifle fire was exchanged and some prisoners were captured. The prisoners revealed that the force comprised twelve battalions with artillery support, planning to attack Romani.|$|E
30|$|It is also {{possible}} that the lack of a main effect of boundary type {{is due in part to}} the large difference in the number <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> for each boundary condition. As noted above, only 4.1 and 5.5 % <b>of</b> the <b>observations</b> occurred near coarse boundaries, which likely explains the large confidence intervals for this condition. However, this difference in number <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> cannot fully explain the results. First, the results presented above were obtained using linear mixed effects modeling, which took into account the different numbers <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> among the conditions. In addition, when the boundary conditions were collapsed into within events versus around event boundaries, the number <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> in each condition were more similar (60.4 and 57.9 % <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> were around event boundaries for the two studies). Therefore, it is unlikely that additional observations for the coarse boundary condition would have dramatically altered the results.|$|R
