One night bassist Noel Redding was warned about a pending visit from law enforcement, so he {{immediately}} phoned drummer Mitch Mitchell, who was at the nightclub Whisky a Go Go, and asked him to come <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> so that they could search for and remove any illegal drugs. They found a large assortment of substances in Hendrix's room that had apparently been given to him by fans. Soon afterwards, they were paid a visit by three detectives who told them that they were under police surveillance by officers living in a nearby house.|$|E

Between 1070 and 1180 the Holy Roman Emperors were again strongly opposed by Bavaria, especially by the ducal House of Welf. In the final conflict between the Welf and Hohenstaufen dynasties, Duke Henry the Lion was banned and deprived of his Bavarian and Saxon fiefs by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Frederick passed Bavaria <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Wittelsbach, which held it until 1918.

[...] Kemper replied, [...] "No, good night!", before waiting for her to fall asleep and {{returning}} to bludgeon her with a claw hammer and slit her throat with a knife. He then decapitated her and engaged in irrumatio with her severed head before using it as a dart board; stating that he [...] "put [...] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour... threw darts at it," [...] and ultimately, [...] "smashed her face in." [...] He also cut out her tongue and larynx {{and put them in the}} garbage disposal. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough vocal cords and ejected the tissue back into the sink. [...] "That seemed appropriate," [...] Kemper later said, [...] "as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years." [...] He then had sex with his mother's corpse, hid it in a closet and went out to drink. Upon his return, he invited his mother's best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor [...] "Sally" [...] Hallett, <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> for dinner and a movie.

2500|$|The {{suggestion}} {{to renew the}} riverfront was not original, as previous projects were attempted but lacked popularity. The Jefferson memorial idea emerged amid the economic disarray of the Great Depression and promised new jobs. The project was expected to create 5,000 jobs {{for three to four}} years. Committee members began to raise public awareness by organizing fundraisers and writing pamphlets. They also engaged Congress by planning budgets and preparing bills, in addition to researching ownership of the land they had chosen, [...] "approximately one-half mile in length... from Third Street east to the present elevated railroad." [...] In January 1934, Senator Bennett Champ Clark and Representative John Cochran introduced to Congress an appropriation bill seeking $30million for the memorial, but the bill failed to garner support due to the large amount of money solicited. In March of the same year, joint resolutions proposed the establishment of a federal commission to develop the memorial. Although the proposal aimed for only authorization, the bill incurred opposition because people suspected that JNEMA would later seek appropriation. On March 28 the Senate bill was reported out, and on April 5 it was turned <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> Library Committee, [...] which later reported favorably on the bills. On June 8, both the Senate and House bills were passed. On June 15, then President Franklin D. Roosevelt , instituting the United States Territorial Expansion Memorial Commission.
