Semi-fluorinated chainsof three different lengths (F-octyl, F-hexyl and F-butyl) were grafted to EDOP via a n-hexyl chain. The filmselaborated by imposed potential are characterized by static and dynamic contact angle measurements(with water and hexadecane), robustness tests, scanning electron microscopy and optical profilometry. Robust superhydrophobic surfaces (contact angles of water greater than 140 ◦after applying an externalpressure) were produced from F-hexyl derivatives and robust superhydrophobic and superoleophobicsurfaces (contact angles of hexadecane greater than 140 ◦after applying an external pressure) were pro-duced from F-octyl derivatives. These surfaces presented a peculiar double-scale surface structure (micro-and nanostructuration). <b>Oil-repellent</b> properties are highly depending on the deposition charge i. e. onpolymer growth stage. The surface roughness parameters are given at various steps of the polymer growthand we thus identify microstructure profiles from which high <b>oil-repellent</b> properties are reached.

Superhydrophobic surfaces are obtained with F-octyl and F-hexyl chains but only the surfaces produced from the monomer containing F-butyl chains are highly oleophobic. These high contact angles can be explained by their surface morphology (spider-web-like structure) which favors the "pinning effect".

Smooth surfaces are elaborated to compare these values.

Here, we report on the prepn. of superoleophobic cotton textiles based on a multilength-scale structure, as demonstrated by a high hexadecane contact angle (153 Deg for 5 micro L droplets) and low roll-off angle (9 Deg for 20 micro L droplets). The multilength-scale roughness was based on the woven structure, with addnl. two layers of silica particles (microparticles and nanoparticles, resp.) covalently bonded to the fiber.

40|$|Controllable surface {{adhesion}} {{of solid}} substrates has aroused great interest both in air and underwater in solving many challenging interfacial science {{problems such as}} robust antifouling, <b>oil-repellent,</b> and highly efficient oil/water separation materials. Recently, responsive surface adhesion, especially switchable adhesion, under external stimulus in air has been paid more and more attention in fundamental research and industrial applications. However, phototunable underwater oil adhesion is still a challenge. Here, an approach to realize phototunable underwater oil adhesion on aligned ZnO nanorod array-coated films is reported, via a special switchable contact mode between an unstable liquid/gas/solid tri-phase contact mode and stable liquid/liquid/solid tri-phase contact mode. The photo-induced wettability transition to water and air exists (or does not) in the micro/nanoscale hierarchical structure of the mesh films, playing important role in controlling the underwater oil adhesion behavior.

Though the sol–gel nanocomposite coatings {{in the absence of}} fluoropolymer were superhydrophobic with WCA of 155 °, they were oleophilic with oil contact angle of b 10 °.

40|$|A fluorine-containing {{methylacrylate}} copolymer latex {{has been}} synthesized by emulsion polymerization {{and was used}} as a water- and <b>oil-repellent</b> agent to treat some pure cotton woven fabrics at different dry and curing temperature. The treated cotton fabric surfaces were investigated by attenuated total reflectance infrared analysis and angle-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy directly. The analysis results could agree with the fluorine-containing copolymer real situation on the fabrics surface much more, and could indicate, factually, surface properties of treated or modified material rather than copolymer film. It was found that fluorine elements are enriched at the air-polymer interface and fluorine content of the treated cotton fabrics surface decreases with increasing analysis depth, which depends on heating and cooling experience, such as annealing and quenching. Furthermore, the results showed that almost the same effect can be attained using this copolymer curing from 100 C to 175 C; the relatively low curing temperature is very valuable and advantageous for some fabrics which would yellow easily at higher temperatures.

On the other hand, electronic touch panels have a problem such as deterioration of visibility of the screen by finger grease stain. To solve these problems, we need to fabricate the anti-stain surfaces which have superhydrophobic and <b>oil-repellent</b> abilities without spoiling the transparency of the transparent substrate. In this study, we fabricated lotus leaves like surface on a glass substrate. Firstly, SiO 2 particles of ca. 100 nm diameter were arranged on the glass substrates. Secondly, to obtain the fractal-like structure (ultra-micro-rough structure) on the surface, ZnO thin film having a columnar structure was fabricated on the SiO 2 particles by using an atmospheric pressure cold plasma deposition system. By using these processes, the ZnO columns formed radiantly on the spherical surface of the SiO 2 particles. Furthermore, without spoiling the ultra-micro-rough structure, a transparent anti-stain monolayer with low surface energy was prepared by using a chemical adsorption technique onto the surface. Average value of the water droplet contact angles of the samples fabricated was 151. 8 deg.

In this dissertation, a new evaporation speed controlling method is demonstrated using a thin liquid-film based microfluidic valve. Microfluidic droplet ejectors were designed, fabricated and {{integrated with the}} liquid-film based microfluidic valve. The thin liquid film with nonvolatility and immiscibility exhibited excellent microfluidic valve functionality without any stiction problem between valve components, and provided a very effective evaporation protection barrier for the microfluids in the device. Successful evaporation control by the liquid-film-embedded (LiFE) microfluidic valve has been demonstrated. In addition, guided actuation of the microfluidic valve along predefined paths was successfully achieved using newly developed <b>oil-repellent</b> surfaces, which were later used for developing ‘virtual walls’ for confining low surface tension liquids within predefined areas. Moreover, bioinspired slippery surfaces for aiding the microfluidic valve along the ejector surface have also been developed. These slippery surfaces were evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing microfluidic valve driving voltages. Finally, a sliding liquid drop (SLID) shutter technique has been developed for a normally closed functionality with aid from nanostructures. The SLID shutter resolves many issues found in the previous LiFE microfluidic valve. Smooth and successful printing results of highly volatile bio-fluids have been demonstrated using the SLID shutter technique.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{we report}} the {{possibility}} to selectively switch by voltage and anion exchange the water-repellent properties, {{in comparison with the}} <b>oil-repellent</b> properties, of copolymers containing both fluorinated chains (EDOT-F 8) and pyridinium (EDOT-Py+) moieties. Here, the fluorinated chains are necessary to reach superhydrophobic properties while the pyridinium moieties allow the switching in the wettability by counter-ion exchange. Because, conducting polymers can exist in their oxidized and reduced state, here, we report also the switching of their wettability by voltage. The best properties (superhydrophobic properties with low hysteresis and sliding and good oleophobic properties) are obtained for a % of EDOT-Py+ of 25 %. Surprisingly, by reducing the polymer by changing the voltage, a selective decrease in the contact angle of water is observed while that of oils (diiodomethane and hexadecane) remain unchanged, making possible to have higher contact angles with diiodomethane than with water. Here, the switching in the wettability is due to the change of the water droplet from the Cassie-Baxter state to the Wenzel state by changing the voltage. Due to the presence of highly polar pyridinium groups and their perchlorate counter-ions, the wettability of oil droplets (diiodomethane and hexadecane) is not significantly affected. This effect is confirmed by changing the counter-ions with highly hydrophobic ones (C 8 F 17 SO 3 -, Tf 2 N- or BF 4 -). Such materials are excellent candidates for oil/water separation membranes...|$|E

The PFAA compounds perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) are found globally in humans; because they readily cross the placental barrier, in utero exposure may be a cause for concern. We investigated whether in utero exposure to PFOA and PFOS affects semen quality, testicular volume, and reproductive hormone levels. We recruited 169 male offspring (19 - 21 years of age) from a pregnancy cohort established in Aarhus, Denmark, in 1988 - 1989, corresponding to 37. 6 % of the eligible sons. Each man provided a semen sample and a blood sample. Semen samples were analyzed for sperm concentration, total sperm count, motility, and morphology, and blood samples were used to measure reproductive hormones. As a proxy for in utero exposure, PFOA and PFOS were measured in maternal blood samples from pregnancy week 30. Multivariable linear regression analysis suggested that in utero exposure to PFOA was associated with lower adjusted sperm concentration (ptrend = 0. 01) and total sperm count (ptrend = 0. 001) and with higher adjusted levels of luteinizing hormone (ptrend = 0. 03) and follicle-stimulating hormone (ptrend = 0. 01). PFOS did not appear to be associated with any of the outcomes assessed, before or after adjustment.

40|$|Industry is on a {{continuous}} way to search new treatments and novel technologies to reduce costs, increase productivity, decrease waste generation and treatment. The textile industry {{is characterized by}} mature processes and its breakthrough has necessarily to come from technological transfer from research. Plasma treatment being based on a gaseous technology does not require to use many chemicals, {{as well as the}} precious resource given by freshwater. In this view, plasma treatment of textile materials appears very promising in replacing a number of current wet chemical processes, or at least, intensifying them. Plasma is commonly known as the fourth state of matter, being constituted by ionized gas in a neutral state with an equal density of positive and negative charges. It consists of a fast evolving mix of ions, electrons, free radicals, meta-stable excited species, molecular and polymeric fragments. Additionally, a high energetic content given by visible, UV and IR radiations characterizes plasmas. Decades of development have allowed researchers and scientists to confine geometrically plasma, control its energy and develop applications in material processing and waste reduction by designing devices suitable to very many industrial uses. Although plasma treatments have been used for years to process materials including semiconductors, microchips, and other electrical and electronic components, only recently the textile industry has considered the use of plasma for fabric processing with particular emphasis given to the surface of this material. Plasma treatments are classified among nanotechnologies since they interact with the fiber surface only and do not alter the properties of the fiber core. Plasmas can be classified according two major categories: thermal and non-thermal. A thermal plasma is characterized by a very high temperature and it is not suitable for applications to heat-sensitive materials. A non-thermal plasma is generated at moderate temperature and it is suitable for heat-sensitive materials such as textiles. Non-thermal plasmas are also known as low-temperature plasmas (LTP) and can be classified into many different categories depending on operating pressure, type of power supply (lowfrequency, radio-frequency and microwave) and geometrical arrangements. Plasmas modify the surface of materials by transferring energy from the excited plasma particles to the substrate. Thanks to this interaction, both chemical and physical modifications can be obtained. The mechanisms, which give origin to these modifications, include surface etching, surface activation, cross-linking, chain scission, de-crystallization, oxidation and surface chemical reactions. The reaction type depends largely on the type of gas used. For instance, inert gases such as argon and helium typically generate surface activation. Compounds that contain oxygen are commonly used as etching gases. Most likely, nitrogen is prone to cause reduction reactions. Pre-treatment and finishing of textile materials with LTP offers many advantages over conventional chemical processes, because most part of LTP surface modification treatments do not require use of water or chemicals and are characterized by an extremely low energy need. The possible applications of LTP in the textile field are commonly dyeing and finishing oriented; they include several types of functionalization such as hydrophilic enhancement to improve wetting, dyeing or adhesive bonding. Hydrophobic enhancement gives origin to water- and <b>oil-repellent</b> textiles. It is possible to change physical and/or electrical properties, clean surfaces, remove sizing agents, and perform surface sterilization of fiber at room temperature. Although most of the LTP treatments on polymeric materials, including textiles, developed by researcher have been carried out using low-pressure plasma, the atmospheric pressure plasma has demonstrated to be a much more interesting technology for large-scale applications. However, data and results from low-pressure plasma applications can be used to predict, compare or optimize atmospheric pressure plasma processes. In the work of this PhD research project all plasma treatments used are conducted at atmospheric pressure with a variety of gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, helium, argon a mixture of them and ambient air. Only atmospheric plasma equipment were selected because of easy applicability in {{a continuous}} mode, by considering that according to economical reasons, the evolution of textile technologies is oriented to continuous processes. In this thesis, Chapter I gives a general description of the LTP physics, main plasma generation systems and processing equipment, including also typical applications. In Chapter II {{a brief description of the}} selected textile characterization methods adopted in this work is provided. SEM, ATR-FTIR and XPS analyses, wettability tests, air and water vapor permeability measurement, tensile strength and low-stress mechanical properties test were selected to characterize and evaluate textile modifications carried out by plasma. Additionally, also the transformation mechanisms are enlightened. Chapter III comparatively describes the effect of three kinds of atmospheric plasma treatment. These treatments, finalized to wool fabric hydrophilicity enhancement, were performed in reducing, oxidizing and neutral conditions. A novel wool fabric dyeing process is described in Chapter IV. This process, requiring plasma as a pre-treatment, gives emphasis to water and energy saving, as well as to process productivity. Then, the fabric produced was characterized according to standard methods. The study presented in Chapter V deals with the comparison of a standard pad-dry-cure coating process for water- and <b>oil-repellent</b> finishing with respect to a plasma intensified pad-dry-cure coating process and a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process. These two innovative processes were performed to improve coating durability, reduce chemical consumption and avoid the least use of water, as in the PECVD cas...|$|E
