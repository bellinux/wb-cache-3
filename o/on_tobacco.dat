5|$|Polonium-210 {{in tobacco}} {{contributes}} {{to many of}} the cases of lung cancer worldwide. Most of this polonium is derived from lead-210 deposited <b>on</b> <b>tobacco</b> leaves from the atmosphere; the lead-210 is a product of radon-222 gas, much of which appears to originate from the decay of radium-226 from fertilizers applied to the tobacco soils.|$|E
5|$|Mason avoided overdependence <b>on</b> <b>tobacco</b> as {{a source}} of income by leasing much of his land {{holdings}} to tenant farmers, and diversified his crops to grow wheat for export to the British West Indies as Virginia's economy sank because of tobacco overproduction in the 1760s and 1770s. Mason was a pioneer in the Virginia wine industry, subscribing along with other Virginians such as Thomas Jefferson to Philip Mazzei's scheme for growing wine grapes in America.|$|E

5|$|Policy {{interventions}} to decrease passive smoking in public {{areas such as}} restaurants and workplaces have become more common in many Western countries. Bhutan has had a complete smoking ban since 2005 while India introduced a ban on smoking in public in October 2008. The World Health Organization has called for governments to institute a total ban <b>on</b> <b>tobacco</b> advertising to prevent young people from taking up smoking. They assess that such bans have reduced tobacco consumption by 16% where instituted.|$|E
5|$|Willson's {{interventions}} ultimately {{had little}} to do with the end of the violence. In 1908, the courts began handing down convictions against the Night Riders, though many of their leaders escaped the convictions. A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax <b>on</b> <b>tobacco,</b> and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American Tobacco Company to be in violation of antitrust laws. Each of these events helped raise tobacco prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E
5|$|It did {{not take}} Louis XVIII long {{to go back on}} one of his many promises. He and his ComptrollerGeneral of Finance Baron Louis were {{determined}} not to let the exchequer fall into deficit (there was a 75million franc debt inherited from Napoleon I), and took fiscal measures to ensure this. Louis XVIII assured the French that the unpopular taxes <b>on</b> <b>tobacco,</b> wine and salt would be abolished when he was restored, but he failed to do so, which led to rioting in Bordeaux. Expenditures on the army was slashed in the 1815 budget– in 1814, the military had accounted for 55% of government spending.|$|E

5|$|The Labour party {{conference in}} Manchester on 21–24 September {{occurred}} {{days after the}} Scottish referendum result. Miliband's conference speech was criticised, particularly after he missed sections on the deficit and immigration, after attempting to deliver the speech without notes. At the conference, Miliband pledged to focus on six national goals for Britain until 2025, including boosting pay, apprenticeships and housing; a mansion tax and levy <b>on</b> <b>tobacco</b> companies to fund £2.5 billion a year 'time to care' fund for the NHS; a commitment to {{raise the minimum wage}} to £8 or more by 2020; and a promise to lower the voting age to 16 ready for elections in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi anti-tobacco {{campaign}} included banning {{smoking in}} trams, buses and city trains, promoting health education, limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht, organizing medical lectures for soldiers, {{and raising the}} tobacco tax. The National Socialists also imposed restrictions <b>on</b> <b>tobacco</b> advertising and smoking in public spaces, and regulated restaurants and coffeehouses. The anti-tobacco movement {{did not have much}} effect {{in the early years of}} the Nazi regime and tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939, but smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945. Even by the end of the 20th century, the anti-smoking movement in postwar Germany had not attained the influence of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign.|$|E
5|$|As the 49th Congress {{gathered}} in 1885, Cleveland's {{position on the}} tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed the plan, and Randall joined 13 Democrats and most Republicans in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison's attempt to reduce the tariff. Again, Republicans and Randall's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the lame-duck session of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises <b>on</b> <b>tobacco</b> and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall's protectionists, but Republicans {{and the rest of}} the Democratic caucus rejected it.|$|E

5|$|During the 1894 {{legislative}} session, Brown advocated and won {{passage of}} several government efficiency measures, including {{a bill to}} transfer certain state governmental expenses to the counties, a bill to reform state printing contracts, and measures clarifying laws governing asylums and charitable institutions. The most significant bill, {{and the one that}} generated the most debate, was a law giving married women individual property rights {{for the first time in}} state history. Other measures passed during the session included a basic coal safety measure, a common school statute, a measure prohibiting collusive bidding <b>on</b> <b>tobacco,</b> new regulations on grain warehouses, and a law providing free turnpikes. Measures advocated by Brown but not enacted by the Assembly included broadening the powers of the state railroad commission, establishing the offices of state bank inspector and superintendent of public printing, and reforming prison management, including separate detention of adolescent criminals. Brown also lobbied for the abolition of the state parole board; when the Assembly refused, Brown vowed to ignore the board's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|In the 38th Canadian Parliament Dosanjh was {{appointed}} Minister of Health {{in the federal}} Cabinet. As Health Minister, Dosanjh strongly supported Canada's existing single-tier, publicly funded health-care system. Dosanjh introduced legislation to make cigarettes fire safe, new regulations to further limit lead content in children's jewelry, and supported an NDP motion to ban trans fats. He advocated that Canada ratify the World Health Organization Framework Convention <b>on</b> <b>Tobacco</b> Control, which they did in November 2004. Dosanjh funded a program to revise the Canada food guide to include more multicultural foods and another program to integrate foreign-trained medical professionals into the health-care system. Supported by a unanimous vote in the House of Commons, the government agreed to compensate the 6,000 Canadians infected with hepatitis C from tainted blood transfusion. Along with Prime Minister Martin, a 10-year, $41 billion funding plan was negotiated with the provinces to deliver health care – with $5.5 billion to specifically address wait times that had been an election issue during the 2004 federal election – but they rejected Premiers' demands for a national program to purchase pharmaceuticals in bulk. As the Minister of Health, Dosanjh introduced Bill C-12 An Act to prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases which updated the 1985 Quarantine Act; it was given royal assent in May 2005.|$|E
5|$|Claiborne sailed for Kent Island on 28 May 1631 with indentured {{servants}} recruited in London {{and money}} for his trading post, likely believing Calvert's hopes defeated. He was able to gain {{the support of the}} Virginia Council for his project and, as a reward for London merchant Maurice Thomson's financial support, helped Thomson and two associates get a contract from Virginia guaranteeing a monopoly <b>on</b> <b>tobacco.</b> Claiborne's Kent Island settlers established a small plantation on the island and appointed a clergyman. While the settlement on Kent Island was progressing, the Privy Council had proposed to Sir George Calvert, former Secretary of State for the King that he be granted a charter for lands north of the Virginia colony, in replacement for the unsuccessful settlements of his earlier colony of Avalon in Newfoundland (eastern modern Canada), in order to create pressure on the Dutch settlements further north along the Delaware and Hudson Rivers (modern states of Delaware, New Jersey and New York). Calvert accepted, though he died in 1632 before the charter could be formally signed by King Charles I, and the Royal Grant and Charter for the new colony of Maryland was instead granted to his son, Cecilius Calvert, on 20 June 1632. This turn of events was unfortunate for Claiborne, since the Maryland charter included all lands {{on either side of the}} Chesapeake Bay north of the mouth of the Potomac River, a region which included Claiborne's proposed trading post on Kent Island, mid-way on the Bay. The Virginia Assembly, still in support of Claiborne and now including representatives of the Kent Island settlers, issued a series of proclamations and protests both before and after when the news of the granting of the Maryland charter reached across the ocean, claiming the lands for Virginia and protesting the charter's legality.|$|E
