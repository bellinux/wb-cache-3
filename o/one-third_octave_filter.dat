The extracted features were associated with the type and distance of the moving vehicle and the heterogeneous multi-classifier system (HTMCS) based on multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM) has been developed. Bootstrap sampling method based HTMCS was developed and the developed model has yielded a higher classification accuracy when compared to the individual base classifier models...|$|E
30|$|A SIP 95 {{sound level}} meter was used to record {{acoustic}} data. The measurement system is inspected every two years {{and approved by the}} French National Laboratory for testing in accordance with international standards. The microphone is positioned at 4 m above the ground to comply with the requirement of the free field condition. The ground is flat and consists of grass shorter without brush, wood or obstacles. Two calibrations are performed every day. The free-field sensitivity level of the microphone and preamplifier in the reference direction, at frequencies over at least the range of one-third-octave nominal mid-band frequencies from 50 Hz to 10 kHz inclusive, is within 1.0 dB of that at the calibration check frequency, and within 2.0 dB for nominal mid-band frequencies of 6.3 kHz, 8 kHz and 10 kHz. The output of the analysis system consists of one-third octave band sound pressure levels as a function of time, obtained by processing the noise signals with the following characteristics: a set of 24 one-third octave band filters [50 Hz– 10 kHz]; response and averaging properties in which the output from any <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> <b>filter</b> band is squared, averaged and displayed or stored as time-averaged sound pressure levels; the interval between successive sound pressure level samples is 500 ms 5 ms for spectral analysis with or without slow time-weighting. Ambient noise, including both an acoustical background and electrical noise of the measurement system was recorded for 10 minutes a day with the system gain set at the levels used for the aircraft noise measurements. The recorded aircraft noise data is acceptable according to international standards. The exclusion criteria of the recorded data are: days on which a strike took place and special weather conditions (gusty winds, stormy rainfall, atmospheric turbulence, etc.). According to the measurement specifications, we identified and retained 15460 turbojet aircraft approaching the airport in the same conditions representing 84.5 % (+ 20 T) of the air traffic (15 % of the air traffic represents propeller aircraft (3 – 9 T and + 20 T) and 0.5 % others (− 3 T and 3 − 9 T)). In this paper, we analyzed the measured maximum noise levels. This is because the model described in the previous sections provide the maximum noise values.|$|E
30|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{the use of a}} {{modulation}} spectrum front end that is based on time-domain filtering that does not require collapsing the output to the equivalent of <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> <b>filters,</b> but which still makes it possible to estimate the posterior probability of the states in a finite-state machine. In brief, we first filter the speech signal with 15 gammatone filters (roughly equivalent to <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> <b>filters)</b> and we process the Hilbert envelope of the output of the gammatone filters with nine modulation spectrum filters [19]. The 135 -dimensional (135 -D) output of this system can be sampled at any rate that is an integer fraction of the sampling frequency of the input speech signal. For the conversion of the 135 -D output to posterior probability estimates of a set of states, we use the sparse coding (SC) approach proposed by [20]. Sparse coding is best conceived of as an exemplar-based approach [21] in which unknown inputs are coded as positive (weighted) sums of items in an exemplar dictionary.|$|R
30|$|In {{designing}} the modulation spectrum analysis system, {{a number of}} decisions {{had to be made}} about implementation details. Although we are confident that all our decisions were reasonable (and supported by data from the literature), we cannot claim that they were optimal. Most data in the literature on modulation spectra are based on perception experiments with human subjects, {{but more often than not}} these experiments use auditory stimuli that are very different from speech. While the results of those experiments surely provide guidance for ASR, it may well be that the automatic processing aimed at extracting the discriminative information is so different from what humans do that some of our decisions are sub-optimal. Our gammatone filterbank contains 15 <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> <b>filters,</b> which have a higher resolution in the frequencies < 500 Hz than the Mel filterbank that is used in most ASR systems. However, initial experiments in which we compared our <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> filterbank with a filterbank consisting of 23 Mel-spaced gammatone filters, spanning the frequency range of 64 to 3, 340 Hz did not show a significant advantage of the latter over the former. From the speech technology’s point of view, this may seem surprising because the narrow-band <b>filters</b> of the <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> filterbank in the low frequencies may cause interactions with fundamental frequency, while the relatively broad filters in the higher frequencies cannot resolve formants. But from an auditory system’s point of view, there is no such surprise, since <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> <b>filters</b> are compatible with most, if not all, outcomes of psycho-acoustic experiments. This is also true for experiments that focused on speech intelligibility [1].|$|R

40|$|AbstractMaximum sound {{pressure}} levels {{are commonly used}} for environmental noise and building acoustics measurements. This paper investigates the signal processing errors due to Fast or Slow time-weighting detectors when combined with <b>octave</b> band <b>filters,</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> band <b>filters</b> or an A-weighting filter. For 6 th order Butterworth CPB filters the inherent time delay caused by the phase response of filters is quantified using three different approaches to establish the following rules-of-thumb: (1) time-to-gradient/amplitude matching occurs when Bt≈ 1, (2) time-to-peak matching occurs when Bt≈ 2 and (3) time-to-settle matching occurs when Bt≈ 4 for <b>octave</b> band <b>filters,</b> and when Bt≈ 3 for <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> band <b>filters.</b> Four different commercially-available sound level meters are used to quantify the variation in measured maximum levels using tone bursts, half-sine pulses, ramped noise and recorded transients. Tone bursts indicate that Slow time-weighting is inappropriate for maximum level measurements due to the large bias error. The results also {{show that there is}} more variation between sound level meters when considering Fast time-weighted maximum levels in <b>octave</b> bands or <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> bands than with A-weighted levels. To reduce the variation between measurements with different sound level meters, it is proposed that limits could be prescribed on the phase response for CPB filters and A-weighting filters...|$|R
30|$|For {{a recent}} review {{of the range of}} {{approaches}} that has been taken towards noise-robust ASR, we refer to [17]. Here, we focus on one set of approaches, guided by the finding that humans have less trouble recognizing speech in noise, which seems to suggest that humans are either better in source separation or in latching on to the speech information that is not obscured by the noise (or in both). This suggests that there is something in the auditory processing system that makes it possible to deal with additive noise. Indeed, {{it has been suggested that}} replacing the conventional short-time spectral analysis based on the fast Fourier transform by the output of a principled auditory model should improve robustness against noise. However, up to now, the results of research along this line have failed to live up to the promise [18]. We believe that this is at least in part caused by the fact that in previous research, the output of an auditory model was converted to the equivalent of the energy in <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> <b>filters,</b> necessary for interfacing with a conventional ASR back end, but without trying to capture the continuity constraints imposed by the articulatory system. In this conversion most of the additional information carried by the modulation spectrum is lost.|$|R

40|$|The switched-capacitor (SC) {{technique}} {{is a very}} attractive method for implementing fully integrated filters in MOS technology [...] The filters, consisting only of switches, capacitors and operational amplifiers, can be realised through a nutter of design procedures. This thesis describes these design techniques and their applications. Many of the suitable designs use SC integrators which can be easily derived from the analogue active integrators. Parasitic-insensitive implementation is possible realising either the lossless discrete integrator (Lza) or the bilinear transformation. The effects of noise and other non-idealities of the switches and operational amplifiers on these integrators are described. A general biquadratic structure based on the SC integrators is given from which a circuit capable of realising bandpass transfer functions is derived. The SC biquads are cascaded or coupled {{for the design of}} higher order filters. Higher order SC filters are also designed by simulating doublyterminated 'LC ladder networks with integrators using the LDI transformation. Other methods of simulating the ladder network include using voltage-controlled current sources, the impedance simulation method and voltage inverter switches. These methods mostly produce circuits which are sensitive to parasitic capacitances and are only briefly described. These design techniques are used to design SC filters which meet the <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> bandpeds <b>filter</b> specification required for the analysis of acoustic noiii and vibration. The midband frequencies of the resulting SC bandpass filters can be varied from 10 Hz to 20 kHz. The designs are made using clock frequency at a minimum value possible and another at 48 times the midband frequency. The suitable circuits are compared with regard to their requirements and performances. The antialiasing problem due to the wide range of required midband frequencies is overcome with the use of an SC decimator circuit. This allows the antialiasing filter, the decimator and other accessories to be implemented on 4 single Chip with the SC bandpass filter. The SC circuits are analysed using their z-transform relations. The nodal analysis technique and the equivalent circuit method are described and used for deriving z-transform transfer functions of the SC filters. These are then used to predict the frequency responses of the filters and their sensitivity as to variation of one single capacitor value...|$|R

One accepted model is often called the critical band model, which shows how signals psychoacoustically mask one another, {{as long as they are}} within a critical band [Zwicker, 1990]. A close approximation to the critical bands of hearing is a third <b>octave</b> <b>filter</b> bank, which is designed in this paper.
