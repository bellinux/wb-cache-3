40|$|Toxocariasis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} reported helminth zoonotic infections throughout the world. Its main etiologic agent is the Toxocara canis nematode, and less frequently Toxocara cati, whose final hosts are the dog and cat respectively [6, 9, and 11]. It is acquired through the ingestion of embryonated eggs exposed to infected soil, geophagy, poorly washed hands, <b>onychophagy,</b> as well as the ingestion of vegetables with animal feces and larvae encysted in the tissue of paratenic hosts (various animals) [2, 3, 14]. These animals host hipobiotic larvae in the liver and other tissues, which can be transmitted to humans trough the ingestion of raw or undercooked meat [1, 4]. However there is little information available on the prevalence of T. canis infection in humans trough paratenic hosts such as horses, sheep, birds, etc. [13]. The objective of the present study was to determine the presence of T. canis antibodies in sheep of Ayapango, Mexico State, Mexico...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the frequency of anti-Toxocara antibodies in youngsters aging from 2 to 20 years in northwest Iran. Materials and Methods. 397 samples were taken randomly almost equally from four locations in Urmia, west Azerbaijan, during August 2014 to September 2015. Anti-Toxocara IgG antibody assays were done on sera by using ELISA kit (IBL, Germany). In order to prevent cross-reaction, the samples of the patients who are infected with other parasites in stool exam, especially Ascarididae family, were also excluded. SPSS 16. 0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results. 12 (3 %) of the serum samples were positive for anti-Toxocara IgG. According to the Chi-square analysis, risk factors such as mother’s educational level, keeping dogs or cats as pets, and history of coughing were related to Toxocara infection (P< 0. 05). There was no relationship between toxocariasis and gender, history of <b>onychophagy,</b> pica, fever, abdominal pain, and anorexia; however, we found a significant relationship between Toxocara infection and chronic coughing (P= 0. 045). Conclusion. Toxocariasis in northwest Iran can be considered as a public health problem. This study may also help to increase the awareness about this infection...|$|E
40|$|OS OBJETIVOS DESTE ESTUDO FORAM: CARACTERIZAR A POPULAÇÃO DE PACIENTES DE UMA CLÍNICA-ESCOLA; INVESTIGAR OS ASPECTOS PSICO-AFETIVOS ASSOCIADOS ÀS DOENÇAS PERIODONTAIS DESSES PACIENTES, ALÉM DOS RECURSOS DEFENSIVOS UTILIZADOS POR ELES. MÉTODO: LEVANTOU-SE DADOS SÓCIO-DEMOGRÁFICOS, DE SAÚDE GERAL E PERIODONTAL DE 789 PACIENTES ATENDIDOS NUM DEPARTAMENTO DE PERIODONTIA DE UMA CLÍNICA-ESCOLA DE ODONTOLOGIA, DADOS ESTES QUE CONSTITUÍRAM A ETAPA QUANTITATIVA DO ESTUDO. ESSA CARACTERIZAÇÃO FOI FEITA ATRAVÉS DE PLANILHAS ESPECIALMENTE ELABORADAS PARA A PESQUISA. A PARTIR DESSAS PLANILHAS, FOI SELECIONADA UMA SUB-AMOSTRA DE 273 PACIENTES QUE APRESENTARAM QUEIXAS EM TRÊS OU MAIS SISTEMAS ORGÂNICOS, ALÉM DA QUEIXA PERIODONTAL, OS QUAIS FORAM DENOMINADOS DE PACIENTES POLI-QUEIXOSOS. UMA TERCEIRA SUB-AMOSTRA INTEGROU 59 PACIENTES POLI-QUEIXOSOS, DIAGNOSTICADOS COM DOENÇA LEVE A MODERADA OU LEVE A SEVERA. DESSES PACIENTES, TRÊS FORAM ENTREVISTADOS E INTEGRARAM A AMOSTRA DA ETAPA QUALITATIVA DA PESQUISA. OS RESULTADOS INDICARAM QUE ENTRE PACIENTES POLI-QUEIXOSOS NÃO FOI ENCONTRADA CORRELAÇÃO SIGNIFICATIVA ENTRE DOENÇA PERIODONTAL LEVE A MODERADA OU LEVE A SEVERA COM GÊNERO, IDADE, ESTADO CIVIL, GRAU DE INSTRUÇÃO OU ATIVIDADE LABORAL. TAMBÉM NÃO HOUVE RELAÇÃO SIGNIFICATIVA QUANTO À PRESENÇA DE TABAGISMO, BRUXISMO, ONICOFAGIA E XEROSTOMIA. VERIFICAMOS QUE A DOENÇA PERIODONTAL CRÔNICA TEM SUAS ORIGENS NAS RELAÇÕES OBJETAIS DA MAIS TENRA INFÂNCIA E QUE AS ANSIEDADES ESQUIZO-PARANÓIDES QUE CARACTERIZAM ESSAS PRIMEIRAS RELAÇÕES, CONTINUAM PERMEANDO AS RELAÇÕES DURANTE TODA A VIDA DAS PACIENTES. COMO OS RECURSOS DEFENSIVOS UTILIZADOS SÃO PSIQUICAMENTE POUCO EVOLUÍDOS, O EQUILÍBRIO, A HOMEOSTASE É ENCONTRADA NA DOENÇA. CONCLUÍMOS QUE A DINÂMICA INTRA-PSÍQUICA PODE ESTAR ASSOCIADA NÃO SÓ À DOENÇA PERIODONTAL, MAS TAMBÉM AO ESTADO DE SAÚDE GERAL DESSES PACIENTES. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the patients from a clinic of a dentistry school; to investigate psychological and affectivity aspects related to periodontal diseases in those patients, besides the defensive resources they use. Method: social and demographical basis as well as general and periodontal health information of 789 patients looked after at a clinic of a dentistry school were picked up, which composed the quantitative stage of the study. This characterization was done throughout planning board specially worked out for the research. From those planning board on, another sample were selected by 273 patients who were denominated multi-complainant as they complained of three or more organic systems besides the periodontal complaint. A third sample was composed by 59 multi-complainant patients diagnosed with mild to moderate or mild to severe periodontal disease. Three of those patients were interviewed who composed the qualitative stage of the research. The results showed that among multi-complainant patients there were no significant association of mild to moderate or mild to severe periodontal diseases with gender, age, civil state and level of education or professional degree. It was not also find out a correlation with smocking, bruxism, <b>onychophagy</b> and dry mouth. It was found out that inflammatory periodontal disease is originated at the first relationships in the childhood and the schizoid anxiety which characterizes those first relationships keeps permeating on along all life of the patients. As the psychically defensive resources are less evoluted, the equilibrium is found through the illness. It was concluded that psychical dynamics is associated not only to periodontal diseases, but also to general health of those patients...|$|E
