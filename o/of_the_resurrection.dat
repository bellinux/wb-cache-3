5|$|In 1751, Francis Blomefield, in his Collectanea Cantabrigiensia, {{recorded}} StJames' {{as having}} a square tower, with four bells and a clock. The north aisle was leaded {{and there was a}} chantry chapel at the east end with a screen. He concludes this to be the Chancel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection.</b> At this time, the south aisle, nave and chancel were also recorded as leaded.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 Ge {{returned}} to Florence and would paint not only Herzen's portrait {{but also the}} Messengers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> and {{the first version of}} the Christ on the Mount of Olives. The new religious paintings at that time were not much of a success, and the Imperial Academy refused to exhibit them in its annual exhibition.|$|E

5|$|The Office of Religious Life {{calls the}} chapel the third-largest {{university}} chapel in the world. According to Milliner, Princeton's is the second-tallest by {{height of the}} nave at the crossing; the tallest is King's College Chapel at the University of Cambridge. The belltower of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at the University of Notre Dame, the tower of the Duke University Chapel, the tower of the University of Chicago's Rockefeller Chapel, and the campanile of Valparaiso University's Chapel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> are all taller than Princeton's chapel, which {{does not have a}} tower or other appendages.|$|E
5|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for {{the second}} of three Easter feast days included the narration of the Road to Emmaus. The cantata was Bach's first composition for Easter as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. He derived it from his earlier Serenata, which had a similar celebratory mood. An unknown librettist solved the problem that Bach's congratulatory cantata was a dialogue of tenor and alto by retaining a dialogue in three movements, assigned to Hope and Fear. They represent different attitudes to the news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> of Jesus, which {{may be found in}} the two disciples, discussing the events on their walk, but also within the listener of the cantata.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> Apocalypse and <b>the</b> {{ascension}} <b>of</b> Weapon Omega {{to power}} {{as the new}} Apocalypse, he began resurrecting deceased Alpha mutants.

25|$|As a {{religious}} concept, {{it is used}} in two distinct respects: a belief in <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> individual souls that is current and ongoing (Christian idealism, realized eschatology), or else a belief in a singular <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. <b>The</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead is a standard eschatological belief in the Abrahamic religions.|$|R
50|$|I {{believe in}} the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, <b>the</b> communion <b>of</b> saints, <b>the</b> {{forgiveness}} <b>of</b> sins, <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, and the life everlasting.|$|R
5|$|From {{the end of}} {{the sixteenth}} century through the eighteenth century, a period known as Reformed orthodoxy, Reformed baptismal {{theology}} further developed the covenantal meaning of baptism. Theologians more carefully defined the sacramental union of baptism, or the relationship between the outward washing with that which it signifies. In the high orthodox period (middle to late seventeenth century), theologians such as Hermann Witsius expanded the covenantal meaning of baptism using analogies such as Noah's Ark and the crossing of the Red Sea, which carried the theological themes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> and eternal life. This period also saw the emergence of Reformed Baptists. Reformed Baptist theologians had much in common with the Reformed, but saw baptism {{as a sign of the}} baptized's fellowship with Christ rather than a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, and as a result did not baptize their children.|$|E
5|$|Many {{churches in}} the city (including the Church <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> or Holy Sepulchre) were burned, and {{numerous}} relics, including the True Cross, the Holy Lance, and the Holy Sponge, were carried off to the Persian capital Ctesiphon. The loss of these relics was thought by many Christian Byzantines to be a clear mark of divine displeasure. Some blamed the Jews for this misfortune and {{for the loss of}} Syria in general. There were reports that Jews helped the Persians capture certain cities and that the Jews tried to slaughter Christians in cities that the Persians had already conquered but were found and foiled from doing so. These reports are likely to be greatly exaggerated and the result of general hysteria.|$|E
5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resurrection,</b> and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E
500|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for {{the feast}} day {{were from the}} First letter to the Corinthians ("Christ is our Easter lamb"– [...] ) and from <b>the</b> Gospel <b>of</b> Mark (<b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Jesus– [...] ).|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION. <b>The</b> fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Risen Christ is {{the focal}} point which gives meaning to the Christian faith as a whole. Modern thought, while not denying <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection,</b> tends to confine it to its doctrinal or credal significance. In contrast, the early Christians were {{conscious}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Risen Lord and consequently <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> was a fact of living experience. As mere history it loses its moral significance; as mere faith it becomes vague belief in deathlessness, and undermines <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atonement. <b>The</b> <b>Resurrection</b> is both fact and faith...|$|R

5|$|The {{flagship}} {{temple in}} Guadalajara is pyramidal {{and has an}} innovative structure. The project began in 1983, when the Church's former temple built to accommodate 8,000 people was deemed insufficient to accommodate {{the growing number of}} people who attended various annual celebrations. Construction began on July 3, 1983 when Flores laid the cornerstone and lasted until August 1, 1992. The temple was completed largely by members of the Church. It is a notable architectural feature in Guadalajara in a working-class district {{on the outskirts of the}} city. Dozens of institutions, architects, and engineers were invited to submit proposals for a new temple. The pyramidal design submitted by Leopoldo Fernández Font was from the final shortlist of four proposals. Fernandez Font was later awarded an honorary degree for this and other structures. He said that one of his favorite works is the Temple <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection,</b> but that the temple of La Luz del Mundo seemed difficult to him. The temple was built to accommodate 12,000 worshipers and is used for annual ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|Between the 6th and 9th centuries, the {{iconography}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> in the Eastern Church {{was influenced by}} {{the iconography}} of the Transfiguration, given that there was no scriptural guidance for the depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> scene. In traditional Orthodox iconography the actual moment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> of Christ ("Anabasis") is never depicted, unlike the treatment of the raising of Lazarus. The icons do not depict the moment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection,</b> but show the Myrrhbearers, or the Harrowing of Hell. Usually the resurrected Christ is rescuing Adam and Eve, and often other figures, symbolizing the salvation of humanity. His posture is often very active, paralleling the Western depictions that show him climbing out of the tomb.|$|E

50|$|Getty's hymns, {{along with}} those written in {{collaboration}} with Kristyn Getty, cover many biblical and liturgical themes, including the Incarnation ("Joy Has Dawned"), the Crucifixion ("The Power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross") <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> ("See, What a Morning"), the Holy Spirit ("Holy Spirit, Living Breath of God"), Communion ("Behold the Lamb"), Benediction ("May <b>the</b> Peace <b>of</b> God"), and Missions ("Hear <b>the</b> Call <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom").|$|R
50|$|Also in 1844, he {{published}} a monthly magazine called Hierophant, devoted to <b>the</b> elucidation <b>of</b> scriptural prophecies, and he issued, in New York, a work entitled Anastasis, {{in which he}} opposed <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literal <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. Attacks upon this latter work, which attracted much attention, he answered in <b>The</b> <b>Resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Christ.|$|R

25|$|Depictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> {{continued}} into the Baroque period, with Rubens producing two paintings in 1611 and 1635 in which the triumphant figure of a resurrected Christ dominates the space. As in other religious subjects, after Tiepolo and his Spanish imitators, the momentum in producing religious art was lost. However, the depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> {{continues to be a}} major theme in Christian churches, e.g. as in the 19th-century Rosary Basilica in Lourdes, France.|$|E
