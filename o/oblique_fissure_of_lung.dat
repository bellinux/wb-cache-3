Hence, our main objective is to find out the variations in the <b>fissures</b> and lobes <b>of</b> the <b>lungs</b> as well as prevalence of the variation. Total 100 lungs were included in present study. The dissection was performed in the dissection hall of Anatomy Department, MGM Medical College, Kamothe, Navi Mumbai.

40|$|Abstract Pulmonary sclerosing {{hemangioma}} (PSH) {{is a rare}} {{benign tumor}} <b>of</b> the <b>lungs.</b> These tumors are composed of cuboidal surface cells and polygonal stromal cells and show four histological manifestations: hemorrhagic, papillary, solid, and sclerotic. PSH predominantly affects asymptomatic middle-aged women. The tumor often occurs at the intralobar site, and less commonly in the bronchus and mediastinum. PSH is easy to be misdiagnosed preoperatively. In this study, we present in detail the treatment procedures followed for two atypical cases of PSH. Case 1 was a 62 -year-old woman bearing a tumor for 15 [*]years. The tumor lesion {{was found to be}} located in the <b>oblique</b> <b>fissure</b> <b>of</b> the left <b>lung.</b> PSH was confirmed by surgical resection and postoperative pathological diagnosis. There was no sign of recurrence and metastasis 1. 5 [*]years after surgery. Case 2 was a 54 -year-old woman diagnosed with bilateral multiple nodules by physical examination. This patient was diagnosed with definite PSH through computed tomography-guided percutaneous lung biopsy. Surgical resection was not performed. The patient also showed no sign of enlarged tumor and metastasis after 2 [*]years of follow-up. Although PSH can be cured by surgical resection, the findings in our cases indicate that surgical resection need not be considered the preferred course of treatment. If PSH is diagnosed before surgery, the patients may survive while bearing the tumor. </p...|$|R

30|$|Intraoperatively, {{the right}} upper lung lobe had {{shifted to the}} {{posterior}} thoracic space; the middle lobe was compressed to the apex; and the lower lobe was distended in the hilar front. The right lung had rotated 90 ° counterclockwise toward the hilum. There was no color change of the pleura due to ischemia and congestion from the lung surface. There was about 1300  ml of serous pleural effusion, which was no malignant. The pulmonary vessels had been stretched but were not completely obstructed. There were no adhesions in thoracic space, but the <b>oblique</b> and horizontal <b>fissures</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lung</b> were incomplete by thickening of pleura due to inflammation.

40|$|The lungs are {{the very}} {{important}} organ for the human beings for respiration. It consists of five distinct lobes which are separated by three <b>fissures</b> (the boundaries <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> lobes are the areas containing fissures and having absence of bronchial trees).

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{proposed}} aim of {{the study}} was to elucidate the variations <b>of</b> the <b>lung</b> <b>fissures</b> and to correlate their importance in clinics. The study was conducted on 48 lung specimens, 30 right and 18 left, obtained from the cadavers of South Indian origin.

Among the left sided lungs, the <b>oblique</b> <b>fissure</b> was incomplete in 7 <b>lungs.</b> The presence <b>of</b> an accessory <b>fissure</b> was found in 5 lungs. With the development of radiological and endoscopic techniques and the advancement of pulmonary surgery, the knowledge of morphological variations <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> <b>fissures</b> is <b>of</b> utmost importance to clinicians to correctly locate the bronchopulmonary segment during pulmonary lobectomy, and for radiologists to correctly interpret X-rays and CT scans...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>fissures</b> in {{the normal}} lungs enhances uniform expansion and hence facili-tates more air intake.

40|$|Right lung {{is divided}} into upper (superior), middle and lower (Inferior) lobes by an oblique and a {{horizontal}} <b>fissure.</b> <b>Oblique</b> <b>fissure</b> passes spirally from posterior border to inferior border deep into the lung separating the lower lobe from upper and middle lobes. A short horizontal fissure passes horizontally forwards from the <b>oblique</b> <b>fissure</b> at midaxillary line to meet the anterior border at 4 th costochondral junction. This separates the upper lobe from the middle lobe. During routine dissection in 2010 - 11 undergraduate batch, we came across two cases <b>of</b> right <b>lungs</b> where an accessory fissure was extending horizontally backwards from the <b>oblique</b> <b>fissure</b> at mid axillary line towards the vertebral part of medial surface.

In contrast, when {{the standard}} oblique algorithm was used, the low-clarity rates decreased to 0 % and 2.7 % for the 16 -slice and 256 -slice CT scanners, respectively, because the oblique lines rotated {{in areas where the}} <b>oblique</b> <b>fissures</b> were oriented at steep angles, such as the lower segments <b>of</b> the right <b>oblique</b> <b>fissures</b> and all three segments <b>of</b> the left <b>oblique</b> <b>fissures.</b> As a consequence, the <b>oblique</b> <b>fissures</b> and slices formed right angles that are exhibited as clear or barely clear in the most oblique multiplanar reformation images where they otherwise would have had an unclear axial MIP five-line sign, as shown in Fig.  2. In addition, for those areas where the five-line sign was clearly presented by the axial algorithm, the clarity level was not compromised by minor angle changes in the oblique plane. Under the generation of the five-line sign during the MIP reconstruction <b>of</b> interlobular <b>fissures,</b> the fissures and scanning plane must form a suitable angle, which can be easily accomplished by angle adjustment via multiplanar reformation on the sagittal plane of the workstation.

Automated methods for segmenting several anatomy structures in chest CT are proposed: namely the lobe lungs, airway tree and pulmonary vessel tree. The airway and pulmonary vessel trees are segmented using a failure tracking and recovery algorithm. The algorithm checks intermediary results consistence, backtrack to a history position if a failure is detected. The quality of the result is improved while reducing the processing time even for subjects with lung diseases. The pulmonary vessels are segmented through the same algorithm with different seed points. The seed for the airway tree segmentation is within the tracheal tube, and the seed for the pulmonary vessels segmentation is within the heart. The algorithm is tested with CT images acquired from four distinct types of subjects: healthy, idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The main bronchi are found in the segmented airway and the associated lung lobes are determined. Combining the segmented lung lobes and the diffuse lung diseases classification, it is possible to quantify how much and where each lobe is injured. The results were compared with a conventional 3 D region growing algorithm and commercial systems.

An available computer tool was used to aid in an objective and efficient quantification <b>of</b> <b>fissure</b> integrity. The correlations between fissure integrity, and pulmonary functions (e. g., FEV 1, and FEV 1 /FVC) and COPD severity were assessed using Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficients, respectively. Results For the five sub-groups ranging from non-COPD to GOLD-IV, the average integrities <b>of</b> the right <b>oblique</b> <b>fissure</b> (ROF) were 81. 8 %, 82. 4 %, 81. 8 %, 82. 8 %, and 80. 2 %, respectively; the average integrities of the right horizontal fissure (RHF) were 62. 6 %, 61. 8 %, 62. 1 %, 62. 2 %, and 62. 3 %, respectively; the average integrities <b>of</b> the left <b>oblique</b> <b>fissure</b> (LOF) were 82. 0 %, 83. 2 %, 81. 7 %, 82. 0 %, and 78. 4 %, respectively; and the average integrities <b>of</b> all <b>fissures</b> in the entire lung were 78. 0 %, 78. 6 %, 78. 1 %, 78. 5 %, and 76. 4 %, respectively. Their Pearson correlation coefficients with FEV 1 and FE 1 /FVC range from 0. 027 to 0. 248 with p values larger than 0. 05. Their Spearman correlation coefficients with COPD severity except GOLD-IV range from − 0. 013 to − 0. 073 with p values larger than 0. 08. Conclusion There is no significant difference in fissure integrity for patients with different levels of disease severity, suggesting that the development of COPD does not change the completeness <b>of</b> pulmonary <b>fissures</b> and incomplete fissures alone may not contribute to the collateral ventilation...|$|R

A dataset consisting of 573 CT exams acquired on different subjects was collected from a COPD study. According to the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) criteria, these subjects (examinations) were classified into five different subgroups, namely non-COPD (222 subjects), GOLD-I (83 subjects), GOLD-II (141 subjects), GOLD-III (63 subjects), and GOLD-IV (64 subjects), in terms of disease severity.
