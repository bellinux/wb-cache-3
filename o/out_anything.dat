5|$|In the , Palpatine was {{voiced by}} Ian Abercrombie from 2008 {{to his death}} in 2012, and by Tim Curry from 2012 to 2014. In the series, Palpatine {{continues}} to serve as Supreme Chancellor while his Sith identity remains behind the scenes via holograms. In the second season, Sidious hires bounty hunter Cad Bane to infiltrate the Jedi Temple and steal a holocron. He then takes a valuable Kyber memory crystal that contains the names of thousands of Force-sensitive younglings - {{the future of the}} Jedi Order - from around the galaxy. The final stage of the plot: to bring four Force-sensitive children to Sidious's secret facility on Mustafar. Anakin and Ahsoka again foil the plot, but Bane escapes and all evidence of Sidious' involvement is lost. In the fifth season, Sidious personally travels to the planet Mandalore to confront his former apprentice Darth Maul after becoming leader of Death Watch, killing Savage Opress before torturing Maul with the intent to make use of him. In the final season, Sidious goes to lengths to conceal the full nature of his plan from the Jedi by attempting to silence the Clone Trooper Fives when he learns of Order 66 and having Dooku wipe <b>out</b> <b>anything</b> tied to Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas.|$|E
5|$|The Lennons {{were married}} on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool. Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance, as was their manager, Brian Epstein, who was best man; no parents were there. The wedding was farcical, because {{as soon as}} the {{ceremony}} began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a jackhammer which drowned <b>out</b> <b>anything</b> the registrar, Lennon, or Powell said. When the registrar asked for the groom to step forward, Harrison stepped forward instead. With no photographs or flowers the wedding party celebrated afterwards, at Epstein's invitation, in Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square, which was the same restaurant where Lennon's parents, Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon, had celebrated their marriage in 1938. Lennon was 21 years old, and Powell 22. The newlyweds had no honeymoon, as Lennon had to play an engagement at the Riverpark Ballroom in Chester the same night, although they did travel to the Hotel George V in Paris, for a belated honeymoon on 16 September, but were accompanied by Epstein, even though he had not been invited to join them.|$|E

Bin Laden's December 2004 message was much more vehement than usual in this speech, lasting over an hour.|$|E

He describes details of his life so {{that she will be}} reminded of her husband. He calls her attention to the improbably negative conditions of the house. He drops clues, gradually leading her to the truth, but she seems to block <b>out</b> <b>anything</b> that will cause recognition. He finally tells the truth straight out. She gets angry and calls him a liar. Because she does not believe in an afterlife, she finds it impossible that he could be her dead husband.|$|E
500|$|One filmed {{scene from}} [...] "The Head and the Hair" [...] was cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scene was {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season 1 DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the scene, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) is visibly upset that someone added paper in the regular garbage and demands to know who did it, as NBC recycles. Jack and Kenneth show up. Jack apologizes for throwing the paper in the regular garbage, which results in Pete telling him to go through the garbage by hand and [...] "fish <b>out</b> <b>anything</b> that's recyclable", as Jack is dressed as a page, in which he is participating on [...] "Bottoms Up" [...] day.|$|E
500|$|CMX {{came under}} {{a great deal}} of {{criticism}} for its edits from readers. These edits included the length and breadth of the book, censoring <b>out</b> <b>anything</b> they felt was questionable for a teen audience such as covering up or removing nudity, fanservice, and sexual innuendo as well as a removal of an omake chapter. This was done by a brand whose promotional material asserts that it offers [...] "pure manga [...] 100% the way the original Japanese creators want you to see it." [...] One of grievances made against CMX is that the edits are not only severe, but very noticeable. One review states it is [...] "possibly the most heavily censored title {{in the history of the}} North American manga industry." ...|$|E

500|$|Returning to Los Alamos, Feynman [...] was put {{in charge}} of the group {{responsible}} for the theoretical work and calculations on the proposed uranium hydride bomb, which ultimately proved to be infeasible. He was sought out by physicist Niels Bohr for one-on-one discussions. He later discovered the reason: most of the other physicists were too much in awe of Bohr to argue with him. Feynman had no such inhibitions, vigorously pointing <b>out</b> <b>anything</b> he considered to be flawed in Bohr's thinking. He said he felt as much respect for Bohr as anyone else, but once anyone got him talking about physics, he would become so focused he forgot about social niceties. Perhaps because of this, Bohr never warmed to Feynman.|$|E
500|$|... "Her Majesty" [...] was {{recorded}} by McCartney on 2 July {{when he arrived}} {{before the rest of}} the group at Abbey Road. It was included in a rough mix of the side two medley, appearing between [...] "Mean Mr. Mustard" [...] and [...] "Polythene Pam". McCartney disliked the way the medley sounded when it included [...] "Her Majesty", so he asked for it to be cut. The second engineer, John Kurlander, had been instructed not to throw <b>out</b> <b>anything,</b> so after McCartney left, he attached the track to the end of the master tape after 20seconds of silence. The tape box bore an instruction to leave [...] "Her Majesty" [...] off the final product, but the next day when mastering engineer Malcolm Davies received the tape, he (also trained not to throw anything away) cut a playback lacquer of the whole sequence, including [...] "Her Majesty". The Beatles liked this effect and included it on the album.|$|E
500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest {{into the}} death of the Princess, on 13 February 2008, {{speaking}} by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he [...] "could not remember specifically" [...] whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milošević, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training. On being told that no MI6 file on Henri Paul had been found, Tomlinson said that it [...] "would be absurd after 17 years to say I can positively disagree with it, but... I do not think the fact that they did not manage to find a file rules <b>out</b> <b>anything</b> either". He said he believed MI6 had an informant at the Paris Ritz but he could not be certain that this person was necessarily Henri Paul.|$|E

500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song had kind {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave marching orders of [...] "Take <b>out</b> <b>anything</b> you want, but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, we listened to the sample {{together}} and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample is so good.|$|E
500|$|Scott Meslow for Vulture {{scored the}} episode four stars out of five, saying {{it makes the}} season's stakes clear by being an origin story for both Ghost Rider and Morrow, and praising the series for {{focusing}} on those elements {{rather than trying to}} closely tie-in with Doctor Strange as it did in previous seasons. Meslow also said that Gabe Reyes was [...] "a welcome addition, successfully recognizing and calling <b>out</b> <b>anything</b> that seems like bullshit." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick at ScreenCrush said the episode was easily the best of the season so far, though he was still [...] "on the fence as to whether Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has the clearest sense of where Season 4 is going". Fitzpatrick noted that Lucy had [...] "inarguably [...] the weakest element" [...] of the season and was not surprised with the Morrow reveal, and questioned the series' stance on the morality of the Ghost Rider, feeling that it should have been made more clear. He added that the episode [...] "seemed to position itself a bit better with regard to coming episodes".|$|E
500|$|Christopher Thale {{writes in}} the Encyclopedia of Chicago that lacking {{credible}} evidence regarding the bombing, [...] "...the prosecution focused on the writings and speeches of the defendants." [...] He further notes that the conspiracy charge was legally unprecedented, the Judge was [...] "partisan," [...] and all the jurors admitted prejudice against the defendants. Historian Carl Smith writes, [...] "The visceral feelings of fear and anger surrounding the trial ruled <b>out</b> <b>anything</b> but the pretense of justice right from the outset." [...] Smith notes that scholars have long considered the trial a [...] "notorious" [...] "miscarriage of justice." [...] In a review somewhat more critical of the defendants, historian Jon Teaford concludes that [...] "he tragedy of Haymarket is the American justice system did not protect the damn fools who most needed that protection... It is the damn fools who talk too much and too wildly who are {{most in need of}} protection from the state." [...] Historian Timothy Messer-Kruse revisited the digitized trial transcript and argued that the proceedings were fair for their time, a challenge to the historical consensus that the trial was a travesty.|$|E

500|$|Let Me In was {{not well}} {{received}} by all critics. Some disputed Reeves' claims {{that he was not}} remaking the film but re-adapting the book, criticizing it for being too similar to the Swedish film. Josh Tyler wrote [...] "The movie he’s made is absolutely a direct remake of the 2008 film, the two are so similar that it’s almost impossible to differentiate between them." [...] In a similar vein, Jamie S. Rich noted that while there was plenty of content in the original novel that the Swedish film omitted, [...] "Reeves hasn't really ferreted <b>out</b> <b>anything</b> new; on the contrary, there is actually less plot in Let Me In than in the Alfredson version." [...] Beth Accomando wrote, [...] "How Reeves can take the credit 'written and directed by Matt Reeves' seems almost laughable when you note how similar the script and the direction are to the original." [...] In comparing the two films, she opined that the remake [...] "makes obvious all that the original film made subtle and does so with less complexity." [...] Mark Kermode called it [...] "the most utterly redundant remake of the year".|$|E
