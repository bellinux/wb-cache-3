5|$|Rules of Engagement: A {{major issue}} for the contingents {{concerned}} Rules <b>of</b> <b>Engagement</b> (ROE) and Orders for Opening Fire (OFOF).

5|$|The four NATO {{aircraft}} {{shot down}} during Operation Deny Flight also forced NATO members to consider new defensive measures for their aircraft, including increased stealth capabilities. Deny Flight also demonstrated {{the necessity of}} better communications and integration among forces operating together, and led to some calls for technical training of UN personnel to work with NATO military systems. Finally, the rules <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> established under Deny Flight also {{played an important role}} in shaping the rules <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> for later NATO operations other than war, including Operation Joint Endeavor, and even NATO operations in Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|In June, William Sullivan was {{replaced}} as ambassador by G.

5|$|A new offer {{had arrived}} for Pei from the Chinese {{government}} in 1982. With {{an eye toward}} the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for a new wave <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> {{with the outside world}} and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1968, No.79 Squadron {{no longer}} had a clear role at Ubon. The USAF had {{sufficient}} fighters based in Thailand to defend the country and was reluctant to use the Australian fighters—which were now regarded as obsolete—to intercept potentially hostile aircraft, as the squadron's rules <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> did not allow it to pursue contacts that left Thai airspace. As a result, the Australian military's chiefs of staff determined that the RAAF presence in Thailand had outlived its political and military usefulness and decided to withdraw the squadron without replacement. No.79 Squadron was taken off alert status on 26July and disbanded {{at the end of the}} month. On 31March 2011 it received a battle honour for its deployment to Ubon between May 1962 and August 1968.|$|E
5|$|Champollion married Rosine Blanc (17941871) in 1818 {{after four}} years <b>of</b> <b>engagement,</b> they had one {{daughter}}, Zoraïde Chéronnet-Champollion (182489). Rosine {{was the daughter of}} a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first her father did not approve of the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met, but with his increasing reputation he eventually agreed. Originally Jacques-Joseph did not approve of his brother's marriage either, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away from his family for months or even years at a time, while traveling to Paris, to Italy, and to Egypt. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an ode to Champollion's work at a celebration in his honor, and the two exchanged letters for a while, but an affair never developed.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of Shiller in the 2007 {{election}} largely {{focused on}} the lack of communication with ward residents, failure to obtain input from residents for zoning changes in the ward, her lack of involvement in community policing meetings, and the many years of blighted retail in the ward. Some critics charged that Shiller was frustrating developers while using the Wilson Yard project to maintain her political base. In 2007, Shiller defeated social worker James Cappleman with 53% of the vote. In October, 2007, Shiller became chair of the City Council's Human Relations Committee. In 2009, Shiller was criticized by Uptown residents for her perceived lack <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> in address crime in the neighborhood, including a string of violent robberies in nearby Lakeview that attracted the attention of the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, and local TV news. Police interviewed said interventions from Shiller and her staff facilitated the protection of gang members from policing activity, allegedly for gaining voter base, {{according to a report in}} Chicago Magazine.|$|E

5|$|Deceptive {{markings}} on helicopters further complicated matters for NATO pilots. Many of the combatants painted their helicopters {{to look like}} those of organizations that the UN's Zagreb Flight Coordination Center had authorized to fly in restricted space. For example, {{the army of the}} Republika Srpska often painted a Red Cross logo on their helicopters, and Croatian helicopters were given markings similar to those of UN humanitarian aid helicopters. The questionable identity of these helicopters became particularly problematic after the Black Hawk Incident in Iraq, because NATO pilots became more reluctant to engage potential belligerents without clear identification. As a result of the rules <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> and difficulties in aircraft identification, NATO forces proved unable to stop most unauthorized helicopter flights, resulting in a documented total of 5711 unauthorized flights during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|In October 1966, strike force F-105 Thunderchiefs were {{equipped}} with QRC-160 radar jamming pods whose effectiveness virtually ended their losses to surface-to-air missiles. As a result, SAM attacks {{shifted to the}} Phantoms, unprotected because of a shortage of pods. To protect the F-4s, rules <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> that allowed the MiGCAP to escort the strike force {{in and out of}} the target area were revised in December to restrict MiGCAP penetration to the edge of SAM coverage. MiG interceptions increased as a result, primarily by MiG-21s using high-speed hit-and-run tactics against bomb-laden F-105 formations, and although only two bombers had been lost, the threat to the force was perceived as serious.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{understood}} {{its mandate}} under the Solemn League and Covenant {{to have been}} fulfilled on 14April 1648 when it delivered the scripture citations to Parliament, and the Scottish Commissioners had already left {{by the end of}} 1647. The Assembly continued to meet primarily for the purpose of examination of ministers for ordination. Most of the divines were unhappy with the republican Commonwealth that emerged after Colonel Pride's Purge of the Long Parliament in 1648. As a result, a majority stopped attending rather than agree to the oath <b>of</b> <b>Engagement</b> to the Commonwealth that was imposed in 1649. Newspapers continued to report on the meetings of the Assembly as late as March 1653.
