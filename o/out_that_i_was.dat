500|$|Matthew West's album, Something to Say, was {{released}} on January 15, 2008. It reached No. 8 on Billboard's Top Christian albums chart, and peaked at No. 159 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it his first Billboard 200 album [...] It was produced by Brown Bannister, Ed Cash, and Christopher Stevens. West {{said in an interview}} that all of the album's songs had already been written and the title [...] "Something to Say" [...] had already been decided [...] "months before I found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to have nothing to say." [...] The first radio single released from the album was [...] "You Are Everything". In March 2008, the song reached No. 1 on R's Christian AC chart. [...] "Something to Say", the album's title track, was also released to radio, receiving airplay in June 2008.|$|E
500|$|In January 1980, Michael Stipe met Peter Buck in Wuxtry Records, the Athens {{record store}} where Buck worked. The pair {{discovered}} that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and The Velvet Underground. Stipe said, [...] "It turns <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> buying all the records that [...] was saving for himself." [...] Stipe and Buck soon met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that [...] "there was never any grand plan behind any of it". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing and played its first show on April 5, 1980, at a friend's birthday party held in a converted Episcopal church in Athens. After considering names like [...] "Twisted Kites", [...] "Cans of Piss", and [...] "Negro Wives", the band settled on [...] "R.E.M." [...] (which stands for the stage of sleep called rapid eye movement), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.|$|E
2500|$|May 1994 {{also saw}} the release of Mayhem's album De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, which has Euronymous on {{electric}} guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar. Before the release, Euronymous' family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said [...] "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim {{were on the same}} record. I put word <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> re-recording the bass parts, but I never did." ...|$|E

2500|$|When my {{grandmother}} found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> playing jazz {{in one of}} the sporting houses in the District, she told me that I had disgraced the family and forbade me to live at the house.... She told me that devil music would surely bring about my downfall, but I just couldn't put it behind me. The cornetist Rex Stewart recalled that Morton had chosen [...] "the nom de plume 'Morton' to protect his family from disgrace if he was identified as a whorehouse 'professor'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Loos, Emerson {{and fellow}} writer Frances Marion {{migrated}} to New York as a group, Loos and Emerson sharing a leased mansion in Great Neck, Long Island. Loos desperately wanted Marion as chaperone, as {{she found herself}} attracted to Emerson. He would readily admit that he [...] "had never been, nor could be, faithful to any one female." [...] Loos convinced herself that he would {{see that she was}} different from all his other girls, and that behind his outwardly dull exterior was a great mind. She would be wrong on both counts. She would later write: [...] "I had set my sights on a man of brains, to whom I could look up", she lamented, [...] "but what a terrible let down it would be to find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> smarter than he was." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1946, the twice married Pasternak met Olga Ivinskaya, a 34 {{year old}} single mother {{employed}} by Novy Mir. Deeply moved by her resemblance {{to his first}} love Ida Vysotskaya, Pasternak gave Ivinskaya several volumes of his poetry and literary translations. Although Pasternak never left his wife Zinaida, he started an extramarital relationship with Ivinskaya that would last {{for the remainder of}} Pasternak's life. Ivinskaya later recalled, [...] "He phoned almost every day and, instinctively fearing to meet or talk with him, yet dying of happiness, I would stammer <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> [...] "busy today." [...] But almost every afternoon, toward the end of working hours, he came in person to the office and often walked with me through the streets, boulevards, and squares all the way home to Potapov Street. 'Shall I make you a present of this square?' he would ask." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{appreciate}} your confidence," [...] he said, {{and the girl}} noticed that his voice was a trifle hoarse. [...] "Still, <b>I</b> must point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> almost a stranger to Mr. Devine and you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} if you were trying to make <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> disagreeable," [...] she murmured. [...] "Am I? You will make me afraid to open my mouth presently. I shall end by believing <b>I</b> <b>am</b> no good." ...|$|R
60|$|Wife.--But I'll put off {{our usual}} lodgings at Hampstead, and give <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> gone {{to spend the}} summer in Bedfordshire, at my aunt's, where every body knows I used to go sometimes; they can't come after me thither.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I got to {{thinking}} about some one else at fust it was only not thinking about him--I was ashamed. Then I tried to make <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too young in the fust place, to know whether I really ca'ed for any one in the right way; but after I made <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> I couldn't feel exactly easy--and I've been wanting to ask you, Miss Milray--" ...|$|E
60|$|Mameena never {{waited for}} the end of the sentence, but, sobbing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> false and cruel, she turned and {{departed}} swiftly. Oh! little did I foresee how and where we should meet again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, but don't you see,' he said, ruefully, 'what a mess I'm in? If {{they find}} <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the Pav. {{at the time}} when the cups were bagged, how on earth am I to prove I didn't take them myself?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell you," [...] she cried, half quelled by his derision, [...] "that <b>I</b> {{have found}} <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not fit for it,--that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a failure and a disgrace; {{and you had}} no right to expect me to be {{anything}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{there is}} one {{attitude}} more odious to me than any other of the many attitudes of [...] "knowingness," [...] it is that air of lofty superiority to the vulgar. She will soon find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a very commonplace woman.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you cant}} make <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> acting meanly, Marian. Why, I have {{everything}} {{to lose by}} giving her up. There is her money, and I suppose I must prepare for a row with the family; unless the match could be dropped quietly. Eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have much}} the same as said so," [...] he whined. [...] "Because I was forced to go home for ever so short a time, having {{forgotten}} to do what my mother bade me, you immediately cried <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a traitor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{very soon}} {{find out whether}} I'm a fool or not! I mean it! Do you think I'd stay here one second after I found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{injuring}} you? At least I have enough sense of justice not to do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{now we see}} the {{difference}}," [...] {{said the}} judicious Mrs Boyce. [...] "I often said that dear Mrs Dale was wrong, and it turns <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> right. It will make no difference to me, as regards calling on them {{and that sort of}} thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "... if {{you will}} make an appointment, when we can discuss the matter without prejudice. Get those typed, Miss Milliken. Have a cigar, Sam. Miss Milliken, tell Peters as you go <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{occupied}} with a conference and can see nobody for half an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean to go {{the round}} of all the places near London--say, within ten miles. I shall stay from a week to a {{fortnight}} in each, take a quiet lodging, give <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{on the lookout for}} a small house with a garden, and get to talk with people of all kinds." ...|$|R
6000|$|BURGE [interrupting him forcibly] Lubin: {{has this}} stupendously {{important}} communication which Professor Barnabas has just made to us: a communication for which <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> indebted to him {{all my life}} long: has this, I say, no deeper effect on you than to set you pulling my leg by trying to make <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an infidel? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's prejudice," [...] she objected, {{shaking her}} head. [...] "Nowadays {{there are few}} things a woman can't do. To tell you the truth, my new {{interest}} in life started three years ago, when Uncle Theodore found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to Rome for the winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just as {{authors are}} {{told not to}} read the criticisms;--but I never would believe any author {{who told me that}} he didn't read what was said about him. I wonder when the man found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> good-natured. He wouldn't find me good-natured if I could get hold of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I said, 'One Clowes is luxury, two excess.' I pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just on {{the verge}} of {{becoming}} rather a blood at Wrykyn, and that I didn't want the work of years spoiled by a brother who would think it a rag to tell fellows who respected and admired me----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cruel! What have I done? Tell me what cruelty. Have I beat you? Have you <b>been</b> starved? Have <b>I</b> {{not asked}} and implored your assistance,--only to be refused? The {{fact is that}} your father and you have found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a rich man, {{and you want to}} be rid of me. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> true or false?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{it should}} turn <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> mistaken," [...] Andrew said stiffly, [...] "I should {{be glad to}} ask your pardons, but from my present {{information}} I can only say I do not care to extend the hospitality of my house to Major Forrest, nor do I consider him a fit associate, madam, {{for you and your}} step-daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was a mistake, and Mr. Sparr lost {{as much as}} he got. Yes, I {{think those}} boys guilty, and in the end you will find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> right," [...] added Job Haskers as he went off, smiling grimly to himself, {{as if it was a}} {{pleasure}} to him to have the boys thus accused.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Suddenly a {{clump of}} Saxons ran out upon me and, seeing a Norman alone, would have killed me, but my Saxon cried <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> his prisoner, and beat them off. Thus, see you, he saved my life. He put me on my horse and led me through the woods ten long miles to this valley.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was lying}} lifeless {{in the street}} from starvation," [...] said Romola. [...] "I revived him with bread and wine. I brought him to our door, {{but he refused to}} come in. Then I gave him some money, and he went away without telling me anything. But he had found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> your wife. Who is he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, that's {{as people}} fancy. Bumppo has no lofty sound, I admit; and yet men have bumped {{through the world}} with it. I did not go by this name, howsoever, very long; for the Delawares soon found out, or thought they found <b>out,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not given to lying, and they called me, firstly, 'Straight-tongue.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What, {{in being}} laughed at by you, Miss Oriel, for {{pretending to be}} a man, when you choose to make <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only a boy?

6000|$|... "Mr. Speaker, I {{have heard}} with {{profound}} attention and entire approval {{the explanation of}} the honourable member, and wish to offer a few remarks on my own behalf. <b>I,</b> too, have <b>been</b> foully calumniated by our ancient enemy, the Infamous Falsehood, and I wish to point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> made of the fur of the Mustela maculata, which is dirty from birth." ...|$|R
