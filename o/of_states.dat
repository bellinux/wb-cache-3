5|$|Any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} may be placed into rectangular form, after which its transition rule may be factored into {{the action of}} an idempotent semicentral bigroupoid (a reversible rule for which regions of cells with a single state value change only at their boundaries) together with a permutation on the set <b>of</b> <b>states.</b> The first-order invariants for the idempotent lifting of the automaton rule (the modified rule formed by omitting the permutation) necessarily behave like the ones for a rectangular band: they have a basis of invariants that flow either leftwards or rightwards at a constant rate without interaction. The first-order invariants for the overall automaton are then exactly the invariants for the idempotent lifting that give equal weight to every pair <b>of</b> <b>states</b> that {{belong to the same}} orbit of the permutation. However, the permutation <b>of</b> <b>states</b> in the rule may cause these invariants to behave differently from in the idempotent lifting, flowing non-uniformly and with interactions.|$|E

For example, federal law provided resources like research, training, grants to improve state and local programs, and a conference procedure to convene agencies and polluters under the guidance of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Direct regulations—such as, for example, setting emissions standards—were left to states.|$|E

5000|$|The Parliamentary Under-Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for Scotland, often {{referred}} to as Under-Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for Scotland is a junior ministerial post (of Parliamentary Under Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> rank) in the United Kingdom government, supporting the Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for Scotland. The post was first established as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health for Scotland in 1919, before becoming the Parliamentary Under-Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for Scotland in 1926. Additional Parliamentary Under-Secretary posts were added in 1940 and 1951 and a Minister <b>of</b> <b>State</b> post was established in 1951.

5|$|As Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Schuman was {{instrumental}} in turning French policy away from the Gaullist policy of permanent occupation or control of parts of German territory such as the Ruhr or the Saar. Despite stiff ultra-nationalist, Gaullist and communist opposition, the French Assembly voted a number of resolutions in favour of his new policy of integrating Germany into a community. The International Authority for the Ruhr changed in consequence. Schuman's guiding principles were moral, based on the equality <b>of</b> <b>states</b> (international democracy), not the power politics of domination.|$|E
