It marks a major stylistic advance in contemporary portraiture; the girl is set in an airy, three-dimensional, realistic setting, and stares out at the viewer with a complicated expression that is reserved, yet intelligent and alert.|$|E
5|$|The Old Debauchees, {{originally}} titled The Despairing Debauchee, {{appeared with}} The Covent-Garden Tragedy on 1 June 1732. The play ran for six nights {{and was later}} paired with The Mock Doctor. The play was later revived to attack Catholics during the disputes with the Stuarts between 1745 and 1746. The play alludes to the 1731 trial of Father Girard, a Jesuit tried for using magic during an attempted seduction/rape <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl.</b> The nature of the attacks against Catholicism within the play undermines the overall humour of the play.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{structure}} of the Earthsea novels is in many ways typical of fantasy, it has been described as subverting the tropes of this genre. The protagonists of her stories, with the exception of Tenar, were all dark-skinned, in comparison to the white-skinned heroes more traditionally used.

5|$|In ancient Egypt, cats were sacred animals, {{with the}} goddess Bastet often {{depicted}} in cat form, sometimes {{taking on the}} war-like aspect of a lioness. The Romans are often credited with introducing the domestic cat from Egypt to Europe; in Roman Aquitaine, a first- or second-century engraving <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> holding a cat {{is one of two}} earliest depictions of the Roman domesticated cat. However, cats possibly were already kept in Europe prior to the Roman Empire, as they may have been present in Britain in the late Iron Age.
