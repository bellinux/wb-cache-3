5|$|After the {{problems}} with Hubble's mirror were discovered, the first servicing mission assumed greater importance, as the astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics. The seven astronauts for the mission were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools.

5|$|Between 1954 and 1960, {{the student}} body at New England more than doubled to over 500 {{students}} with a corresponding increase in staff and faculty, forcing the school to erect temporary, weatherboard huts to accommodate its expanded facilities and classrooms. In 1958, the university received £900,000 in government grants for facilities improvements and Madgwick presided over the planning and construction of <b>over</b> <b>ten</b> permanent buildings on the main campus, {{some of which were}} completed after Madgwick retired in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of Pluto's moon Charon radically changed this picture. By measuring Charon's orbital period, astronomers could accurately calculate Pluto's mass for the first time, which they found to be much smaller than expected. Pluto's mass was roughly one twenty-fifth of Mercury's, making it by far the smallest planet, smaller even than the Earth's Moon, although it was still <b>over</b> <b>ten</b> times as massive as the largest asteroid, Ceres.|$|E

40|$|Monolayers of the {{phospholipid}} dimyristoyl {{phosphatidic acid}} {{on the surface}} of water have been studied by a combination of the new techniques of synchrotron x-ray diffraction and fluorescence microscopy with classical surface pressure data. The pressure vs. area isotherm changes slope at the surface pressures pi c and pi s. The optical technique demonstrates that between pi c and pi s the fluid phase coexists with a denser "gel" phase. Electron diffraction data have shown that the gel phase has bond orientational order <b>over</b> <b>tens</b> of micrometers. However, the x-ray data demonstrate that positional correlations extend only <b>over</b> <b>tens</b> of angstroms. Thus, the gel phase is not crystalline. Above pi s a solid phase is formed with a positional correlation range that is eight times longer for the chemically purest films...|$|R
5|$|King {{stated that}} black Americans, {{as well as}} other {{disadvantaged}} Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50billion <b>over</b> <b>ten</b> years to all disadvantaged groups.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, the mallard {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is {{because it has a}} large range–more than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)–and because its {{population}} is increasing, rather than declining by 30% <b>over</b> <b>ten</b> years or three generations and thus is not warranted a vulnerable rating. Also, the population size of the mallard is very large.|$|E
5|$|Solaris is not {{the only}} work of Lem's to be filmed. <b>Over</b> <b>ten</b> film and {{television}} adaptations of his work exist, such as adaptations of The Astronauts (First Spaceship on Venus, 1960) and The Magellan Nebula (Ikarie XB-1, 1963). Lem himself was, however, critical of most of the screen adaptations, with the sole exception of Przekładaniec in 1968 by Andrzej Wajda. More recently, in 2013, the Israeli–Polish co-production The Congress was released, inspired by Lem's novel The Futurological Congress.|$|E
