40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>solar</b> <b>reflectors</b> are {{devices that}} combine high {{reflection}} for visible wavelengths {{with a strong}} emissivity in the infrared. Compared to the conventional rigid quartz tiles used on spacecraft since the 1960 s, thin-film solutions can offer a significant advantage in weight, assembly, and launch costs. Here, we present a metasurface-based approach using an Al-doped ZnO (AZO) transparent conducting oxide as infrared plasmonic material. The AZO is patterned into a metasurface to achieve broad plasmonic resonances with an enhanced absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the thermal infrared. In the visible range, the transparent conducting oxide provides low losses for solar radiation, while intrinsic absorption losses in the ultraviolet range are effectively suppressed using a multilayer reflecting coating. The addition of high-emissivity layers to the stack eventually results in comparable emissivity values to the thin plasmonic device, thus defining {{a window of opportunity}} for plasmonic absorption as a design strategy for ultrathin devices. The optimized experimental structure achieves solar absorptance (Î±) of 0. 16 and thermal emissivity (Îµ) of 0. 79.

The influence of the deposition parameters (argon and oxygen flow rates, and substrate temperature) and effect of coating thickness on the optical, electrical, structural and microstructural properties of ITO thin films deposited on FEP was investigated. The thickness of the ITO coatings was varied from 10 to 180 nm. The optimized ITO coating (10 nm thick) exhibited high IR emittance (79 %) on FEP substrate with high average solar transmittance (94 %) and moderate sheet resistance (3 kÎ©/sq.). We also investigated in detail the angular dependence of reflectance as well as haze factor of thin ITO coatings. Our results suggest that 10 nm thick ITO coating exhibits an average haze factor of 8. 6 %. The high value of IR emittance, moderate sheet resistance and high solar transmittance along with low haze factor indicate the suitability of ITO thin films on FEP substrates as flexible <b>optical</b> <b>solar</b> <b>reflector</b> for space applications...|$|E
40|$|The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) {{project had}} a rapid {{development}} schedule starting with project conception in spring of 2004, instrument and launch vehicle selection late in 2005 and then launch in early 2009. The lunar thermal environment {{is one of}} the harshest in our solar system with the heavy infrared loading of the moon due to low albedo, lack of lunar atmosphere, and low effective regolith conduction. This set of constraints required a thermal design which maximized performance (minimized radiator area and cold control heater power) and minimized thermal hardware build at the orbiter level (blanketing, and heater service). The orbiter design located most of the avionics on an isothermalized heat pipe panel called the IsoThermal Panel (ITP). The ITP was coupled by dual bore heat pipes to an <b>Optical</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>Reflector</b> (OSR) covered heat pipe radiator. By coupling all of the avionics to one system, the hardware was simplified. The seven instruments were mainly heritage instruments which resulted in their desired radiators being located by their heritage design. This minimized instrument redesigns and therefore allowed them to be delivered earlier, though it resulted in a more complex orbiter level blanket and heater service design. Three of the instruments were mounted on a tight pointing M 55 J optical bench that needed to be covered in heaters to maintain pointing. Two were mounted to spacecraft controlled radiators. One was mounted to the ITP Dual Bores. The last was mounted directly to the bus structure on the moon facing panel. The propulsion system utilized four- 20 pound insertion thrusters and eight- 5 pound attitude control thrusters (ACS) in addition to 1000 kg of fuel in two large tanks. The propulsion system had a heater cylinder and a heated mounting deck for the insertion thrusters which coupled most of the propulsion design together simplifying the heater design. The High Gain Antenna System (HGAS) and Solar Array System (SAS) used dual axis actuator gimbal systems. HGAS required additional boom heaters to cool the approximately 10 W of RF losses thru the rotary joints and wave guides from the 40 W Ka system. By design this module needed a fair amount of heater, blanketing, and radiator complexity. The SAS system required a separate cable wrap radiator to help cool the Solar Array harness which dissipated 30 W thru the actuators and cable wraps. This module also was complex...|$|E

40|$|Radiators {{are used}} to reject energy from space {{vehicles}} through radiant heat transfer. They are typically the largest component in a vehicle's thermal control system and can have a large impact on the vehicle design and operation. NASA s current vision for exploration dictates that radiators for a Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), a Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM), and a lunar base {{will need to be}} developed.

Important conclusions from this study, which includes two parallel tests, are as follows: (1) All of the GaAs solar cells with multilayer-coated coverslides display UV degradation. The laboratory data, extrapolated to 10 years in orbit, point to a significant loss mechanism {{from a combination of}} absorption and a reduction in optical match in such coatings from this portion of the space environment; (2) The effects of contamination in a vacuum system, on the measured degradation in solar-cell short-circuit current during a UV test, depend upon the type of coverslide coatings present on the coverslide surfaces. This has implications for both coated coverslides and <b>optical</b> <b>solar</b> <b>reflectors</b> (OSR's) in space; and (3) Because of the observed trends in this test and uncertainties in the extrapolation of data for multilayer coated coverslides, the use of any multilayer-coated coverslides for extended missions (greater than 1 year) cannot be recommended without prior flight testing...|$|R

A fraction of the volatile materials were collected on 25 C <b>solar</b> cells, <b>optical</b> <b>solar</b> <b>reflectors</b> (OSR's) or aluminized Mylar. The contaminated surfaces were exposed to 26 equivalent sun hours of simulated solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Measurements of contamination deposit mass, structure, reflectance and effects on solar cell power output were made before and after UV irradiation. Standard total mass loss - volatile condensible materials (TML - VCM) tests were also performed. A 2500 A thick contaminant layer produced by EPDM rubber motor-case insulation outgassing increased the solar absorptance of the OSR's from 0. 07 to 0. 14, and to 0. 18 after UV exposure. An 83, 000 A layer caused an increase from 0. 07 to 0. 21, and then the 0. 46 after UV exposure.

40|$|ICESat (Ice, Cloud {{and land}} Elevation Satellite) was {{launched}} in 2003 carrying a single science instrument - the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). Its primary mission was to measure polar ice thickness. The GLAS thermal control architecture utilized propylene Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) technology to provide selectable and stable temperature control for the lasers and other electronics over a widely varying mission thermal environment. To minimize expected degradation of the radiators, <b>Optical</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>Reflectors</b> (OSRs) were used for both LHP radiators to minimize degradation caused by UV exposure in the various spacecraft attitudes necessary throughout the mission. Developed as a Class C mission, with selective redundancy, the thermal architecture was single st ring, except for temperature sensors used for heater control during normal operations. Although originally planned for continuous laser operations over the nominal three year science mission, laser anomalies limited operations to discrete measurement campaigns repeated throughout the year. For trending of the science data, these periods were selected to occur at approximately the same time each year, which resulted in operations during similar attitudes and beta angles. Despite the laser life issues, the LHPs have operated nearly continuously over this time, being non-operational for only brief periods.

40|$|Solar {{radiation}} {{is the main}} factor to determine the thermal state of a spacecraft (SC) when it moves to the sunlit portion of the Earth orbit and {{moves away from the}} Earth. The extent of the solar radiation impact on the SC temperature state depends, primarily, on the interaction of this radiation with the surface portions of the SA body and the design elements that are placed outside the main body. To ensure the required SC temperature surfaces are used various coating and screen-vacuum thermal insulation, as well as multilayer <b>optical</b> <b>solar</b> <b>reflectors</b> with a thickness being in the range from tenths of a millimeter to 15 âˆ’ 20 mm. When designing the SC, to predict their temperature state at various stages of operation are used mathematical models of various levels of complexity, including models related to the solution of inverse problems for determining the conditions of the thermal effects on the SC and thermal properties of structural thermal protection materials. In most famous works, which analyse the SC temperature and condition, a mathematical model is based on the heat balance equation composed for the SC discrete circuits and containing discrete temperature values of individual functional units, structural elements and parts of the surface. This work is aimed at defining the continuous local temperature distribution over the surface of a thin-walled shell of the SC with uneven solar radiation, including cases of moving boundaries between areas with different intensity of exposure. Application of an equilibrium temperature concept of the Sun-irradiated SC surface area allowed formulating and solving the nonlinear problems on calculation of the temperature state of the shell, which is perfectly thermally isolated on the inside surface and is non-evenly irradiated on the outside surface. The paper presents the calculated dependences for finding the temperature distribution of the shell in the vicinity of jump values of the equilibrium temperature of the surface and in the zone of the shaded band. It also considers the problem of determining the shell temperature condition at the translational and vibrational movement of the boundary between the irradiated and shaded areas. </p...|$|R
