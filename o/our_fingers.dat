Once Nancy became pregnant again Claire Crick of All About Soap said [...] "At last – {{some good news}} in Hollyoaks for once! Our favourite soapy couple, Nancy and Darren, discover they’re going to be parents once again in tonight's episode, and we’ve got <b>our</b> <b>fingers</b> (and toes!) crossed that it works out for them this time". She said that [...] "with Darren's cheeky escapades and Nancy's no-messing attitude, they’ll make the perfect parents and we can’t wait to see them with a little one". Crick {{went on to say}} [...] "while Darren might be dad to twins already (remember them? You could be forgiven for forgetting they even existed – it seems Darren already has!), we think he's got potential to be great daddy material".|$|E
500|$|A notable {{event at}} the Congress was the {{promotion}} of the policy of [...] "peaceful coexistence" [...] by Khrushchev, which officially was a policy to increase East-West collaboration against the threat of nuclear war, but which anti-revisionists believed [...] "was merely a way to divide the world in to spheres of influence inside which each side would enjoy unquestioned supremacy." [...] One anti-revisionist author described Khrushchev's policy as follows: [...] "Khrushchev {{made it clear that he}} was prepared to give up international class struggle, renouncing on behalf of the colonial peoples any right to liberate themselves from oppression and reassuring capitalist governments by emphasising 'peaceful transition to socialism' or the Parliamentary road..." [...] He then quoted Khrushchev as saying that [...] "'if any mad man wanted war, we , the two strongest countries in the world, would have but to shake <b>our</b> <b>fingers</b> to warn him off.'" ...|$|E

During a more recent interview, Byford described the album as a mixture of Rock and roll and Heavy metal. When asked about a possible release date, Byford said: [...] "We're looking at maybe at a summer release. It just depends on whether it's ready or not.

2500|$|There {{was in the}} {{laboratory}} a large tank of good-sized turtles being used experimentally to test the claims of a commercially minded enthusiast who wanted to market a turtle vaccine to immunize humans against tuberculosis. [...] On rather a dull afternoon my gaze somehow wandered to this turtle cage and I thought what fun {{it would be to}} organize a turtle race, whip up some betting and try to make some money. [...] I sold the idea to other members of the class and soon we had chalk lanes mapped out on the floor, a turtle with a number on its back assigned to each member, and were down on our knees, snapping <b>our</b> <b>fingers,</b> and exhorting our respective turtles to hurry up and win the race.|$|E
2500|$|Buemi and Davidson were {{disappointed}} {{to achieve a}} third-place podium finish with Davidson saying Toyota had to learn from their mistake and make progress. Both drivers added that their focus {{would be on the}} championship. Lapierre accepted that his early race crash affected his team's ambitions of winning the race, stating he was unable to see anything because of low visibility, and did not expect to get the car back to the pit lane with the heavy damage it sustained: [...] "We crossed <b>our</b> <b>fingers</b> that the car would hold together to the end, and after this we can be pleased with what we accomplished." [...] Wolfgang Ullrich, the head of Audi Motorsport, expressed his respect for Porsche, saying the German company and Toyota were strong competitors and Ullrich held a belief that Audi would succeed despite of strenuous prerequisites for the season. He stated the event was [...] "of the kind you can only experience at Le Mans" [...] with the deciding factors being that the Audi R18 e-tron quattro drove consistently fast for the entire duration of the race and said the victory was placed among one of the German company's greatest wins because of the constant changing factors for all the competing teams.|$|E

What with Darren’s cheeky escapades and Nancy’s no-messing attitude, they’ll make the perfect parents". She added that if Nancy is [...] "as organised at being a mum as she is at being a journalist, then they will cope brilliantly! We’re hoping the writers will leave them to be a happy for once and let Nancy have a stress-free pregnancy, but we don’t fancy their chances". Crick's colleague Laura Morgan commented on Nancy going into premature labour saying [...] "Our hearts were breaking for the couple as they faced the reality of their situation [...] we’re keeping <b>our</b> <b>fingers</b> crossed there will be a happy ending to their nightmare". Morgan added that [...] "Despite the sad nature of the storyline, it’s been amazing (as always) to watch Jess Fox (aka Nancy) and Ashley Taylor Dawson (Darren) acting their socks off, and proving to us once again they’re two of the best actors in soap right now".|$|E

40|$|Although we {{obtain a}} lot of {{information}} in our environment via the visual modality, we also obtain rich information via the non-visual modality. In the mechanism how we perceive our environment, we use not only the sensor information, but also “how it changes ac-cording to how we act. ” For example, we obtain the haptic infor-mation from the haptic sensor on <b>our</b> <b>finger,</b> and when we move <b>our</b> <b>finger</b> along {{to the surface of the}} touching object, the haptic infor-mation changes according to the finger motion, and we “perceive” the whole shape of the object by executing the action-and-sensing process. In other words, we have a high ability to “integrate ” the relation of our body’s action and its related sensing data, so as to improve the accuracy of sensor in our body. Based on this idea, we developed a simple perception aid device with user’s explorer action, to perceive the object at a distance...|$|R
