On numerous occasions vandals damaged the Charterhouse, eventually demolishing its buildings. By 1405, a stout wall was built to protect the property and maintain the privacy of the Order, particularly its church where men and women alike came to worship.|$|E
5|$|Like much of British post-war planning, {{regeneration}} of Bristol {{city centre}} was characterised by large, cheap tower blocks, brutalist architecture {{and expansion of}} roads. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversed, with the closure of some main roads and the regeneration of the Broadmead shopping centre. In 2006 <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> centre's tallest post-war blocks was torn down. Social housing tower blocks have also been demolished {{to be replaced by}} low rise homes.|$|E

These paintings, completed in 1670, hung in London's Guildhall until it was bombed during World War II; today only two (those of Sir Matthew Hale and Sir Hugh Wyndham) remain in the Guildhall Art Gallery the remainder having been destroyed or dispersed.|$|E

5|$|The {{rebuilding}} of Bristol city centre was characterised by 1960s and 1970s skyscrapers, mid-century modern architecture and road improvements. Beginning in the 1980s some main roads were closed, the Georgian-era Queen Square and Portland Square were restored, the Broadmead shopping area regenerated, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> centre's tallest mid-century towers was demolished. Bristol's road infrastructure changed dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s {{with the development}} of the M4 and M5 motorways, which meet at the Almondsbury Interchange just north of the city and link Bristol with London (M4 eastbound), Swansea (M4 westbound across the Severn Estuary), Exeter (M5 southbound) and Birmingham (M5 northbound).|$|E
5|$|Like much of British post-war development, the {{regeneration}} of Bristol {{city centre}} was characterised by Mid-Century Modern towers such as Castlemead, Modernist architecture, and improvement and expansion to road infrastructure. The world's oldest shot tower in Redcliffe {{was lost to}} road development in 1968, being replaced the following year by the Cheese Lane Shot Tower on a different site. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversing, limiting access with the closure {{of a number of}} main roads, whilst the Broadmead shopping centre has been further developed. In 2006, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> centre's tallest Mid-Century Modern towers was lost, with further historic 20th century structures being destroyed more recently. The transfer of the docks to Avonmouth, 7miles(11km) downstream from the city centre, relieved congestion in the centre of Bristol and allowed substantial redevelopment of the old central dock area (the Floating Harbour). The continued existence of the central docks was for some time in jeopardy, as they were seen to be remnants of a derelict industry instead of an asset to be developed for public use.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{difficult}} to excavate, as it is buried deep under the later layers of habitation. A defensive system against floods, composed of a circular embankment was unearthed, {{in addition to a}} circular 6.7m thick internal rampart to protect the city from enemies. An area of 300 meters long filled with gardens and craftsmen quarters, separated the outer embankment from the inner rampart which had a height of 8 to 10 meters, and was strengthened by defensive towers. Other findings include <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> gates, a street beginning at the center and ending at the gate, in addition to residential houses. Mari had a central mound, however no temple or palaces have been unearthed, although a large building that seems to have been an administrative one was unearthed which had stone foundations and dimensions of (32 meters X 25 meters), with rooms up to 12 meters long and 6 meters wide. The city was abandoned {{at the end of the}} Early Dynastic period II c. 2550 BC for unknown reasons.|$|E

25|$|The site of Khorsabad was {{excavated}} 1928–1935 by American archaeologists {{from the}} Oriental Institute in Chicago. Work {{in the first}} season was led by Edward Chiera and concentrated on the palace area. A colossal bull estimated to weigh 40tons was uncovered outside the throne room. It was found split into three large fragments. The torso alone weighed about 20tons. This was shipped to Chicago. The preparation and shipment of the bull back to the Oriental Institute was incredibly arduous. The remaining seasons were led by Gordon Loud and Hamilton Darby. Their work examined <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> gates, continued work at the palace, and excavated extensively at the palace's temple complex. Since Dur-Sharrukin was a single-period site that was evacuated {{in an orderly manner}} after the death of Sargon II, few individual objects were found. The primary discoveries from Khorsabad shed light on Assyrian art and architecture.|$|E

High was running for the Democratic Party nomination for Governor of Florida at the time. He appointed Athalie Range to fill the unexpired term of the commissioner who had resigned. In 1967 and again in 1969 Athalie Range was reelected to the City commission. While on the commission, Range sought to have garbage collection improved in black neighborhoods, which sometimes went three weeks between garbage pickups, while white neighborhoods got twice a week pickups. After a vote on her proposed ordinance to equalize garbage service was twice postponed, Range had her neighbors bring bags of garbage to the commission meeting and dump them on the commissioners' desks. After that the ordinance was passed. She also pressed for tighter gun controls, but {{was able to get}} only part of what she wanted. After a fire caused by a kerosene heater killed eleven people in a house in a black neighborhood, Range led an effort to have such heaters banned in Miami.Dunn. P. 188-9Robinson.|$|E
