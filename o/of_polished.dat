5|$|The library, {{the last}} of the palace's rooms to be completed, is based on Sir Walter Scott's own library, {{revealing}} the personal friendship that Blore had with Scott. Inside, the library features about 6,000 literary and musical works of the 18th and 19th centuries. The interior's woodwork, including the doors, panelling, and ceilings, is made out of oak. The walls are adorned in cloth, with designs made by Dutch, Flemish, French, and Italian painters. The palace's Gothic fireplaces are made out <b>of</b> <b>polished</b> diabase.|$|E
5|$|From 1879, more {{locomotives}} were needed, and {{the design}} was updated and 24 were delivered between 1879 and 1885. Originally they were painted bright olive green lined in black and yellow, chimneys copper capped with the locomotive number in brass figures at the front and domes <b>of</b> <b>polished</b> brass. In 1885, the colour changed to a dark red known as Midcared, and this was to remain the standard colour, taken up as the colour for the Metropolitan line by London Transport in 1933. When in 1925 the Met classified its locomotives by letters of the alphabet, these were assigned A Class and B Class. When the M was being built, it was considered that they would struggle on the gradients and five Worcester Engine 0-6-0 tank locomotives were delivered in 1868. It was soon found that A and B Classes could manage trains without difficulty and the 0-6-0Ts were sold to the Taff Vale Railway in 1873 and 1875.|$|E
5|$|Older gravestones in the {{cemetery}} are generally cut from limestone, and the gravestones placed after 1900 are predominantly made <b>of</b> <b>polished</b> granite. Most of the gravestones have weathered significantly. The gravestones are generally rounded or rectangular in shape, and are placed on small stone foundations. The gravestones of prominent local leaders are more ornate in character, including that of Captain David Pugh and his family, who are buried under a large obelisk that lists the names of his three wives and their respective children. Nixon's gravestone is deteriorating due to advanced weathering; it is made of limestone and contains a carving of an open book. Following {{the purchase of a}} rectangular land tract around 1990, {{the cemetery}} was expanded on the east side. This section of the cemetery is excluded from the church's historically-recognized boundaries, as it was not associated with the church during the period of its greatest significance.|$|E

5|$|Pottery finds showed better finish {{compared}} to the earlier Period I. The pots were <b>of</b> <b>polished</b> black ware, mostly handmade, {{in the form of}} a dish with stand, a high-necked jar, and so forth. Also found was a wheel turned red ware pot which contained 950 beads made from carnelian and agate (inferred as items for sale), which was thought to belong to the later part of this period. A very impressive painted pottery ware recovered from this period was a globular red ware pot made on a turntable; the painting on the pot was of a wild goat of black colour with long horns and hanging ears. Another pottery item which is of interest is a polished black ware in globular shape jar with a long neck and flaring mouth.|$|E
5|$|The gate, {{built of}} large square blocks <b>of</b> <b>polished</b> white marble fitted {{together}} without cement, has {{the form of}} a triumphal arch with three arched gates, the middle one larger than the two others. The gate is flanked by large square towers, which form the 9th and 10th towers of the inner Theodosian wall. With the exception of the central portal, the gate remained open to everyday traffic. The structure was richly decorated with numerous statues, including a statue of Theodosius I on an elephant-drawn quadriga on top, echoing the Porta Triumphalis of Rome, which survived until it fell down in an earthquake in 740. Other sculptures were a large cross, which fell in an earthquake in 561 or 562; a Victory, which was cast down in the reign of Michael III; and a crowned Fortune of the City. In 965, Nikephoros II Phokas installed the captured bronze city gates of Mopsuestia in the place of the original ones.|$|E

25|$|Human's {{technological}} ascent {{began in}} earnest in {{what is known as}} the Neolithic Period ("New Stone Age"). The invention <b>of</b> <b>polished</b> stone axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms. This use <b>of</b> <b>polished</b> stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic, but were originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland. Agriculture fed larger populations, and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried, as nomadic ones must. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the hunter-gatherer economy.|$|E

We then turn to special classes <b>of</b> <b>Polish</b> metric spaces, including locally compact, ultrametric, zero-dimensional, homogeneous, and ultrahomogeneous spaces.
