In this paper, we propose a self-adapting routing strategy for frequently changing application traffic in content-based publish/subscribe system. The strategy firstly trains the traffic information and then uses this training information to predict the application traffic in the future.

This paper studies lane assignment strategies for connected autonomous vehicles in a highway scenario {{and their impact}} on the <b>overall</b> <b>traffic</b> efficiency and safety. We formulate a model of connected autonomous vehicles, which includes three features: traffic data available online, ultra-short reaction time, and cooperative driving. Based on this model, we propose a novel lane change maneuver Politely Change Lane (PCL), which achieves the tradeoff between traffic safety and efficiency. Its effectiveness is validated and evaluated by extensive simulations. The performance shows that PCL improves both safety and efficiency of the <b>overall</b> <b>traffic,</b> especially with heavy traffic. I. IN TRODUC TIO...|$|R

The primary aim of this cross sectional study was to assess the use of the Short Form- 36 Health Survey (SF 36), within a larger health questionnaire, as a tool for measuring residents’ health and wellbeing in relation to commercial traffic density in Brisbane. Three levels of exposure were compared: i) low <b>overall</b> <b>traffic</b> density - control site, ii) high <b>overall</b> <b>traffic</b> density - with a low proportion of commercial vehicles, iii) high <b>overall</b> <b>traffic</b> density - with a high proportion of commercial vehicles. A total of 368 roadside residential houses were approached with 148 adult residents completing the health survey. When compared to residents in the ‘low’ traffic site, residents in the ‘high’ commercial traffic site were approximately {{three times more likely to}} have SF 36 scores below the Australian norms for the scales of mental health and bodily pain, and two and a half times more likely for the social functioning scale, after adjusting for age, gender, income and smoking.

40|$|Network-wide traffic {{monitoring}} {{is of interest}} to network operators. With constantly changing traffic characteristics and measurement objectives, existing techniques for {{traffic monitoring}} tend to be sub-optimal due to poor choice of monitor deployment locations. Routing-assisted network monitoring mechanisms have successfully catered to these needs {{and are able to}} maximize the <b>overall</b> <b>traffic</b> monitoring utility of the network by strategically re-directing selected traffic sub -populations over existing deployed monitoring devices. Both the traffic measurement gain of the network and the load-balancing of measurement workloads across distributed monitoring devices are important performance metrics in the design of efficient routing-assisted traffic monitoring mechanisms. This thesis focuses on the design of gain driven routing-assisted monitoring mechanisms where maximizing the <b>overall</b> <b>traffic</b> measurement gain is our primary design objective. This problem is tackled using two different approaches. First, novel centralized optimal and heuristic routing solutions are proposed for jointly optimizing monitor placement and dynamic routing strategy to achieve maximum measurement gain of the network. Next, we consider the load-balancing problem about how to distribute the network measurement workload across monitoring devices without compromising on the <b>overall</b> <b>traffic</b> measurement gain of the network. Providing effective load-balancing is important since previously- placed monitoring devices may be easily overwhelmed with ever-increasing link rates and increasingly sophisticated measurement tasks. We present an optimization framework called LEISURE (Load- EqualIzed meaSUREment) for load- balancing network measurement workloads across distributed monitors. Finally, a distributed measurement-aware traffic engineering protocol is proposed based on a game-theoretic re-routing policy that attempts to optimally utilize existing monitor locations for maximizing the traffic measurement gain of the network while ensuring that the traffic load distribution across the network satisfies some traffic engineering constraint. It guarantees not only a provable Nash equilibrium, but also a quick convergence without significant oscillations to an equilibrium state in which the measurement utility of the network is close to the maximum achievable gain using offline, centralized routing-assisted network monitoring mechanisms. Both these centralized and distributed routing -assisted approaches improve the <b>overall</b> <b>traffic</b> measurement utility of the network significantly while ensuring low computation complexit...|$|R

30|$|Autonomous {{intersection}} management (AIM) will be {{a future}} method for improving traffic efficiency in the urban area. Instead of using the traffic signal control like nowadays, it uses wireless communication with autonomous vehicles to support the management of road traffic more safely and efficiently. A single AIM shows an exceptional performance in managing traffics at an intersection. However, {{it could not be}} represented a traffic in the real world, which is composed of multiple intersections. We show that coordination of traffic information among vehicles and infrastructures {{is an essential part of}} macroscopic traffic management. Coordination of traffic information among the network of AIMs is the key to improve the <b>overall</b> <b>traffic</b> flow throughout the network not only has an optimal flow in some intersections and very heavy traffic in others. In this paper, we introduce the distributed control to a graph-based intersection network to control traffic in a macroscopic level. Vehicle to infrastructure and infrastructure to infrastructure communication are used to exchange the traffic information between a single autonomous vehicle to the network of autonomous intersections. We implement a discrete time consensus algorithm to coordinate the traffic density of an intersection with its neighborhoods and determine the control policy to maximize a traffic throughput of each intersection as well as stabilizing the <b>overall</b> <b>traffic</b> in the network. We use the Greenshields traffic model to define the boundary condition of various traffic flows to the corresponded traffic density and velocity. Our proposed method represents the ability to maintain traffic flow rate of each intersection without having a back up traffic. As well, every intersection operates under the uncongested flow condition. The simulation results of the graph-based networked control of a multiple autonomous intersection showed that the <b>overall</b> <b>traffic</b> flow in the network achieves up to 20 % higher than using traffic signal system.|$|R
