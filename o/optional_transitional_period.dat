40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the level of relevance of the economic development and the level of pollution of thirteen states that joined the European Union (EU) in the last three enlargement rounds (2004, 2007, and 2013), with the length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods,</b> i. e. the number of regulations that have agreed <b>transitional</b> <b>periods.</b> The initial assumption is that the level of economic development of countries joining the EU and the level of pollution are affecting the length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> and the number of regulations that are agreed upon <b>transitional</b> <b>periods.</b> Accordingly, the paper points to the level of economic development (measured by GDP) and the level of pollution (emissions measured by CO 2 /pc and CO 2 /gdp). All the states are grouped into five regional groups (Mediterranean, Central Europe, the Baltics, South-East Europe and the member states of the former Yugoslavia). Separate part of the paper analyzes in detail the types of regulations relating to the agreed <b>transitional</b> <b>periods,</b> and the number and length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> that are contracted by the states of the five groups. For the analysis we used the <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> in the field of energy, environment and transport, given their potential importance for CO 2 emissions. The final part of the paper analyses perceived relevance between the level of economic development, levels of pollution, the length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> and the number of regulations that are agreed upon <b>transitional</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R
