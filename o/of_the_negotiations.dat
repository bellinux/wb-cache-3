With DeGeneres hinting at her and her character's coming out both off-screen and within the show, the rumors were confirmed when the episode went into production in March 1997.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Buffalo was {{presented}} with the Treaty of La Pointe covering his lands.

5|$|By {{the winter}} of 1939, the Soviets further reduced their demands and sent Boris Stein to negotiate. Stein and Erkko met five times. Erkko {{rejected}} the Soviet proposals, saying that the Soviet demands would {{mean the end of}} the Finnish neutrality policy and displease the Germans. When the chairman of the Finnish Defense Council C.G.E. Mannerheim was informed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiations,</b> he opined that Finland should give up the Suursaari islands because their defence would anyway be impossible during a war, but his arguments did not persuade the majority of the Finnish government.

5|$|Cienfuegos led electors {{that were}} part of the {{imperial}} party in an attempt to elect Giulio Piazza. Piazza was almost elected on May 13, but was short by four votes. The electors were confident that {{they would be able to}} elect him, because more cardinals were arriving to participate in the conclave, and it became public in Rome that Piazza was likely to be the new pope. Albani did not support this because he had not been a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiations</b> despite being the original elector to suggest Piazza, and undermined his election by proposing Vincenzo Orsini as an alternate candidate.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin {{was one of}} {{the main}} advisors of King John during the dispute with the pope over Stephen Langton's {{appointment}} to the Archbishopric of Canterbury. Jocelin did not immediately leave England after Pope Innocent III placed an interdict on England. Jocelin encouraged John to settle with Innocent in early 1209, worried that Innocent would expand the interdict into an excommunication, forcing John's advisors to choose between serving the king or obeying the pope. Nothing came <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiations,</b> however. Jocelin did leave England when John was excommunicated in late 1209. Jocelin, along with Gilbert Glanvill, the Bishop of Rochester, was the subject of a mocking song on his conduct during the interdict.|$|E

5|$|Since 2003, Croatian {{foreign policy}} has focused on {{achieving}} the strategic goal of becoming a member state of the European Union (EU). In December 2011, Croatia completed the EU accession negotiations and signed an EU accession treaty on 9 December 2011. Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 marking {{the end of a}} process started in 2001 by signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and Croatian application for the EU membership in 2003. A recurring obstacle to the negotiations was Croatia's ICTY co-operation record and Slovenian blocking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiations</b> because of Croatia–Slovenia border disputes.

5|$|The RBNA {{gradually}} {{went into}} decline following the Nurses Registration Act 1919; after six failed attempts between 1904 and 1918, the British parliament passed the bill allowing formal nurse registration.

Helena supported the proposed amalgamation of the RBNA {{with the new}} RCN, but that proved unsuccessful when the RBNA pulled out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiations.</b> However, she remained active in other nursing organisations, and {{was president of the}} Isle of Wight, Windsor and Great Western Railway branches of the Order of St. John.

5|$|After {{months of}} strikes and {{political}} deliberations, {{at the conclusion}} of the 10th plenary session of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR, the Polish communist party), the government agreed to enter into Round Table Negotiations that lasted from February to April 1989. Wałęsa was an informal leader of the non-governmental side in the negotiations. During the talks, he traveled throughout Poland giving speeches in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiations.</b> At the end of the talks, the government signed an agreement to re-establish the Solidarity Trade Union and to organize semi-free elections to the Polish parliament; in accordance with the Round Table Agreement, only members of the Communist Party and its allies could stand for 65 percent of the seats in the lower house, the Sejm.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiations,</b> the {{military}} {{situation on the}} ground was threatening Lithuania not only in the Suwałki Region, but also in Vilnius. The Polish leader, Józef Piłsudski, feared that the Entente and the League might accept the fait accompli that had been created by the Soviet transfer of Vilnius to Lithuania on August 26, 1920. Already on September 22, Sapieha asked Paderewski to gauge the possible reaction of the League in case military units in the Kresy decided to attack Vilnius, following the example of the Italian Gabriele D'Annunzio, who in 1919 staged a mutiny and took over the city of Fiume. By agreeing to the negotiations, the Poles sought to buy time and distract attention from the Vilnius Region. The Lithuanians hoped to avoid new Polish attacks and, with help of the League, to settle the disputes.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea <b>negotiation,</b> {{which was}} instigated as a {{response}} to increased human activities at sea, was an international law making process. <b>The</b> <b>negotiation</b> has been described as the longest, most techncally complex, continuous negotiation attempted in modem times. It was attended by almost all states in the world and contained a series of complex and overlapping issues. It was a remarkably successful process in that it concluded with an agreement, which protagonists with different interests and objectives succeeded in producing after 27 years. This thesis analyses international relations and negotiation theories that relate to <b>the</b> Law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea <b>negotiation,</b> highlighting <b>the</b> strengths and weaknesses of each body <b>of</b> theory. <b>The</b> work goes on to examine the most importnt aspets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea <b>negotiation,</b> including why <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> started, <b>the</b> core issues and principal actors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiation,</b> <b>the</b> process up until 1980 when the draft Treaty was devised, <b>the</b> American rejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty and the process which led to <b>the</b> final agreement <b>of</b> 1994. <b>The</b> work then looks at these individual aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> examination <b>of</b> international relations theory and negotiation theory that relates to <b>the</b> Law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiations,</b> the conspirators succeeded in overthrowing the {{democracy}} and imposing the oligarchic government of the Four Hundred, among the leaders of which were Phrynichus and Pisander. At Samos, however, a similar coup instigated by the conspirators did not go forward so smoothly. Samian democrats learned of the conspiracy and notified four prominent Athenians: the generals Leon and Diomedon, the trierarch Thrasybulus, and Thrasyllus, at that time a hoplite in the ranks. With the support of these men and the Athenian soldiers in general, the Samian democrats were able to defeat the 300 Samian oligarchs who attempted to seize power there. Further, the Athenian troops at Samos formed themselves into a political assembly, deposed their generals, and elected new ones, including Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. The army, stating {{that they had not}} revolted from the city but that the city had revolted from them, resolved to stand by the democracy while continuing to prosecute the war against Sparta.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged of his {{relationship}} with Katz and the money she had received.

In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone and e-mail to lobby for a renewal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>negotiations.</b> Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct.|$|E
