500|$|The {{development}} of Revelations: Persona began in 1994, {{after the release}} of Shin Megami Tensei If.... The high school setting of If... was received positively upon release, so Atlus decided to create a dedicated subseries focusing on the inner struggles of young adults. This concept eventually evolved into Persona, and its underlying focus on the [...] "human soul" [...] would become a mainstay of the Persona series. The title Megami Ibunroku was designed to show the title's status as a spin-off directly related to the Megami Tensei series, although it was removed for later Persona titles. The Persona system was directly inspired by the Guardian system used in If..., originally designed by future Persona director Katsura Hashino. Veteran Megami Tensei producer Kouji Okada, and character designer Kazuma Kaneko took over these respective staff roles. New to the production team was writer Satomi Tadashi. The script took about a year to write, with the staff going through twenty drafts. The first draft involved the students going <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> and being caught in a series of mysterious events. This was one of the more fondly-remembered versions. Shigenori Soejima, a future designer for the series, was involved in designing minor characters and coloring promotional and cover artwork. The main concept behind Persona was a Megami Tensei game that could be enjoyed by people new to the series. The popularity of casual games on the PlayStation was a key factor in making this decision. The development team's focus on Persona resulted in development on [...] coming to a near-halt.|$|E
500|$|Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, {{wrote in}} her {{autobiography}} My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that the episode's script gives the audience a [...] "visual and aural feast". She said the background designers [...] "must have gone on another field trip for this one" [...] because they captured {{the look of a}} typical musical recording studio. The recording studio in the episode, where Lurleen records her new songs with the Simpson family, features two rooms, one for the artist and one for the engineer, with a pane of glass between them. Cartwright said the designers added their own [...] "special touch" [...] by putting a few cracks on the walls, designing a slightly dilapidated ceiling, and by making it look as if the soundproofing on the walls is falling off. The property designers went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> to Sun Studio to receive inspiration for the props in the recording studio, such as the [...] "in session" [...] red light, the mixing board, the musical instruments, and the volume-unit meters that indicates how loud the artist is singing. For the interior design of the recording studio, the color designers mixed colors such as orange, mauve, gray, and brown to make them complement each other. The colors in the engineer's booth were darker to make Homer's white suit stand out from the background. The appearance of the engineer at the recording studio was based on John Boylan, an American music producer who produced the highly successful album The Simpsons Sing the Blues. Lurleen's mobile home was designed to be [...] "very confined" [...] and [...] "tiny" [...] so that the compositions of Homer and Lurleen would be tighter, thus giving the scene an intimate, romantic feeling.|$|E
