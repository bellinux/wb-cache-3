2500|$|Pisemsky {{remembered his}} mother a nervous, dreamy, astute, eloquent (even if not well educated) and rather sociable woman. [...] "Except for those clever eyes of hers, she wasn't good-looking, and <b>once,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a student, my father asked me: 'Tell me Aleksey, {{why do you think}} your mother becomes more {{attractive}} with age?' – 'Because {{she has a lot of}} inner beauty which, as years go by, becomes more and more evident', I answered, and he had to agree with me," [...] Pisemsky later wrote. His mother's cousins were Yury Bartenev, one of the most prominent Russian Freemasons (colonel Marfin in the novel Masons) and Vsevolod Bartenev (Esper Ivanovich in People of the Forties), a Navy officer; both exerted considerable influence upon the boy.|$|E

Only 10,000 tickets were printed for the inaugural game and 20,000 people showed up. Both Hoover and Lang had to find pots, bowls and any other available receptacles to collect admission fees. Stanford won the game. In 1892 Hoover invited Polish composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski to give a benefit concert. Hoover and his associates were unable to pay Paderewski the entire honorarium. The musician after hearing their story returned them the money so they could pay for rental of the concert hall. In 1919 Paderewski, now prime minister of Poland, traveled to America to thank the head of the American Relief Administration for helping Poland. [...] "That's all right, Mr. Paderewski," [...] Hoover replied.
