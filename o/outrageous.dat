5|$|However, this ends up alienating Homer {{from the}} rest of the town, as nobody feels {{comfortable}} confessing their secrets now that they know he's Mr. X, and his fame soon plummets.

5|$|Told in letters, {{it is as}} neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of {{the most}} <b>outrageous</b> of the Restoration dramatists who may have {{provided}} some of her inspiration... It stands alone in Austen's work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters.|$|E
5|$|Darren Craig {{directed}} the song's music video, which Candy envisioned as a satire on political and socioeconomic repression {{of women and}} misogyny. In the video, Candy appears {{with a group of}} oppressed women who rise up against a tyrannical man and shoot him with golden rifles. The visual attracted critical attention from media commentators, who discussed the possible inspirations for the women and the setting. Critics positively responded to the music video, complimenting it as vibrant and <b>outrageous.</b>|$|E

5|$|Espejo {{realized}} that the charges against the clergy were so serious {{that he had to}} focus on destroying Barreto's credibility. Therefore, he implied that Barreto's own conduct was <b>outrageous</b> because of his excesses in collecting taxes and his habit of paying public funds to licentious women. Additionally, he stated that the real author of the report was José Miguel Vallejo, whom he called an immoral man who despised the clergy. Thus, Espejo claimed the report should not be believed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kenneth is {{planning}} a party. Knowing this, Liz recounts past parties of Kenneth's to Tracy, telling {{him that she was}} the only other person who attended those parties.

5|$|TISM {{have used}} a variety of methods to conceal their identities. They have never officially {{revealed}} their names, instead choosing to use pseudonyms on their records and in interviews, all the while concealing their faces. Usually this involves the wearing of a balaclava, but <b>outrageous</b> costumes have been created for the purpose, including Ku Klux Klan uniforms made of newspaper, silver suits with puffy arms and legs to mimic an inflated cask wine bladder, giant foam paintings worn on the head, large foam signs bearing the name of a Beatle, fat 'businessman' suits, and eight-foot-high inflatable headpieces among others.|$|E
5|$|The group {{retains a}} high profile largely because of their <b>outrageous</b> costumes, {{but also because of}} their {{frequent}} work for charitable organizations. The Hogettes have appeared in a national advertising campaign for VISA, and they provide support for many charities, including Children's Miracle Network, Ronald McDonald House, and March of Dimes.

5|$|The scandalous trick and {{the frank}} {{language}} have {{for much of}} the play's history kept it off the stage and out of print. Between 1753 and 1924, The Country Wife was considered too <b>outrageous</b> to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by David Garrick's cleaned-up and bland version The Country Girl, now a forgotten curiosity. The original play is again a stage favourite today, and is also acclaimed by academic critics, who praise its linguistic energy, sharp social satire, and openness to different interpretations.|$|E
5|$|The series {{concerns}} Phineas's {{attempts to}} avoid boredom by finding {{something new to}} do for each day of his summer vacation.

Chizuru {{is described as a}} free spirit, someone who enjoys doing unconventional, often <b>outrageous</b> things which surprise those around her; she frequently acts without thinking, and as a result projects a childish personality. Her impulsive behavior sometimes gets her in trouble with other characters, but she quickly becomes ashamed when she realizes the consequences. She tries to be everyone's friend, though Saori strongly dislikes her impulsiveness. Chizuru joins the girls' basketball team in junior high. Her family runs a soba restaurant.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} difference between the community components in Miami and California was that both Los Angeles and San Francisco had very active and visible gay communities. Founder of Metropolitan Community Church Reverend Troy Perry, who {{began his career as a}} charismatic preacher in the Church of God of Prophecy but was rejected for being gay, went on a 16-day fast to raise $100,000 and succeeded. Hollywood stars Bette Midler, Lily Tomlin, and Richard Pryor came out in force for the cause, raising another $100,000. In January 1978 Harvey Milk took office as a supervisor of San Francisco, and the first openly gay man to be elected to office in California. Briggs campaigned for the measure throughout the state, and held a series of public and televised debates with Milk who was very well received by the media, quick to quip and give print-friendly comments. He often made the front page in newspapers in San Francisco with the <b>outrageous</b> things he said. Milk spoke to 350,000 participants of 1978's San Francisco Gay Freedom Day; similar numbers were seen in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu {{is selling}} items to {{customers}} at <b>outrageous</b> prices, like normal. Apu scribbles out the 1989 expiration date on {{a package of}} ham and then lowers the price instead of throwing it out. Homer buys the meat, eats it, and contracts food poisoning. After recovering, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to complain, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired shrimp to placate him. Homer eats the shrimp and becomes ill again. Whilst recovering at home, Homer sees the Channel 6 investigative news program Bite Back with Kent Brockman. Lisa gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a spy camera to expose Apu for selling expired food. Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking the buzzing of the machinery as a bee, the camera catches Apu placing a hot dog that he had dropped on the ground back into the hot dog cooker. Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E
5|$|Born in Bodenwerder, Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, {{the real-life}} Münchhausen {{fought for the}} Russian Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739. Upon {{retiring}} in 1760, he became a minor celebrity within German aristocratic circles for telling <b>outrageous</b> tall tales based on his military career. After hearing some of Münchhausen's stories, Raspe adapted them anonymously into literary form, first in German as ephemeral magazine pieces and then in English as the 1785 book, which {{was first published in}} Oxford by a bookseller named Smith. The book was soon translated into other European languages, including a German version expanded by the poet Gottfried August Bürger. The real-life Münchhausen was deeply upset at the development of a fictional character bearing his name, and threatened legal proceedings against the book's publisher. Perhaps fearing a libel suit, Raspe never acknowledged his authorship of the work, which was only established posthumously.|$|E
5|$|By 1310 the {{relationship}} between Edward II and his earls had deteriorated {{to the point where}} a committee of earls took control of government from the king. The earls disobeyed a royal order not to carry arms to parliament, and in full military attire presented a demand to the king for the appointment of a commission of reform. At the heart of the deteriorating situation was the peers' opinion of Edward II's relationship with Piers Gaveston, and his reputedly <b>outrageous</b> behavior. On 16 March 1310, the king agreed to the appointment of Ordainers, who were {{to be in charge of}} the reform of the royal household. John of Brittany was one of eight earls appointed to this committee of21, referred to as the Lords Ordainers. He was among the Ordainers considered loyal to Edward II and was also by this time one of the older remaining earls.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Greater Poland felt quite safe when he {{was invited}} to a meeting {{organized}} by Henry IV Probus. The meeting took place probably on 9 February 1281 in one of the Silesian villages; however, the Duke of Wrocław had another plan – he broke all the rules of hospitality, imprisoned the three princes who where invited (Przemysł II, Henry V the Fat of Legnica, and Henry III of Głogów), and forced them to make political concessions. This action was made even more <b>outrageous</b> by the fact that only four years earlier Przemysł II and Henry III risked their lives and armies to save Henry IV Probus in the Battle of Stolec, which ended with victory of Henry V the Fat, the third guest of this meeting. Historians speculate that the reason for the Duke of Wrocław to make this radical move was probably his desire to increase his influence over the neighboring principalities as part of his own plans for a royal coronation.|$|E

(Years later Bobby Kennedy would chide her about the incident, saying it was <b>outrageous</b> for the time, to which the by-then-octogenarian Alice replied that it would only have been <b>outrageous</b> had she removed her clothes.) In her autobiography, Crowded Hours, Alice made note of the event, {{pointing}} {{out that there was}} little difference between the linen skirt and blouse she had been wearing and a lady's swimsuit of the period.|$|E
