5|$|Atlético versus América {{was known}} as the Clássico das Multidões ("Derby of the Masses") before the {{construction}} of the Mineirão, as they were the most popular clubs in the state. In their first years, América {{was known as}} an elitist club, while Atlético had popular appeal; the former dominated the early years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>encounter,</b> winning ten consecutive Campeonato Mineiro titles from 1916 to 1925. In the 1930s, Atlético pioneered professionalization of football in Minas Gerais, whereas América resisted against it. From that time on, Galo became the major force between the two, with América suffering a setback {{as a result of its}} internal disagreements regarding professionalism.|$|E
5|$|Next, Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, Eric Young, and Petey Williams) were {{pitted against}} the 4Live Kru (B.G. James, Kip James, Konnan, and Ron Killings) in an Eight-Man Tag Team match.

After the match, Konnan also bashed B.G. over the head with the chair before leaving the ring.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{controversy}} over the actual location of the battle; according to some, it {{took place in the}} town itself, while Jean-Pierre Protzen and John Hemming argue that the nearby plain of Mascabamba better matches the descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>encounter.</b> In any case, the Inca army managed to hold the Spanish forces from a set of high terraces and flood their position to hinder their cavalry. Severely pressed and unable to advance, the Spaniards withdrew by night to Cusco. Despite this victory, the arrival of Spanish reinforcements to Cusco forced Manco Inca to abandon Ollantaytambo and seek refuge in the heavily forested region of Vilcabamba, where he established the small independent Neo-Inca State which survived until 1572.|$|E

5|$|News <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>encounter</b> was {{conveyed}} back to France, but {{the country}} was {{at this time in}} one of the most turbulent eras of the ongoing Revolution and little notice was taken of events in India. Historian William James notes that under normal political circumstances the action would have had more significant ramifications, while Edward Pelham Brenton claims that the French deliberately ignored the report out of fear of antagonising Britain. In Britain, the Admiralty approved of Cornwallis' actions, suggesting that the French were deliberately using the guise of trade to support Mysore against Britain. The action had no effect on the ongoing war in India, which was now centred on the inland city of Seringapatam. As British forces closed on the city in February 1792, the Tipu Sultan initiated peace talks which brought the war to an end in exchange for concessions to the Company and its Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June 2011, Chopra penned {{a three-year}} deal with Ipswich Town signing for an {{undisclosed}} fee, which was reported by East Anglian Daily Times to be £1.5 million. Manager Paul Jewell revealed {{that he was the}} type of player the club was searching for. After signing, Chopra said that he was hungry for goals. He started his Ipswich years with a bang scoring twice in his debut against Bristol City. He also scored a goal in each of the two match =es against his former club Cardiff City. He ended the season as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. However, Chopra had a lackluster second season with the club, where he scored five times in thirty six matches. Unhappy with his performance, manager Mick McCarthy said that he was not in his plans for going forward and they were free to look for another club. Nevertheless, he found the winner goal in the dying minutes of a match against Watford. Though he missed a couple of chance earlier in the match, he was successful in converting Carlos Edwards low cross in the last minute <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>encounter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{weeks after}} their encounter, word reached Le Gris of accusations being made against him by Carrouges and his wife. It {{will never be}} known what basis these {{allegations}} had in fact but Carrouges claimed that on 18 January 1386, whilst Carrouges was still in Paris, Le Gris had entered the chateau of Carrouges' mother Nicole and there raped Marguerite. According to Marguerite de Carrouges' testimony, a squire in Le Gris' employ named Adam Louvel had {{knocked on the door}} of the chateau and demanded entry. All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so Marguerite was alone when Louvel called. Once inside, Louvel gave Marguerite a message that Le Gris was outside and desired to see her because he was passionately in love with her. Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris broke into the house and propositioned her, offering money in exchange. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris attempted to take her by force and raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel. As Le Gris departed, he threatened her with violence if she told <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>encounter.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} at Turning Point {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Jeff Jarrett defended against the {{challenger}} Rhino. The storyline behind this match began at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event on October23, 2005, where Jarrett was to defend the title against Kevin Nash. However, Nash {{was rushed to the}} hospital the night before and was not cleared to wrestle. Rhino took Nash's place in the match, where he defeated Jarrett to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Later, Jarrett reclaimed the title on the November3, 2005 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!. This led to a Six-Man Tag Team match pitting the team of Rhino and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) against the team of Jarrett and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) at TNA's Genesis PPV event on November13, 2005.

5|$|The {{main event}} was a tag team match pitting {{the team of}} Christian Cage and Sting against the team of Jeff Jarrett and Monty Brown. The {{duration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>encounter</b> was 15 minutes and 35 seconds. Jarrett was accompanied by Gail Kim. Cage and Brown started the match before they both quickly tagged in their partners. Kim interfered by distracting the referee, allowing Jarrett to hit Cage in the groin and throw him to the ringside mat. Kim then assaulted Cage in the ringside area. After several minutes of Jarrett and Brown having the advantage over a beaten Cage, Sting was tagged into the match and placed Jarrett in his signature Scorpion Deathlock submission maneuver. Jarrett submitted to the maneuver, but the referee was unconscious. Team Canada then interfered in the bout, attacking Cage and Sting. Jarrett bashed Sting {{in the face with}} the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt and covered for a near-fall once the referee regained consciousness. Afterwards, Sting forced Jarrett's head into the ring mat with his trademark Scorpion Death Drop maneuver and covered for the pinfall victory.|$|E
