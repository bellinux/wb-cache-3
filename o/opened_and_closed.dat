5|$|The {{extent to}} which cryovolcanism really occurs is a subject of some debate, as water, being denser than ice by about 8%, has {{difficulty}} erupting under normal circumstances. At Enceladus, it appears that cryovolcanism occurs because water-filled cracks are periodically exposed to vacuum, the cracks being <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> by tidal stresses.|$|E
5|$|Polyptychs were {{produced}} by the more accomplished masters. They provide greater scope for variation, and {{a greater number of}} possible combinations of interior and exterior panels that could be viewed at one time. That hinged works could be <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> served a practical purpose; on religious holidays the more prosaic and everyday outer panels were replaced by the lush interior panels. The Ghent Altarpiece, completed in 1432, had different configurations for weekdays, Sundays and church holidays.|$|E
5|$|The train {{doors were}} {{originally}} designed to be <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> automatically and the doors would re-open if an object blocked them, much as elevator doors do. Almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 Metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled. At present the doors may be opened automatically or manually. If a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction, the operator must re-open the door.|$|E

50|$|If Y has the {{discrete}} topology (i.e. all subsets are <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed)</b> {{then every}} function f : X → Y is both <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> (but not necessarily continuous). For example, the floor function from R to Z is <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed,</b> but not continuous. This example {{shows that the}} image of a connected space under an open or closed map need not be connected.|$|R
5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, {{railroad}} traffic declined {{and parts}} of Depot Town began to fall into disrepair. The Thompson Block was put up for sale in 1950, standing vacant {{for more than a}} year. A series of businesses <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> in the building, with none finding lasting success. In the late 1960s, landlord David Kircher bought the building, using it as a warehouse. From 1996 until 2005, the building was tied up in legal disputes. Kircher was found guilty of demolition by neglect, and first Barnes and Barnes and then Beal Properties were named receivers. In May 2006, Stewart Beal purchased the building outright.|$|E
5|$|The Patent Cable Tramway Corporation {{owned the}} rights to the Hallidie {{cable-car}} system first invented and used in San Francisco in 1873; trains were attached to the cable with clamps, which would be <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> at stations, allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or to interfere with other trains sharing the cable. There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12mph. However, the additional length of tunnel permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality of the cable system.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} the nonstandard vector {{space in which}} the concept of additive inverse element will not be taken into account. We also consider a metric defined on this nonstandard vector space. Under these settings, the conventional intuitive properties for the <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> balls will not hold true. Therefore, four kinds of <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> sets are proposed. Furthermore, the topologies generated by these different concepts of <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> sets are investigated...|$|R
50|$|In topology, a clopen set (a {{portmanteau}} of closed-open set) in a {{topological space}} {{is a set}} which is both <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed.</b> That this is possible may seem counter-intuitive, as the common meanings of <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> are antonyms, but their mathematical definitions are not mutually exclusive. A set is closed if its complement is open, which leaves {{the possibility of an}} open set whose complement is also open, making both sets both <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>and</b> therefore clopen.|$|R
5|$|Wings is {{also one}} of the first widely {{released}} films to show nudity. In the enlistment office are nude men undergoing physical exams, who can be seen from behind through a door which is <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed.</b> Bow's breasts are revealed for a second during the Paris bedroom scene when military police barge in as she is changing her clothes. In the scene in which Rogers becomes drunk, the intoxication displayed on screen was genuine, as although 22 years of age, he had never tasted liquor before, and quickly became inebriated from drinking champagne. A boom was built with the camera mounted on an extension to shoot the Café de Paris scene.|$|E
5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed.</b> Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E
50|$|Ion {{channels}} can {{be classified}} by how they respond to their environment. For example, the ion channels involved in the action potential are voltage-sensitive channels; they <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>close</b> {{in response to the}} voltage across the membrane. Ligand-gated channels form another important class; these ion channels <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>close</b> in response to the binding of a ligand molecule, such as a neurotransmitter. Other ion channels <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>close</b> with mechanical forces. Still other ion channels—such as those of sensory neurons—open <b>and</b> <b>close</b> in response to other stimuli, such as light, temperature or pressure.|$|R

5|$|These sister {{stations}} were of similar design and were built, <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> together. Stella South, with a generating capacity of 300megawatts (MW), {{was built on}} the site of the Blaydon Races, and Stella North, with a capacity of 240MW, on that of the former Lemington Hall. They powered local homes and the many heavy industries of Tyne and Wear, Northumberland and County Durham. The large buildings, chimneys and cooling towers were visible from afar. Their operation required coal trains on both sides of the river to supply them with fuel and river traffic by flat iron barges to dump ash in the North Sea. After their closure in 1991, they were demolished in stages between 1992 and 1997. Following the stations' demolition, the sites underwent redevelopment: the North site into a large business and industrial park, the South into a housing estate.|$|E
5|$|The {{capital city}} was {{completely}} {{dependent on the}} water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians {{a picture of the}} prevailing surface water distribution methods in use at that time in the semiarid regions of South India. Contemporary records and notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers. Excavations have uncovered the remains of a well-connected water distribution system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes (suggesting it was for the exclusive use of royalty, and for special ceremonies) with sophisticated channels using gravity and siphons to transport water through pipelines. The only structures resembling public waterworks are the remains of large water tanks that collected the seasonal monsoon water and then dried up in summer except for the few fed by springs. In the fertile agricultural areas near the Tungabhadra River, canals were dug to guide the river water into irrigation tanks. These canals had sluices that were <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> to control the water flow. In other areas the administration encouraged the digging of wells monitored by administrative authorities. Large tanks in the capital city were constructed with royal patronage while smaller tanks were funded by wealthy individuals to gain social and religious merit.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April, Utah left Norfolk for {{sea trials}} to train her engine room crew and {{to test the}} {{radio-control}} equipment. The ship could be controlled at varying rates of speed and changes of course: maneuvers that a ship would conduct in battle. Her electric motors, operated by signals from the controlling ship, <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> throttle valves, moved her steering gear, and regulated the supply of oil to her boilers. In addition, a Sperry gyro pilot kept the ship on course. She passed her radio control trials on 6 May, and on 1 June, the ship was operated for 3 hours under radio control. On 9 June, she again left Norfolk, bound for San Pedro, California, where she joined Training Squadron 1, Base Force, United States Fleet. Starting in late July, the ship began her first round of target duty, first for the cruisers of the Pacific Fleet, and then for the battleship Nevada. She continued in this role for the next nine years; she participated in Fleet Problem XVI in May 1935, during which she served as a transport for a contingent of Marines. In June, the ship was modified to train anti-aircraft gunners {{in addition to her}} target ship duties. To perform this task, she was equipped with a new /75 caliber anti-aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon.|$|E
