50|$|Octanitrocubane {{is thought}} to have 20-25% greater {{performance}} than HMX (<b>octogen).</b> This increase in power is due to its highly expansive breakdown into CO2 and N2, {{as well as to the}} presence of strained chemical bonds in the molecule which have stored potential energy. In addition, octanitrocubane produces no water vapor making it less visible, and both the chemical itself and its decomposition products (nitrogen and carbon dioxide) are considered to be non-toxic.|$|E
50|$|For optimal penetration, a high {{explosive}} {{with a high}} detonation velocity and pressure is normally chosen. The most common explosive used in high performance anti-armor warheads is HMX (<b>octogen),</b> although never in its pure form, {{as it would be}} too sensitive. It is normally compounded with a few percent of some type of plastic binder, such as in the polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) LX-14, or with another less-sensitive explosive, such as TNT, with which it forms Octol. Other common high-performance explosives are RDX-based compositions, again either as PBXs or mixtures with TNT (to form Composition B and the Cyclotols) or wax (Cyclonites). Some explosives incorporate powdered aluminum to increase their blast and detonation temperature, but this addition generally results in decreased performance of the shaped charge. There has been research into using the very high-performance but sensitive explosive CL-20 in shaped-charge warheads, but, at present, due to its sensitivity, this has been {{in the form of the}} PBX composite LX-19 (CL-20 and Estane binder).|$|E
50|$|Kandy Lake, {{the main}} body of water in Kandy in central Sri Lanka, is a {{man-made}} lake created in 1807 by the last Sinhalese king of Kandy, Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe, using forced labor. Deveda Moolacharya is considered the architect of the Kandy Lake. The king used land which was a paddy field to create the lake. The king first built a dam across the paddy fields, starting from the Pattiruppuwa (<b>Octogen)</b> side, where the steps leading into the lake by the Mahamaluwa (Esplanade) are still visible, stretching across to the Poya-maluwa. The dam, upon which a roadway was constructed, allowed the king to go across to the Malwatte Vihare. According to D’Oyley, the dam was constructed between 1810-1812. It stands as an indictment of the excesses of the Kandyan monarchy for wasting away national resources to build an ornamental lake {{at a time when the}} kingdom was under serious threat. When a hundred of his advisors advised King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe against building the lake, he had them impaled on the reservoir bund of the paddy field which he was converting into the ornamental lake. It was not long before the British captured him, with help from his own noblemen disgruntled by his irrational policies.|$|E
50|$|Nanodiamond {{synthesis}} {{was first}} {{discovered in the}} USSR in 1963 when Russian researchers found that the detonation of carbon-based explosives resulted {{in the formation of}} nanodiamonds. Other methods of synthesis include hydrothermal synthesis, ion bombardment, laser bombardment, microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition techniques, ultrasound synthesis, and electrochemical synthesis. In addition, the decomposition of graphitic C3N4 under high pressure and high temperature yields large quantities of high purity diamond nanoparticles. However, detonation synthesis of nanodiamonds has become the industry standard in the commercial production of nanodiamonds: the most commonly utilized explosives being mixtures of trinitrotoluene and hexogen or <b>octogen.</b> Detonation is often performed in a sealed, oxygen-free, stainless steel chamber and yields a mixture of nanodiamonds averaging 5 nm and other graphitic compounds. In detonation synthesis, nanodiamonds form under pressures greater than 15 GPa and temperatures greater than 3000K in the absence of oxygen to prevent the oxidation of diamond nanoparticles. The rapid cooling of the system increases nanodiamond yields as diamond remains the most stable phase under such conditions. Detonation synthesis utilizes gas-based and liquid-based coolants such as argon and water, water-based foams, and ice. Because detonation synthesis results in a mix of nanodiamond particles and other graphitic carbon forms, extensive cleaning methods must be employed to rid the mixture of impurities. In general, gaseous ozone treatment or solution-phase nitric acid oxidation is utilized to remove sp2 carbons and metal impurities.|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of explosive substances {{is a subject}} of high importance in several areas including environmental health, de-mining efforts (land and sea) and security and defence against terrorist activity.

The electrochemical detection of explosive nitroamines and taggant substances in solution using a virtual sensor array of metal-doped screen printed electrodes and differential pulse voltammetry was achieved.

40|$|This {{report is}} focused {{partly on the}} {{chemical}} development of some chemical functional groups, and partly on our own results connected with research by Vladimir Prelog in the last period of his work. The period Vladimir Prelog spent in Zagreb {{marked the beginning of}} the development of organic synthetic chemistry at the University of Zagreb and at the pharmaceutical company Kaštel, later PLIVA. One approach he took was the synthesis of new potentially active compounds, but more important was the development of a rational and economical procedure for the synthesis of known active compounds. A start was made with the synthesis of azo dyes and quinine analogs. In the last period of his work on chemistry, Prof. Prelog and visiting collaborators, mostly from PLIVA, studied the enantioselectivity of chiral ionophores, such as lyphophyl tartaric acid esters and spirobifluorene crown ethers towards some biologically active amino alcohols by intramolecular binding. The first and most successful result of the collaboration between Kaštel and Vladimir Prelog, was the early entry into the market with sulfanylamide. The key intermediate for the synthesis of sulfanylamide and other subsequently discovered sulfonamides was nitrobenzene. Organic nitro compounds now have a broad application in fine chemical production, as solvents, intermediates and final products. Simple aliphatic and aromatic nitro compounds are used as solvents and reagents; others have been used as intermediates in the synthesis of amino, hydroxy, halogen, sulpho, keto or other functional groups. Some nitro compounds are important active pharmaceuticals, including the Ca-antagonist nifedipine, the anthelmithic metronidazol or the coronary dilatator dinitroisosorbide, while others are explosives like hexogen, <b>octogen</b> or trinitrotoluene. It is known that some nitro compounds are both useful drugs and explosives including the nitro esters nitroglycerine or pentrite. In PLIVA, the nitration process was used in the production of various active pharmaceuticals, such as pyridoxine hydrochloride, metronidazole, methoprolol tartarate, chlortalidone, dinitroisosorbide and lampren. Further synthetic processes were developed in which purchased nitro compounds were used as intermediates for the production of active compounds with nitro or other functional groups. In 1991 when the war broke out in Croatia, some PLIVA chemists were involved in the development and production of explosives from nitro compounds. Thanks to the broad experience and tradition in organic synthesis, within a short time, a laboratory procedure was developed, a semi-production plant on a separate location was adapted and production of the most powerful brisant explosive, <b>octogen</b> had started. Later, an industrial process for the production of pentrite was developed and its trial production started. During this period, laboratory procedures for some other explosives were developed...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: Fast {{methods that}} allow the in situ {{analysis}} of explosives {{from a variety of}} surfaces are needed in crime scene investigations and home-land security. Here, the feasibility of the ambient mass spectrometry technique desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization (DAPPI) in the analysis of the most common nitrogen-based explosives is studied. METHODS: DAPPI and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) were compared in the direct analysis of trinitrotoluene (TNT), trinitrophenol (picric acid), <b>octogen</b> (HMX), cyclonite (RDX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), and nitroglycerin (NG). The effect of different additives in DAPPI dopant and in DESI spray solvent on the ionization efficiency was tested, as well as the suitability of DAPPI to detect explosives from a variety of surfaces. RESULTS: The analytes showed ions only in negative ion mode. With negative DAPPI, TNT and picric acid formed deprotonated molecules with all dopant systems, while RDX, HMX, PETN and NG were ionized by adduct formation. The formation of adducts was enhanced by addition of chloroform, formic acid, acetic acid or nitric acid to the DAPPI dopant. DAPPI was more sensitive than DESI for TNT, while DESI was more sensitive for HMX and picric acid. CONCLUSIONS: DAPPI could become an important method for the direct analysis of nitroaromatics from a variety of surfaces. For compounds that are thermally labile, or that have very low vapor pressure, however, DESI is better suited. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

This LDRD was undertaken in order to investigate the possible detection of explosive particulates at safe standoff distances {{in an attempt to}} identify vehicles that might contain large vehicle bombs (LVBs). The explosives investigated have included the common homogeneous or molecular explosives, 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), cyclonite or hexogen (RDX), <b>octogen</b> (HMX), and the heterogeneous explosive, ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (ANFO), and its components. We have investigated standard excited/dispersed fluorescence, laser-excited prompt and delayed dispersed fluorescence using excitation wavelengths of 266 and 355 nm, the effects of polarization of the laser excitation light, and fluorescence imaging microscopy using 365 - and 470 -nm excitation. The four nitro-based, homogeneous explosives (TNT, PETN, RDX, and HMX) exhibit virtually no native fluorescence, but do exhibit quenching effects of varying magnitude when adsorbed on fluorescing surfaces. Ammonium nitrate and fuel oil mixtures fluoresce primarily due to the fuel oil, and, in some cases, due to the presence of hydrophobic coatings on ammonium nitrate prill or impurities in the ammonium nitrate itself. Pure ammonium nitrate shows no detectable fluorescence.

The use of electrochemical methods is particularly attractive as many common explosives contain suitable chemical groups to be detected using electrochemical methods. The electrochemical {{detection of}} explosives and related compounds in solution using a virtual metal electrode array and differential pulse voltammetry was achieved. The multiple sets of voltammetric data were integrated using multivariate analysis and matched with known substances present in explosives. Seven explosive substances: 2, 4 -initrotoluene, 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene, 3, 4 -dinitrotoluene, 2 -nitrotoluene, <b>octogen</b> (HMX), pentaerithrytol tetranitrate (PETN), trinitrotoluene (TNT) and cyclonite (RDX) and a taggant agent 2, 3 Ã¢â�¬ dimethylÃ¢â�¬ 2, 3 Ã¢â�¬ dinitrobutane (DMNB) were subjected to analysis using four solid electrodes, namely glassy carbon, silver, gold and platinum in saline aqueous solutions to mimic an aquatic environment.

The full facts became known only after 1990 and, compared with similar locations in Germany, Elsnig plays an outstanding role due to is large quantities and varieties of explosives with all their byproducts and metabilites (in same samples more than 50 components). This made is necessary to develop and validate additional analytical techniques. Particularly it was necessary to characterized an influence of the Elsnig groundwater matrix on the correctness of analytical results. The studies also focused on the efficiency of an electrochemical detector in analysing real samples. The results can be summarized as follows: Various compounds such as hexyl, hexogen, <b>octogen,</b> tetryl, picric acid, glycerol trinitrate and nitrobenzoic acids cannot or cannot be directly analyzed by gas chromatography. HPLC, in principle, enables all explosives, byproducts and metabolities to be separated and detected. The experimental conditions for this are given. The electrochemical detector is a valuable addition to the UV detector in analysing real samples, but cannot replace it. For the extractive enrichment of all explosives and relevant compounds of water it is necessary to work with 3 different pH-values. A suitable extraction regime was worked out. In solid phase extraction, the Elsnig real-water matrix has a rather strong influence on the recovery rates of a number of substances. In liquid extraction, this influence is considerably smaller.

In our recently constructed 5 kg/hr pilot- scale unit we have also demonstrated the destruction of a liquid gun propellant and simulated wastes containing HMX (<b>octogen).</b> MSD converts the organic constituents of the waste into non-hazardous substances such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water. Any inorganic constituents of the waste, such as metallic particles, are retained in the molten salt. The destruction of energetic materials waste is accomplished by introducing it, together with air, into a vessel containing molten salt (a eutectic mixture of sodium, potassium, and lithium carbonates). The following pure explosives have been destroyed in our bench-scale experimental unit located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory`s (LLNL) High Explosives Applications Facility (HEAF) : ammonium picrate, HMX, K- 6 (keto-RDX), NQ, NTO, PETN, RDX, TATB, and TNT. In addition, the following compositions were also destroyed: Comp B, LX- IO, LX- 1 6, LX- 17, PBX- 9404, and XM 46 (liquid gun propellant). In this 1. 5 kg/hr bench-scale unit, the fractions of carbon converted to CO and of chemically bound nitrogen converted to NO{sub x} were found to be well below 1 %.

40|$|To address {{security}} issues in both {{military and civilian}} settings, there is a pressing need for improved explosives detection technologies suitable for trace vapor detection. In light of the strong dependence of vapor pressure on temperature, trace vapor detection capabilities may be enhanced by selectively heating target materials by external excitation. Moreover, polymer-bonded energetic materials may be particularly susceptible to heating by mechanical or acoustical excitation, due to {{the high levels of}} damping and low thermal conductivities of most polymers. In this work, the thermomechanical response of polymer-based energetic composites and methods for acoustical excitation are investigated in order to improve the understanding of the temperature rises induced by applied excitation, and to uncover waveforms which may efficiently transmit excitation energy to generate heat and enhance trace vapor detection capabilities. ^ The heat generation in the binder material of energetic and surrogate systems under harmonic excitation was investigated analytically through the application of a viscoelastic material model. Specifically, structural-scale heating was considered under low-frequency direct mechanical excitation as applied to a beam geometry. Experiments were conducted with a mock mechanical material, wherein the mechanical and thermal responses were recorded by scanning laser Doppler vibrometry and infrared thermography, respectively. Direct comparisons between the model and experimental results demonstrated good agreement with the predicted response, with low-order, bulk-scale heating observed along the modal structure in areas of higher strains. In addition, localized heating near individual crystals was investigated analytically by extending the viscoelastic heating model to general three-dimensional stress-strain states. Application of the model to a Sylgard 184 binder system with an embedded HMX (<b>octogen)</b> crystal under ultrasonic excitation revealed predictions of significant heating rates, particularly near the front edge of the crystal, due to the wave scattering and the resulting stress concentrations. ^ In considering methods for such excitation through incident acoustical or ultrasonic waves, the form of the wave profile was tuned in this work for the purpose of maximizing the energy transmission into solid materials. That transmission is generally limited by the large impedance mismatch at typical fluid [...] solid interfaces, but by varying the spatial distribution of the incident wave pressure, significant transmission increases can be achieved. In particular, tuned incident inhomogeneous plane waves were found to predict much lower values of the reflection coefficient, and hence large increases in the energy transmission in the context of lossless and low-loss dissipative media. Also, material dissipation was found to have a strong effect on the optimal incident waveform, generally causing a shift to lower inhomogeneity values. Similar results were obtained for parameterized forms of bounded incident waves with respect to the local reflection phenomena and surface wave excitation. These results suggest that, depending on the targeted solid material, substantial energy transmission and heat generation increases may be achieved by tailoring the spatial form of the incident wave profile. ...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the current idea of thermal nature of {{detonation}} initiation of energetic materials, the findings and data from kinetic and mechanistic studies of their thermolysis were applied to investigation of the chemical micromechanism of detonation of organic polynitro and polynitroso compounds. In this respect, {{attention has been paid to}} differential thermal analysis (DTA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TGA), the Soviet manometric method (SMM), and the Czech vacuum stability test STABIL. The Arrhenius parameters of some nitramines thermolysis, particularly the not yet synthesized ones, have been predicted with the application of N NMR chemical shifts of nitrogen atoms in their nitro groups. Attention has also been given to the impact sensitivity (first reaction) of polynitramines as related to their molecular structures, thermal reactivities, and physical stability. In the context with what has been mentioned, the characteristics of physical stability and impact sensitivity of substances not yet synthesized (DIGEN,TETROGEN, DECAGEN) have predicted and somewhat increased attention to physical and chemical (thermal) stability of the attractive <b>OCTOGEN</b> was paid. In the group of polynitroarenes, it was similarly pointed out at the influence on chemical thermal stability of TATB exerted by the peculiarities of its physical thermal stability. The relationships between the characteristic of low-temperature thermolysis of the energetic materials studied and their detonation characteristics were specified, namely between the entropies of the start of their thermolysis from DTA and heats of detonation or ratio of detonation pressures and density of the given substances (these relationships - in their form - bear a far resemblance to the Boltzmann theorem), and between the activation energies of the low-temperature thermolysis and heats of detonation (these are - in their form and underlying principles - identical with the Evans-Polanyi-Semenov equation). In the case of mixed (commercial) explosives, the relationships between the explosion temperatures and the results of their TGA or reaction rates of gaseous products formation of their low-temperature thermolysis under the condition of the STABIL vacuum test were found. On {{the basis of}} the relationships mentioned and results of discussion of their significance, results of discussion of both general and published knowledge and data on molecular excitation, region of explosive moleculs primary fragmentation during the detonation transformation, and finally also on {{the basis of the}} published communications about the spectroscopical investigation of detonation initiation, it was stated that the primary fragmentation of polynitro and polynitroso sompounds, in their detonation transformation, proceeds in an induction period preceding the front of detonation wave (i. e. even before the end of adiabatic compression) and its course is not random but most likely identical with the primary fragmentation of their molecules during low-temperature thermolysis. It is also stated that the ability of initiation of decomposition and/or detonation of polynitramines by impact depends primarily on the conformational stability and intensity of intermolecular interactions of their moleculesAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
