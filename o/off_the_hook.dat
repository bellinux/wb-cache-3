5|$|The {{flotilla}} {{was ordered}} back to Felixstowe in Autumn 1942. Their first {{contact with the}} enemy was on the night 14/15 September when they engaged a small convoy <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hook</b> of Holland. They followed a convoy that was escorted by four Flak trawlers almost into harbour before inflicting considerable damage to it. For this, Hichens was awarded a second Bar to his DSC. Other members of the flotilla were awarded a DSC, two DSMs and a MID.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} Bamber {{had not received}} {{a telephone call from}} his father, that Nevill was too badly injured after the first shots to have spoken to anyone, that there was no blood on the kitchen phone that had been left <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook,</b> and that Nevill would have called the police before calling Bamber. They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.|$|E

5|$|There {{were three}} {{telephones}} {{at the farm}} on the night, {{all on the same}} landline. There was usually a cordless phone with a memory-recall feature in the kitchen; a beige digital phone, also kept in the kitchen; and a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom. (There was normally a fourth phone too, a blue digital phone in the first-floor office, but it had been sent for repairs on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it after the murders with its receiver <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> They found the beige digital phone under a pile of magazines in the kitchen.|$|E

5|$|Chartjackers was devised in 2009 by Davenport and Andy Mettam of Hat Trick Productions, and was {{commissioned}} for development by Geoffrey Goodwin and Jo Twist of BBC Switch. Alongside the programmes <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hook</b> and The Cut, it was featured {{as part of}} a season of multi-platform content designed to appeal to teenagers. The show was also directly linked to the 2009 annual appeal for the British charity Children in Need – profits from sales of the completed pop song were donated to the charity. Chartjackers aired weekly at approximately 1:10p.m. on Saturday afternoons on BBC Two, with the first episode premiering on 12 September 2009 during the channel's two-hour long BBC Switch segment. The series garnered a viewing figures peak of almost half a million with its final episode and was critically panned by reviewers. Each episode was streamed online through BBC iPlayer to UK residents for seven days after its initial airing. The series was not broadcast outside the UK and, , is not available to buy on DVD.|$|E

5|$|McGinnity {{began the}} 1902 {{season with the}} Orioles. However, the {{franchise}} began to fall into significant debt. Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon, reported that the team owed as much as $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Unable to afford that debt, Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and player-manager John McGraw, who had resigned from the team and signed with the New York Giants of the NL. With this, Mahon became the majority shareholder. On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold {{his interest in the}} Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman and Brush released McGinnity, McGraw, Kelley, Roger Bresnahan, Jack Cronin, Cy Seymour, and Dan McGann from their Oriole contracts. Brush then signed Kelley and Seymour to the Reds, while Freedman signed McGinnity, Bresnahan, Cronin, and McGann, joining McGraw, his new player-manager, on the Giants. McGinnity attempted to contact Johnson that night, offering to stay with the Orioles if he could receive Johnson's personal assurance that he was welcome to stay. McGinnity did not hear back from Johnson, who had left his phone <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> that night to avoid being contacted, and joined his teammates with the Giants.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{dismissal}} of Martyn, Vaughan brought back Jones – realising that Australia were reluctant to hit runs and thus allowing Jones to get through his overs without causing as much damage as he did early on. In fact, he and Harmison {{were part of a}} remarkable streak – they served up 28 successive dot-balls to Symonds and Michael Clarke (who bowed under to the pressure and was hit on the pad, out lbw for a 19-ball two). However, Michael Hussey – facing his first ball at 93 for 5 after 25 overs – took control of Jones, and when Harmison was taken off, Australia were let <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
60|$|It is true {{people used}} all {{possible}} precaution.

On <b>the</b> other hand, the butcher would not touch the money, but have it put into a pot full of vinegar, which he kept for that purpose. The buyer carried always small money to make up any odd sum, that they might take no change.

40|$|Hypocotyl hooks {{have been}} shown to {{influence}} greening in excised cucumber (Cucumis sativus) cotyledons. The properties of the lag phase are greatly affected by {{the presence or absence of}} <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> tissue. A 45 -second light pretreatment followed by 4 hours of darkness is sufficient to remove the lag phase from cotyledons with hooks, while hookless cotyledons require 2 hours of continuous illumination followed by 1 hour of dark incubation to break the lag phase. <b>The</b> effect of <b>hooks</b> on cotyledon greening is enhanced if <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> are shielded from light. Cutting <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> after lag phase removal caused a marked decrease in chlorophyll accumulation in the cotyledons. These observations may indicate that <b>the</b> hypocotyl <b>hooks</b> produce a substance or substances needed in the greening process, which are translocated to the cotyledons. Indoleacetic acid, abscisic acid, gibberellin A 3, 6 -benzylamino purine and δ-aminolevulinic acid do not show any activity; on the other hand, ethylene appears to replace partially <b>the</b> hypocotyl <b>hooks...</b>|$|R

Happily he missed, and the unconscious agents of good luck drew nearer, disclosing their innocence of anything resembling law or justice.

25|$|Tim Bresnan's {{onslaught of}} fast bowling {{resulted}} in three quick wickets for Yorkshire Phoenix, {{yet he was}} only called upon to bowl three overs – for 22 runs – and Nottinghamshire Outlaws were let <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> Chris Read top-scored with 43 off 35, propelling the hosts to 170 for 8. An excellent start by Ian Harvey and Michael Lumb sent Yorkshire to 60 for 1, as Harvey found boundaries seemingly at will – {{when he was out}} for 74 (with 64 of them in boundaries), however, Yorkshire imploded from 121 for 2 to 135 for 6. Craig White and Ismail Dawood fought back, and number 10 Richard Dawson won them the match with a two and a four, as Yorkshire needed four runs from the last three deliveries of the game.|$|E
25|$|Lagun Ein {{was not yet}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> The king {{assigned}} him to lead {{another attempt}} on Minkhaung. Lagun Ein led a team of 12 commandos to infiltrate the Ava camp. The team made it inside the camp from the lightly guarded north side. He and five men managed to get inside the Ava king's quarters. But the plan was foiled when a concubine of Minkhaung saw them and screamed. She was killed but the king escaped. Lagun Ein and his men took Minkhaung's ruby-studded royal sword and gold-plated betel nut chest. They barely escaped. When they got back, Saw Pyei Chantha, Minkhaung's daughter who had been captured in early 1408 and put in Razadarit's harem, identified that the sword and the chest were her father's. Although the second attempt did not succeed, Razadarit forgave Lagun Ein, and let him live.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this time}} there was no collapse. Two no-balls from Harmison followed, Andrew Symonds and Damien Martyn defended well, waiting for Harmison and Flintoff to be taken off and saved for the last overs. They were – and Australia were let <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> Symonds and Martyn paired up for 142 runs, taking runs off every bowler – even Flintoff and Harmison – and batted {{together}} for nearly 25 overs, with a partnership run-rate of nearly 6. The first four overs only yielded 13 runs, but when Harmison was taken off England lost the sting. Symonds was finally run out by the skipper Trescothick for 73, a hopeless attempt at taking a single, and Flintoff dug out Michael Hussey for 5 two overs later. Australia, however, made a highly competitive 266 for 5, and in the seaming conditions one would expect it to be enough.|$|E

25|$|The Judges {{themselves}} are not exempt from the law; in fact {{they are expected to}} obey it more strictly than any other. A violation that would earn a citizen a few months in an Iso-Cube would get a Judge a twenty-year sentence, served as hard labor on Saturn's moon, Titan, after surgical modification to enable the convict to survive outside there without needing an expensive space suit. (Titan is a moon of Saturn in reality, but was located over Jupiter in an early Dredd strip.) When Judges do make a minor mistake (anything were the citizen is alive or not in an intensive care ward) such as wrongful arrest or search they do have to pay the citizen a compensation fee if there is no crimes to be charged with. On that basis, if they can't find any evidence for the main charge, then they will look for any minor crime or misdemeanours to charge to citizen with to get themselves <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E

If Cuphead and Mugman can win another time, they will own the entire casino; if not, the Devil will have their souls. Cuphead rolls snake eyes and he and Mugman must give up their souls. The brothers beg for mercy, so the Devil makes a deal with them: collect the contracts of other inhabitants of Inkwell Isle who have lost their souls by midnight the next day, and he might let them <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> They visit Elder Kettle, who gives them a potion that allows them to fire blasts from their fingers to aid in their quest.|$|E
25|$|Even as the Twins {{were forced}} to {{continue}} playing in 2002, {{the seeds of the}} eventual financing solution were sown when Hennepin County, in which the city of Minneapolis is located, began to express interest in being a financial partner in a ballpark. Unfortunately for the Twins, Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura wanted to foster competition between the various localities, thinking it would spur more creativity in the structure of any deal. Instead, St. Paul legislators, led by new mayor Randy Kelly, and aided by Hennepin County legislators wanting to keep their constituents <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook,</b> played hardball, and amended the ballpark bill so that only cities -- not counties -- could become financial partners in a ballpark. They knew that this move would eliminate both Hennepin County and Minneapolis (by virtue of the $10 million cap on any contribution), and leave only St. Paul as a viable partner. The bill passed, and Ventura signed it, but the strategy backfired. The Twins investigated and quickly rejected St. Paul as an implausible place to build. Nothing came of the bill, and it effectively ended any serious talk of the team moving to St. Paul.|$|E
