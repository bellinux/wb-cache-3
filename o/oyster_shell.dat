40|$|Abstract: An {{enormous}} amount of waste <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> are dumped into public waters and landfills, which caus-es a bad odor {{as a consequence of}} the decomposition of organics attached to the shells. Marine pollution by waste <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> has become one of the most serious problems in the mariculture industry in Korea. To de-termine the feasibility of recycling waste <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> as desulfurization/denitrification sorbents, pretreating experiments and the SO 2 /NOx removal activity were investigated. Through pretreating processes, such as cal-cination and hydration, the specific surface area and pore volume of waste <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> were increased over those of the fresh particles, making it possible to enhance the removal capacity in acid gases. XRD analysis of calcined waste <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> exhibited peaks characteristic of calcium oxide, whereas raw waste <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> showed that the main peaks were characteristic of calcium carbonate. The optimal temperatures for calcination and hydration were 800 ∼ 850 and 90 oC, respectively. SO 2 /NOx removal experiments were under taken to test the reactivity of absorbents in a fixed bed reactor. The SO 2 removal activity and reaction rate of the cal-cined/hydrated waste <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> were higher than those of calcined/hydrated limestone. This finding clearly indicates that absorbents prepared from waste <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> are substitutes for commercial limestone and can be applied directly to industries attempting to reduce their emissions of SO 2 and NOx...|$|R

40|$|It is {{said that}} the {{application}} of alkaline material is an effective method of suppressing Cd absorption by plants in Cd contaminated soil. Since the main ingredient of <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> is calcium carbonate, it may be thought that the application of <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> is effective in suppressing Cd absorption by plants in soil contaminated by Cd, {{but there are many}} points which are not understood about this effect. In this study, combinations of {{the presence or absence of}} added Cd (1 μgg- 1) in commercial loamy soil (total Cd; 0. 38 μgg- 1) and application of calcium carbonate or of <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> were made, and the effects of applications of <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> on the growth of pak choi (qinggengcai), Chinese cabbage and cabbage, and on their absorption of Cd, Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn were investigated. With the soil without added Cd, the growth of 3 species of plants was less with application of <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> compared to application of CaCO 3. The Cd concentrations in the leaf were 0. 01 ～ 0. 04 μg DW g- 1, and there was no significant difference between applications of <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> and CaCO 3. With the soil with added Cd, the dry weight of the leaves of the 3 species was about the same with application of <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> as with application of calcium carbonate. The Cd concentration in the leaf of cabbage with application of <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> was 1. 9 μg DW g- 1, and the Cd content was 2. 5 μg plant- 1, indicating that it is significantly lower than with application of CaCO 3. Significant differences in Cu, Zn and Mn concentrations were not seen in the leaf of the cabbage between application of <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> and CaCO 3, but the Fe concentration was significantly lower with application of <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> compared to CaCO 3.

25|$|Edo {{suffered}} badly from devastating {{fires and}} the 1657 Great Fire of Meireki {{was a turning}} point in urban design. Initially, as a method of reducing fire spread, the government built stone embankments in at least two locations along rivers in the city. Over time these were torn down and replaced with dōzō storehouses that were used both as fire breaks and to store goods unloaded from the canals. The dōzō were built with a structural frame made of timber coated with a number of layers of earthen plaster on the walls, door and roof. Above the earthen roofs was a timber framework supporting a tiled roof. Although Japanese who had studied with the Dutch at their settlement in Dejima advocated building with stone and brick this was not undertaken because of their vulnerability to earthquakes. Machiya and storehouses from the later part of the period are characterised by having a black coloration to the external plaster walls. This colour was made by adding India ink to burnt lime and crushed <b>oyster</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E

When combined with suitable alkali activators they can be converted to geopolymers cement at ambient temperature. In this work we have investigated the possibility of use bauxite and <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> as mineral admixture in volcanic ashes, to enhance the properties of geopolymers synthesized. Different methods of analyses such as Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were used to assess the variation of setting time, linear shrinkage and 28 days compressive strength of geopolymers paste. The bauxite and the <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> were characterized using inductively coupled plasma (ICP-AES), thermal analyses (DSC/ATG), FTIR and X-ray diffractometry. The results of these analyses has showed that bauxite and <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> are respectively source of Al 2 O 3 and of CaO, and can compensate the deﬁciencies of these oxides in volcanic ashes. Adding mineral admixture dissolve slowly in high alkaline medium. Addition of about 20 % of bauxite or 10 % of <b>oyster</b> <b>shells</b> is seen to decrease the setting time respectively from 415 to 275 min and 195 min.

[...] The yoke is one-piece and curved to follow the back. The left cuff is made one-quarter inch longer than the right to allow for the watch. The allowance is lower for made-to-order shirts. The cuff is made more or less wide, depending if the customer wants his watch to remain hidden under the cuff or to show. According to a Charvet representative, many customers have two different types of shirts: those for evening wear, intended to be worn with a flat watch, and the others for day wear, with a thicker watch. For men, shirt tails are square and vented for a clean look. For women, they are rounded, with a signature side-seam gusset. The collar is very clean-cut, made from six layers of unfused cloth for a dressy, yet not stiff, appearance. [...] Instead, a free floating stiffener aims to provide more comfort and a better shape. The stitching on a standard collar is four millimeters from the edge. The stitching of the top and the edges are precise and well-planned.
