[...] It created a {{national}} milk grid linking producers throughout India with consumers in over 700 towns and cities, reducing seasonal and regional price variations while {{ensuring that the}} producer gets a major share of the price consumers pay, by cutting out middlemen. The bedrock of <b>Operation</b> <b>Flood</b> has been village milk producers' co-operatives, which procure milk and provide inputs and services, making modern management and technology available to members.

Domestic milk powder production increased from 22,000 tons in the pre-project year to 140,000 tons by 1989, all of the increase coming from dairies set up under <b>Operation</b> <b>Flood.</b> In this way EEC gifts and the World Bank loan helped promote self-reliance.

50|$|Amul's {{cooperative}} dairying venture {{became a}} success and in 1965, Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri tasked Kurien to replicate its pattern nationwide. Kurien was mindful of meddling {{by the political}} class and bureaucrats sitting in the capital cities, letting it be known upfront. And so, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) was found under Kurien on his condition that it be set up closer to farmers at Anand. Shastri also took his help to set right the government's mismanaged Delhi Milk Scheme. Later, he prevailed on prime ministers, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi on setting up cooperatives & plants, and managing operations to intervene in fruits & vegetables and oilseeds & edible oils markets during their tenures, respectively, like he had done for milk during <b>Operation</b> <b>Flood.</b> Brands resulting from these - Dhara (Operation Golden Flow for cooking oils), Mother Dairy (<b>Operation</b> <b>Flood)</b> and Safal (for vegetables) are household names today.|$|E

50|$|Phase III (1985-1996) enabled dairy cooperatives {{to expand}} and {{strengthen}} the infrastructure required to procure and market increasing volumes of milk. Veterinary first-aid health care services, feed and artificial insemination services for cooperative members were extended, along with intensified member education. <b>Operation</b> <b>Flood's</b> Phase III consolidated India's dairy cooperative movement, adding 30,000 new dairy cooperatives to the 43,000 existing societies organized during Phase II. Milk-sheds peaked at 173 in 1988-89 with the numbers of women members and Women's Dairy Cooperative Societies increasing significantly. Phase III increased emphasis {{on research and development}} in animal health and animal nutrition. Innovations like vaccine for Theileriosis, bypassing protein feed and urea-molasses mineral blocks, all contributed to the enhanced productivity of milk producing animals.|$|R

During this phase, <b>Operation</b> <b>Flood</b> linked 18 of India's premier milksheds with consumers in India's major metropolitan cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, establishing mother dairies in four metros. <b>Operation</b> <b>Flood</b> - I was originally meant {{to be completed in}} 1975, actually spanned the period of about nine years from 1970-79, at a total cost of Rs.116 crores. At the start of Operation Flood-I in 1970 certain aims were kept in view for the implementation of the programs: Improving the organized dairy sector in the metropolitan cities Mumbai (then Bombay), Kolkata (then Calcutta), Chennai (then Madras) and Delhi through marketing, increasing producers' share of the milk market, and speeding up development of dairy animals in rural areas to increase both production and procurement.|$|E
