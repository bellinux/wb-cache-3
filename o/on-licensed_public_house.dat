And, will this <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> for the poor be near my neighborhood?

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> {{residents}} have the worst health of any population in the USA. However, {{it is unclear what}} the cause of that poor health is among this population. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the association between <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> and health conditions: specifically, we ask if residents entered <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> already ill or if <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> may cause the poor health of its residents. The data used for this study come from the GSU Urban Health Initiative, which is a prospective, mixed-methods study of seven <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> communities earmarked for demolition and relocation (N[*]=[*] 385).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> subsidies on employment outcomes using the 1999 - 2005 <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> administrative data from Western Australia. The existing <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> literature presents two opposing arguments on the impacts of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> on employment. <b>Public</b> <b>housing</b> can {{have a positive impact}} by providing security of tenure. On the other hand, neighbourhood and stigma effects and the withdrawal of housing subsidies as income increases can depress work effort. It is often difficult to accurately measure the impact of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> on employment because <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> is correlated with unobservable factors that may discourage employment. This study addresses this issue by using a quasi-experimental approach in which individuals who entered <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> within the timeframe form a treatment group that can be compared to a control group consisting of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> applicants who did not enter <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> within the timeframe. We find that transition into <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> has a positive net impact on employment outcomes, and the impact is twice as high for males as it is for females. We attempt to unbundle this positive impact into a welfare trap effect and a housing stability effect. Where a welfare trap exists, individuals depress their labour supply while on the <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> wait list in order to maintain eligibility for <b>public</b> <b>housing.</b> A housing stability effect improves the employment outcomes of individuals once they hav...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{substantial}} shift from <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> to voucher-based housing assistance over the past decade, largely {{in response to the}} rising cost of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> and the high rates of crime, unemployment and school failure among <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> residents. Despite this shift, there is relatively little evidence on the impact of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> or housing vouchers on educational outcomes. This paper utilizes a plausibly exogenous source of variation in housing assistance generated by <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> demolitions in Chicago to examine the impact of high-rise <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> on student outcomes.

40|$|PosterAs {{a typical}} sector of social infrastructure, <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> {{in many regions}} is playing an {{important}} role in underpinning the well-being, social cohesion and economic growth, offering accommodations to large percentage of their population. However, management of such infrastructure assets faces great challenges across their different lifecycle stages—a small incident may exert a huge negative social impact or lead to a catastrophic economic loss due to the internal interdependency between <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> buildings and facilities and the external interdependency of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> with other urban infrastructures. Whilst most available literatures on <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> now focus on discussions of higher strategies like privatization and decentralization, this paper commences the research of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> management from infrastructure asset management (IAM) perspective to reduce the lifecycle and social cost and improve the transparency of <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> programs.

It shows that specialist homelessness agencies were very successful in assisting clients to sustain their <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> tenancies. Summary <b>Public</b> <b>housing</b> policy in Australia has been guided by three overarching objectives: prioritising vulnerable tenants in the allocation of property; sustaining stable tenancies by linking households to welfare services; and reducing the pressure on government budgets by enhancing service delivery. At 30 June 2013, 331, 000 Australian households were living in <b>public</b> <b>housing.</b> At the same time, there were also 159, 000 households on <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> waiting lists. Specialist homelessness services {{play a key role in}} helping vulnerable people to obtain or maintain <b>public</b> <b>housing.</b> In 2012 - 13, these services assisted an estimated 244, 000 clients. This report looks at the intersection between specialist homelessness services clients and <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> tenants in New South Wales and Western Australia. By linking data from specialist homelessness agencies and <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> authorities in these states, AIHW identified 18, 688 <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> tenants who sought support from specialist homelessness agencies between 1 July 2011 and 30 June 2013. Some of these people were supported prior to obtaining <b>public</b> <b>housing,</b> some were supported while they were in <b>public</b> <b>housing,</b> and others had lost their <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> and subsequently sought assistance from a homelessness agency. The study found that: 	Specialist homelessness agencies were very successful in helping people to sustain <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> tenancies. 	 		Over 85 % of the <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> tenants in the study who received assistance from a specialist homelessness agency had an ongoing tenancy at the end of June 2013. 		For tenants seeking to maintain their tenancies, the more days of specialist homelessness support received, the greater the likelihood that a tenancy would continue. 		The more days of support received from an SHS agency prior to commencing a <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> tenancy, the more likely that the tenancy was ongoing at the end of June 2013. 	 	 	Most of those assisted into <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> were women. 	 		Proportionally they were more likely than men to sustain their tenancies. 	 	 	Women and their children experiencing family and domestic violence were the largest group assisted in <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> 	The formerly homeless are at the highest risk of losing a tenancy and this risk is greatest in the first 12 months of that tenancy. Around 70 % of all exits from <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> occurred within 12 months of commencing a tenancy. 	Income support receipt was very high and employment levels very low among the study group. Almost all clients studied (91 %) were receiving a government payment or pension, and employment rates across all clients were around 5 %. 	Tenants who exited <b>public</b> <b>housing</b> during the study period were more likely to have complex and multiple needs.
