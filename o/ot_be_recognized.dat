This framework allows defining an adequate modification to counterbalance any action performed by any user in the collaborative system...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Ovarian torsion (<b>OT)</b> <b>is</b> a rare {{cause of}} acute {{abdominal}} pain that requires prompt recognition and treatment during puerperium. Diagnosis of <b>OT</b> can <b>be</b> challenging due to nonspecific clinical features and uncommon objective findings. The management of <b>OT</b> <b>is</b> often delayed because of diagnostic uncertainty. Early and timely recognition and prompt intervention {{are crucial to}} preserve ovarian function and to minimize morbidity. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a 29 -year-old postpartum woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe right flank pain, nausea and anorexia initially considered as renal colic. After further investigation, OT caused by large mucinous cyst was diagnosed. Right-sided salpingo-oophorectomy was performed due to hemorrhagic ovary and huge cystic mass causing ischemic <b>OT.</b> DISCUSSION: <b>OT</b> <b>is</b> often diagnosed based on the clinical presentation, including severe, sharp, sudden onset of unilateral lower abdominal pain and tenderness with a palpable laterouterine pelvic mass and nausea/vomiting. Emergency surgical intervention should <b>be</b> performed if <b>OT</b> <b>is</b> suspected to confirm the diagnosis and uncoil the twist to prevent ovarian damage. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, emergency physicians {{should be aware of}} the possibility of OT in postpartum women. Therefore, early and timely surgical intervention should be undertaken...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the effect of the {{prolongation}} of operative time (OT) on the prog-nosis of patients with gastric carcinoma. In total, 330 patients with gastric carcinoma were enrolled. Correlation of OT with clinicopathological features including the prognosis of the patients were analyzed. Although tumors of patients for whom the <b>OT</b> <b>was</b> longer proved to be at a significantly more advanced stage of disease and univariate analysis demonstrated that the prognosis of these patients was significantly unfavor-able, tumor stage was the only factor independently associated with worse prognosis for the patients based on multivariate analysis. Duration of <b>OT</b> <b>was</b> not an independent prognostic indicator. However, <b>OT</b> <b>is</b> dependent on the surgical procedure to treat tumor progression of gastric carcinoma...|$|R
