40|$|This paper {{argues that}} discussions of {{diversity}} often avoid {{the issue of}} race. Further, it maintains that diversity and structural backlashes {{to it in the}} United States in social and economic life shape and are shaped by crises in mathematics education. Attention is paid to the lack of instructional diversity in mathematical problem types and to the mathematical achievement of African American and Latino middle-school students. The paper further argues for the importance of the category of intellectual agency, an under-theorized and under-researched psychological phenomenon in mathematics education, particularly in the literature on minority-student achievement. The paper concludes with preliminary data to show the promise of this line of inquiry for researching the development of mathematical ideas and forms of reasoning among a diversity of students. The notion of human diversity evokes a wide range of ideas, including apparent and subtle variance among cultural groups; celebration, or at least tolerance, of differences; enrichment of social, economic, academic, and cultural life through incorporating commensurable elements of the other’s ways into <b>one’s</b> <b>own,</b> and <b>s...</b>|$|R

For describing the real human mental activities, Vygotsky focused on the different two phases of the actual mental activities, i. e., verbal thinking and the emotional experience. He considered the emotional experience (perezhivanie) as emerge from the interconnection between individual personal activity and the environment. In this paper, Vygotsky s concept of the emotional experience is interpreted as the actual expressive activity to shape and externalize <b>one</b> <b>s</b> <b>own</b> innate thought or emotion.

40|$|When may someone complain, morally? And what, if any, is the {{relationship}} between legitimate moral complaint and <b>one</b> <b>s</b> <b>own</b> behaviour? I point out a perplexity about a certain class of moral complaints. Two very different conceptions of moral complaint seem to be operating, and they often have contrary implications. Moreover, both seem intuitively compelling. This is theoretically and practically troubling, but has not been sufficiently noticed. The Paradox of Moral Complaint seems to point to an inherent difficulty in our reflective moral intuitions. Given the legislative nature of moral agency, the plausible limitations upon reasonable moral complaint seem to contradict the inviolability of central moral constraints and the complaints they allow. In the sort of cases under discussion, morality seems at once both to insist upon the possibility of moral complaint, and to deny it. ...|$|R
40|$|Friendly fire in naval warfare is a {{virtually}} unstudied phenomenon. In order to prepare future U. S. naval forces {{for the inevitable}} losses that will occur {{as a result of}} fratricide, we must look to the past to discover the role it has played in this century's wars at sea. This study examines the significance of friendly fire in U. S. naval surface and submarine operations during World War II and argues that the occurrence of self-inflicted casualties is a function primarily of the frequency and intensity of naval combat. Additionally, the causes of and factors contributing to naval fratricide are identified and discussed in detail using historical cases. The crucial result of this thesis is that even the most technologically advanced and highly trained force is subject to surprisingly high rates of friendly fire. Only when the vulnerability of every navy to fratricide is officially acknowledged can technology and doctrine be developed {{to reduce the risk of}} accidentally engaging <b>one's</b> <b>own</b> forces.

40|$|Many egalitarians {{believe that}} social inequalities {{are worse than}} natural ones. Others deny that one can coherently {{distinguish}} between them. I argue that although one can separate the influence of these factors by an analysis of variance, the distinction is morally irrelevant. It might be alleged that my argument in favour of moral irrelevance attacks a straw man. While I think this allegation is incorrect, I accommodate it by distinguishing between four claims that are related to, and sometimes confused with, the claim that social inequalities are worse. These are: that one has a stronger reason to eliminate inequalities that obtain between, or are produced by, members of <b>one</b> <b>s</b> <b>own</b> society; that inequalities that result from unfair treatment are worse; that inequalities that we make, rather than merely allowing to exist, are worse; {{and that it is}} bad if people are treated unfairly. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} helpful for {{understanding}} interactive-agent economies. It presents a user-friendly framework {{for exploring the}} implications of economic interaction, and demonstrates its wide applicability. Agents repeatedly face binary choices and receive i. i. d. shocks; payoffs depend upon <b>one</b> <b>s</b> <b>own</b> action and shocks, as well as upon {{the actions of a}} subset of other agents. Simulations explore how properties change as the number of agents, the number of neighbors, and the degree of interaction change. Key results in this framework include the following: The law of large numbers can readily be postponed or defeated, stationarity and ergodicity are trivial to deduce, any equilibrium distribution may be attained in globally interactive economies, continuous- and discrete-time analogues generally behave very similarly, dynamics can be sensitive to details of the interaction structure (implying that popular mean-field approximations are not always appropriate), and substantial persistence is typical. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of bioethics, freedom and {{autonomy}} assume the ability of self-regulation and determination. If one {{has the ability to}} make <b>one</b> <b>ś</b> <b>own</b> decisions, then <b>one</b> represents an autonomous and free person. Such a view of autonomy faces many difficulties, because it ultimately limits those who can be considered autonomous. The Orthodox theology of the one Hypostasis of Jesus Christ presents an alternative to such a notions of autonomy, freedom and personhood. A person can be said to possess freedom and autonomy not when she or he can make decisions for herself or himself, but when she or he is perfected in Christ. When people begin to live in communion with one another and with God, their freedom increases. In this essay, the author introduces the Orthodox theology of the two natures of Christ, united to the Divine Hypostasis of the Logos at the moment of the Incarnation, and its implications for human freedom and autonomy...|$|R

40|$|Learning is a {{key issue}} in education. Being {{familiar}} with contemporary learning theory, therefore, is an essential prerequisite for education scholars and practitioners alike. Virtually any educational effort involves learning, both {{on the part of}} the learner and {{on the part of the}} teacher. It seems obvious and necessary, therefore, to explore learning processes from a theoretical point of view. Fortunately, education researchers and theorists have produced a growing body of knowledge on learning and teaching in recent years. Internationally acclaimed scholars such as Peter Jarvis, Knud Illeris, or Ference Marton have provided building blocks for a contemporary outlook on learning in educational situations. This book offers an overview on the most important contributions, combining them to form a person-oriented concept of learning and teaching.
