He declared martial law in 1678 and 1680 – both during his periods as temporary governor of the island– because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> invasion, re-built the fortifications surrounding the town, and increased the number of cannon from 60 to more than 100 in the five years up to 1680.|$|E
5|$|Often in {{part because}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse {{population}} between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances.

Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect.|$|E

5|$|On June 27, {{officials}} {{announced that the}} estimated containment date had been delayed until July 7. According to a Forest Service Spokesman, the final 7% of the perimeter was in extremely rough terrain that was close to impossible for hand crews or bulldozers to reach. Due {{to the difficulty of}} access the fire remained only 96% contained on July 9 and the estimated containment date was pushed back to July 21. Due to favorable conditions, on July 12, the Sherpa fire was 100% contained ahead of schedule. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> flare ups within the burn area, patrols continued for several days.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{considered}} Zeppelin to {{have achieved}} its main objective of tying down German {{forces in the}} region until after the invasion of Normandy, although it {{did not appear to}} convince German high command that major Allied landings would occur in the Mediterranean.

According to Jacob Field, the operation successfully detained 25 divisions in defensive positions in the region.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Cardiff Castle {{escaped the}} slighting, or {{deliberate}} damage and destruction, that affected many other castles. Probably because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> a pro-Royalist invasion by the Presbyterian Scots, a Parliamentary garrison was installed instead and the castle remained intact. The Herberts continued {{to own the}} castle as the Earls of Pembroke, both during the interregnum and after the restoration of Charles II. The castle's constable continued to act as mayor {{of the town of}} Cardiff, controlling the meetings of the town's burgesses, bailffs and aldermen; the Herberts usually appointed members of the more important local gentry to this position during the period.|$|E

Abe {{and his staff}} transferred to Yukikaze at 08:15. Kirishima was ordered by Abe to take Hiei under tow, escorted by Nagara and its destroyers, but the attempt was cancelled because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> submarine attack and Hieis increasing unseaworthiness. After sustaining more damage from air attacks, Hiei sank northwest of Savo Island, perhaps after being scuttled by her remaining crew, in the late evening of 13 November.|$|E
5|$|In 1315 the Nasrid Moors of Granada {{attempted}} to recapture Gibraltar but abandoned a brief siege when a Castilian relief force appeared. Eighteen years later, the Nasrid Sultan of Granada, Muhammed and the Marinid Sultan of Fez, Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman, united to besiege Gibraltar {{with a large}} army and naval force. This time the king of Castile, Alfonso XI, was unable to raise a relief force for several months because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> rebellions within his kingdom. The relief force eventually arrived in June 1333 but found that the starving inhabitants of Gibraltar had already surrendered to the Moors of Fez. The Castilians now found themselves having to besiege an entrenched enemy, but {{they were unable to}} break through the Moorish defences and, faced with a stalemate, the two sides agreed to disengage in exchange for mutual concessions and a four-year truce.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the college}} moved {{location}} {{several times before}} establishing itself at its present campus in Hereford.

However, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> a German invasion, the authorities soon advised another move, and this time, with 24 hours notice and the help of the London Society for the Blind, a temporary home was found for RNC in Dorton, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. At the time of the move most of the students were on holiday, although some thirty had remained at the college along with several staff members.|$|E

Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect. Christopher Landsea et al. estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E
5|$|This revival did {{not last}} long. Following the death of Charles of Anjou in 1285 and the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> an {{invasion}} from Italy, Michael's successor Andronikos II Palaiologos (1282–1328) assumed that, by relying on the naval strength of his Genoese allies, he could do without {{the maintenance of a}} fleet, whose particularly heavy expenditure the increasingly cash-strapped treasury could no longer afford. At the same time, Andronikos was less concerned with the West and more with affairs in Asia Minor and his—eventually futile—attempt to stop the Turkish advance there, a policy where the fleet lacked a role. Consequently, the entire fleet was disbanded, its crews dismissed and the ships broken up or left to rot. The results were quick to follow: during Andronikos' long reign, the Turks gradually took permanent possession of the Aegean coasts of Anatolia, with the Empire unable to reverse the situation, while the Venetian fleet was able to attack Constantinople and raid its suburbs at will during the 1296–1302 war.|$|E
5|$|More than {{a century}} before {{the events of the}} series begin, Fire Lord Sozin, ruler of the Fire Nation, planned a world war to expand his nation's {{territory}} and influence. He was prevented from carrying out his plans by Avatar Roku, who was born in the Fire Nation. After Roku's death, the Avatar was reincarnated as an Airbender named Aang. As Aang was then only a child, Sozin saw his chance and proceeded with his militant plans. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> Sozin's war, Aang learned about his avatar status when he was only twelve years old. Afraid of his new responsibilities and of separation from his mentor, Gyatso, he fled his home on his flying bison named Appa. Forced into the ocean by a storm, Aang entered the avatar state and encased them in suspended animation in an iceberg for one hundred years. Sozin, knowing that the avatar's reincarnation cycle mandated that an air nomad was the new avatar, carried out a genocide against the Air Nomads during the passing of a once-a-century comet which increases the Firebenders' power, and continues his world conquest.|$|E
