This is a critical problem in the application of cartography and geographical information systems (GIS). In this paper we study the fundamental issues related to map {{labeling of}} point features and develop a new genetic algorithm to solve this problem. We adopt a method called convex <b>onion</b> <b>peeling</b> and utilize it in our proposed convex <b>onion</b> <b>peeling</b> genetic algorithm (COPGA) to efficiently manage map labels of point features. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of a convex <b>onion</b> <b>peeling</b> structure to achieve better map label initialization and to enhance the evolutionary process. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.

Initial statistical screening using a Plackett-Burman design showed temperature, incubation time, fermentation type, non-treated onion waste, KH 2 PO 4 and L-asparagine as significantly, influencing β-carotene production. Response surface methodology was applied to determine the mutual interactions between these parameters and optimal levels for β-carotene production.

Ekstrakt smo hidrolizirali po postopku kislinske hidrolize s HCl in s tem določili vsebnost totalnega kvercetina v ekstraktu. Preučevali smo vpliv parametrov (temperatura, tlak in uporabljena vrsta plina v avtoklavu, kontaktni čas in koncentracija raztopine ekstrakta) na izkoristek hidrolize s subkritično vodo v šaržnem reaktorju. Na podlagi optimalnih pogojev v šaržnem reaktorju smo izvedli kontinuirno hidrolizo ekstrakta s subkritično vodo. Kvalitativno in kvantitativno vsebnost kvercetina v hidroliziranih vzorcih smo določili s HPLC analizo.

Abstract This master thesis {{describes}} the possible usage of subcritical water as hydrolysis medium for selective decomposition of glycoside bounded antioxidants in red <b>onion</b> <b>peel</b> extract. The main {{intention was to}} obtain quercetin from unused red <b>onion</b> <b>peels</b> as a material with added value. Convencional extraction of <b>onion</b> <b>peels</b> enabled us to obtain the <b>onion</b> <b>peel</b> extract. The content of total phenols in the extract was determinated with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. The extract was hydrolyzed according to the procedure of acid hydrolysis with HCl and {{the total amount of}} quercetin in the extract was determined. We studied the effect of reaction parameters (temperature, pressure and type of gas in autoclave, contact time and concentration of extract solution) on efficiency of hydrolysis with subcritical water in batch reactor. Using optimal conditions in the batch reactor, continuous hydrolysis of extract with subcritical water was performed. Qualitative and quantitative content of quercetin in hydrolysed samples was determined with HPLC analysis. Results show that the highest amount of extract was acquired when the grinded mixture of peels and eadible part of onion was extracted by water at a temperature of 95 °C. The highest content of total phenols was determined in extract of <b>onion</b> <b>peels</b> that was obtained with a 35 % ethanol solution at 80 °C. The highest percentage of hydrolysis performed in batch process was achieved at 195 °C, at a contact time of 12. 5 minutes, using CO 2 at a pressure of 215 bar and a concentration of extract solution of 0. 1 mg/ml. Based on results of HPLC measurements we can conclude that the percentage of hydrolysis in batch process is decreasing by increasing concentration of water solution of onion extract. The highest percentage of hydrolysis performed in continuous mode was achieved at a temperature of 200 °C, pressure of 102 bar, treatment time of 12. 5 min and 0. 5 mg/ml concentration of extract solution. HPLC analysis indicated that during the hydrolysis reaction, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural and 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid are produced as side products, however 5 -HMF could be separated from quercetin, due to differences in solubility in water...|$|R

Randomly assigned subjects were instructed to take either the placebo (n = 43) or 100 mg quercetin capsules each day (n = 49) for 10 weeks. Anthropometric parameters and blood pressure were measured, and blood lipids, glucose, interleukin- 6, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (sVCAM- 1) were determined at baseline and after 10 weeks of quercetin supplementation. Quercetin-rich supplementation significantly reduced serum concentrations of total cholesterol (P < 0. 05) and LDL-cholesterol (P < 0. 01), whereas these effects were not shown in the placebo group. Furthermore, significant increases were observed in serum concentrations of HDL-cholesterol both in the placebo (P < 0. 005) and quercetin-rich supplementation group (P < 0. 001); however, changes in HDL-cholesterol were significantly greater in subjects receiving quercetin-rich supplementation than the placebo.
