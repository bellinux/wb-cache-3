40|$|The Master thesis {{analyses}} {{the development}} <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply. The {{recognition of the}} main development tendencies is especially important and has direct impact on decision – making and implementation. Although the development <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply is influenced by a variety <b>of</b> factors, <b>public</b> administration paradigms {{can be defined as}} the basic factor that determines fundamental changes within the entire system. In order to analyse the development <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services,</b> it is important to raise the following question: how does the change <b>of</b> <b>public</b> administration paradigms influence the change <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply? The following aim has been raised: to reveal the development <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply in the context <b>of</b> <b>public</b> administration paradigms. These objectives have been set: 1. To discuss the concept <b>of</b> a <b>public</b> <b>service</b> and the system <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply. 2. To review the change of elements in the <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply system in the context <b>of</b> the main <b>public</b> administration paradigms. 3. To carry out an analysis of the development <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply in Lithuania. Part one reveals the concept <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> and reviews the change <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply system elements. Part two constructs methodology and describes the analysis of the development <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply in Lithuania. The analysis proves that the current <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply system displays all three public administration paradigms features. However, {{it can be said that}} the elements <b>of</b> the new <b>public</b> management paradigm are prevailing. According to the analysis carried out, the trends of the development <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> <b>services</b> supply system in Lithuania were discussed. It can be predicted that the features <b>of</b> the new <b>public</b> management paradigm will continue to dominate in this system, yet a more elaborate expression <b>of</b> the new <b>public</b> governance features will be seen...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{marketing}} has conventionally been viewed by <b>public</b> <b>service</b> professionals as inappropriate to organizations {{concerned with the}} delivery <b>of</b> <b>public</b> good <b>services.</b> However, the adoption of private sector based approaches to theorganization <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> in many post-modern western economies has forced a fundamental reconsideration of the potential contribution of marketing to thedelivery <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services.</b> Against such a backdrop this paper critically reviews the underlying characteristics <b>of</b> <b>public</b> sector <b>services</b> and through articulating aclassification of such services based {{on the nature of}} the organization-service user interaction, explores the application of particular conceptualizations of marketing to discrete categories <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The topic <b>of</b> co-production <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> {{has gained}} a lot of appeal among {{academics}} and practitioners.

This paper aims to fill this gap by analyzing a case study of co-production of services for autistic children in a context of multi-level governance. Findings show that prompting co-production across all the stages <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> management (co-planning, co-design, co-delivery, co-evaluation) requires new skills and new organizational arrangements even though, in institutional contexts of ‘civil law’ such as Italy, the processes of co-production must also be implemented consistently with procedures and tools provided by law. Finally, findings point to the role of trust among the actors involved as a key variable for the development of co-production along the different stages <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> management...|$|R
