5|$|In April 10, 2015 Marylin Zuniga, {{a teacher}} at Forest Street Elementary School in Orange, New Jersey, was {{suspended}} without pay after asking her students to write letters to Abu-Jamal, who fell ill in prison due to complications from diabetes, without approval from the school <b>or</b> <b>parents.</b> Some parents and police leaders denounced her actions. On the other hand, community members, parents, teachers, and professors expressed their support and condemned Zuniga's suspension. Scholars and educators nationwide including Noam Chomsky, Chris Hedges and Cornel West among others signed a letter calling for her immediate reinstatement. On May 13, 2015 The Orange Preparatory Academy board voted to dismiss Marylin Zuniga after hearing from her and several of her supporters.|$|E
5|$|Admission to {{the school}} is through the eleven-plus examination, taken in year 6. Pupils must obtain a minimum score before their {{application}} will be considered and places will be awarded based on whether the child is in public care, whether {{he lives in the}} catchment area and attends a partnered primary school, and whether they have siblings attending the school <b>or</b> <b>parents</b> working there. In the event of a tie, places will be allocated based on proximity {{to the school}}. The school has a maximum annual intake of 116 at the start of year 7 (aged 11); pupils are arranged into forms of no more than 30, where registration takes place. Their form tutors provide access to pastoral support, overseen by their Key Stage Manager. In 2013 the lower school had approximately 577 pupils on roll. The school uniform consists of a black blazer with the school badge embroidered on the breast pocket and a red braid on each pocket. Charcoal or black trousers are worn along with a white shirt and school tie.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government <b>or</b> <b>parents</b> should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E

40|$|Business {{entities}} {{today are}} typically {{made up of}} groups of legally separate corporations, subsidiaries and parents, operating as a single enterprise. This volume is concerned with how procedural law treats these legally independent but functionally integrated corporations. Among the most important procedural issues addressed by this volume include: When can jurisdiction over a subsidiary also confer jurisdiction over its <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> other subsidiaries? In an action against a <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> subsidiary, when can a party obtain discovery against the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s non-party subsidiary <b>or</b> <b>parent?</b> When will {{the location of a}} <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> subsidiary be considered in determining whether there is diversity of citizenship for federal court jurisdiction in an action involving a subsidiary <b>or</b> <b>parent</b> company? When will res judicata or collateral estoppel against a non-party <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> subsidiary apply against its subsidiary <b>or</b> <b>parent</b> company? Alternatively, when will res judicata or collateral estoppel in favor of a non-party <b>parent</b> <b>or</b> subsidiary bind a third partry subsequently involved in an action against its subsidiary <b>or</b> <b>parent</b> corporation? This volume considers these and countless other procedural law questions of corporate groups. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|The Afroyim {{decision}} {{stated that}} no one with United States citizenship could be involuntarily deprived of that citizenship. Nevertheless, the Court distinguished a 1971 case, Rogers v. Bellei, holding in this newer case that individuals who had acquired citizenship via jus sanguinis, through birth outside the United States to an American parent <b>or</b> <b>parents,</b> could still risk loss of citizenship in various ways, since their citizenship (unlike Afroyim's citizenship) {{was the result of}} federal statutes rather than the Citizenship Clause. The statutory provision whereby Bellei lost his citizenship—a U.S. residency requirement which he had failed to satisfy in his youth—was repealed by Congress in 1978; the foreign voting provision, already without effect since Afroyim, was repealed at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Under this Act, a {{child is}} {{guaranteed}} maintenance {{from his or her}} parents until the child ceases to be a minor. This is in effect for both legitimate and illegitimate children who are claimed by the parent <b>or</b> <b>parents.</b> Parents or infirmed daughters, on the other hand, must be maintained so long as they are unable to maintain for themselves. Sections 20-22 of the Act cover the same, and provide for the maintenance of any dependents of an individual.|$|E
25|$|Manual {{babbling}} is structurally {{identical to}} vocal babbling in its development.

He {{supported}} Ashcroft's {{decision to}} file {{suit against the}} voter-approved Oregon Death with Dignity Act, which was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court {{in favor of the}} Oregon law. As governor of Texas, however, Bush had signed a law which gave hospitals the authority to take terminally ill patients off of life support against the wishes of their spouse <b>or</b> <b>parents,</b> if the doctors deemed it medically appropriate.

25|$|Cleft palate {{can also}} be {{corrected}} by surgery, usually performed between 6 and 12 months. Approximately 20–25% only require one palatal surgery to achieve a competent velopharyngeal valve capable of producing normal, non-hypernasal speech. However, combinations of surgical methods and repeated surgeries are often necessary as the child grows. One of the new innovations of cleft lip and cleft palate repair is the Latham appliance. The Latham is surgically inserted by use of pins during the child's 4th or 5th month. After it is in place, the doctor, <b>or</b> <b>parents,</b> turn a screw daily to bring the cleft together to assist with future lip or palate repair.|$|E
