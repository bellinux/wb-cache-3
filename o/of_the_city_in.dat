5|$|A postwar {{review of}} {{inadequate}} housing {{led to the}} clearance and redevelopment of areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>in</b> a postwar style, often at variance with the local Georgian style. In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it council housing. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E

5|$|Although {{an urban}} revolt in Aleppo {{did not take}} place in the {{aftermath}} of the city's occupation by French forces, many of Aleppo's inhabitants engaged in passive resistance against the French and clandestinely provided material aid to Hananu's rebels fighting in the rural areas west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the rebels' propaganda campaign, anti-French sentiment in Aleppo was growing due to socio-economic factors. These included the disruption of trade routes between Aleppo and its countryside, the hoarding and profiteering of flour and rising unemployment that was partially a result of an influx of Armenian refugees who had fled their villages in Turkey during the Armenian Genocide. The latter led to soaring prices for bread and subsequent food riots and famine in some of the city's neighborhoods. The French authorities also declared martial law, restricting travel and speech, further frustrating the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan had been to demolish the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it {{was too small to}} house the entire city. The walls along the landward approach to the city were left intact, and the Fortezza became a citadel housing the Venetian administration of the city. It was only to be used by the inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>in</b> the case of an Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications were made to the fortress. Nonetheless, it was never truly secure as it lacked a ditch and outworks, and the ramparts were rather low.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway16 (Bus. US16) was a {{business}} route in the Grand Rapids area in the 1950s and 1960s. When US16 was rerouted to replace Byp. US16 around the southern and western sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>in</b> 1953, the former route of the mainline through downtown was redesignated as the business loop. That loop followed Remembrance Avenue southeasterly to Leonard Avenue in Walker Township. From there, the loop turned easterly on Leonard over the Grand River to Monroe Avenue before turning south parallel to the river along Monroe into downtown. In downtown Grand Rapids, Bus. US16 turned eastward on Fulton Avenue into East Grand Rapids. There the loop followed Cascade Road into Cascade Township where it reconnected to US16 at the intersection with 28th Street. Bus. US16 lasted until 1962 when US16 was decommissioned in Michigan.|$|E

Between 1952 and 1967 the ECSC Council held its Luxembourg meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d’Armes. Its secretariat moved on numerous occasions but between 1955 and 1967 it was housed in the Verlorenkost district <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>In</b> 1957 {{with the creation of}} two new Communities with their own Councils, discretion on location was given to the current President.

5|$|During the {{negotiations}} {{leading to the}} federation of the Australian colonies, Wagga Wagga was a contender for {{the site of the}} capital for the new nation. During World War I the town was the starting point for the Kangaroo recruitment march. The Great Depression and the resulting hardship saw Wagga Wagga become the centre of a secession movement for the Riverina region. Wagga Wagga became a garrison town during World War II with the establishment of a military base at Kapooka and Royal Australian Air Force bases at Forest Hill and Uranquinty. After the war, Wagga Wagga was proclaimed as a city in 1946 and new suburbs were developed to the south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>In</b> 1982 the city was amalgamated with the neighbouring Kyeamba and Mitchell Shires to form the City of Wagga Wagga local government area.|$|E
