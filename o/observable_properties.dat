5|$|The {{dust in the}} gossamer rings {{originates}} in essentially {{the same way as}} that in the main ring and halo. Its sources are the inner Jovian moons Amalthea and Thebe respectively. High velocity impacts by projectiles coming from outside the Jovian system eject dust particles from their surfaces. These particles initially retain the same orbits as their moons but then gradually spiral inward by Poynting–Robertson drag. The thickness of the gossamer rings is determined by vertical excursions of the moons due to their nonzero orbital inclinations. This hypothesis naturally explains almost all <b>observable</b> <b>properties</b> of the rings: rectangular cross-section, decrease of thickness in the direction of Jupiter and brightening of the top and bottom edges of the rings.|$|E

In this paper, the behaviour of a system is described with timed action sequences.

25|$|This {{statement}} {{implies that}} thermal equilibrium is an equivalence relation {{on the set}} of thermodynamic systems under consideration. Systems are said to be in equilibrium if the small, random exchanges between them (e.g. Brownian motion) do not lead to a net change in energy. This law is tacitly assumed in every measurement of temperature. Thus, if one seeks to decide if two bodies are at the same temperature, {{it is not necessary to}} bring them into contact and measure any changes of their <b>observable</b> <b>properties</b> in time. The law provides an empirical definition of temperature and justification for the construction of practical thermometers.|$|E

There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories (since from a historical point of view, a given form can move gradually {{from one to the other}} by morphologization). However, by identifying clusters of <b>observable</b> <b>properties</b> that are associated with core examples of clitics on the one hand, and core examples of affixes on the other, one can pick out a battery of tests that provide an empirical foundation for a clitic/affix distinction.|$|E

40|$|A key aspect in {{concurrent}} real-time {{system development}} {{is to build}} a model from which a “correct ” implementation can be synthesised. Hence, {{it is important to understand}} the relation between the properties of a model and of its corresponding implementation. In this paper, we use timed action sequences to describe the behaviour of a real-time system. We first define a notion of distance as a metric to express the <b>observable</b> <b>property</b> preservation between timed action sequences. Furthermore, considering both model and implementation as sets of timed action sequences, we show that a smaller distance between them, and hence a stronger <b>observable</b> <b>property</b> preservation, is obtained when urgency on the execution of observable actions is imposed over the execution of unobservable ones. Based on this result, we extend a previous model synthesis approach to generate from a model an implementation with stronger property preservation. By means of a case study, we show how the proposed approach can be applied to the development of real-time systems. 1...|$|R

This was despite what A. C. Crombie (viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress) calls [...] "a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity", in which Platonism stood in opposition to the Aristotelian concentration on the <b>observable</b> <b>properties</b> of the physical world. But Renaissance humanists, who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity, had no interest in scientific innovation. However, by the mid-to-late 16th century, even the universities, though still dominated by Scholasticism, began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology, thus setting the stage for Galileo's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} abstract interpretation, and {{in particular}} the basic operators of reduced product and complementation of abstract domains, as a tool to systematically derive denotational semantics by composition and decomposition. Reduced product allows to perform the logical conjunction of semantics, while complementation characterizes what is left from a semantics when the information concerning a given <b>observable</b> <b>property</b> is “subtracted” from it. We apply this idea to the case of logic programming, characterizing in a uniform algebraic setting, the interaction between a number of well known declarative semantics for logic programs. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} leading order quantum corrections to {{the geometry}} of large AdS black holes in a spherical reduction of four-dimensional Einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant. The Hawking temperature grows without bound with increasing black hole mass, yet the semiclassical back-reaction on the geometry is relatively mild, indicating that observers in free fall outside a large AdS black hole never see thermal radiation at the Hawking temperature. The positive specific heat of large AdS black holes is a statement about the dual gauge theory rather than an <b>observable</b> <b>property</b> on the gravity side. Implications for string thermodynamics with an AdS infrared regulator are briefly discussed. Keywords: black hole thermodynamics, semiclassical gravity, AdS/CFT correspondence. 1 Content...|$|R
