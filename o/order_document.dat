50|$|A {{sales order}} is an {{internal}} document of the company, meaning it {{is generated by}} the company itself.

The customer's PO is the originating document which triggers the creation of the sales order. A sales order, being an internal document, can therefore contain many customer purchase orders under it. In a manufacturing environment, a sales order can be converted into a work order to show that work is about to begin to manufacture, build or engineer the products the customer wants.|$|E

This short essay, however, does not intend to survey the extensive discussions on sacraments within the ecumenical dialogues over the past three decades. In the 16 th century, many of the dialogues on baptism, Eucharist, and ministry concentrated to look into points of agreement and reconciliation. For the ongoing ecumenical dialogues, it is of utmost important to look into areas of convergences on the theology of the sacraments.

40|$|Cost-based query {{optimization}} (CBO) is a {{very important}} area for data management in general and for XML data management in particular. For native XML database management systems (XDBMS), CBO techniques are harder than for relational databases, because the underlying tree-based data model is much more complex and the relative <b>order</b> (<b>document</b> order) between XML elements (nodes) matters. In this paper, we present our first ideas on statistics data structures supporting CBO, that is, the mapping of a logical access model with algebraic operators to the physical access model. In our prototype system called XTC (XML Transaction Coordinator), the physical access model is embodied by a toolbox of path processing operators from which the best performing operators have to be selected based on statistic information for the construction of the query execution plan...|$|E

To enable all software features, all new or upgraded Cisco devices that require software license activation, must be registered with Cisco. The registration process requires a Product Authorization Key (PAK), an 11 -character alphanumeric key printed on the purchase <b>order</b> <b>document</b> shipped with your device hardware. The registration process converts the PAK to an electronic license file containing a unique key for your device hardware. The license file must then be installed on your device to unlock the product and its features.

We describe the vortex nucleation by means of a Schwinger-type path-integral calculation including the effects of quantum dissipation. The overdamped case is treated exactly, while the case in which a periodic array of pinning centres is present is dealt with by means of a renormalization group (RG) approach in frequency space. This yields an approximate but very appealing analytic result for the dependence of the vortex nucleation rate on the externally driven supercurrent. In this formula the rate dependence displays oscillations which are connected to the pinning periodicity and correspond to the vortex nucleation length probing over the pinning sites as the current density is varied. Our RG treatment describes the vortex nucleation process in both the confined and the mobile phases of the dissipation-driven localization transition characterizing the motion of dissipating quantum particles in a periodic potential...|$|E
40|$|In this {{document}} I develop a weight function theory of positive order basis function interpolants and smoothers. **In Chapter 1 the basis functions and data spaces are defined directly using weight functions. The data spaces {{are used to}} formulate the variational problems which define the interpolants and smoothers discussed in later chapters. The theory is illustrated using some standard examples of radial basis functions and two classes of weight functions I will call the tensor product extended B-splines and the central difference weight functions. **In Chapter 2 I derive modified inverse-Fourier transform formulas for the basis functions and the data functions (native spaces) and to use these formulas to obtain bounds for the rates of increase of these functions and their derivatives near infinity. **Chapter 3 shows how to prove functions are basis functions without using the awkward space of test functions $S_{ 0,n}$ which are infinitely smooth functions of rapid decrease with several zero-valued derivatives at the origin. Worked examples include several classes of well-known radial basis functions. **In Chapter 4 we prove the existence and uniqueness of {{a solution to the}} minimal seminorm interpolation problem. We then derive orders for the pointwise convergence of the interpolant to its data function as the density of the data increases. **In Chapter 5 a well-known non-parametric variational smoothing problem will be studied with special interest in the order of pointwise convergence of the smoother to its data function. This smoothing problem is the minimal norm interpolation problem stabilized by a smoothing coefficient. **In Chapter 6 a non-parametric, scalable, variational smoothing problem will be studied, with special interest in its order of pointwise convergence to its data function. **In Chapter 7 we study the bounded linear functionals on the data spaces.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to use machine learning to <b>order</b> <b>documents</b> by popular-ity, or the predicted frequency that an article is viewed by the average PubMed user. Other research on general search en-gine usability has applied machine learning to <b>order</b> <b>documents</b> by their relevance to a given query. The approach here takes a global view of popularity across all users in a given time period, independent of their information need. An effec-tive method for learning popularity from clickthrough data is identified, and a novel measure of success in this task is pro-posed. The resulting model shows that the topic of an article has the largest single influence on its popularity, and its pub-lication date has a strong secondary influence. Possible applications and extensions are discussed...|$|R
