5|$|In October 1843, future California {{governor}} Peter H. Burnett recounted a {{story of}} an aboriginal American man who badly burned his foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The likely apocryphal story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napoleon McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident. British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, {{and two years later}} Canadian painter Paul Kane created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre's work showed erupting material from a vent about a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> from the summit on the mountain's west or northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend only a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the tooth crown from the tip in all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, {{so that there was}} no difference in width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1958, a B-47B Stratojet crashed {{while taking}} off from Loring, killing all four crewmembers on board. The plane belonged to a unit at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. The plane was {{described}} as having reached two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the runway, when it veered sharply to the right, eventually crashing 400 feet north of the runway. On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 Stratotanker of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly {{in the same area}} as the B-47 three days before. Two crewmembers were thrown to safety by the impact of the crash. The Air Force stated that after a four-hour mission, the crewmembers were practicing taking off and landing on the runway. On 18 November 1960, a KC-135 crashed upon landing at Loring, killing one and injuring sixteen others. The plane landed after a six-and-a-half-hour training mission, veered off {{to the left of the}} runway, and skidded three thousand feet while on fire. Surviving crewmembers were able to use the emergency chutes to evacuate the plane safely. On 9 May 1962, six crewmembers of a KC-135 were killed when their plane crashed during takeoff into a surrounding marsh, about fifteen hundred feet north of the runway. On 4 January 1965, four crewmembers were killed three miles north of Loring when their KC-135 crashed into the ground after takeoff. On 5 September 1969, a B-52 Stratofortress crashed approximately three miles north of the runway after taking off. Seven men were killed, including six crewmembers, during a Minimum Interval Takeoff drill. On 4 October 1989 a KC-135 crash killed all 4 crewmembers. The jet, which crashed about 2.4 miles off the TransCanada Highway in New Brunswick, was attempting to land at Loring.|$|E

25|$|As events unfolded, some police {{officers}} were still deployed making a cordon three-quarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the pitch to prevent Liverpool supporters reaching the opposing supporters. Without public address announcements to explain the situation, many Nottingham Forest fans {{on the other end}} were chanting for their team and whistled their anger at what they saw as a pitch invasion, incensing some of the Liverpool supporters. Some fans tried to break through the cordon simply to ferry injured fans to waiting ambulances on the Nottingham Forest end but were forcibly turned back.|$|E
25|$|Between 1991 and 1994, a {{somewhat}} controversial and odd design of jersey was employed, where the chevron that St Helens had now adopted {{in place of}} the traditional V finished three—quarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the shirt. Umbro remained the clubs kit suppliers until 1994, when Stag took over. Their jerseys were far more lightweight than what they had replaced, and they chose to revert to a more conventional fashion of red V in their designs. The kit used first by the club was reverted to during their centenary year in 1995.|$|E
25|$|The nave and aisle have fine 15th-century roofs. The nave {{has four}} arch-braced {{principals}} or composite cruces and the roof has been strengthened by a triangular truss one third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the nave. The massive beam of this truss has a decorative mould {{which is likely}} to be early 16th-century and may represent a strengthening of the structure {{at the same time as}} the campanile was placed on the tower. The three tiers of quatrefoils roof wind-braces are likely to belong to the Victorian restoration. In the north aisle, there are arch-braced principals with foiled apex struts and two tiers of decorative wind-braces.|$|E

25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} front vise design is the leg vise. It's called a leg vise {{because one of}} the bench's legs is an {{integral}} part of it - usually forming the inside jaw. The outside jaw also goes all the way to the floor - or nearly so. There is a single screw mounted between a quarter and a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> that goes through both jaws with the nut on the back of the leg. Finally, there is some sort of horizontal beam at the bottom to act as a fulcrum. This beam may take the form of a board that can be adjusted by means of holes and pegs, or it can even be another screw. The leg vise is probably the simplest and least expensive of the front vises, and it is very strong.|$|E
25|$|Wise begged Richmond to {{send him}} some guns, as had Hill before him, but the numbers that were {{actually}} sent were inadequate. They were distributed into several nominal forts: facing Croatan Sound were twelve guns in Fort Huger, at Weir's Point, the northwestern corner of the island; four guns in Fort Blanchard, about a mile (1.6km) to the southeast; and nine guns in Fort Bartow, at the romantically-named Pork Point, about a quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the island. Across the sound, at Redstone Point opposite Fort Huger, two old canal barges had been pushed up onto the mud, protected by sandbags and cotton bales, armed with seven guns, and named Fort Forrest. These were all the guns that would bear on the sound; the southern half of the island, nearest Pamlico Sound, in the direction from which the attack would come, was unprotected. Five other guns did not face Croatan Sound: a battery of two guns {{on the eastern side}} of the island protected against possible assault across Roanoke Sound, and three others occupied an earthwork near the geometric center of the island.|$|E
25|$|The Woolnough {{design was}} used by Sentinel for their larger railway locomotives. It resembled most other three-drum designs, having almost-straight tubes. Its {{distinguishing}} feature was a firebrick wall two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the furnace. The furnace grate was on the longer side of this, with the combustion gases passing out through the tube bank, along inside a steel outer casing, then back within the shorter tube bank. Coiled tube superheaters {{were placed in the}} gas flow outside the tubes. The combustion gases thus passed through the tube bank twice, once outwards and then again inwards. A single central chimney exhausted from the centre of the far end, not as usual from outside the tubes. The relative temperature difference between gas passage through the two sections of the bank led to a circulation current that was upwards through the first, hotter, part of the bank and downwards through the further, less hot, bank. Circulation was also controlled by an internal weir plate within the upper water drum, so as to keep a depth of water above the ends of the hotter tubes, thus avoiding overheating of dry tubes.|$|E

25|$|Rusk first climbed Mount Stuart in 1920. When {{he first}} saw it in 1894, Rusk desired to climb it; however, other matters, {{including}} the McKinley expedition, prevented him from climbing it. That same year, 1920, the Cascadians mountaineering club was formed and with Rusk as a leading member, they decided that a record box {{should be taken to}} the summit. Rusk climbed Stuart with Rolfe Morse Whitnall in July and although Whitnall was unable to make the summit, Rusk was successful and placed the record box on the summit. Their success inspired the club to send another party later that year on Labor Day. This party consisted of Clarence Truitt, Harold Carey, Vern Mason, Joseph R. Vincent, Rolland Whitmore, Wayne E. and Fern Richardson, Rolfe and Alice Whitnall, and Rusk. The whole party made the summit, even though they had some close calls and were forced to bivouac part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the mountain. Rusk climbed Stuart again the next year with Wayne Richardson, Truitt, Rolfe Whitnall, Max Hiscock, and Jimmie Frisque. That year, they climbed earlier in the season, the 29th of May, than any party before and many thought that there was still too much snow to climb at that time in the season. All but Whitnall made the summit. Rusk led another much larger party up Stuart on May 29, 1922.|$|E

Just as he reached the top, Second Lieutenant Thomas T. Jones, commanding the 3rd Platoon, saw and heard three North Korean mortars fire from [...] away on a grassy ridge to the east. He suggested to Kennedy that artillery fire be directed on these mortars, but Kennedy did not act on the suggestion. Kennedy established his command post inside the tunnel behind the 2nd Platoon position. The D Company position was entirely within the area enclosed by the stone wall, which was nearly intact except on the northeast near the 3rd Platoon position where it had crumbled and was covered with brush and trees. Jones pointed out to his platoon sergeant and squad leaders where he wanted them to take position at the edge of the woods facing the North Korean mortars he had seen on the grassy ridge beyond. He then remained a few minutes in conversation with Kennedy. A few minutes later Jones joined his 3rd Squad men at the edge of the woods. They told him that the platoon sergeant and the rest had continued on toward the narrow grassy ridge. One of the squad members called Jones to the edge of the woods and pointed out 12 well-camouflaged North Korean soldiers, one of them carrying a machine gun, coming down the narrow ridge toward them from the mortar position.
