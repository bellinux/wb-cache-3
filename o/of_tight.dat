5|$|One of {{the bright}} spots in this era was the play <b>of</b> <b>tight</b> end Bob Tucker who, from 1970 through part of the 1977 season {{was one of the}} top tight ends in the NFL. He led the league with 59 receptions in 1971, {{becoming}} the first Giant ever to do so. Tucker amassed 327 receptions, 4,322yards and 22 touchdowns during his years as a Giant.|$|E

5|$|Aesthetically glam metal draws {{heavily on}} the glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s, often with very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy {{clothing}} and accessories (chiefly consisting <b>of</b> <b>tight</b> denim or leather jeans, spandex, and headbands). The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment coincided {{with the rise of}} the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of drugs, strippers and late-night parties, which were widely covered in the tabloid press.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, Capuano {{was elected}} to the Somerville Board of Aldermen {{representing}} Ward 5, once served in by his father. Capuano served one term, stepping down in 1979 to run for Mayor of Somerville. In the 1979 mayoral election he faced Eugene Brune, Paul Haley, and incumbent, Thomas August. He lost the nomination to Brune, who went on to defeat August. Capuano ran again in 1981 to challenge Brune, placing second in a three-person runoff election. Capuano promoted his opposition to the state ballot question Proposition 2½ and criticized Brune for expanding the mayoral staff in the face <b>of</b> <b>tight</b> city budgets, while Brune touted his prevention of service cuts after the proposition passed. Capuano lost in the general election with 40% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|Maryland lost several {{important}} {{players from the}} 2007 team. In January 2008, shortly after Oregon State defeated Maryland in the Emerald Bowl, linebacker Erin Henderson {{announced that he would}} forgo his senior year to enter the 2008 NFL Draft. Henderson, the brother of Butkus and Bednarik Award winner E.J., had recorded an ACC-high four fumble recoveries in 2007 and was the Terrapins' leader in total tackles (133) and tackles for loss (11). The defensive line lost tackles Dre Moore and Carlos Feliciano, while the secondary unit lost both starting safeties, strong safety Christian Varner and free safety J. J. Justice, as well as cornerback Isaiah Gardner. The Maryland offense lost tailbacks Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore who combined for 1,573rushing yards and 25touchdowns in 2007. The offensive line saw the departure <b>of</b> <b>tight</b> ends Jason Goode and Joey Haynos, and offensive guard Andrew Crummey.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers {{opened the}} Ray Perkins era by setting team records for points scored, total yardage, margin of victory, and {{touchdown}} passes thrown. Steve DeBerg was 24 of 34 for 333yards and five touchdowns, throwing touchdowns {{on each of}} the Buccaneers' first four possessions. DeBerg's five touchdown passes still stands as a Buccaneers record, having been tied by Brad Johnson in 2002. Perkins, who had played with Joe Namath in college and Johnny Unitas in the pros, and drafted Phil Simms with the Giants, said that DeBerg had one of the best games of any quarterback with whom he had been associated. In a completely dominating performance, the Buccaneers controlled the ball for 38minutes, allowed no sacks, and converted 14 of 16 third-down attempts. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers defense had four sacks and three turnovers. DeBerg did throw one interception, but on the very next play cornerback Bobby Futrell intercepted David Archer's overthrow <b>of</b> <b>tight</b> end Ken Whisenhunt.|$|E

50|$|Upper garments, such as rugby shirts, were {{sometimes}} adapted as mini-dresses.

25|$|The BBB is {{compromised}} due {{to active}} recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes and their migration across the barrier. Release of chemokines {{allow for the}} activation of adhesion molecules on the lymphocytes and monocytes, resulting in an interaction with the endothelial cells of the BBB which then activate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases to degrade the barrier. This results in disruption of the BBB, causing an increase in barrier permeability due to the degradation <b>of</b> <b>tight</b> junctions which maintain barrier integrity. Inducing the formation <b>of</b> <b>tight</b> junctions can restore BBB integrity and reduces its permeability, {{which can be used}} to reduce the damage caused by lymphocyte and monocyte migration across the barrier as restored integrity would restrict their movement.|$|E

30|$|Composite {{tight gas}} {{reservoirs}} that exhibit the composite features <b>of</b> conventional <b>tight</b> gas reservoirs and deep tight gas reservoirs {{are controlled by}} buoyancy and hydrocarbon molecular expansive force during the early and late accumulation stages, respectively. The main controlling factors <b>of</b> composite <b>tight</b> gas reservoir accumulation can thus be classified into two subsidiary sets. One set {{is associated with the}} accumulation <b>of</b> conventional <b>tight</b> gas reservoirs, mainly cap rocks (C), gas reservoirs (D), low fluid potential areas (P), and source kitchens (S). The other is associated with deep tight gas reservoirs, mainly universal reservoir densification (L), stable tectonic settings (W), widely distributed reservoirs (D), and source rocks in a close contact with reservoirs (S). Therefore, we infer that the development <b>of</b> composite <b>tight</b> gas reservoirs is driven by the following six main factors S, D, C, W, P, and L, with the accumulation process depending on the spatiotemporal combination of these functional elements, and with the development model shown by “T-CDPS + T-LWDS” (Pang et al. 2014). The genetic mechanisms <b>of</b> composite <b>tight</b> gas reservoirs are thus a recombination <b>of</b> conventional <b>tight</b> and deep tight gas reservoir accumulations, resulting in the complex gas–water relationships and full gas-bearing properties.|$|R
