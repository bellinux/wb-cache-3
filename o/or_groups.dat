Furthermore, the recipient must assure that only eligible individuals <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> participated in the program by establishing strict controls of program funds to avoid non-eligible persons from receiving the specific assistance.|$|E

5|$|Analogous to its lighter congeners, the nonbonding {{electrons}} on unbiunium in UbuF {{are expected}} to be able to bond to extra atoms <b>or</b> <b>groups,</b> resulting {{in the formation of the}} unbiunium trihalides UbuX3, continuing the trends of existence of ScX3, YX3, LaX3, and AcX3. Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just like in elements 119 and 120. The standard electrode potential for the Ubu3+/Ubu couple is predicted as −2.1V.|$|E

Spanish trio Presuntos Implicados hold the record for most nominations without a win, with three, and Mexican band RBD and Spanish bands Amaral, Estopa and Jarabe de Palo had two unsuccessful nominations. The last winner of this category was given to supergroup Alex, Jorge y Lena for their eponymous 2010 album.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, older {{historical}} {{analyses were}} challenged by {{a range of}} neo-positivist, Marxist and econometric approaches, supported by a widening body of documentary, archaeological and scientific evidence. Marxist and Neo-Marxist analyses continued to be popular in the post-war years, producing seminal works on economic issues and social protests. Post-modern analysis became influential in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on identity, gender, interpretation and culture. Many studies focused on particular regions <b>or</b> <b>groups,</b> drawing on new records and new scientific approaches, including landscape and environmental archaeology. Fresh archaeological finds, such as the Staffordshire Hoard, continue to challenge previous interpretations, and historical studies of England in the Middle Ages have never been so diverse as in the early 21st century.|$|E

During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board, control of the center and centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of key squares <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).|$|E

5|$|Fungal mycelia {{can become}} {{visible to the}} naked eye, for example, on various {{surfaces}} and substrates, such as damp walls and spoiled food, where they are commonly called molds. Mycelia grown on solid agar media in laboratory petri dishes are usually referred to as colonies. These colonies can exhibit growth shapes and colors (due to spores or pigmentation) that can be used as diagnostic features in the identification of species <b>or</b> <b>groups.</b> Some individual fungal colonies can reach extraordinary dimensions and ages {{as in the case of}} a clonal colony of Armillaria solidipes, which extends over an area of more than 900ha (3.5 square miles), with an estimated age of nearly 9,000years.|$|E
5|$|Individuals <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> could {{petition}} at the Castellania {{through a}} supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing {{a license to}} perform their occupation and the poor requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the working environment of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to address these issues.|$|E
5|$|Irregular moons {{are small}} {{satellites}} with large-radii, inclined, and frequently retrograde orbits, {{believed to have}} been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process. They often occur as collisional families <b>or</b> <b>groups.</b> The precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (albedo of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands. They are neutral or moderately red in color—similar to C-type, P-type, or D-type asteroids, though they are much less red than Kuiper belt objects.|$|E

5|$|Research at the Asummiut {{excavation}} site {{near the airport}} has uncovered the changing settlement pattern, exhibiting transition from the single-family dwellings to tiny villages of several families. The types of dwelling varied from tent rings made of the hides of hunted mammals, to stone hearths, with no evidence of communal living in larger structures. In contrast, there is evidence for reindeer hunting as a coordinated effort of either villagers <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> of more loosely related individuals, with gathering places in proximity of the hunting grounds being found. Despite recent advances in DNA research based on hair samples from the ancient Saqqaq migrants (which gives insight into their origin), {{the reason for the}} decline and subsequent disappearance of the culture are not yet known.|$|E
