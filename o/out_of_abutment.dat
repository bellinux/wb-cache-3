40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to present the {{frequency}} of biological and technical complications and its severity related with metal ceramic fixed partial dentures (FPDs). Total 245 <b>abutments</b> <b>of</b> 140 pa-tients presented with complications in their FPDs were examined. The mean age of the patients was 42 years (range 23 - 83). 66. 1 % and 33. 8 %complication were found in the FPDs provided by qualified and unqualified persons respectively with an average 5. 4 years length of services. Among the biologi-cal complications caries were present in 21. 2 % (52) <b>of</b> the <b>abutment</b> teeth; 13. 06 % (32) had periapical problems, 12. 65 % (31) periodontal problems and 2. 85 % (7) had abutment fracture.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, removal toque <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> screw after the cyclic loading showed no {{statistically}} significant difference among the groups. Generally, conical abutment is believed to be better in fit and stability than non-conical connection [11]. One possibility of this discrepancy {{may be due to the}} deformation <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> screw. Actually, implant–abutment connection after the removal <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> screw was still tight in CC group, but they were easily divided in other two groups. This may indicate that implant–abutment connection in CC group was almost sound and intact after the loading. In contrast, in EP and IP groups, abutment screw may be deformed which lead to the increase <b>of</b> RTV <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> screw. The fracture <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> screws in EP and IP groups may support this speculation. In addition, axial force is strongly affected by the interfacial friction coefficient [12]. In the present study, interfacial friction was supposed to be largest in CC group because the contact area between implant body and abutment was smallest in EP group and both EP and IP groups had parallel walls at the interface with gaps and voids [13, 14]. This may be one reason for the larger standard deviation of RTV in both EP and IP groups.|$|R
50|$|With {{the aid of}} a {{registration}} template, the abutments can {{be attached}} and connected to the implants at the defined position. No less than a pair <b>of</b> <b>abutments</b> should be connected simultaneously to avoid any discrepancy.

30|$|There {{are some}} spaces between {{abutment}} and implant body {{which can be}} a reservoir of toxic substance, and they can penetrate into subgingival space from microgap at the implant–abutment interface.

In the present study, three kinds <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> connection system, external parallel connection (EP), internal parallel connection (IP), and internal conical connection (CC), were studied from the viewpoint of microleakage from the gap between the implant and the abutment and in connection with the loosening <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> screw.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{influence}} of denture-base fit and retainer design on the distribution <b>of</b> stress on <b>abutment</b> teeth, and the displacement <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> teeth and the denture base. A mandibular model with a simulated periodontal ligament and mucosa was fabricated to simulate a partially edentulous case with the right first molar and second molar missing. The edentulous area was made flat to eliminate the influence of residual ridge forms. Two types of removable partial dentures with different direct retainers: 1, a cone crown telescope （CCT）; and 2, a modified circumferential clasp with a distal guide plate, a buccal retentive arm and a lingual enlarged bracing arm （MCC）, with an embrasure clasp as an indirect retainer, were designed. The following conditions of the denture-base conformity with the simulated mucosa were established: completely suitable（ CS）, mesial half unsuitable（ M－）, distal half unsuitable（ D－）, buccal half unsuitable （B－）, lingual half unsuitable （L－）, and completely unsuitable （CU）. A 200 μm clearance area was made between the denture base and simulated mucosa on these unsuitable parts. The stresses at the apical, buccal and distal portions, the distal displacement <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> teeth and the subsidence of the denture base were investigated. Both the stress on and the displacement <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> teeth for the partially unsuitable denture base were larger than those for the completely suitable denture bases for the CCT-retained denture. The distal stress and distal displacement <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> teeth for the completely unsuitable denture base were larger than for the completely suitable denture base with the MCC-retained denture. The buccal stress distribution and the distal displacement <b>of</b> the <b>abutment</b> teeth with the CCT-retained denture were significantly larger than those with the MCC-retained denture under all conditions. When the denture base was completely unsuitable or the distal part was unsuitable, the subsidence of the denture base with the MCC-retained denture was larger than that with the CCT-retained denture. These results showed that the denture base fit influenced the stress and displacement <b>of</b> the <b>abutment</b> teeth for the CCT-retained denture more than that for the MCC-retained denture, and the subsidence of the denture base of the MCC-retained denture was the same as that of the CCT-retained denture when the unsuitable parts of the denture base were only mesial and buccal. Thus, the MCC-retained denture does not cause overloading <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> teeth and the residual ridge even if the fitness of the denture base decreases...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} shown the {{efficiency}} of using attachments that can be adapted for clinical crowns of any height. The combination of fixing elements of an attachment determines sufficient fixation to provide high masticatory efficiency, and spatial stabilization of a denture, {{but at the same}} time it restricts partially, not completely, denture lability when functioning that is typical of rigid attachments and telescopic systems. The restricted lability determines a reduced load on parodontium <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> teeth due to the redistribution of a part of masticating pressure on alveolar mucosa. This attachment provides the distribution of masticating pressure along the long axis <b>of</b> an <b>abutment</b> tooth; it is physiological, and significantly reduces the risk of traumatic occlusion, mobility, and displacement <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> teeth.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} {{clinical}} study was to analyze the long-term treatment outcome of fixed partial dentures (FPD) with cantilevers. Materials and Methods: Ninety-two patients with 115 cantilever FPDs on 239 abutment teeth were examined. Immediately following cementation, radiographs <b>of</b> the <b>abutment</b> teeth were obtained. At the follow-up examination 5 to 16 years after cementation, the abutment teeth were clinically and radiographically evaluated. Besides the assessment of periodontal parameters and vitality testing, the presence of carious lesions <b>of</b> the <b>abutment</b> teeth, loss <b>of</b> retention, fracture of bridgework, and fracture <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> teeth were also recorded. The Student's t {{test was used to}} detect differences between abutment teeth and control teeth with natural crowns as well as over time within the groups. Results: Plaque scores and bleeding on probing were low at both abutment and nonabutment teeth. Mean probing pocket depth and level of the clinical attachment never exceeded 3. 0 mm in both groups. The radiographic bone levels at abutments were stable within 3 % over the observation period. Of the 120 initially vital abutment teeth, 12 (10 %) lost vitality during the observation period; one (1 %) of the 119 initially nonvital abutments showed periapical pathology. Development of secondary caries was observed at 8 % <b>of</b> the 239 <b>abutment</b> teeth. In total, 8 % <b>of</b> the <b>abutment</b> teeth were affected by loss of retention, which made up {{more than half of all}} technical problems. Material fractures only occurred occasionally, affecting from 1 % to less than 3 % <b>of</b> the <b>abutment</b> teeth. Fracture <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> teeth amounted to 3 % and was twice as frequent at abutments adjacent to cantilevers compared to abutments not adjacent to cantilevers. Conclusion: The most frequent biologic (caries) and technical complications (loss of retention) made up more than half of all problems recorded. These problems may be at least partially avoided by performing optimal plaque control and by strictly observing the rules for preparation <b>of</b> retentive FPD <b>abutments.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The {{mathematical}} model <b>of</b> the <b>abutment</b> tooth {{is the starting}} point of the finite element analysis of stress and deformation of dental structures. The simplest and easiest way is to form a model according to the literature data of dimensions and morphological characteristics of teeth. Our method is based on forming 3 D models using standard geometrical forms (objects) in programmes for solid modeling. Objective. Forming the {{mathematical model}} <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> <b>of</b> the second upper premolar for finite element analysis of stress and deformation of dental structures. Methods. The abutment tooth has a form of a complex geometric object. It is suitable for modeling in programs for solid modeling SolidWorks. After analyzing the literature data about the morphological characteristics of teeth, we started the modeling dividing the tooth (complex geometric body) into simple geometric bodies (cylinder, cone, pyramid, [...] .). Connecting simple geometric bodies together or substricting bodies from the basic body, we formed complex geometric body, tooth. The model is then transferred into Abaqus, a computational programme for finite element analysis. Transferring the data was done by standard file format for transferring 3 D models ACIS SAT. Results. Using the programme for solid modeling SolidWorks, we developed three models <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> <b>of</b> the second maxillary premolar: the model <b>of</b> the intact <b>abutment,</b> the model <b>of</b> the endodontically treated tooth with two remaining cavity walls and the model of the endodontically treated tooth with two remaining walls and inserted post. Conclusion Mathematical models <b>of</b> the <b>abutment</b> made according to the literature data are very similar with the real abutment and the simplifications are minimal. These models enable calculations of stress and deformation of the dental structures. The finite element analysis provides useful information in understanding biomechanical problems and gives guidance for clinical research...|$|R
40|$|This {{prospective}} {{clinical study}} evaluated the incidence <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> loosening <b>of</b> Morse taper-connection implants used for single-tooth replacement. In addition, the {{cumulative survival rate}} and the implant/crown success were evaluated. Implants were evaluated 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after insertion. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> loosening, modified Plaque Index, modified Sulcus Bleeding Index, probing depth, distance from the implant-crown margin to the coronal border of the peri-implant mucosa, width of keratinized mucosa, and the distance between implant shoulder and first bone-implant contact (DIB) were assessed. The cumulative survival rates were calculated with Kaplan-Meier estimates. Implant/crown success criteria included absence <b>of</b> <b>abutment</b> loosening, absence <b>of</b> suppuration and mobility, probing depth < 5. 0 mm, and DIB < 1. 5 mm after 12 months and not exceeding 0. 2 mm for each following year. Over a 4 -year period (2003 - 2007; mean follow-up per implant: 30. 79 months), 307 implants (162 maxillary, 145 mandibular) were inserted in 295 patients (125 men and 170 women aged between 24 and 79 years) at six different clinical centers.
