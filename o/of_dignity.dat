5|$|The {{disaster}} gained international notoriety {{due in part}} to {{a photograph}} taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named Omayra Sánchez, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E
5|$|The next day, Endara and {{his running}} mates, Ricardo Arias Calderón and Guillermo Ford, led a {{contingent}} of a thousand supporters to protest the annulment of the elections and urge that the ADOC candidates be recognized as the winners. The protest was attacked by a detachment <b>of</b> <b>Dignity</b> Battalions, a paramilitary group supporting Noriega, and the three candidates were badly beaten. Endara was struck with an iron club, leaving a gash on his head. He was briefly hospitalized and received eight stitches. Images of the attacks on Endara and Ford were carried by media around the world, and were credited with building public support in the US for the invasion that would soon follow.|$|E

25|$|In general, Filipino {{women find}} {{pride in their}} work. They do not find {{themselves}} alienated from their chores because they work with, around, and for their families. This family-oriented mindset gives them a sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and responsibility. The family and the children are the primary priority some Filipino women's life. In addition to doing housework, the contemporary role of a Filipino wife today is to provide financial support in the household by seeking employment in higher-earning occupations which then expands the Filipino female work outside the household.|$|E
25|$|There is {{sometimes}} corruption and theft {{by the employees}} of a shelter, as evidenced by a 2011 investigative report by FOX 25 TV in Boston wherein a number of Boston public shelter employees were found stealing large amounts of food {{over a period of}} time from the shelter's kitchen for their private use and catering. The homeless are often obliged to adopt various strategies of self-presentation in order to maintain a sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity,</b> which constrains their interaction with passers-by and leads to suspicion and stigmatization by the mainstream public.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} projects investigates the construction <b>of</b> human <b>dignity</b> in the lived experience of poor, Roma women in Oslo, Norway. It {{seeks to contribute}} to a more inclusive, less abstract interpretation <b>of</b> human <b>dignity,</b> taking into account the inner perspectives, lived experiences, and knowledge of persons unheard in current debates on human dignity. It shows that, while the theoretical interpretation <b>of</b> human <b>dignity</b> remains abstract, the construction <b>of</b> human <b>dignity</b> in the lived experience is complex, diverse and multifaceted. Poor, Roma women describe a gain or loss <b>of</b> human <b>dignity</b> in terms <b>of</b> personal integrity, autonomy of the person, group culture, basic needs, non-discrimination, and suffering. These components <b>of</b> human <b>dignity,</b> however, are rich, contextual, and interconnected, and cannot be easily separated in the lived experience. The gain or loss <b>of</b> human <b>dignity</b> is related to the women s inner perspectives, experiences, and identity, to their relationships, and to the environment. ...|$|R

25|$|Similarly, Emanuel {{argues that}} there are four major {{arguments}} presented by opponents of euthanasia: a) not all deaths are painful; b) alternatives, such as cessation of active treatment, combined {{with the use of}} effective pain relief, are available; c) the distinction between active and passive euthanasia is morally significant; and d) legalising euthanasia will place society on a slippery slope, which will lead to unacceptable consequences. In fact, in Oregon, in 2013, pain wasn't one of the top five reasons people sought euthanasia. Top reasons were a loss <b>of</b> <b>dignity,</b> and a fear of burdening others.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} others who point to the {{changing}} urban aspirations and prospects for mobility that can be seen in Indian cities such as Mumbai in which the film is set. The film is seen by D. Parthasarathy (2009) as reflecting a larger context of global cultural flows, which implicates issues of labour, status, ascription-achievement, and poverty in urban India. Parthasarathy (2009) argues for a better understanding of issues <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> of labour and that the film should be interpreted in a more nuanced way as reflecting the role of market forces and India’s new service economy in transforming the caste and status determined opportunity structure in urban India.|$|E
25|$|The letter {{condemned}} {{physical and}} verbal violence against homosexual persons, but asserted that condemnation of violence {{did not mean}} that the homosexual orientation was good or neutral or that homosexual sexual acts should be permitted. The letter also said that accepting homosexual acts as morally equivalent to married heterosexual acts was harmful to the family and society and warned bishops to be on guard against, and not to support, Catholic organizations not upholding the Church's doctrine on homosexualitygroups which the letter said were not really Catholic. This alluded to LGBT and LGBT-accepting Catholic groups such as DignityUSA and New Ways Ministry, and which ultimately resulted in the exclusion <b>of</b> <b>Dignity</b> from Church property.|$|E

25|$|During the 19th century {{there was}} a {{conscious}} revival of the style in Renaissance Revival architecture, that paralleled the Gothic Revival. Whereas the Gothic style was perceived by architectural theorists as being the most appropriate style for Church building, the Renaissance palazzo was a good model for urban secular buildings requiring an appearance <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and reliability such as banks, gentlemen's clubs and apartment blocks. Buildings that sought to impress, such as the Paris Opera, were often of a more Mannerist or Baroque style. Architects of factories, office blocks and department stores continued to use the Renaissance palazzo form into the 20th century, in Mediterranean Revival Style architecture with an Italian Renaissance emphasis.|$|E
25|$|Tocqueville's {{penetrating}} analysis {{sought to}} understand the peculiar nature of US political life. In describing the US, he agreed with thinkers such as Aristotle and Montesquieu that the balance of property determined the balance of political power, but his conclusions after that differed radically from those of his predecessors. Tocqueville tried {{to understand why the}} US was so different from Europe in the last throes of aristocracy. The US, in contrast to the aristocratic ethic, was a society where hard work and money-making was the dominant ethic, where the common man enjoyed a level <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> which was unprecedented, where commoners never deferred to elites, and where what he described as crass individualism and market capitalism had taken root to an extraordinary degree.|$|E
25|$|Charles Taylor, in his 2007 book A Secular Age, {{showed the}} {{historical}} role of deism, leading {{to what he}} calls an exclusive humanism. This humanism invokes a moral order, whose ontic commitment is wholly intra-human, with no reference to transcendence. One of the special achievements of such deism-based humanism is that it discloses new, anthropocentric moral sources by which human beings are motivated and empowered to accomplish acts of mutual benefit. This is the province of a buffered, disengaged self, which is the locus <b>of</b> <b>dignity,</b> freedom and discipline, and is endowed with a sense of human capability. According to Taylor, by the early 19th century this deism-mediated exclusive humanism developed as an alternative to Christian faith in a personal God and an order of miracles and mystery.|$|E
