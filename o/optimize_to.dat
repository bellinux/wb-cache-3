50|$|For {{deconvolution}} to be effective, {{all variables}} in the image scene and capturing device need to be modeled, including aperture, focal length, distance to subject, lens, and media refractive indices and geometries. Applying deconvolution successfully to general-purpose camera images is usually not feasible, because the geometries of the scene are not set. However, deconvolution is applied in reality to microscopy and astronomical imaging, where the value of gained sharpness is high, imaging devices and the relative subject positions are both well defined, and the imaging devices would cost {{a great deal more}} to <b>optimize</b> <b>to</b> improve sharpness physically. In cases where a stable, well-defined aberration is present, such as the lens defect in early Hubble Space Telescope images, deconvolution is an especially effective technique.|$|E

50|$|Many of the fungal {{partners}} {{involved in}} the endosymbiotic relationship with the bacteria are also in mutualistic or parasitic relationships with other plants. The presence of intracellular bacteria living within these fungi add another level of complexity and suggests that at some level, the plant is benefitting indirectly from the interaction between fungi and bacteria. About 80% of natural and cultivated plants harbour AM fungi. These interactions increase nutrient availability in the plant and lead to increased plant growth and environmental stress-resistance. There exists a current demand in agriculture to cultivate and <b>optimize</b> <b>to</b> increase yield sustainably. Without considering the bacteria that live within AM fungi, like Ca. G. sporarum, as a factor that may contribute the beneficial nature of AM fungi to plants, we may overlook what makes widespread agricultural application possible. On {{the other side of}} the spectrum are the fungi that cause disease in agricultural crops leading to huge loses, such as R. microsporus which causes blight in rice seedlings. R. microsporus relies on its bacterial partner of the Burkholderia sp. for the pathogenic toxin. Previous efforts to control infection included the use of harmful pesticides to eliminate the fungi, however more recent research takes into mind the role of the endosymbiotic bacteria in pathogenesis and uses phages to target the bacteria. We can see that fungal-bacterial endosymbiosis significantly impacts the global concern of food production and we can think of the deeper understanding of these relationships as being the solution to these problems.|$|E

40|$|While widely {{acknowledged}} as highly effective in com-puter vision, multi-label MRFs with non-convex priors {{are difficult to}} <b>optimize.</b> <b>To</b> tackle this, we introduce an algo-rithm that iteratively approximates the original energy with an appropriately weighted surrogate energy that is easier to minimize. Our algorithm guarantees that the original en-ergy decreases at each iteration. In particular, we consider the scenario where the global minimizer of the weighted surrogate energy {{can be obtained by}} a multi-label graph cut algorithm, and show that our algorithm then lets us han-dle of large variety of non-convex priors. We demonstrate the benefits of our method over state-of-the-art MRF energy minimization techniques on stereo and inpainting problems. 1...|$|E
