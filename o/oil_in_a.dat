Paella is a characteristic Spanish dish, originally from Valencia, radiating {{early on to}} Catalonia and Murcia along Spain's Mediterranean coast. It comes in many versions, and may contain a mixture of chicken, pork, rabbit, or shellfish, sautéed in olive <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large shallow pan, with vegetables, and typically round-grain rice (often of the local albufera, arròs bomba, sénia varieties or similar) cooked to absorb the water and coloured with saffron. The dish may be varied with artichoke hearts, peas, sweet peppers, lima beans, string beans, or sausages.|$|E

25|$|There are {{generally}} {{three types of}} liquids: mineral, semi-synthetic, and synthetic. Semi-synthetic and synthetic cutting fluids represent attempts to combine the best properties of oil with the best properties of water by suspending emulsified <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> water base.

25|$|The total {{estimated}} {{amount of oil}} in an oil reservoir, including both producible and non-producible oil, is called oil in place. However, because of reservoir characteristics and limitations in petroleum extraction technologies, {{only a fraction of}} this oil can be brought to the surface, and it is only this producible fraction that is considered to be reserves. The ratio of reserves to the total amount of <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> particular reservoir is called the recovery factor. Determining a recovery factor for a given field depends on several features of the operation, including method of oil recovery used and technological developments.|$|E
25|$|The world's largest {{deposits}} of bitumen are in Canada, although Venezuela's {{deposits of}} extra-heavy crude oil are even bigger. Canada has vast energy resources {{of all types}} and its {{oil and natural gas}} resource base would be large enough to meet Canadian needs for generations if demand was sustained. Abundant hydroelectric resources account for the majority of Canada's electricity production and very little electricity is produced from <b>oil.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> scenario with oil prices above US$100, Canada would have more than enough energy to meet its growing needs, with the excess oil production from its oil sands probably going to export. The major importing country would probably continue to be the United States, although before the developments in 2014, there was increasing demand for oil, particularly heavy oil, from Asian countries such as China and India.|$|E

25|$|Researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture have {{investigated}} whether hydrogenation {{can be achieved}} without the side effect of trans fat production. They varied the pressure under which the chemical reaction was conducted— applying 1400kPa (200psi) of pressure to soybean <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2-liter vessel while heating it to between 140°C and 170°C. The standard 140kPa (20psi) process of hydrogenation produces a product of about 40% trans fatty acid by weight, compared to about 17% using the high-pressure method. Blended with unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil, the high-pressure-processed oil produced margarine containing 5 to 6% trans fat. Based on current U.S. labeling requirements (see below), the manufacturer could claim the product was free of trans fat. The level of trans fat may also be altered by modification of the temperature {{and the length of}} time during hydrogenation.|$|E
25|$|Century eggs can {{be eaten}} without further preparation, {{on their own}} or as a side dish. As an hors d'œuvre, the Cantonese wrap chunks of this egg with slices of pickled ginger root (sometimes sold on a stick as street food). A Shanghainese recipe mixes chopped century eggs with chilled tofu. In Taiwan, it is popular to eat century eggs by slicing them, and placed on top of cold tofu with katsuobushi, soy sauce, and sesame <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> style similar to Japanese hiyayakko. A {{variation}} of this recipe common in northern China is to slice century eggs over chilled silken (soft) tofu, adding liberal quantities of shredded young ginger and chopped spring onions as a topping, and then drizzling light soy sauce and sesame oil over the dish, to taste. They are also used in a dish called old-and-fresh eggs, where chopped century eggs are combined with (or used to top) an omelet made with fresh eggs. The century eggs may also be cut into chunks and stir fried with vegetables, which is most commonly found in Taiwanese cuisine.|$|E

She glances across the room at the Tony citation—recognizing her nomination for best featured actress in a musical—as she describes how her throat became infected due to a reaction to the <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> haze-making compound that designers pump onstage to enhance lighting effects. She missed a lot of performances, and an untold number of Tony voters missed her performance. She can't help but wonder how that affected the outcome." [...] At one point, Gaven's understudy Alice Ripley took her place for eight consecutive weeks while Gaven recovered. Gaven eventually had to leave The Who's Tommy some months after it opened because of her allergy. She also disliked the idea of performing in one musical for more than a year.|$|E
