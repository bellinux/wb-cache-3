50|$|The vessel is also {{equipped}} with four 25-person SOLAS inflatable rafts; six 65-person <b>open</b> <b>reversible</b> rafts; one 6.5 meter Rapid Intervention Boat with a speed {{in excess of}} 25 knots and an 85 nautical mile range, launched from the stern transom ramp; four 4.5 meter Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats are carried on the bridge deck and launched by an Elbeck crane; and one Twinlock Decompression chamber, consisting of two berth inner lock and medical outer lock. A separate survivor's area has {{been included in the}} vessel's arrangement, which provides for the decompression chamber, medical reception, operation theater and seating in an open plan arrangement. It takes a crew of 37: six officers, six petty officers, a medical officer that is also a hyperbaric specialist, two rescue divers, a corpsman and twenty-one ratings. Acquired through soft loans from Australia initiated in 1997, each ship originally cost A$19 million, reduced to A$16.7 million.|$|R

The tramway {{was built by}} the workmen of the Corporation and consisted of a single line with a passing loop at the centre. It was built to a gauge of 2ft 6in. The Corporation provided open and covered cars. The <b>open</b> one had <b>reversible</b> seats for 24 passengers, and the closed one could accommodate 16 passengers. The fare was 1d.

40|$|A photofunctionalized square bipyramidal DNA nanocapsule (NC) was {{designed}} and prepared {{for the creation of}} a nanomaterial carrier. Photocontrollable open/close system and toehold system were introduced into the NC for the inclusion and release of a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) by photoirradiation and strand displacement. The <b>reversible</b> <b>open</b> and closed states were examined by gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the open behavior was directly observed by high-speed AFM. The encapsulation of the DNA-modified AuNP within the NC was carried out by hybridization of a specific DNA strand (capture strand), and the release of the AuNP was examined by addition of toehold-containing complementary DNA strand (release strand). The release of the AuNP from the NC was achieved by the opening of the NC and subsequent strand displacement...|$|R
40|$|Mouse tumor {{models have}} {{undergone}} profound {{improvements in the}} fidelity of emulating human disease. Replacing ectopic s. c. implantation with organ-specific orthotopic implantation reproduces human tumor growth and metastasis. Strong fluorescent labeling with green fluorescent protein along with inexpensive video detectors, positioned externally to the mouse, allows the monitoring of details of tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastatic spread. However, the sensitivity of external imaging is limited by light scattering in intervening tissue, most especially in skin. <b>Opening</b> a <b>reversible</b> skin-flap in the light path markedly reduces signal attenuation, increasing detection sensitivity many-fold. The observable depth of tissue is thereby greatly increased and many tumors that were previously hidden are now clearly observable. This report presents tumor images and related quantitative growth data previously impossible to obtain. Single tumor cells, expressing green fluorescent protein, were seeded on the brain image through a scalp skin-flap. Lung tumor microfoci representing a few cells are viewed through a skin-flap over the chest wall, while contralateral micrometastases were imaged through the corresponding skin-flap. Pancreatic tumors and their angiogenic microvessels were imaged {{by means of a}} peritoneal wall skin-flap. A skin-flap over the liver allowed imaging of physiologically relevant micrometastases originating in an orthotopically implanted tumor. Single tumor cells on the liver arising from intraportal injection also were detectable. Possible future technical developments are suggested by the image, through a lower-abdominal skin-flap, of an invasive prostate tumor expressing both red and green fluorescent proteins in separate colonies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Three {{reversible}} continuous time Markov chain {{models for}} ion channels {{based on the}} reversibility of these biological systems are presented. It is shown that the single ion trans paths {{from left to right}} and those from right to left are equivalent in distribution. This explains an interesting phenomenon observed by biophysicists, that the distribution of time needed for ions to transit an ion channel is the same in either direction, even if there is an electric potential difference across the channel. The distribution of transit time is important in determining the capacity of cell to cell signaling. The first model assumes that there is no interaction between the ions in order to obtain a <b>reversible</b> <b>open</b> system model as the infinite ion limit of a reversible closed system. Then, interaction is brought into the model in two different ways to obtain the doormat model and the floormat model. The entrance rates do not depend on the channel state in the doormat model, but do in the floormat model. The effects of trans-membrane potentials, interaction strength and entrance rates are discussed. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{reversible}} data hiding mechanism based on multiresolution analysis with difference expansion algorithm. Based on the multiresolution analysis of an image, gradient information of crude original image is exploited to select proper embedding areas. Adaptively embedding method based on Difference Expansion Algorithm is proposed to embed data into the host image without causing overflow / underflow and distortion problems. The original host image {{can be obtained}} upon the extraction of the embedded information. Driving application of reversible date hiding is authentic {{and can be used}} in some special applications, such as law enforcement, banks, medical and military fields, where original cover media is required for legal reason. Embedding data into cover media while keeping the media <b>reversible</b> <b>opens</b> a new door for linking some data with original media. With this proposed method we ensure that the Host information improves the compression efficiency, and thus the lossless data embedding capability is achieved. Experimental results signify that the proposed reversible data hiding method can embed a large payload with low visual distortion in the host image...|$|R
40|$|Human {{mitochondrial}} NAD(P) (+) -dependent malic enzyme {{was strongly}} inhibited by Lu 3 +. The X-ray crystal structures indicated a structural change between the metal-free and Lu 3 +-containing enzymes (Yang Z, Batra R, Floyd DL, Hung HC, Chang GG, Tong L. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2000; 274 : 440 - 444). We characterized the reversible slow-binding mechanism and the structural interconversion. between Mn 2 +- and Lu 3 +-containing human mitochondrial malic enzymes. When Lu 2 + was added, {{the activity of}} the human enzyme showed a downward curve over time, {{similar to that of the}} pigeon enzyme. The rate of the transformation (k(obs)) from the initial rate to the steady-state rate increased hyperbolically with the concentration of Lu 3 +, suggesting the involvement of an isomerization step. Lu 3 + had a much higher affinity for the isomerized form (K*(i,Lu(app)) = 4. 8 muM) than that of the native form (K-i,K-Lu (app) = 148 muM). When an excess of Mn 2 + was added to the Lu 3 +. inhibited enzyme, assays of the kinetic activity showed an upward trend, indicating reactivation. This result also indicated that the reactivation was a slow process. Fluorescence quenching experiments confirmed that the Lu 3 +-induced isomerization was completely reversible. The dynamic quenching constants for the metal-free, Mn 2 +-containing, and Lu 3 +-containing enzyme were 3. 08, 3. 07, and 3. 8 M- 1, respectively. When the Lu 3 +-containing enzyme was treated with excess Mn 2 +, the dynamic quenching constant returned to the original value (3. 09 M- 1). These results. indicated that binding of Mn 2 + did not induce any conformational change in the enzyme. The open form transformed to the closed form only after substrate binding. Lu 3 +, on the other hand, transformed the open form into a catalytically inactive form. Excess Mn 2 + could replace Lu 3 + in the metal binding site and convert the inactive form back into the <b>open</b> form. This <b>reversible</b> process was slow in both directions because of the same but opposite structural change involved. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
