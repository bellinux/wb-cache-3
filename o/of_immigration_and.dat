5|$|Historically, {{the largest}} ethnic group inhabiting the Zaolzie area was the Poles. During the 19th century {{the number of}} Germans grew. At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century and later from 1920 to 1938, the Czech population grew significantly (mainly as a result <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>and</b> the assimilation of locals) and the Poles became a minority, which they are to this day.|$|E
5|$|Canada is a {{multilingual}} {{and multicultural}} society home {{to people of}} many different ethnic, religious and national origins, {{with the majority of}} the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants. Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization, different waves (or peaks) <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>and</b> settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today. Elements of Indigenous, French, British, and more recent immigrant customs, languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada and thus a Canadian identity. Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the United States.|$|E

5|$|Stevenson also {{advocated}} {{careful study}} of the state's finances to deal with increasing expenditures. He insisted that the state stop covering its short-term indebtedness using bonds. However, Stevenson was willing to tax to benefit segregation in schools, and helped create the state bureau of education in 1870. Because most blacks possessed little property of significant value, the new tax yielded little revenue to support their educational institutions. State legislators rejected his 1870 proposal to create a state bureau <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>and</b> statistics to spur interest in and migration to the state. He did persuade the legislators to make some improvements in the state's penal and eleemosynary institutions, including establishing a House of Reform for juvenile offenders.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the largest}} {{specified}} ethnic group inhabiting this area were those identifying as Poles. Under Austrian rule, Cieszyn Silesia was initially {{divided into three}} (Bielitz, Friedek and Teschen), and later into four districts (plus Freistadt). One of them, Frýdek, had a mostly Czech population, the other three were mostly inhabited by Poles. During the 19th century the number of ethnic Germans grew. After declining {{at the end of}} the 19th century, at the beginning of the 20th century and later from 1920 to 1938 the Czech population grew significantly (mainly as a result <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>and</b> the assimilation of locals) and Poles became a minority, which they are to this day. Another significant ethnic group were the Jews, but almost the entire Jewish population was exterminated during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) {{began on}} January 24, 1848, when gold {{was found by}} James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California {{from the rest of}} the United States and abroad. The sudden influx <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>and</b> gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and California became one of the few American states to go {{directly}} to statehood without first being a territory, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease, genocide and starvation. By the time it ended, California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory to the home state of the first nominee for the Republican Party.|$|E
