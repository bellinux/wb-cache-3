50|$|Blue Riding Breeches: The current {{light blue}} {{breeches}} {{with a white}} stripe along the <b>outseam</b> were introduced in 1822. The original breeches in 1762 were also light blue, but between 1774-1822 different colours were used, yellow were however most common.|$|E
5000|$|A dinner jacket (British English) or tuxedo (American English, also colloquially {{known as}} [...] "tux"), dinner suit, or DJ is a semi-formal evening suit {{distinguished}} primarily by satin or grosgrain facings on the jacket's lapels and buttons {{and a similar}} stripe along the <b>outseam</b> of the trousers.|$|E
50|$|To {{maximize}} yield, most jeans {{are made}} from wide denim and have a straight <b>outseam</b> that utilizes the full width of the fabric, including the edges. Selvedge denim {{has come to be}} associated with premium quality jeans, which show the finished edges from the loom rather than the overlocked edges that are shown on other jeans.|$|E
5000|$|The Philadelphia Phillies {{added an}} {{alternate}} uniform that emulates their 1948 uniforms, {{which was all}} off-white with no red pinstripes, but have red and blue trim around the neck, sleeve ends and <b>outseams</b> of the pants, and a blue hat with a red [...] "P" [...] and bill. The interleague alternate hat (Red hat with blue bill with white P with blue star in the middle) was dropped; ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1947: After {{designing}} and testing 13 pairs of prototype jeans, Blue Bell introduces the Wrangler 11MWZ to American consumers. The Wrangler Jeans featured several innovations aimed particularly at cowboys: Felled <b>outseams</b> and inseams, rear pockets positioned for {{comfort in the}} saddle, 'no scratch' rivet pocket reinforcement, a zipper fly, and use of a strong tack in the crotch instead of a metal rivet. A promotional campaign is launched featuring 11MWZ test riders and rodeo legends Freckles Brown, Bill Linderman, and Jim Shoulders.|$|R
5000|$|By World War I, {{the grey}} option {{had fallen out}} of favour but the [...] "midnight blue" [...] {{alternative}} became increasingly popular and rivalled black by the mid 1930s. Notch lapels, imported from the ordinary business suit, were a brief vogue in the 1920s. [...] A single stripe of braid covering the <b>outseam</b> on each leg was an occasional variation at first, but became standard by the 1930s. At this time double-breasted jackets and white jackets became popular for wear in hot weather.|$|E
30|$|There {{has been}} little {{research}} and reference regarding pants lining patternmaking methods. The suggested manufacturing methods for pants lining in literature (Nam and Lee 2005; Kwak et al. 2008) are as follows: 1  cm circumference ease {{on the front and}} 0.5  cm from the both the inseam line and the <b>outseam</b> line. As the circumference increases, the front crotch length increases. The length for the pants lining may be 7 – 10  cm below the knee line of the pant leg.|$|E
30|$|On the front, the X {{values of}} the point ➀, ➁, and ➂ {{were the same as}} − 0.34 cm, which means moving to left from the center front line. The {{counterpart}} point (➄, ➅) X values were the same as 0.4 cm, which means moving to the right from the side seam. The bottom of the lining pattern (around the knee level), the point ➃ and ➆ values are − 0.18 and 0.35 cm. These values are not similar; the inseam point ➃ (− 0.18 cm), was less than the <b>outseam</b> point ➆ (0.35 cm). The point ➇, which determines the length of the pants lining was − 2.31 cm below the knee line. The length of pants lining varied; the longest lining panel was 7 cm below the knee line, while the shortest one was 5 cm above the knee line. These results were also different from the comparative literature, which stated 10 cm below and 7 cm below the knee line was average. The length of the pants lining pattern in menswear brands was shorter than that in the literature reviews.|$|E
