5|$|During the 1911 {{football}} season Baker scored 92 points, {{a school record}} that lasted until 1974. Princeton finished the 1912 season with seven wins, one loss, and one tie in nine games. As the Princeton hockey team did not have its own ice rink, most of their home games were played in New York City at the St. Nicholas Rink, {{one of the few}} facilities in the world with artificial ice at the time. The team finished the 1911–12 hockey season with a record of eight wins and two losses in ten games. During his sophomore year, Baker was invited to join the Ivy Club, the oldest and most prestigious of the eating clubs that were at the center <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>life</b> at the university.|$|E
5|$|During the Han, {{the empire}} {{was divided into}} large {{administrative}} units of kingdoms and commanderies; within a commandery there were counties, and within counties there were districts that contained at least several hamlets. An average hamlet contained about a hundred families and usually was enclosed by a wall with two gates. At the center <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>life</b> in the hamlet was the religious altar (built in honor of a local deity) where festivities could be staged. Each district and county also had an official religious altar. The official reach of government extended {{no further than the}} district level, where county-appointed officials included the chief of police who maintained law and order and the district tax collector. However, the government was able to control local society at the hamlet level with their bestowal of twenty ranks.|$|E
5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life, social interaction, the social construction of self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>life</b> such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E

It regularly hosted dinners, bingo events, and from the 1940s onwards showed movies every Sunday night after they had been shown to the inmates during the day on Saturday and Sunday. The club was responsible for organizing numerous special events on the island (held either in the hall or the Parade Grounds) and the fundraising associated with it, anything from ice cream and watermelon feasts to Halloween fancy dress and Christmas parties.|$|E
5|$|While {{publishing}} short {{articles on}} the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay De quelques formes primitives de classification written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 magnum opus The Elementary Forms of Religious Life. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought {{to understand how the}} concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>life.</b> He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not a priori. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time. In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of rationalism and empiricism, arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabla rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal a priori's (as Kant argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.|$|E
5|$|After the Reformation, and the {{departure}} of the Scottish court in 1603, artists and artisans looked to secular patronage and estate houses became repositories of art and of elaborate furnishings. Estate houses were adorned with paintings, wood carvings and plasterwork. The Grand Tour encouraged the collection of classical art and the adoption of classical styles for new works that were incorporated into the Adam Style. The Baronial revival resulted a synthesised Victorian style that combined elements of the Renaissance, symbols of landed power and national affiliation with modern fittings. From the late sixteenth century, many estate houses were surrounded by gardens influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens. From the late seventeenth century the formal gardens at Versailles and Dutch gardens were important models. In the eighteenth century less formal and symmetrical layouts became common with the development of the jardin anglais. In the nineteenth century there was a return of the formal garden near to the house. The development of the Palladian country house in the seventeenth century separated the family of the householder from the servants. Gentry families spent much of their time visiting family, friends or neighbours and hospitality was an important part of life. Major activities included hunting, cards, chess and music. Large and sumptuous meals were an important part <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>life.</b> In the eighteenth century, estate houses were designed as centres of public display, but in the nineteenth century they became increasingly private and developed distinct male areas.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} of Indian women in society further deteriorated during the medieval period, when child marriages and {{a ban on}} remarriage by widows became part <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>life</b> in some communities in India. The Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent brought purdah to Indian society. Among the Rajputs of Rajasthan, the Jauhar was practised. In some parts of India, some of Devadasis were sexually exploited. Polygamy was practised among Hindu Kshatriya rulers for some political reasons. In many Muslim families, women were restricted to Zenana areas of the house.|$|E
25|$|Imperial {{states and}} feudal states, both low in infrastructural power, {{depend on the}} despotic rule of an elite class for {{societal}} order. Monarchs and emperors of the past could not extend their direct rule to every aspect <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>life</b> {{without the aid of}} modern technology. Beginning with the Industrial Revolution, the infrastructural power of developed states rose rapidly. In the modern era, developed states became able to monitor their populations; provide employment, health care and welfare; impact all levels of the economy; and more. In this way, they obtained their infrastructural power.|$|E
