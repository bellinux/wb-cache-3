5|$|As an {{official}} {{history of the}} Japanese Navy, Sakamoto's work {{was considered to be}} official admission of the attacking submarine's identity. Subsequently, most sources assumed as fact Nakagawa's and I-177s role in the loss of Centaur. Nakagawa refused to speak on the subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Centaur following the war crimes investigation at the end of World War II, even to defend himself or deny the claims made by Rohwer's and Sakamoto's works, and died in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sakonju's fears, the Allies {{were not}} {{immediately}} aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Behar. Her distress signal {{had been picked}} up by only a single Allied merchant ship, which did not report it until she arrived at Fremantle on 17March. In the meantime, Somerville had decided on 16March that surface raiders no longer posed a threat to shipping in the Indian Ocean and allowed Allied vessels to resume their normal routing.|$|E

5|$|Elements {{took part}} in the capture of Engebi in the Eniwetok Atoll on 18 February 1944, code named Operation Catchpole. Because of the speed and success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Kwajalein, the attack was {{undertaken}} several months ahead of schedule. After a week of fighting, the division secured the islands of the atoll. The division then returned to Hawaii to continue training. There, in June 1944, General Douglas MacArthur and President Franklin Roosevelt personally reviewed the division.|$|E
5|$|The YB-17s {{quickly became}} {{obsolete}} and were transferred in October 1940 to the 19th Bomb Group at March Field, California, when the 2d BG acquired newer models. During World War II they operated again at Langley Field until mid-1942. The Air Corps belatedly put the B-17 into mass production beginning in July 1940, {{but at the}} time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Pearl Harbor still had only 198 in service. However, 12,000 were produced during the war, became the backbone of the air war against Germany, and were an iconic symbol of the AAF.|$|E

5|$|Fairbanks {{received}} word <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Pearl Harbor via civilian shortwave radio operators who passed {{the news to}} the U.S. Army base. More than 200 civil defense volunteers immediately signed up for work that included orchestrating a town blackout, blocking town airfields, and making emergency plans to evacuate the town {{in the event of}} an attack. In June 1942, the invasion of the Aleutian Islands and the bombing of Dutch Harbor intensified the war's effect on Fairbanks. Ladd Field's cold-weather testing detachment was disbanded as its soldiers were used to bolster Alaska defenses at other locations.|$|E
5|$|Grant's Union Army of the Tennessee of the District of Cairo {{consisted}} of three divisions, commanded by Brig. Gens. McClernand, C.F. Smith, and Lew Wallace. (At the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Fort Donelson, Wallace was a brigade commander in reserve at Fort Henry, but was summoned on February 14 and charged with assembling a new division that included reinforcements arriving by steamship, including Charles Cruft's brigade on loan from Buell.) Two regiments of cavalry and eight batteries of artillery supported the infantry divisions. Altogether, the Union forces numbered nearly 25,000 men, although {{at the start of}} the battle, only 15,000 were available.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They {{caught up with the}} Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability {{to catch up with the}} Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E

5|$|In late April, the {{division}} loaded onto troop trains {{for a trip}} to the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia {{along with the rest of}} the 31st Army, which was transferring to the 1st Ukrainian Front for the final push to Prague. It disembarked in Saxony on the night of May 6. The army's role was as a flank guard on the left of the 1st Ukrainian Front, protecting the northern prong <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> the Czech capital. Advancing against little organized resistance, the 331st was on the outskirts of the town of Schlewitz when it got word of the German surrender.|$|E
5|$|Indiana was {{the first}} of the country's western states to {{mobilize}} for the Civil War. When news reached Indiana <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Fort Sumter, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861, many Indiana residents were surprised, but their response was immediate. On the following day, two mass meetings were held in Indianapolis, the state capital of Indiana, and the state's position was decided: Indiana would remain in the Union and would immediately contribute men to suppress the rebellion. On April 15, Indiana's governor, Oliver P. Morton, issued a call for volunteer soldiers to meet the state's quota set by President Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Just as World War I had a {{significant}} impact on the college, World War II was pivotal in the college's history too. Within four days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Pearl Harbor, thirteen students withdrew from the college to join the military. The enrollment dropped from 2,077 students in 1940 to a low of 860 students (21% were men) in spring 1943. Faculty decreased to as low as 60 from 112 before the war had begun. Before the war was over, 3,500 SDSC graduates, students, former students, and faculty entered the armed forces, with 135 losing their lives. Not surprisingly for a city dominated by a naval base, a large majority joined the Navy. Others joined the Air Corps, participating in the Doolittle Raid over Japan and battles over the Philippines and the East Indies.|$|E

5|$|Kunivas' {{condition}} worsens, and Korris, Konmel, and Worf {{are present}} when he dies, {{and the three}} let out a fierce roar as per Klingon custom. As they return to the Klingons' quarters, Konmel is disappointed that Kunivas was not killed by an enemy, leading Worf to question the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> the freighter; Korris and Konmel quickly change the subject. Worf forces Korris to reveal the truth: the three had commandeered the freighter, in order to seek out a place they could live as true Klingons, and {{the damage to the}} freighter was a result of a battle with a Klingon ship. When the two are seen near the ship's battle bridge, hoping to steal the drive section and escape the crew on the saucer, they are placed in the brig.|$|E
5|$|Rising {{tension between}} Japan and the United States {{stretched}} back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria in the Mukden Incident. Japan's continued aggression, instigating the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and invading French Indochina in 1940to which the United States and European powers responded with embargoes on iron and oil importsfurther heightened the tension. The Japanese thereafter decided {{to attack the}} Western powers in Asia, beginning with a surprise attack on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor. When the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Mahan was at sea with the aircraft carrier , three cruisers and four destroyers as part of Task Force 12. Lexingtons mission was to ferry Marine aircraft to reinforce Midway Island. After news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Pearl Harbor, the task-force commander received orders to terminate the ferry mission and {{to search for the}} Japanese strike force. Unable to locate them, the task force returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 December.|$|E
5|$|The plans {{called for}} two {{simultaneous}} attacks against Allied naval {{vessels in the}} Indian and South Pacific oceans. These attacks were intended as diversions ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Midway Island in the North Pacific, with the Japanese hoping to convince the Allies that they intended to attack to the south or west of their conquests. Eleven submarines of the 8th Submarine Squadron were {{to carry out the}} two attacks, the five submarines of the Western Attack Group in the Indian Ocean, and the six submarines of the Eastern Attack Group in the Pacific Ocean. The submarine groups were to select a suitable port of attack, based on their own reconnaissance.|$|E

25|$|Fassbinder {{did little}} to {{discourage}} <b>the</b> personalized nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> himself and his work.

5|$|When news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Camp Holloway reached Saigon on {{the morning}} of 7 February 1965, General William Westmoreland, McGeorge Bundy and Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, flew out to Pleiku to survey the damage. Bundy then called President Johnson to put forward the MACV's request for retaliatory air strikes against North Vietnam. In {{response}} to Bundy's request, Johnson hastily convened a session of the National Security Council, which involved the speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader, to discuss the need for reprisal against the Communists in Vietnam. That afternoon, General Nguyễn Khánh arrived in Pleiku to meet with Westmoreland and Bundy, and they both informed him that recommendations for air strikes against North Vietnam had been made to the President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|At 03:30 {{local time}} on 8 December 1941 (about 09:00 on 7 December in Hawaii), Sutherland learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Pearl Harbor and {{informed}} MacArthur. At 05:30, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, General George Marshall, ordered MacArthur {{to execute the}} existing war plan, Rainbow Five. MacArthur did nothing. On three occasions, {{the commander of the}} Far East Air Force, Major General Lewis H. Brereton, requested permission to attack Japanese bases in Formosa, in accordance with prewar intentions, but was denied by Sutherland. Not until 11:00 did Brereton speak with MacArthur about it, and obtained permission. MacArthur later denied having the conversation. At 12:30, nine hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, aircraft of Japan's 11th Air Fleet achieved complete tactical surprise when they attacked Clark Field and the nearby fighter base at Iba Field, and destroyed or disabled 18 of Far East Air Force's 35 B-17s, 53 of its 107 P-40s, three P-35s, and more than 25 other aircraft. Most were destroyed on the ground. Substantial damage was done to the bases, and casualties totaled 80 killed and 150 wounded. What was left of the Far East Air Force was all but destroyed over the next few days.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{situation}} was stabilized, the South Vietnamese were forced to retreat into small compounds at {{the north and south}} ends of the town. The intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> Lộc Ninh revealed the true intentions of the Communists; ARVN Lieutenant General Nguyễn Văn Minh, commander of the III Corps Tactical Zone, and his American advisor Major General James F. Hollingsworth realized that Bình Long, not Tây Ninh, would be the focus of the Communist offensive. In order to halt the Communist advance, Minh and Hollingsworth directed all available tactical support aircraft towards Lộc Ninh. Almost immediately, Republic of Vietnam Air Force F-5 and A-1 fighter-bombers, United States Air Force (USAF) A-37s from the 8th Special Operations Squadron based at Biên Hòa, attack aircraft from the aircraft carrier , and USAF F-4 and AC-130 aircraft from Thailand began flying over the skies of Lộc Ninh. U.S. and South Vietnamese tactical support aircraft were directed against Viet Cong and North Vietnamese formations by American advisers on the ground. As the fighting intensified, Colonel Nguyễn Công Vinh ordered the 1st Cavalry Squadron — commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Huu Duong — to withdraw from Fire Support Base Alpha to reinforce Lộc Ninh. However, Duong refused, saying he would surrender his unit to the Viet Cong instead. Angered, Captain Mark A. Smith reportedly threatened to destroy the 1st Cavalry Squadron with American air power if the squadron didn't fight.|$|E
