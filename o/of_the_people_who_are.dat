Most interpretations identify aspects of law and legality as important in his work, in which the legal system is often oppressive. The law in Kafka's works, rather than being representative of any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces. These are hidden from the individual but control the lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> innocent victims of systems beyond their control.
