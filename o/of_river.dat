5|$|Much {{of what is}} now MD291 was {{constructed}} as two different highways. MD291 proper ran from MD290 near Chesterville through Millington to the Delaware state line. MD447 connected US213 in Chestertown and MD290 in Chesterville, using MD291's current corridor from Chestertown to Morgnec and a more northerly path from Morgnec to Chesterville. MD291 {{was constructed}} as a concrete road from Millington to the Delaware state line in 1929 and 1930; the portion <b>of</b> <b>River</b> Road on which MD290 runs concurrently with MD291 was paved in concrete in the same time span. The concrete highway was extended west from Millington to Mills Branch in two sections, the eastern part completed in 1933 and the western segment built in 1934 and 1935. Kent County included the portion <b>of</b> <b>River</b> Road between MD290 and Mills Branch as its top priority in the post-war construction program; that segment was surfaced and brought into the state highway system as an extension of MD291 in 1946.|$|E

40|$|In {{the master}} degree thesis, we {{evaluated}} the effect <b>of</b> transverse <b>river</b> structures on longitudinal connectivity <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> and {{fish in the}} Sora River basin. At first, the types <b>of</b> transverse <b>river</b> structures with potential impact on fish migration in rivers were defined (weir, dam, rock-ramp, sluice gate, torrential barrier, road culvert). At the investigated Sora River basin we collected data on 150 transverse river structures, including 19 dams, 126 weirs and 5 rock-ramps. Several different methods for priority ranking <b>of</b> transverse <b>river</b> structures {{in order to improve}} longitudinal connectivity <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> were reviewed, and based on the available data and the suitability of the considered methods, we selected the Canadian method. For the Sora River basin we calculated dendritic connectivity index – DCIp index. We also calculated the theoretical DCIp indexes for determination <b>of</b> transverse <b>river</b> structures that have the greatest impact on migration of potamodromous fish. Transverse river structures, higher than 20 cm, were considered as impassable for fish. The result of the DCIp index of the examined Sora River basin showed a high pressure <b>of</b> transverse <b>river</b> structures, impassable for fish. Based on the calculated DCIp index values, we made a priority list <b>of</b> transverse <b>river</b> structures, where the establishment of longitudinal connectivity <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> for fish needs to be done. Also the solutions for establishment of longitudinal connectivity <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> for fish were reviewed. In the last part of master degree thesis we covered the Slovenian legislation regarding transverse river structures and longitudinal connectivity <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> and fish, and further guidance to improve longitudinal connectivity <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> was given...|$|R
