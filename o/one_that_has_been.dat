5|$|Several {{stations}} {{proposed for}} the DART Light Rail network are classified as deferred. As defined by DART, a deferred station is <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> identified, but will not be constructed until land use changes warrant {{the construction of a}} station. In addition to the deferred stations, the network also features a single ghost station, the Knox–Henderson Station. The underground station was excavated {{at the time of the}} original construction of the Red and Blue Lines, only to have plans subsequently scrapped due to neighborhood opposition.|$|E
5|$|Triadic pyramids first {{appeared}} in the Preclassic. They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform. The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petén Basin; it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV, the largest pyramid at Tikal. The three superstructures all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform. No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known, but they may have developed from the eastern range building of E-Group complexes. The triadic form was the predominant architectural form in the Petén region during the Late Preclassic. Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites. At Nakbe, there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature. At El Mirador there are probably as many as 36 triadic structures. Examples of the triadic form are even known from Dzibilchaltun in the far north of the Yucatán Peninsula, and Q'umarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala. The triadic pyramid remained a popular architectural form for centuries after the first examples were built; it continued in use into the Classic Period, with later examples being found at Uaxactun, Caracol, Seibal, Nakum, Tikal and Palenque. The Q'umarkaj example is the only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> dated to the Postclassic Period. The triple-temple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to Maya mythology.|$|E

25|$|The {{lives of}} Paleo-Eskimos {{of the far}} north were largely {{unaffected}} {{by the arrival of}} visiting Norsemen except for mutual trade. Labrador Inuit have had the longest continuous contact with Europeans. After the disappearance of the Norse colonies in Greenland, the Inuit had no contact with Europeans for at least a century. By the mid-16th century, Basque whalers and fishermen were already working the Labrador coast and had established whaling stations on land, such as the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> excavated at Red Bay. The Inuit appear not to have interfered with their operations, but they raided the stations in winter for tools and items made of worked iron, which they adapted to their own needs.|$|E

Some populations of invasive Spartina spp. cordgrass in Pacific estuaries <b>have</b> <b>been</b> separated from the specialist planthopper Prokelisia marginata for many generations while virtually no native populations, in estuaries of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America, have experienced this separation. Contemplating the implications for biological control, we compared native cordgrass populations for resistance and tolerance to the planthopper with invasive <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> separated from the herbivore from many generations.

25|$|In Italy, a {{significant}} building {{of this time}} is the 12th- or 13th-century Rector’s Palace in San Gimignano. This modestly sized building, fronting onto a square, has a symmetrical façade, a low gable that retains {{the appearance of a}} Classical pediment, and a portal that has a semi-circular arch raised above a broad lintel supported on corbels, a common feature of medieval Italian domestic architecture and also seen at the House of Dante. This house has a doorway, also with arch and lintel, between the two mullioned windows of its upper floor that once led out onto a balcony, like the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> restored on a 13th-century house at Poreč in Istria, Croatia.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} early {{recordings}} which survive {{from before}} the famous sextetos were formed. Some of the theatre music was interesting, for example, the Teatro Alhambra had a group of which Adolfo Colombo was the leading personality. He was a singer and regular recording artist, though few of these recordings have survived. <b>One</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reissued by Harlequin reveals a funky number which is hard to categorize. Listed as a rumba, it is perhaps best described as a guaracha-son. The artists singing are Colombo and Claudio García, the guitar probably Alberto Villalón, plus an unknown tres player. All three named players were white, yet the number is creole, almost Afro-Cuban, in style.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} weeks of February 2012 up to 214,200 becquerels of {{radioactive}} caesium per kilogram was measured in samples gravel in the quarry near Namie, situated inside the evacuation zone. The gravel stored outside showed about 60,000–210,000 becquerels of caesium in most samples.

At 27 locations the radioactivity levels were higher than the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|The most {{underdeveloped}} mass ceramics area is in tableware, porcelain and stoneware. Mexico {{has only}} two major tableware manufacturers, Anfora and Santa Anita, which produce porcelain and stoneware respectively. Anfora is the only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> successful in exporting its goods to US companies including Panera Bread, Pottery Barn and Starbucks. Most of these ceramics are imported from other countries such as the United States, Japan and Germany despite its ability to produce it itself. However, the lack of certain raw materials may partially explain this. Another problem is the continued production of lead glazed ware, which cannot be exported. While lead free and low lead glazes {{have been developed for}} use with low temperature firing, the most traditional, only about half of artisans use it.|$|E
25|$|Given its {{conservation}} throughout evolution, {{the action}} potential seems to confer evolutionary advantages. One function of action potentials is rapid, long-range signaling within the organism; the conduction velocity can exceed 110m/s, which is one-third {{the speed of}} sound. For comparison, a hormone molecule carried in the bloodstream moves at roughly 8m/s in large arteries. Part of this function is the tight coordination of mechanical events, such as the contraction of the heart. A second function is the computation associated with its generation. Being an all-or-none signal that does not decay with transmission distance, the action potential has similar advantages to digital electronics. The integration of various dendritic signals at the axon hillock and its thresholding to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of computation, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> exploited biologically to form central pattern generators and mimicked in artificial neural networks.|$|E
