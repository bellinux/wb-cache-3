2500|$|Each {{thyristor}} valve will typically contain tens or {{hundreds of}} thyristor levels, each operating at a different (high) potential with respect to earth. [...] The command information {{to turn on the}} thyristors therefore cannot simply be sent using a wire connection – it needs to be isolated. [...] The isolation method can be magnetic (using pulse transformers) but is usually optical. [...] Two optical methods are used: [...] indirect and direct optical triggering. [...] In the indirect optical triggering method, the low-voltage control electronics sends light pulses along <b>optical</b> <b>fibres</b> to the high-side control electronics, which derives its power from the voltage across each thyristor. [...] The alternative direct optical triggering method dispenses with most of the high-side electronics, instead using light pulses from the control electronics to switch light-triggered thyristors (LTTs), although a small monitoring electronics unit may still be required for protection of the valve.|$|E

40|$|Much {{research}} {{has been carried out}} in the field of using <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> sensors as internal strain and temperature measuring devices for advanced composite structures in recent years. The specific application is the use of embedded <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> sensors for smart composite reinforcement for strain monitoring in an innovative civil engineering structure, particularly for the structure after rehabilitation. Researchers have also paid attention to using the <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> sensor for monitoring the condition of composite materials during manufacturing and curing processes. However, heat induced in the curing process may influence the accuracy of measurement and eventuate in causing damage at the bond interface between the <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> and the surrounding matrix material because of the different thermal properties of silica fibre and composite materials. In this paper, a simple theoretical model is introduced to determine the interfacial properties of the embedded <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> system in composite laminates with different values of the coefficient of thermal expansion under different temperature environments. A finite-element method is used to compare the result from the theoretical prediction. The results show that the maximum shear stress in the coating layer decreases with increasing surrounding temperature when the <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> is embedded into carbon and Kevlar fibre composites. In contrast, increasing the temperature when the <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> is embedded into glass fibre composite results in the increase of maximum shear stress of the material.
