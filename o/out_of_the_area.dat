5|$|Additional {{criticism}} continued even a {{week after}} the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and international agencies stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of aid to areas in desperate need. Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> and prevent them from knowing {{what was going on in}} the hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region. On November8, local media discovered that the Junta was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election.

North Vietnamese forces were driven <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> around Khe Sanh after suffering 940 casualties. The Marines suffered 155 killed in action and 425 wounded.
