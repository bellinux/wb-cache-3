40|$|In {{this article}} I address the Problem <b>of</b> <b>Universals</b> by {{answering}} questions about what facts {{a solution to the}} Problem <b>of</b> <b>Universals</b> should explain and how the explanation should go. I argue that a solution to the Problem <b>of</b> <b>Universals</b> explains the facts the Problem <b>of</b> <b>Universals</b> is about by giving the truthmakers (as opposed to the conceptual content and the ontological commitments) of the sentences stating those facts. I argue that the sentences stating the relevant facts are those like 'a has the property F', that is, sentences stating that a particular has a certain property. Finally I show how answering these questions in this way transforms the Problem <b>of</b> <b>Universals,</b> traditionally conceived as the One over Many, that is, the problem of explaining how different particulars can have the same properties, into the Many over One, that is, the problem of explaining how the same particular can have different properties. The Problem <b>of</b> <b>Universals</b> is the problem of the Many over One. © Oxford University Press 2000...|$|R
50|$|The problem <b>of</b> <b>universals</b> is {{an ancient}} problem in metaphysics {{concerning}} the nature <b>of</b> <b>universals,</b> or whether they exist. Part of the problem involves the implications of language use and the complexity of relating language to ontological theory.|$|R

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law <b>of</b> <b>universal</b> gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity is the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E
5|$|Dracula's Daughter was {{the last}} in the first cycle <b>of</b> <b>Universal</b> Horror films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal {{said it was because}} a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate. In truth, the cycle was {{suspended}} because, just before filming on Dracula's Daughter had wrapped, the Laemmle family had lost control <b>of</b> <b>Universal.</b> Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from J. Cheever Cowdin, head of the Standard Capital Corporation, and from Charles R. Rogers. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4, 1936 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of Dracula's Daughter to focus on fare like Deanna Durbin musicals. Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released Son of Frankenstein in 1939.|$|E

40|$|Universals	 have	 traditionally	 thought	 to	 obey	 the	 identity	 of	 indiscernibles,	 that	is,	it	has	traditionally	been	thought	that	there	can	be	no	perfectly	similar	universals.

Finally,	 I	 shall	 respond	 to	 some	 objections	 and	 I	 shall	 undermine	the	criterion	of	distinction	between	particulars	and	universals	that	says	that	 the	 distinction	 between	 particulars	 and	 universals	 lies	 in	 that	 while	 there	 can	 be	 indiscernible	particulars,	there	cannot	be	indiscernible	universals...|$|R
40|$|There is {{no single}} problem <b>of</b> <b>universals</b> but a family of {{difficulties}} that treat {{of a variety of}} interwoven metaphysical, epistemological, logical and semantic themes. This makes the problem <b>of</b> <b>universals</b> resistant to canonical reduction (to a ‘once-and-for-all’ concern). In particular, the problem <b>of</b> <b>universals</b> cannot be reduced to the problem of supplying truth-makers for sentences that express sameness of type. This is (in part) because the conceptual distinction between numerical and qualitative identity must first be drawn before a sentence is eligible to be supplied with truth-makers. The case is made through a consideration of a recent argument by Gonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra...|$|R

A nonreductionist theory <b>of</b> <b>universals</b> and properties is then outlined, and it is sketched how {{to reap the benefits}} of possibilism and Meinongianism in an actualist setting...|$|R
