40|$|Abstract. Background: Sunscreen {{compounds}} {{with added}} benefit of skin cancer prevention have both public and commercial interests. Our earlier study using the Epstein-Barr virus early antigen in vitro assay reported on skin cancer chemoprevention potential of benzophenone sunscreens. We now report the in vivo antitumor activity {{of two of the}} benzophenone sunscreens which tested positively in the in vitro assay, <b>octabenzone</b> (UV- 1) and dioxybenzone (UV- 2), in the two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis model using (±) -(E) - 4 -methyl- 2 -[-(E) -hydroxyamino]- 5 -nitro- 6 -methoxy- 3 -hexanamide (NOR- 1) as inducer and 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) as promoter. Materials and Methods: Pathogen-free, female hairless mice of HOS:HR- 1 strain, 15 animals per control and test groups, were used. Skin tumors were induced by a single dose o...|$|E
40|$|A plastic tubing system {{operated}} under vacuum is usually {{used to collect}} sap from maple trees during spring time to produce maple syrup. This system is commonly sanitized with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to remove microbial contamination colonizing the system during the sugar season. Questions have been raised whether IPA would contribute to the leaching of plastic residues in maple sap and syrup coming from sanitized systems. First, an extraction experiment was performed in the lab on commercial plastic tubing materials that were submitted to IPA under harsh conditions. The results of the GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of many compounds that served has target for further tests. Secondly, tests were done on early and mid-season maple sap and syrup coming from many sugarbushes using IPA or not to determine potential concentrations of plastic residues. Results obtained from sap and syrup samples showed that no quantifiable (< 1 – 75 μg/L) concentration of any plastic molecules tested was determined in all samples coming from IPA treated or not treated systems. However, some samples of first sap run used as a rinse solution to be discarded before the season start and that were coming from non sanitized or IPA sanitized systems, showed quantifiable concentrations of chemical residue such as ultraviolet protector (<b>octabenzone).</b> These results show that IPA can be safely used to sanitize maple sap collection system {{in regards to the}} leaching of plastic residues in maple sap and syrup and reinforced the need to thoroughly rinse the tubing system {{at the beginning of the}} season for both sanitized and non sanitized systems...|$|E
