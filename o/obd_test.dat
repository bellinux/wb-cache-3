40|$|ABSTRACT To {{investigate}} the mechanisms behind the Se-rum cholesterol-lowering effect of oat fiber, we simultaneously measured postprandial lipid responses. serum lathosterol con-centrations. and small bowel excretion {{of fat and}} sterols in ileostomy subjects given test meals high or low in oat fiber. Six ileostomy subjects (three women and three men) were served an oat-bran test meal (OB: 16. 3 g fiber) and a wheat test meal (6. 3 g fiber in random order. After the postprandial 7 -h period. a controlled, low-fat, cholesterol-free diet was served and ileos-tomy effluent was sampled throughout the 24 -h period. Bile acid and fat excretion (24 h) increased by 93 % and 146 %, respectively (P < 0. 05), and total and endogenous cholesterol excretion decreased by 14 % and 19 %. respectively (P < 0. 05), after the <b>OB</b> <b>test</b> meal. The change in hepatic cholesterol synthesis was strongly related to the change in bile acid excre-tion (Spearman r = 0. 89. P < 0. 02). The postprandial chylo-micron lipid concentration tended to be lower after the <b>OB</b> <b>test</b> meal (- 43 % for cholesterol, P = 0. 07) whereas {{there was no difference}} in cholesterol absorption measured by isotope in five subjects. The main effect of the viscous oat -glucan seems to be related to increased bile acid excretion and subsequent changes in synthesis and endogenous excretion of cholesterol. An additional effect may have been a delay in the micellar lipid sobubibization process and a consequent reduction in the secre-tion of chylomicrons into the circulation. Am J Cliii Nui...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare a new form of warm-up with the {{traditional}} warm-up routine in baseball bat swing. Three different warm-up conditions (i. e., the standard bat warm-up (CO), the overweighted arm warm-up (OA), and the overweighted bat warm-up (<b>OB))</b> were <b>tested.</b> Twenty subjects who had competitive baseball experience in high school or college participated in this study. Results indicated that during warm-up swings the bat speed of the CO (31. 95 ± 1. 50 m/s) was significantly faster than that of the OA (31. 35 ± 1. 82 m/s) and the OB (25. 55 ± 1. 43 m/s) (p <. 05). However, the OA warm-up increased bat speed (0. 659 ± 2. 79 %) more than the CO (0. 049 ± 2. 54 %) and OB (− 0. 203 ± 3. 83 %) warm-ups. However, these differences were not statistically significant due to large variation across subjects. This study also found a significant drop of the bat speed at the first trial (− 0. 499 ± 3. 21 % and − 1. 07 ± 3. 21 % for the OA and OB warm-ups, respectively) immediately following loaded warm-ups.

40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with impaired functional hyperemic response. We have shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are important in mediating functional vasodilation. Adipocyte-derived factors (ADFs) can alter vascular tone via opening KATP channels. We hypothesize that, in an animal model of obesity, ADFs will decrease basal arteriolar tone by opening KATP channels, resulting in an attenuated functional vasodilation. We used wild-type (WT) mice and ob−/ob− mice (<b>ob)</b> to <b>test</b> this hypothesis. The spinotrapezius muscle was prepared for the microcirculatory observation of arcade arterioles, and we measured the vasodilatory responses to muscle stimulation. The basal arteriolar diameter was larger in ob mice compared with WT mice. The KATP channel inhibitor glibenclamide (10 μM) decreased arteriolar diameter in ob mice with no effect in WT mice. The increase in arteriolar diameter induced by muscle stimulation was attenuated in ob mice compared with WT mice. To determine the mechanisms {{for the opening of}} KATP channels, fat was collected from the ob mice, subcutaneous fat from around the spinotrapezius muscle (OBSF) or visceral fat (OBVF) and was incubated in physiological saline solution (PSS). The vasodilatory responses to the fat-conditioned PSS were determined in WT mice. Treatment with OBSF- or OBVF -conditioned PSS increased the arteriolar diameters in WT mice, a dilation that was inhibited by glibenclamide. The absolute diameters induced by muscle stimulation were not altered by the fat-conditioned PSS. These results suggest that, in ob mice, local ADFs reduce the functional vasodilatory capability via opening KATP channels...|$|R
40|$|Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) and Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) are {{frequent}} complications in the lung transplant recipient, {{and are the}} leading cause of mortality after transplantation. The mechanisms responsible for OB remain elusive, but inflammatory and tissue remodeling responses are implicated. We hypothesized that alterations in markers of tissue remodeling in BALF of lung transplant recipients could predict development of <b>OB.</b> To <b>test</b> this, we identified 13 lung transplant recipients who developed both BOS and histologic OB (OB group) at median post-operative day (POD) 485 (range 73 – 2070). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained at median POD 387 (range 45 – 2205), which preceded the onset of OB and BOS by a median of 140 days (range 60 – 365). As a control, BALF was also obtained from a group of 21 stable recipients without OB (non-OB group) at median POD 335 (range 270 – 395). BALF was examined for gelatinolytic activity, fibronectin gene transcription, and transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) expression. Gelatin zymography of BALF from the OB group showed increased matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) activity over that of the non-OB group (p < 0. 005). Similarly, BALF from the OB group induced greater fibronectin expression in fibroblasts com- pared to the non-OB group (p < 0. 03). The induction of fibronectin also correlated with the amount of TGF-β 1 protein in BALF (r = 0. 71) from the OB group. We conclude that activation of tissue remodeling precedes the onset of OB, and analysis of gelatinolytic and/or fibronectin-inducing activity in BALF can serve as an early, pre-clinical marker for OB...|$|R

Restricting to GP studies resulted in a declined I(2) measure of 11 % (p-value = 0. 33) and an OR of 1. 10 (p-value = 0. 015). Regarding the five hypotheses, our data showed (a) some difference between GP and HP studies (p-value = 0. 012) and (b) an association in extreme comparisons (BMI >= 32. 5, 35. 0, 37. 5, 40. 0 kg/m(2) versus BMI, 25 kg/m(2)) yielding ORs of 1. 16, 1. 18, 1. 22, or 1. 27 (p-values 0. 001 to 0. 003), which was also underscored by significantly increased CC-genotype frequencies across BMI categories (10. 4 % to 12. 5 %, p-value for trend = 0. 0002). We did not find evidence for differential ORs (c) among studies with higher than average obesity prevalence compared to lower, (d) among studies with BMI assessment after the year 2000 compared to those before, or (e) among studies from older populations compared to younger. Analysis of non-Caucasian adults (n = 4889) or children (n = 3243) yielded ORs of 1. 01 (p-value = 0. 94) or 1. 15 (p-value = 0. 22), respectively. There was no evidence for overall association of the rs 7566605 polymorphism with obesity. Our data suggested an association with extreme degrees of obesity, and consequently heterogeneous effects from different study designs may mask an underlying association when unaccounted for.

40|$|The {{long-term}} X-ray lightcurves {{of classical}} supergiant X-ray binaries and supergiant fast X-ray transients show relatively similar super-orbital modulations, {{which are still}} lacking a sound interpretation. We propose that these modulations {{are related to the}} presence of corotating interaction regions (CIRs) known to thread the winds of <b>OB</b> supergiants. To <b>test</b> this hypothesis, we couple the outcomes of 3 -D hydrodynamic models for the formation of CIRs in stellar winds with a simplified recipe for the accretion onto a neutron star. The results show that the synthetic X-ray light curves are indeed modulated by the presence of the CIRs. The exact period and amplitude of these modulations depend on a number of parameters governing the hydrodynamic wind models and on the binary orbital configuration. To compare our model predictions with the observations, we apply the 3 -D wind structure previously shown to well explain the appearance of discrete absorption components in the UV time series of a prototypical B 0. 5 I-type supergiant. Using the orbital parameters of IGRJ 16493 - 4348 which has the same B 0. 5 I donor spectral type, the period and modulations in the simulated X-ray light-curve are similar to the observed ones, thus providing support to our scenario. We propose, that the presence of CIRs in donor star winds should be considered in future theoretical and simulation efforts of wind-fed X-ray binaries. Comment: Accepted for publication on A&...|$|R

A central question discussed is whether these tests {{can be interpreted as}} assimilation, repressive liberalism or as a neutral instrument that changes its function according to the surrounding citizenship regime as some authors argue. The analysis has the surprising result that none of the hypotheses from the existing literature on civic integration can explain the content of all five citizenship tests. In particular I find that the characteristics of the surrounding citizenship regime are not a good predictor for the content of the respective citizenship tests: countries with rather restrictive citizenship regimes such as Austria or Germany have opted for a citizenship test with a liberal content that is comparable not only to the British but also to the US-American test. On the other hand the content of the Dutch citizenship test does not fully correspond to a Rawlsian definition of political liberalism although the Dutch citizenship regime is relatively open. Therefore I conclude that the formal character of a citizenship regime is only loosely connected with the national definition of citizenship as it is conveyed by the content of citizenship tests. It is not because civic integration requirements are obligatory and restrict the free will of future citizens that citizenship itself is defined in illiberal terms.

Insbesondere wird deutlich, dass Länder mit einem eher restriktiven Staatsangehörigkeitsrecht wie Österreich und Deutschland Einbürgerungstests mit einem liberalen Inhalt eingeführt haben, der nicht nur dem britischen, sondern auch dem amerikanischen Test ähnelt. Andererseits entspricht der Inhalt des niederländischen Tests nicht vollständig einer Rawlsischen Definition des politischen Liberalismus, obwohl das niederländische Staatsangehörigkeitsrecht relativ offen ist.

40|$|Hypersecretion {{of insulin}} from the {{pancreas}} {{is among the}} earliest detectable metabolic alterations in some genetically obese animals including the ob/ob mouse and in some obesity-prone humans. Since {{the primary cause of}} obesity in the ob/ob mouse is a lack of leptin due to a mutation in the <b>ob</b> gene, we <b>tested</b> the hypothesis that leptin targets a regulatory pathway in pancreatic islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin. Insulin secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e. g., glucagon-like peptide- 1) and phospholipase C (PLC) (e. g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion. Effects of leptin on each of these regulatory pathways were thus examined. Leptin did not influence glucose or glucagon-like peptide- 1 -induced insulin secretion from islets of either ob/ob or lean mice, consistent with earlier findings that these regulatory pathways do not contribute to the early-onset hypersecretion of insulin from islets of ob/ob mice. However, leptin did constrain the enhanced PLC- mediated insulin secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice. A specific enhancement in PLC-mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action. This action of leptin on PLC-mediated insulin secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i. e., within 3 min), and reversible. Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway. One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin...|$|R
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Clinical Psychology (MCIPsych) Scope {{and purpose}} of the work: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) {{is the most common}} form of {{dementia}} and is distinguished from other dementias by specific pathology. Recent studies estimate that around 40 % of individuals over 65 have Alzheimer Disease pathology without the cognitive changes characteristic of the disease. It could be that the development of these pathological changes signals future cognitive and functional declines characteristic of AD. If this is the case, a screening test for early detection of these individuals is required. This need will increase once disease altering treatments become available. One area of the brain which is known to exhibit early AD pathology is the olfactory bulb (OB). Impaired olfactory function is known as an early symptom of AD and this may be related to these pathological changes. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter which is important for normal olfactory functioning and is also implicated in the development of AD. Placing additional stress on the pathways releasing ACh within the OB may have exaggerated consequences. Using this principle, Schofield et al (2012) speculated that intranasal administration of an anticholinergic agent might be used to reveal AD pathology in the OB. In their study it was hypothesised that intranasal administration of an anticholinergic agent (atropine) could help to identify individuals who had started to develop AD pathology in the <b>OB.</b> By <b>testing</b> olfactory function before and after the administration of atropine they were able to demonstrate a significant decline in the group who had features of early AD compared to a “low risk of AD” control group. This is the “Olfactory Stress Test” (OST) and the measure of olfactory change after administration of atropine is the “atropine effect” (AE). The present study attempts to establish the test- retest validity of the OST procedure set out in Schofield et al (2012). Methodology: We recruited individuals 65 years and older without severe cognitive impairment. Participants were asked to attend our clinic on two consecutive occasions. On the first occasion participants were asked to complete the OST and this process was repeated on the second occasion. To establish test- retest reliability we examined the level of agreement between AE scores obtained on each of the two sessions using the Intraclass Coefficient (ICC). Results: There was a weak negative correlation between AE scores at both sessions (with time between sessions ranging from 7 to 125 days) ICC (3, 2) = - 0. 161. Secondary analysis showed weak test- retest agreement, ICC (3, 4) = 0. 465, for the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) which is the olfactory measure used in the OST. Conclusions and Implications: The main findings of this study were that the test-retest reliability of the OST was poor. Secondary analysis suggested that test- retest reliability of UPSIT was also poor when used in this procedure. Future study of the OST would benefit from a greater number of participants, further data regarding the reliability of the UPSIT over multiple administrations, and methodological changes aimed at reducing unwanted variability between test sessions...|$|R
40|$|Since {{its first}} success in 1983, lung {{transplantation}} {{has become the}} treatment of choice for selected patients with end stage lung disease. However, long-term graft survival is relatively low compared to other solid organs, such as heart, liver and kidney. The primary factor limiting long-term survival of pulmonary allografts is obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), a form of chronic pulmonary graft rejection characterized by submucosal fibroproliferation of the small airways, which leads to luminal compromise and respiratory failure. Due to their unique anatomic location, lungs are exposed to environmental factors in the air which include potentially toxic agents. This suggests a possible importance of non-alloimmune mediated factors in the pathogenesis of pulmonary rejection in addition to alloimmunity. Clinical reports reveal that gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is commonly observed following lung transplantation, {{and it has been}} postulated that GERD after lung transplantation could accelerate the development of OB and subsequent lung allograft failure. Although clinical studies point to the importance of GERD in the survival of the transplant, the potential effects of GERD on pulmonary allografts still need to be identified. In this dissertation, the effects of GERD on pulmonary allografts, including ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury and the pH of the gastric fluid aspirate, are evaluated. Further, this dissertation explores the mechanisms by which GERD affects chronic lung allograft rejection, particularly the role played by mast cells in rejection. I-R injury of the pulmonary graft has been associated with a higher risk of developing bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) in clinical practice, and prolonged ischemic time has been correlated with poorer long-term survival after lung transplantation. To explore the relationship between GERD, I-R injury, and OB formation after lung transplantation, the effect of long and short ischemic times on WKY-to-F 344 rat orthotopic left lung transplants receiving 8 weekly aspirations of gastric fluid was assessed. In this study, described in Chapter 2, long ischemic times led to significantly (p Also, it remains unknown whether pharmaceutical-induced increases in gastric pH might effectively prevent pulmonary injury associated with chronic aspiration. The hypothesis that neutralization of gastric fluid would affect the development of aspiration-associated <b>OB</b> was <b>tested.</b> The results, described in Chapter 3, revealed that the pH of the aspirated gastric fluid did not significantly affect pulmonary graft rejection. This finding suggests that clinical management of lung transplant patients with GERD should probably include more than just pharmaceutical blockage of gastric protons and/or antacid to neutralize the pH of gastric fluid. Mast cells, the first responders of the innate defense system, might play a role in pulmonary allograft rejection due to their ability to orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses. Correspondingly, increased mast cell numbers associated with increased rejection grade as well as the presence of OB were reported in a retrospective clinical study. Identifying how mast cells are involved with gastric fluid aspiration-associated pulmonary allograft rejection could uncover a potential method for treatment. With this in mind, cromolyn, a mast cell membrane stabilizer which prevents mast cell degranulation, was utilized to investigate the role of mast cells in the pathogenesis of pulmonary allograft failure. The results, described in Chapter 4, reveal that pulmonary allografts in rats treated with cromolyn and aspirated with gastric fluid developed significantly fewer OB lesions than those treated with gastric fluid alone (p Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|Adequate {{management}} of burn pain may influence pain resistance, analgesic requirements, sensitivity to pain over time, wound healing {{and the development}} of delirium and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Efforts should be made to optimize pain management. An important step is effect evaluation of interventions by pain measurement. Another step is to disclose the latest insights from the literature, especially on non-pharmacological interventions during wound care. In these two steps, burn care nurses, confronted with pain on a daily basis, play a central role. Tools with good clinimetric properties to evaluate pain in burned children aged 0 - 4 years, unable to provide self-reports, are necessary. Therefore, reliability and validity of the pain observation scale for young children (POCIS), the COMFORT behaviour scale (COMFORT-B), and the nurse observational visual analogue scale (VAS <b>obs)</b> have been <b>tested.</b> The POCIS and COMFORT-B provide ratings obtained by structured observation, the VAS obs provides a global impression of pain. When burn care nurses used the VAS obs simultaneously, their ratings corresponded less well when compared to POCIS and COMFORT-B ratings, suggesting better reliability for structured observation. The POCIS and COMFORT-B were also able to differentiate background from procedural pain and seemed to measure one unidimensional construct, indicating validity. Nurses preferred the COMFORT-B. Ranges at which adapted treatment needs consideration appeared 6 - 13 (mild), 14 - 20 (moderate) and 21 - 30 (severe). The visual analogue thermometer (VAT) is an instrument with good clinimetric properties for self-reports of pain in adults with burns. The graphic numeric rating scale (GNRS) is another brief, simple and easy to use tool for pain assessment. To legitimate their interchangeable use, scores and cutpoints were compared, and their ability to differentiate background from procedural pain. Mean VAT self-reports turned out to be lower than GNRS scores, suggesting that they cannot be used interchangeably without taking their differences into account. However, both scales were able to differentiate background from procedural pain. They also seemed to share a similar cutpoint: patients indicated that a pain level of more than 2 on the 0 - 10 scales was unacceptable. The state of art is that adequate {{management of}} burn pain consists of an individualized approach, using drugs with different mechanisms of action, combined with non-pharmacological interventions. Considerations when selecting non-pharmacological interventions are: simplicity, immediate usability and minimal expenditure of time and effort during use. The effectiveness of simple relaxation on procedural pain in adults was examined by a literature review. Previous research did not examine our patient group, but simple relaxation is a low risk intervention which shows promise in enhancing pain management. The best available evidence was found for active hypnosis, rapid induction analgesia and distraction relaxation. Pain remains a challenging problem in the burn field. Managing this problem requires adequate pain measurement to improve individualized outcomes. The reliable and valid pain measurement instrument arsenal is enlarged, implying that pain measurement is currently feasible for a larger group of patients and that cutpoints can be used for treatment protocols including non-pharmacological interventions...|$|R
