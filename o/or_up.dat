5|$|Despite {{the added}} barrel length, the PS90 is {{relatively}} compact and lightweight, {{with an overall}} length of 667mm (26.3in), and a weight of 3.4kg (7.5lb) with a fully loaded 50-round magazine. Due to the added barrel length, the PS90 can achieve a muzzle velocity of up to 777m/s (2,550ft/s) with SS195LF ammunition, <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to 930m/s (3,050ft/s) with third-party ammunition.|$|E

5|$|JMP {{software}} is partly focused on exploratory data analysis and visualization. It {{is designed for}} users to investigate data to learn something unexpected, as opposed to confirming a hypothesis. JMP links statistical data to graphics representing them, so users can drill down <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to explore the data and various visual representations of it. Its primary applications are for designed experiments and analyzing statistical data from industrial processes.|$|E

5|$|Much {{research}} has been done into erection. By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E
5|$|T. cruzi {{can also}} be {{transmitted}} through blood transfusions. With the exception of blood derivatives (such as fractionated antibodies), all blood components are infective. The parasite remains viable at 4°C for at least 18 days <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to 250 days when kept at room temperature. It is unclear whether T. cruzi can be transmitted through frozen-thawed blood components.|$|E
5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the gall midge Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut foliage and hence reduce its value.|$|E

5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E
5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight Stinger missiles externally, set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the Australian {{government}} decided to purchase two passenger jets for strategic transport, primarily to mitigate what it {{saw as the}} risk of terrorist attack inherent in carrying VIPs on commercial flights. Its attempts to procure one Boeing 727 each from domestic carriers Ansett and TAA were unsuccessful but, in December, Qantas agreed to sell the government two Boeing 707s for $14.5 million. Purchasing big jets for VIPs was controversial, but the 707s were also intended for general long-range transport, being capable of carrying cargo <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to 160 passengers. The first {{was transferred to the}} RAAF in March 1979, and its inaugural Air Force flight took place on 22April. Located at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, the 707s were initially operated by No.37 Squadron. They were formed into No.33 Flight under the command of Wing Commander J.D. Grierson on 2February 1981. The flight's first mission took place the same day, when it ferried RAAF members and their families to RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia, a task that had previously necessitated a Qantas charter.|$|E
50|$|Each dragon type has a {{different}} Glide Gauge. The dragon's ability to slow down <b>or</b> speed <b>up</b> can only be done {{a limited number of}} times as it decreases the Glide Gauge. When the Glide Gauge is empty, the dragon can no longer slown down <b>or</b> speed <b>up</b> and must wait for the gauge to refill (which happens automatically over time). The Glide Wing can speed <b>up</b> <b>or</b> slow down <b>up</b> to three times using a full Glide Gauge, while the Base Wing can only do so two times. The Heavy Wing can't slow down <b>or</b> speed <b>up</b> at all, trading its mobility for a greater damage output.|$|R

5|$|In Ancient Roman times, tigers {{were kept}} in menageries and amphitheatres to be exhibited, trained and paraded, and were often {{provoked}} to fight humans and exotic beasts. Since the 17th century, tigers, being rare and ferocious, were sought after to keep at European castles as symbols of their owners' power. Tigers became central zoo and circus exhibits in the 18th century: a tiger could cost up to 4,000 francs in France (for comparison, a professor of the Beaux-Arts at Lyons earned only 3,000 francs a year), <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to $3,500 in the United States where a lion cost no more than $1,000.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, P. schultzi {{can take}} in only a small visual field at one time, as the most acute part of a main eye can see all of a circle up to 12millimeters wide at 20centimeters away, <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to 18millimeters wide at 30centimeters away. A Portia spider takes a {{relatively}} long time to see objects, possibly because getting a good image out of such tiny eyes is a complex process and {{needs a lot of}} scanning. This makes a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds, frogs, and mantises, which it often cannot identify because of the other predator's size.|$|E
5|$|Malmö Stadion has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 26,500 spectators for sports, of which 14,000 are standing spectators. When hosting concerts, the stadium can host 25,000 spectators when {{the stage is}} on either long side of the stadium, <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to 40,000 when it is {{placed in front of}} either short side. It comprises two main stands on each of the long sides of the pitch: the Southern Stand and the Northern Stand, both of which have two tiers. The lower tier of the Northern Stand is terraced, and was the only tier of the stand until the upper, seated tier was built in 1992. The short sides of the pitch feature two minor terracing sections, respectively named the Eastern Stand and the Western Stand. When Malmö FF were based at the ground, the Northern Stand terracing was the section with the most season ticket holders, while the Eastern Stand was the section used to house away fans.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the center of mass is back <b>or</b> <b>up</b> far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E
5|$|The F-20 did, however, {{have several}} {{problems}} inherent to its small size. The low-mounted wing meant {{that there was}} limited ground clearance, and {{the position of the}} landing gear meant loads had to be positioned towards the outer ends of the wings. This limited hard point weights to 1,000lb (454kg). A single hard point under the fuselage could carry more, a single Mk 84 2,000 lbs bomb <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to five Mk 82 500 lbs bombs. Additionally, although the wing profiling improved lift at higher angles of attack (AoA) while maneuvering, it did not improve cruise lift performance at normal AoA. This did not present a problem in the fighter role, but did severely reduce its payload/range figures compared to similar aircraft like the F-16.|$|E
5|$|The {{pelagic zone}} {{contains}} macro- and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents. Most {{of the smallest}} organisms are the larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. The zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of the complex food chain that extends through variously-sized fish and other nektonic organisms, which are in turn eaten by larger squids, sharks, porpoises, dolphins, and whales. Some marine creatures make large migrations, either to {{other regions of the}} ocean on a seasonal basis <b>or</b> <b>up</b> and down its vertical layers, often ascending to feed at night before descending to safety by day. Ships can introduce or spread invasive species through the discharge of ballast water or through the transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of the fouling community on the hulls of vessels.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} the boy throughout the game. As {{is typical of}} most two-dimensional platform games, the boy can run left or right, jump, climb onto short ledges <b>or</b> <b>up</b> and down ladders and ropes, and push or pull objects. Limbo is presented through dark, greyscale graphics and with minimalist ambient sounds, creating an eerie, haunting environment. The dark visuals also hide numerous environmental and physical hazards, such as deadly bear traps on the forest floor, or lethal monsters hiding in the shadows, such as a giant spider. Among the hazards are glowing worms, which attach themselves to the boy's head and force him to travel in only one direction until they are killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} shell is usually 5–9mm, but can reach up to 11–13mm. The height of the shell is 4–6.5mm, <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width of the shell of brackish water populations is 9.3mm. Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight of the shell is 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1mm, and maximum height is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E
5|$|The species easily {{attaches}} {{itself to}} stones, which {{allows it to}} live in fast-running waters and in wave zone in lakes. The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to live in freshwater and also in brackish water demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of this species. This small snail can live in up to 60 m depth in coastal waters. Brackish water populations can live in salinities of up to 15‰ in the Baltic Sea <b>or</b> <b>up</b> to 18‰ in the Baltic Sea and in Black Sea. Populations from brackish water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater. Brackish water populations have much higher accumulation of ninhydrin-positive substances in the foot.|$|E
