25|$|The U.S. and U.K., Butler told me, were {{uncertain}} about going ahead. He needed {{to consult with}} them, he said, and on the 15thmy thirty-seventh birthdayI found myself pacing the floor <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> on the thirtieth floor of the United Nations Secretariat Building in New York, waiting {{for the results of}} these talks.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{house will}} {{understand}} that there is no part of the Home Secretary's duty which throws greater responsibility upon him or is indeed more painful, then that which has to be exercised in connection with the prerogative of mercy. Of course, any man would be only too glad to find a scintilla of evidence or reason, or I might say to invent a reason, which would enable him to save a human life. But my duty, as I understand it, is to act in accordance with the law and the traditions <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
500|$|Initially, Schindler {{was mostly}} {{interested}} in the money-making potential of the business and hired Jews because they were cheaper than Poles – the wages were set by the occupying Nazi regime. Later he began shielding his workers without regard for cost. The status of his factory as a business essential {{to the war effort}} became a decisive factor enabling him to help his Jewish workers. Whenever Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were threatened with deportation, he claimed exemptions for them. Wives, children, and even persons with disabilities were claimed to be necessary mechanics and metalworkers. On one occasion, the Gestapo came to Schindler demanding that he hand over a family with forged identity papers. [...] "Three hours after they walked in," [...] Schindler said, [...] "two drunk Gestapo men reeled out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> without their prisoners and without the incriminating documents they had demanded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{the ghostly}} adviser of the unhappy youth, {{and in the}} {{execution}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> sacred <b>office</b> I have learned that he is innocent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Signore, yes. By {{the sacred}} nature <b>of</b> <b>my</b> holy <b>office,</b> do I affirm that {{of this crime}} is Jacopo innocent! I shrived the fisherman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Signore, as I {{have just}} said, in virtue of {{knowledge}} gained {{in the exercise}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> holy <b>office.</b> He has laid bare his soul to me, as one whose feet were in the grave; and, though offending, like all born of woman, towards his God, he is guiltless as respects the state." ...|$|R
2500|$|... a {{tremendous}} force {{in my personal}} and professional life. He was always in and out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> asking how things were going. Even as {{he was trying to}} convince me to do something I absolutely did not want to do, I always felt his intentions for me were the best. Marvin was always honest and unpretentious.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, a {{previously}} unknown eyewitness {{account of the}} events of May 31, 1921, was discovered and obtained by the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. In the 10-page typewritten manuscript, noted Oklahoma attorney Buck Colbert Franklin recalls standing in his office, watching [...] "’planes circling in mid-air: [...] "’They grew in number and hummed, darted and dipped low. I could hear something like hail falling upon the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> building. Down East Archer, I saw the old Mid-Way hotel on fire, burning from its top, and then another and another and another building began to burn from their top.’" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will excuse me, Sir Julien," [...] he said slowly, [...] "but I am {{responsible}} only to {{the permanent}} officials in control <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office.</b> Besides,--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{anything}} could convert me {{to your own}} peaceful and unresisting opinions, Alice, {{it would be the}} reflections that offer themselves at this conviction, that even you have been led by the base tongues <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dastardly enemies, to doubt my honor and conduct. What is fame, when a man can be thus traduced to his nearest friends? But no more of these childish reflections! they are unworthy <b>of</b> myself, <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> and the sacred cause in which I have enlisted!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I met him {{ten years}} afterwards, casually, unexpectedly, in the street, on coming out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{consignee}} <b>office.</b> I was {{not likely to}} have forgotten him with his [...] "I can manage now." [...] He recognised me at once, remembered my name, and in what ship I had served under his orders. He looked me over from head to foot.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly! The boy is an {{inventor}} already. I shall {{have one of}} those cards attached to the door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> private <b>office</b> at once. I tell you, Belinda, our son will be a great man one of these days," [...] said Mr. Joslyn, walking up and down with pompous strides and almost bursting with the pride he took in his young hopeful.|$|R
6000|$|PRINCE PAUL. No, to Paris. He has confiscated my estates, robbed me <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> and my cook. I {{have nothing}} left but my decorations. I am here for revenge.[5] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{a terrible}} affair," [...] he admitted, [...] "and, as Mr. Bellamy has told you, it {{occurred}} within a few steps <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office.</b> So far, too, the police seem completely at a loss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{think it}} beneath the dignity <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> to parley further with the prisoners,” the sheriff {{observer}} to his companion, while they both retired with a precipitancy that Captain Hollister mistook for {{the signal to}} advance.|$|E
60|$|From {{that hour}} I {{was no longer}} {{connected}} with the government. Snubbed by the department, snubbed by the Cabinet, snubbed at last by the chairman of a committee I was endeavoring to adorn, I yielded to persecution, cast far from me the perils and seductions <b>of</b> <b>my</b> great <b>office,</b> and forsook <b>my</b> bleeding country in the hour of her peril.|$|R
6000|$|... "Admonition and remonstrance may {{always be}} useful when crime is meditated. You are now {{committing}} a felony, {{for which the}} State's prison is the punishment prescribed {{by the laws of}} the land, and the duties <b>of</b> <b>my</b> holy <b>office</b> direct me to warn you of the consequences. The earth itself is but one of God's temples, and his ministers need never hesitate to proclaim his laws on any part of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, Buckley criticised the Government for {{withholding}} {{information from}} his {{investigation into the}} Hinduja affair, in which Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Mandelson was accused of attempting to influence a passport application by Srichand Hinduja. Buckley complained that the refusal to release the information strikes {{at the very heart}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office's</b> function and effectively made my investigation unsustainable. [...] The Cabinet Office apologised and disclosed to Buckley the papers he sought. Buckley also criticised the Home Office for its failure to maintain its files on the sensitive issue in anything approaching an adequate manner. [...] Buckley had sought a transcript of a disputed telephone call between Mandelson and the Home Office Minister Mike O'Brien about the affair. However, the Home Office were unable to find many of the papers for the case. Tony Wright, Chairman of the Public Affairs Select Committee, said the affair demonstrated appalling record keeping, horrific administrative failures and breakdowns in IT systems in Government departments.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Wingrave Seton {{is never}} {{likely to come}} here again, I am afraid," [...] he answered. [...] "If he did, I don't think he'd mind. To tell you the truth, I'm rather proud <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> young lady!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I demand {{entrance}} into this house,” said Hiram, summoning all the dignity he could muster to his assistance, “in {{the name of}} the people; and by virtue of this war rant, and <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> and with this peace officer.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we had best be going, for I {{understand}} that none could be less welcome here than I. Yet in this, Madonna, {{let me assure}} you that there is nothing personal to myself. I am the slave <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office.</b> I do but perform it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is a case," [...] said he, [...] "where my dreadful {{money can}} do some good. I am anxious to help Myrtle Dean, for I believe she is deserving <b>of</b> <b>my</b> best <b>offices.</b> But I don't exactly know what to do. She is really your protégé, my dears, and I am {{going to put the}} affair in your hands for settlement. Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it. Spend my money as freely upon Myrtle as you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he began}} to talk about offices, in view of what were now pretty obvious possibilities. After {{discussing}} more important people, he asked whether, after a recent conversation, I had thought more <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>office,</b> and I told him that I fancied like Regulus I had better go back to the Irish department. “Yes,” he answered with a flash of his eye, “I think so. The truth is that we’re both chained to the oar; I am chained to the oar; you are chained.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been wondering," [...] he continued, {{with some}} diffidence, [...] "whether you'd {{care for a}} bit <b>of</b> work in <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> just to carry you along till things looked up. Blanche, she was set upon it that I should ask you anyway. Of course, you being a college young gentleman might not care about it, but there's times when any sort of a job is better than none, eh?" ...|$|R
60|$|The purpose {{which she}} had been keeping in view from {{the moment when the}} Minister entered her cell was no mystery now. Ought I to have interfered? Let me confess a weakness, unworthy perhaps <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office.</b> I was so sorry for the child--I hesitated.|$|E
60|$|On {{that day}} I {{was sitting in}} my room a little before supper, when John Paul burst open the door with no civility of knocking, and told me there was one below that wished {{to speak with the}} steward; sneering at the name <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
60|$|Having {{returned}} to the duties <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> I thought of writing to the Minister. While the proposed letter was still in contemplation, I was informed that a lady wished to see me. She sent in her card. My visitor {{proved to be the}} Minister's wife.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No [...] "if" [...] in the case, my dear Sir,' said Perker triumphantly. 'There is {{the very}} letter I speak <b>of.</b> Brought to <b>my</b> <b>office</b> by another woman at nine o'clock this morning, before I had set foot in this place, or held any {{communication}} with Mrs. Bardell, upon my honour.' Selecting the letter from the bundle, the little lawyer laid it at Mr. Pickwick's elbow, and took snuff for two consecutive minutes, without winking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you dealt fairly with Mr. Littlepage and myself, sir, in this affair?" [...] Mr. Worden asked, {{a little}} sternly. [...] "I might, with great propriety, lecture to a cook, {{on the eighth}} commandment, when that cook was a party to robbing you of your supper; but how shall I answer to His Honour, Mr. Mayor, on the charge which will now be brought against me? It is not for myself, Mr. Guert, that I feel so much concern, as for the credit and {{reputation}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> sacred <b>office,</b> and that, too, among your disciples of the schools of Leyden!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you'll {{get used}} to it!" [...] the ex-clerk said. [...] "When I first went into the House, I {{believed}} in honesty and sincerity, like yourself; but I came out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> term <b>of</b> <b>office</b> knowing the whole gang to be thieves. My experience taught me that legislators in America think it's a Christian virtue {{to break into the}} government treasury." ...|$|R
60|$|Elected by the suffrages of your four Nations Rector of {{the ancient}} University of which you are scholars, I take the {{earliest}} opportunity which has presented itself since my restoration to health, of delivering the Address which, by long custom, is expected of the holder <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do not see}} how {{he could}} have left the place without my hearing him, sir," [...] he declared. [...] "The door <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> has been open all the time, and I sit {{opposite}} to it. Besides, on these stone floors one can hear any one so distinctly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not, then, my lord? Good news {{should be}} welcomed with good wine. Frank, send {{down to the}} sexton, and set the bells a-ringing to cheer up all honest hearts. Why, my lord, {{if it were not}} for the gravity <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> I could dance a galliard for joy!" ...|$|E
60|$|While I {{was still}} {{fighting}} with the difficulties <b>of</b> setting up <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> and recommending myself to my connection, and so forth, I got a message from Mr. Fauntleroy telling me to call on him, at the banking-house, the first time I was passing that way. As you may easily imagine, I contrived to be passing that way on a particularly early occasion, and, on presenting myself at the bank, I was shown at once into Mr. Fauntleroy's private room.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like the}} fellow well enough too; {{for he is}} hearty, and frank, and good-natured; but there was some little policy in keeping on good terms with him. I'm afraid, Corny, I did not {{altogether}} consult the dignity <b>of</b> <b>my</b> holy <b>office,</b> this morning, on the ice! It is exceedingly unbecoming in a clergyman, to be seen running {{in a public place}} like a school-boy, or a youngster contending in a match. I thought, moreover, I overheard one of those young Dutchmen call me the 'Loping Dominie;' and so, taking altogether, it struck me it would be wisest to keep on good terms with this Guert Ten Eyck." ...|$|R
5000|$|In February, 2009 he {{accepted}} {{a position as}} a regional vice president with Henry Dunn Inc headquartered in Towanda, PA. In May 2010 he narrowly lost the Republican nomination for the 83rd District of the Pennsylvania House, with 2,904 votes to David Huffman's 3,086. Capelli said of his loss [...] "It's probably the end <b>of</b> <b>my</b> elected public <b>office</b> career, I don't see myself running for office in the future." ...|$|R
