50|$|Retinal {{migraine}} (also {{known as}} <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>migraine,</b> and ocular migraine) is a retinal disease {{often accompanied by}} migraine headache and typically affects only one eye. It is caused by ischaemia or vascular spasm in or behind the affected eye.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{people get}} {{different}} variations of this phenomenon, {{with the central}} vision being involved, or with the visual effect similar to [...] "heat rising off of a car". Some people describe a [...] "kaleidoscope" [...] effect, with pieces of the vision being missing. All of these variations are consistent with <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>migraine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Acephalgic {{migraine}} is {{a neurological}} syndrome. It is {{a variant of}} migraine in which the patient may experience aura symptoms such as scintillating scotoma, nausea, photophobia, hemiparesis and other migraine symptoms but does not experience headache. Acephalgic migraine is {{also referred to as}} amigrainous migraine, ocular migraine, <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>migraine</b> or optical migraine, last three being misnomers.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Thirty-three of 129 {{patients}} who incurred isolated <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>migraine</b> had monocular attacks of scotomatous visual field loss. Fifteen of 33 patients with monocular attacks had im-mediate or remote evidence of vascular disease. Four patients had carotid bruits {{on the same}} side as the monocular attacks and low oph-thalmodynamometer readings. One patient had ischemic optic neuropathy and two had atheromatous disease (advanced stage in one patient). Forty-five percent of the patients with monocular attacks and only 13 % of the remaining patients with homonymous attacks had vascular complications. This represents an important finding even in such a small group of patients. It is felt that, whether the vascular problems are trigger mechanisms or coexistence pathology to the migraine-type attack, one should strongly suspect such an association when a patient describes a monocular attack and one should look for a possible vascular explanation other than migraine...|$|E
