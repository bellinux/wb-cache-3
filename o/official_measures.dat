For example, the ranking of 32,482 sub-wards in England in the index of multiple deprivation (2006) ranged from 819th (part of Penzance East) to 30,899th (part of Saltash Burraton in Caradon), where the lower number represents the greater deprivation.|$|E

40|$|This study {{considers}} how {{the views}} of the public at large may be used to define the poverty income level. The basic data for the study come from routine Gallup surveys conducted {{since the beginning of the}} post-World War II period that asked representative samples of adults in the United States to estimate the smallest amount of money that a family of four needs to “get along. ” Additional Gallup surveys undertaken in 1989 established the income corresponding to the poverty level using a similar approach. The author constructs a set of poverty thresholds, covering the post-World War II period, based on the single point-in-time poverty/get-along income relationship in 1989 and the full get-along series. Comparison of this set of thresholds with an alternative poverty series that is consistent with the Federal Government’s <b>official</b> poverty <b>measure</b> yields three principal findings: (1) a poverty level consistent with the <b>official</b> <b>measure</b> was a good deal higher than the Gallup-based poverty threshold in the immediate post-World War II period, (2) the income level of the <b>official</b> <b>measure</b> was likely consistent with the public’s views about the poverty level at the time when the <b>official</b> <b>measure</b> was introduced, and (3) since the late 1960 ’s and the early 1970 ’s, the income level of the <b>official</b> <b>measure</b> has fallen increasingly below the Gallup-based poverty threshold until 1989 when the <b>official</b> <b>measure</b> was 20 percent below the Gallup series. It is suggested that the two series have diverged over time because {{the views of}} the public about poverty level income have responded to increases in real income that have occurred since World War II while the <b>official</b> <b>measure</b> has remained fixed in real tenns...|$|R

25|$|The Coptic {{decline in}} Egypt {{occurred}} under the Bahri sultans and accelerated further under the Burji regime. There were several instances of Egyptian Muslim {{protests against the}} wealth of Coptic Christians and their employment with the state, and both Muslim and Christian rioters burned down each other's houses of worship in times of intercommunal tensions. As a result of popular pressure, Coptic Christians had their employment in the bureaucracy terminated at least nine times between the late 13th and mid-15th centuries, and on one occasion, in 1301, the government ordered the closure of all churches. Coptic bureaucrats would often be restored to their positions after the moment of tension passed. Many Coptic Christians decided to convert to Islam or at least adopt the outward expressions of Muslim faith to protect their employment, avoid jizyah taxation and avoid <b>official</b> <b>measures</b> against them. The 14th century saw a large wave of Coptic conversions to Islam, {{and by the end}} of the Mamluk period, the ratio of Muslims to Christians in Egypt may have risen to 10:1.|$|E

60|$|I {{had heard}} this matter {{discussed}} by Americans before I left England, and I have of course heard it discussed very frequently in America. There {{can be no}} doubt that the front of the offense given by England to the Northern States was this declaration of Lord John Russell's. But it has been always made evident to me that the sin did not consist in the fact of England's neutrality--in the fact of her regarding the two parties as belligerents--but in the open declaration made to the world by a Secretary of State that she did intend so to regard them. If another proof were wanting, this would afford another proof of the immense weight attached in America to all the proceedings and to all the feelings of England on this matter. The very anger of the North is a compliment paid by the North to England. But not the less is that anger unreasonable. To those in America who understand our constitution, it must be evident that our government cannot take <b>official</b> <b>measures</b> without a public avowal of such measures. France can do so. Russia can do so. The government of the United States can do so, and could do so even before this rupture. But the government of England cannot do so. All men connected with the government in England have felt themselves from time to time more or less hampered by the necessity of publicity. Our statesmen have been forced to fight their battles with the plan of their tactics open before their adversaries. But we in England are inclined to believe that the general result is good, and that battles so fought and so won will be fought with the honestest blows and won with the surest results. Reticence in this matter was not possible; and Lord John Russell, in making the open avowal which gave such offense to the Northern States, only did that which, as a servant of England, England required him to do.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to {{concerns about the}} adequacy of the <b>official</b> federal poverty <b>measure,</b> a new Supplemental Poverty Measure was recently developed to more accurately assess poverty. This fact sheet presents a rather different picture of poverty in the United States for the various demographic groups based on the Supplemental Poverty Measure and compares this new picture to the understanding of poverty based on the <b>official</b> <b>measure,</b> using data for the 2010 calendar year. The poverty rate is higher under the Supplemental Poverty Measure (15. 9 percent poor, IWPR analysis of BLS data) than it is under the <b>official</b> poverty <b>measure</b> (15. 1 percent poor; DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, and Smith 2011) for the total U. S. population and for most of the demographic groups examined. Under the Supplemental Poverty Measure, there is also less inequality in poverty across gender, race/ethnicity, age, and marital status than is found using the standard measure. The new measure will now be released by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) along with the <b>official</b> <b>measure</b> each year. The key differences between the Supplemental Poverty <b>Measure</b> and the <b>official</b> poverty <b>measure</b> are that the supplemental measure includes a more accurate assessment of resources and a more accurate measure of the poverty line (also known as the threshold, the point at which a household's resources are inadequate enough to define it as living in poverty; Women of Color Policy Network 2011).
