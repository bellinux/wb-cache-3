40|$|In the {{previous}} paper, the authors examined {{the effect of}} the programmed learning method and pupils' reaction upon it. The method was tested in two ways, one was at 'teacher's pace' and the other at 'pupils' pace'. And for both the same learning program was used. At 'teacher's pace' some pupils complained of the shortage <b>of</b> <b>response</b> time while others felt it longer and the lesson tedious and irksome. This is one of the defects inevitable in mass teaching. Individual teaching at 'pupils' pace' can be free from this defect, but limited time makes it impossible for us to adopt it. Thus we have to find the proper length <b>of</b> <b>response</b> time for the mass teaching at 'teacher's pace'. We made our experiment as follows: We defined the ratio of the number of the answers to the number of the whole group as the rate <b>of</b> <b>response,</b> and investigated the relation between this rate <b>of</b> <b>response</b> and the effect on pupils in order to see what is the most suitable rate <b>of</b> <b>response.</b> We made junior high school second year boys the subject of the experiment, and divided them into groups and tested with the rate <b>of</b> <b>response</b> as parameter. In this experiment we used V. T. R. for teaching action, and the Minilyzer for detecting the rate <b>of</b> <b>response.</b> Our experiment revealed the following data on condition that the reinforcement was fully carried out in each frame. 1) High rate <b>of</b> <b>response</b> corresponds to longer time <b>of</b> <b>response,</b> but no appreciable advance is observed in the effect of learning after the rate <b>of</b> <b>response</b> gets to the range of 70 % to 90 %. 2) Too much time is required to hike the rate <b>of</b> <b>response</b> up to 90 %. 3) Considering teaching efficiency, the appropriate response time is that which corresponds to the rate <b>of</b> <b>response</b> around 80 %...|$|R

5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan.

Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E

Among the criticisms the Kinsey Report received, a particular one addressed the Institute for Sex Research's tendency to use statistical sampling, which facilitated an over-representation of same-sex relationships by other researchers who did not adhere to Kinsey's qualifications of data.|$|E

40|$|According to the conflict-monitoring {{model of}} {{cognitive}} control, the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) {{plays an important}} role in detecting conflict between competing motor responses. Consistent with this view, pMFC activity is greater in high-conflict trials (e. g., incongruent trials and errors) than in low-conflict trials (e. g., congruent trials and correct <b>responses)</b> <b>of</b> distractor interference tasks. However, in both low- and high-conflict trials, pMFC activity increases linearly with reaction time (RT). Thus, heightened pMFC activity in high-conflict trials may simply reflect the fact that mean RT is longer in high-conflict than in low-conflict trials. To investigate this hypothesis, we reanalyzed data from a previously published fMRI study in which participants performed an event-related version of the multi-source interference task. Critically, after controlling for conditional differences in mean RT, effects <b>of</b> <b>response</b> congruency on pMFC activity were eliminated; in contrast, effects <b>of</b> <b>response</b> accuracy on pMFC activity remained robust. These findings indicate that effects <b>of</b> <b>response</b> congruency on pMFC activity may index any of several processes whose recruitment increases with time on task (e. g., sustained attention). However, effects <b>of</b> <b>response</b> accuracy reflect processes unique to error trials. We conclude that effects <b>of</b> <b>response</b> accuracy on pMFC activity provide stronger support for the conflict-monitoring model than effects <b>of</b> <b>response</b> congruency...|$|R
