5|$|Delayed by {{the change}} to the rules, McCool had a five-year stint from 1956 in English county cricket. Somerset, having {{finished}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the County Championship table for the four years between 1952–1955, had embarked on a renewal programme. Part of the programme involved a vigorous recruiting campaign, including an offer to McCool that saw him return to first-class cricket {{at the age of}} 39.|$|E
30|$|Since {{bacteria}} form biofilms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> {{and sides}} of plates, confocal laser microscopy was used to observe biofilm formation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of 96 -well polystyrene plates. In-line with our quantitative data, 5 -iodoindole at 0.2  mM (1 / 10 of MIC) dramatically inhibited biofilm formation by E. coli and S. aureus (Fig.  4 d, e). Also, relative amounts of biofilm formation by E. coli and S. aureus confirmed that S. aureus 6538 produced markedly more biofilm than E. coli BW 25113 under the same conditions.|$|R
50|$|A rabbit {{cannot be}} declawed. Lacking pads <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of its feet, a rabbit {{requires}} its claws for balance. Removing its claws would render it unable to stand.|$|R
5000|$|Caenis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} mayfly genera of the Holarctic. Larvae can occur in high densities <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of shallow ponds and lakes up to an altitude of 1800 meters in the Alps.|$|R
5|$|In 1967, an {{immigrant}} family acquired {{ownership of the}} theater. The Maizels family also owned other cinemas, including Aladdin Theater, the defunct and demolished Walnut Park, and the Encore, now known as Clinton Street Theater. In addition to Hollywood films, the cinemas screened art-house and Spanish-language movies. Multi-light Broadway Sign Co. installed corrugated aluminum <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the marquee in 1975.|$|E
5|$|In {{what turned}} out to be their final ever game, Cumberland were only able to field eleven out of the {{required}} thirteen players. The club ended up borrowing two players from the opposing team North Sydney to play for them, who were 'Paddy' Boland and Bert Odbert. They lost this game 45–0 and were awarded the wooden spoon for finishing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the competition ladder.|$|E
5|$|Oil and gas form <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of shallow seas when {{micro-organisms}} decompose under anoxic {{conditions and}} later become covered with sediment. Many deserts were {{at one time}} the sites of shallow seas and others have had underlying hydrocarbon deposits transported {{to them by the}} movement of tectonic plates.|$|E
50|$|The {{natural range}} of M. spectabilis {{stretches}} from Kodiak Island, Alaska to Baja California. It is commonly found under ledges and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of rocks in intertidal waters {{to a depth}} of 10 m (33 feet).|$|R
50|$|Cow Island has {{reverted to}} just another distant spot {{in one of}} the more remote areas of Montana. Deserted {{homestead}} buildings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of Cow Creek and adjacent Bull Creek attest to the difficulty of agricultural pursuits in this remote area.|$|R
50|$|Toho, {{the other}} major Japanese supplier, {{seems to have a}} more {{flexible}} packaging policy. Many of the tubed seed beads that can be found in craft stores are stamped with their name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms,</b> indicating both a wholesale and retail packaging setup.|$|R
5|$|On June 20, 2017, the Devils {{revealed}} {{their new}} uniforms for the 2017–18 season. Made by Adidas, the new sweaters {{are the first}} major change to the team's look since they replaced green with black. They feature {{the removal of the}} stripes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the sweater, and also thicker sleeve stripes with equal width bands of white and black.|$|E
5|$|Phenomena {{associated}} with eclipses include shadow bands (also known as flying shadows), which {{are similar to}} shadows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of a swimming pool. They only occur just prior to and after totality, when a narrow solar crescent acts as an anisotropic light source.|$|E
5|$|Stocking of {{the lake}} with fish began before the {{reservoir}} was filled, with a small rearing pond being placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the valley. The lake has several species of freshwater fish; largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, bluegill, crappie, rainbow trout, striped bass, channel catfish, and shad. It {{is considered one of}} the best fisheries in California.|$|E
5000|$|With {{a roll of}} doubles, {{the player}} makes four moves, {{one for each of}} <b>the</b> numbers <b>on</b> top of <b>the</b> two dice and one for each of <b>the</b> numbers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms.</b> <b>The</b> player may {{distribute}} these four moves among one, two, three, or four pieces. Note that the sum of numbers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposite sides of a die is always seven, so with doubles, there are a total of fourteen spaces to move.|$|R
50|$|It {{was used}} as a {{preservative}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of wooden, Nordic style skis until modern synthetic materials replaced wood in the construction of such skis. The pine tar also helped the adhesion of waxes which aided the grip and glide of such skis.|$|R
5000|$|Lindquist {{signed his}} work with a simple script [...] "L" [...] {{including}} the date and type of wood from the early 1950s until 1980. After 1980 he signed {{his work with}} an incised script signature [...] "Mel Lindquist" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of his pieces.|$|R
5|$|The Gevninge helmet {{fragment}} is {{what remains}} of a Danish helmet from the Viking Age or end of the Nordic Iron Age. Made of gilded bronze, it consists of a stylised eyebrow above an oval with eyelashes, and originally formed the right eyepiece of the helmet. Three holes {{on the top and}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the fragment would have once held it in place.|$|E
5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray is an ambush predator that employs electricity to capture prey. Vision is of little importance in hunting, as the ray's eyes are often obscured as it lies buried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> Instead, it likely relies on the mechanoreceptors of its lateral line, as it only attacks moving prey. The electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini may also contribute to prey detection.|$|E
5|$|Two torpedoes {{fired by}} {{land-based}} torpedo batteries struck the ship, causing serious damage. A major {{fire broke out}} aboard Blücher, {{which could not be}} contained. After a magazine explosion, the ship sank, with major loss of life. The wreck remains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the Oslofjord.|$|E
50|$|Sculpins are benthic fish, {{dwelling}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> {{of water}} bodies. Their pectoral fins are smooth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper edge and webbed with sharp rays along the lower edge, a modification {{that makes them}} specialized for gripping the substrate. This adaptation helps the fish anchor in fast-flowing water.|$|R
50|$|The stipes (leaf stems) of Bommeria are hairy, {{with some}} scales, and the fronds are hairy, both above and below. The hairs above and short and sharp, while the hairs below may be {{straight}} or curled. Scales are also present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of <b>the</b> fronds.|$|R
50|$|A {{mangrove}} {{can reach}} up to 80 ft in height in ideal conditions; however, {{it is commonly}} found at a more modest 20 ft. Its bark is thick and a grey-brown color. Mangrove leaves are 1 - 2 in wide and 3 - 5 in long, with smooth margins and an ellipse shape. They are a darker shade of green <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tops than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms.</b> <b>The</b> tree produces pale pink flowers in the spring.|$|R
5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest and underwear cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E
5|$|Brummer and Bremse {{typically}} operated together {{throughout the}} war. They participated in numerous minelaying operations in 1916 and 1917. The two cruisers devastated a British convoy to Norway in October 1917, sinking the two escorting destroyers {{and most of}} the transports. Both were interned at Scapa Flow {{at the end of the}} war; they were successfully scuttled in June 1919. Brummer remains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the harbor, but Bremse was raised for scrapping in 1929 and broken up in the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Cöln and Dresden {{joined the}} High Seas Fleet in 1918, which limited their service careers. They were {{assigned}} to the II Scouting Group, and participated in an abortive fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys. They were to have led attacks on British merchant traffic designed to lure out the British Grand Fleet and force a climactic fleet battle {{in the final days of}} the war, but the Wilhelmshaven Mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan. The two ships were interned and eventually scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919. Both Dresden and Cöln remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of Scapa Flow.|$|E

50|$|Most {{are found}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> and edges of shallow {{seasonal}} ponds in old dune fields, but in drier areas they occur in low riverine habitat.Most Lindera colonies occur in light shade beneath a forest canopy, {{but a few}} grow in almost full sunlight. In warmer areas they occur in bottomland hardwood forests.|$|R
5|$|El Sol settled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> at a 45° angle {{with only}} the tops of her masts {{protruding}} above the surface; the Morgan Line house flag—a blue house flag with a red M inside a white star—still fluttered in the breeze. Even though the sunken vessel was not considered a hazard to navigation, in another fog two days later a Staten Island Ferryboat nearly hit El Sols wreck.|$|E
5|$|Hydra the Revenge {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars that can seat four riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders per train. Each train has two shades of green and pink <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> section while the seats and over-the-shoulder restraints are also pink. Each seat has an over-the-shoulder harness with an interlocking seatbelt. The trains have no floor as the riders' legs can dangle above the track.|$|E
5|$|In September 1909, {{three of}} the ships, Liberté, Justice, and Vérité visited the United States for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. Two years later, Libertés forward {{magazines}} exploded in Toulon harbor, destroying the ship and killing approximately 250 of her crew. The three surviving ships saw action early in World War I at the Battle of Antivari, and spent the remainder blockading the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic and were later stationed at Mudros in the Aegean. They were stricken from the naval register in 19211922 and broken up for scrap. Liberté was left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of Toulon harbor until 1925, when she was raised and broken up for scrap.|$|E
50|$|Pelagic fish live in {{the water}} column of coastal, ocean, and lake waters, but not <b>on</b> or near <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of <b>the</b> sea or the lake. They can be contrasted with {{demersal}} fish, which live <b>on</b> or near <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> and coral reef fish.|$|R
5000|$|Chaetopappa pulchella [...] grows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of {{canyons and}} ravines in the Chihuahuan Desert. It {{is a small}} plant rarely more than 7 cm (2.8 inches) tall though {{possessing}} a taproot and hence perhaps capable of surviving inhospitable seasons {{to act as a}} perennial. Flower heads have lavender ray florets and yellow disc florets.|$|R
50|$|The Blackfin sorcerer {{is known}} to live in holes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of {{continental}} slopes. Its natural predators include cod-like fish such as the European Hake, whilst its prey include small crustaceans and small fish. Its small size and location at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of continental slopes make it of no danger to humans and is also of no use to fisheries due to the abundance of other eels which are easier to locate and catch.|$|R
