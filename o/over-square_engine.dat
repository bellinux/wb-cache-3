50|$|The <b>over-square</b> <b>engine,</b> {{that met}} Euro1, was fed by a Keihin slide type {{carburetor}} with accelerator pump for better pick-up. It {{makes use of}} a larger spring operated nozzle to provide a richer fuel air mixture into the engine for better acceleration. An air injection system injects fresh air into the exhaust port, to meet the emission norms.|$|E
5000|$|Honda employs {{advanced}} {{four-stroke engine}} technology in their 250cc and 450cc bikes. The engines in these bikes use technology developed in Formula One racing engines. Honda uses an <b>over-square</b> <b>engine</b> design, {{which means that}} the diameter of the cylinder is larger than the stroke of the piston. This allows for higher engine speeds and a reduction of reciprocating mass. Another technology that is used is short piston skirts. The [...] "skirt" [...] area of the piston is the portion {{on the side of the}} piston which comes into contact with the cylinder wall and aids piston stability. While the introduction of the shorter skirt on the piston helps to reduce reciprocating mass, it also leads to more [...] "rocking" [...] of the piston, or minute unwanted rotation of the piston around the axis of its wrist pin. This leads to more frequent maintenance intervals for the pistons, piston rings, and cylinder walls.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] {{four-cylinder engine}} was {{replaced}} in August 1962 by a Lotus-developed <b>over-square</b> [...] <b>engine</b> {{with a new}} five-bearing crankshaft and a new gearbox with syncromesh on all four forward ratios. Steering and suspension also received [...] "greased for life" [...] joints.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1952 the Velox was redesignated as the EIPV series, and {{received}} a new <b>over-square</b> 2262 cc <b>engine</b> which {{had been in the}} development pipeline for several years. This provided either [...] or, with a compression ratio improved to 7.6:1, [...] of power.|$|R
