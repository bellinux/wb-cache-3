50|$|In {{the study}} of traffic flow theory, the flow-density diagram is used to {{determine}} the traffic state of a roadway. Currently, {{there are two types of}} flow density graphs. The first is the parabolic shaped flow-density curve, and the second is the triangular shaped flow-density curve. Academia views the triangular shaped flow-density curve as more the accurate representation of real world events. The triangular shaped curve consists of two vectors. The first vector is the freeflow side of the curve. This vector is created by placing the freeflow velocity vector of a roadway at the origin of the flow-density graph. The second vector is the congested branch, which is created by placing the vector of the shock wave speed at zero flow and jam density. The congested branch has a negative slope, which implies that the higher the density on the congested branch the lower the flow; therefore, even though there are more cars on the road, the number of cars passing a single point is less than if there were fewer cars on the road. The intersection of freeflow and congested vectors is the apex of the curve and is considered the capacity of the roadway, which is the traffic condition at which the maximum number of vehicles can pass by a point in a given time period. The flow and capacity at which this point occurs is the optimum flow and <b>optimum</b> <b>density,</b> respectively. The flow density diagram is used to give the traffic condition of a roadway. With the traffic conditions, time-space diagrams can be created to give travel time, delay, and queue lengths of a road segment.|$|E
50|$|Aliens plant crops {{of their}} own, which act as weeds and choke the player's own crops {{and take up}} some of the planet surface's limited space {{suitable}} for crop planting. These weeds can be destroyed by the player firing on them. Indigenous weeds also spread across planet surfaces, unlike alien crops these cannot be razed by the player's weapon fire. The daughtership can plant crops if the player has seed available, when planted seeds grow through three coloured stages, once at the third stage they can be harvested; failure to harvest crops in time will result in them withering. Crops behave in a lifelike fashion; too many or too few crops in an area stunts their growth, players must find the <b>optimum</b> <b>density</b> of crop. The daughtership can hold a limited amount of crop units, indicated by a bar on the screen which fills when crops are collected, collecting more than the ship can carry will result in a crash landing and the destruction of the vessel. The mothership also has limited cargo space, once the mothership's hold is full the vessel must return home so that the crops can be sold. The mothership cannot ascend from the planet's surface until all alien aggressors have been eliminated, forcing the player to destroy the enemy before escaping. Upon returning home the harvested crops, remaining seeds and remaining daughterships are converted into cash, allowing the player to purchase new daughterships with improved shields to defend against rivals. At this point the player can return to the same planet, where additional alien farmers will now be present, or move onto the next and more difficult planet. Each new planet features more powerful and numerous alien ships.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{data file}} for feed {{formulation}} {{of a major}} broiler integrator was used in studies of formulation techniques that affect proportionality among required nutrients. 1) The current practice, often called "optimum density " or "nutrient factoring, " was examined. In <b>optimum</b> <b>density</b> rations, the constraint on {{the weight of the}} diet is relaxed. It was demonstrated that this method merely results in proportionate changes in specified nutrient and ingredient minimums and maximums. <b>Optimum</b> <b>density</b> rations may reduce the cost of the diet in terms of cost per unit of energy only because of the altered constraints. 2) In a formulation related to <b>optimum</b> <b>density,</b> mixing and farm distribution cost was added to the feed mix problem on a per ton basis. This cost did not affect the constraint proportions of the ration (<b>optimum</b> <b>density)</b> until in excess of $ 100 / ton. 3) A method of creating proportionality coefficients that allows nutrient ratios to be specified instead of levels and ranges is presented.

This research was intended to calculate the capacity and <b>optimum</b> <b>density</b> on on-ramp merging segments with Finnish traffic flow. Measured data has been gathered in 2013 from six on-ramp merging areas in Helsinki Metropolitan Area. Traffic flow data was collected from six recording cameras on each site located before and after the merging of vehicles. The data used in this research excludes disturbances such as accidents, roadwork, and bad weather. The HCM model’s parameters were estimated by the measured data. The measured data was used to estimate average speed, traffic volume, and traffic density. The examination was then completed in two parts.

40|$|High Temperature Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (HT-ATES) {{systems can}} be {{implemented}} to store geothermal energy, residual industrial heat and solar heat. Due to the large temperature differences between the injection fluid and ambient groundwater, buoyancy flow occurs, which causes heat losses which in turn results in poor efficiency of such systems. The heat losses can be reduced by applying density difference compensation, this entails injection water with a higher salinity, {{to compensate for the}} low density caused by the high temperature of the injection fluid. The goal {{of this study is to}} get insight into the behaviour of a possible HT-ATES system on the campus of the TU Delft with the injection of saline groundwater from deeper layers for storage in both less deep and less saline aquifers. To achieve this different cases will be considered; a reference case, a theoretical <b>optimum,</b> <b>density</b> difference compensation of the TU Delft case and the <b>optimum</b> <b>density</b> difference compensation. For these cases, different scenarios are modelled in SEAWAT to identify the influence of injection temperature, injection volume, aquifer thickness, and hydraulic conductivity on the behaviour of the system. Using the density difference compensation from the aquifer at TU Delft, with a salinity of 16. 4 kg/m^ 3, a maximum improvement of 2. 0 % can be achieved. Also, differences between the different scenarios for the TU Delft case were maximum 2. 5 %, with exception for a thicker aquifer or smaller injection volume. Due to the large injection volume in thin aquifers, the hot water has a large volume, causing conduction losses to dominate in the system. For thick aquifers a lot of density driven flow occurs in the reference case. With <b>optimum</b> <b>density</b> difference compensation, having a salinity of 39. 1 kg/m^ 3, the density driven flow can be significantly decreased and the efficiency increased with 21. 5 %. Both aquifer thickness and salinity of the injection fluid have a negative correlation with salt recovery. Thin aquifers in relation to injection volume are not sensitive to density driven flow, so density difference compensation is not useful for such HT-ATES systems. Density difference compensation in the case of the TU does give significant improvement in efficiency. The most influential parameter on the efficiency is aquifer thickness, for both the cold and warm well, in relation to injection volume. For thick aquifers with <b>optimum</b> <b>density</b> difference compensation the highest efficiency of 75. 5 % is achieved after 10 cycles. Civil Engineerin...|$|E
