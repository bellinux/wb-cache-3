This device {{is equipped with}} Peltier modules for air conditioning of a bioclimatic habitat model. The analysis of the numerical results shows that the length (L) of the canal significantly influences {{the operation of the}} device. If length (L) ranging between 0. 55 m and 0. 95 m, the average <b>outgoing</b> <b>temperature</b> is 25. 72 °C while mass airflow = 0. 082 kg. s- 1 in April; 25. 3 °C and = 0. 81 kg. s- 1 in May; 25 °C with = 0. 080 kg. s- 1 in June. The analysis also shows that the side walls (h) of the device equipped with Peltier modules. The impact the functioning of the device and leads to new values for average temperatures released from the canal. These temperatures are 23. 31 °C in April, 22. 55 °C in May, and 22. 06 in June. Also, the number of modules required for the whole device is 18. Overall, we present how this very simple device leads to better thermal comfort in hot regions...|$|E

An optimization algorithm is presented for the non-linear constrained problem {{to maximize the}} annual net profit for a system of counter-flow heat exchangers. Several parameters that affect the net profit are examined, including the mass flow rates of working fluids and heat transfer area, which both directly affect the <b>outgoing</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The performance of the heat exchanger and fuel savings by reducing fuel consumption to generate heat are modeled within the problem formulation. Also, power input to the pump for fluid circulation is included. By formulating these multiple parameters {{over a wide range}} of design conditions, the algorithm presents a useful new design tool for the improvement of heat exchanger networks in geothermal systems...|$|R

However, for sanitation, hot water is needed at a temperature that can cause scalding. This may be accomplished by using a supplemental heater in an appliance that requires hotter water.Most residential dishwashing machines, for example, include an internal electric heating element for increasing the water temperature above that provided by a domestic water heater.|$|R
40|$|From September 2007 until August 2010, an {{automatic}} weather station (AWS) has been operating at 650 m a. s. l. in the ablation area of Langfjordjøkelen (Fig. 12 - 2), as {{a contribution to the}} International Polar Year (Glaciodyn). The station (Fig. 12 - 6) was owned and maintained by the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric research Utrecht (IMAU), Utrecht University (contact: J. Oerlemans@uu. nl). The station recorded shortwave and longwave radiation (incoming and <b>outgoing),</b> air <b>temperature,</b> relative humidity, wind speed and direction, air pressure and distance to the surface. Sampling was done every few minutes (depending on the sensor) and 30 -minute averages were stored. The measurements will be used to study the local microclimate at Langfjordjøkelen and to calibrate a mass balance model for the ice cap. Here, we present a selection of the data collected over the three-year period...|$|R
40|$|Cooling {{accounts}} for {{a large amount of}} the global primary energy consumption in buildings and industrial processes. A substantial part of this cooling demand is produced by mechanical cooling towers. Simulations benefit the sizing and integration of cooling towers in overall cooling networks. However, for these simulations fast-to-calculate and easy-to-parametrize models are required. In this paper, a new model is developed for a mechanical draught cooling tower with both a cooling coil and a fill pack. The model needs manufacturers' performance data at only three operational states (at varying air and water flow rates) to be parametrized. The model predicts the cooled, <b>outgoing</b> water <b>temperature.</b> These predictions were compared with experimental data {{for a wide range of}} operational states. The model was able to predict the temperature with a maximum absolute error of 0. 59 °C. The relative error of cooling capacity was mostly between ± 5 %...|$|R

30|$|Historical {{data from}} oceanographic expeditions and {{remotely}} sensed data on <b>outgoing</b> longwave radiation, <b>temperature,</b> wind speed and ocean {{color in the}} western Arabian Sea (1950 – 2010) were used to investigate decadal trends in the physical and biochemical properties of the upper 300  m. 72  % of the 29, 043 vertical profiles retrieved originated from USA and UK expeditions. Increasing outgoing longwave radiation, surface air temperatures and sea surface temperature were identified on decadal timescales. These were well correlated with decreasing wind speeds associated with a reduced Siberian High atmospheric anomaly. Shoaling of the oxycline and nitracline was observed as well as acidification of the upper 300  m. These physical and chemical changes were accompanied by declining chlorophyll-a concentrations, vertical macrofaunal habitat compression, declining sardine landings and an increase of fish kill incidents along the Omani coast.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} measurements {{performed in}} three district heating (DH) substations in semidetached houses. In all these houses more than 40 % {{of the domestic}} hot water (DHW) tappings {{turned out to be}} shorter than 10 s. The fraction of total energy used to heat this water varied between 2. 4 % and 10. 2 %, indicating a large influence of households' daily habits. For 60 - 78 % of tappings, the total amount of supplied DH water volume was below 2. 5 litres, which underlines the importance of using small volume pulses for the energy metering. When analysing the off-load behaviour of the DH substations it was established that radiator circuit control valves for the most part of the studied period were working on/off. During periods when there was no radiator load, the primary supply temperature was typically 50 - 60 degrees C, which was higher than expected. The differences in supply temperature level between the substations might be caused by leaking valves or by differences in off-load set point temperature of DHW control valves. Furthermore, the measurements indicate large differences among DHW controllers regarding the characteristics of the feed-forward control. In more than 80 % of the tappings with duration of more than 10 s, an <b>outgoing</b> DHW <b>temperature</b> of at least 40 degrees C was obtained within a maximum of 10 s. However, depending on the house studied, in 17 - 55 % of those tappings the monitored DHW temperature did not reach the level of at least 50 degrees C, as required by the Swedish District Heating Association...|$|R
40|$|We {{simulate}} the observed statistical relationship between ENSO and the rainfall regime {{of the upper}} Blue Nile using the tropical-band version of the regional climate model RegCM 4 (or Reg-TB). An ensemble of nine simulations for the 28 -year period 1982 – 2009 is completed to investigate the role of ENSO in modulating rainfall over the upper Blue Nile catchment. Reg-TB shows a good skill in simulating the climatology of <b>temperature,</b> <b>outgoing</b> long-wave radiation patterns as well as related atmospheric circulation features during the summer season (i. e. the rainy season over the Blue Nile catchment). The model also succeeds in reproducing the observed negative correlation between Pacific SST and rainfall anomalies over the Blue Nile catchment, {{and in particular the}} association of droughts over the Blue Nile with El Niño events that start in April–June. We thus propose that observations and model forecasts of Pacific SST during this season could be used in seasonal forecasting of summer rainfall over the upper Blue Nile region.

It is presented that a systematic review on the international researches on the topic during the past 30 years, in the respects of remote sensing data applications, anomaly analysis methods, and mechanism understanding. Firstly, the outlines of remote sensing data applications are given including infrared brightness temperature, microwave brightness <b>temperature,</b> <b>outgoing</b> longwave radiation, and assimilated data from multiple earth observations. Secondly, three development phases are summarized as qualitative analysis based on visual interpretation, quantitative analysis based on image processing, and multi-parameter spatio-temporal correlation analysis. Thirdly, the theoretical hypotheses presented for the mechanism understanding are introduced including earth degassing, stress-induced heat, crustal rock battery conversion, latent heat release due to radon decay as well as multi-spheres coupling effect. Finally, three key directions of future research on this topic are proposed:anomaly recognizing by remote sensing monitoring and data analysis for typical tectonic activity areas; anomaly mechanism understanding based on earthquake-related earth system responses; spatio-temporal correlation analysis of air-based, space-based and ground-based stereoscopic observations...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{anomalies}} {{which are}} known to be significant precursors of strong earthquakes can be evidenced by spectral thermal infrared (TIR) bands recorded by sensors on board of NOAA-AVHRR and Terra/Aqua- MODIS satellite. In order to locate relevant thermal anomalous variations prior to some strong even moderate earthquakes recorded in Vrancea tectonic active zone in Romania, satellite derived geophysical parameters have been used: land surface <b>temperature</b> (LST), <b>outgoing</b> long-wave radiation (OLR) and mean air temperature (AT). Spatiotemporal variations of LST, OLR, and AT before and after three strong earthquakes in Vrancea area (Mw = 7. 4, 4 March 1977; Mw = 7. 1, 30 August 1986; Mw = 6. 9, 30 May 1990) and a moderate earthquake (Mw = 5. 9, 27 October 2004) have been analyzed. Anomalous spatio-temporal patterns of these parameters developed a few days up to few weeks before the earthquakes disappeared after the main shocks. Significant increases in land surface <b>temperature,</b> <b>outgoing</b> long-wave radiation, and mean air temperature can be assigned to energy exchange mechanism during earthquake preparatory events. Such preseismic anomalies can be considered {{to be associated with the}} thermodynamic, degassing and ionization geochemical processes which seem to be activated due to the increased stress in the ground, and microfracturing of the rocks especially along area’s active faults...|$|R
40|$|Global {{concern about}} world climatic change and animal {{well-being}} has triggered greater attention regarding {{the effects of}} climatic anomalies on livestock. The objectives of this dissertation were: (1) to assess the effect of radiation components and other environmental variables on tympanic temperature and daily water intake of cattle; (2) to model tympanic temperature and daily water intake based on environmental variables; and (3) to assess the effect of soil surface temperature on comfort indices of cattle during summertime. In order to accomplish these objectives, a series of experiments were conducted during the period 2003 to 2008 at the University of Nebraska. Environmental variables were collected from a weather station located in the feedlot, whereas radiation measurements were collected using precision spectral pyranometers and precision infrared radiometers, which were located in empty pens during different months, years, and locations. Tympanic temperature, daily water intake, panting scores and respiration rate were also collected in each experiment. Tympanic temperatures were collected using data logger devices (Stowaway and/or iButtons), which were fitted into the ear canal of steers. Statistical analyses included correlation, autocorrelation, repeated measures, simple and multiple regressions, and ANOVA. Soil surface <b>temperature,</b> <b>outgoing</b> radiation (long and shortwave) and wind speed {{had a significant effect}} on tympanic temperature during the summer. Thermal and solar radiation had a positive impact on tympanic temperature of finishing steers during the summer, when radiation received by steers was significantly greater than during the winter, when no relationship was found. In addition, soil surface temperature was a novel and promising variable to be used to predict tympanic temperature and daily water intake in finishing cattle. It is expected that in the future, it will be essential to collect more detailed information on the microclimate in feedlot operations. This will allow the incorporation of environmental conditions as a decision tool for managing heat stress. ...|$|R
40|$|Snow surface {{temperature}} {{is a key}} control on and result of dynamically coupled energy exchanges at the snow surface. The snow {{surface temperature}} {{is the result of}} the balance between external forcing (incoming radiation) and energy exchanges above the surface that depend on surface <b>temperature</b> (<b>outgoing</b> longwave radiation and turbulent fluxes) and the transport of energy into the snow by conduction and meltwater influx. Because of the strong insulating properties of snow, thermal gradients in snow packs are large and nonlinear, a fact that has led many to advocate multiple layer snowmelt models over single layer models. In an effort to keep snowmelt modeling simple and parsimonious, the Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snowmelt model used only one layer but allowed the snow surface temperature to be different from the snow average temperature by using an equilibrium gradient parameterization based on the surface energy balance. Although this procedure was considered an improvement over the ordinary single layer snowmelt models, it still resulted in discrepancies between modeled and measured snowpack energy contents. In this paper we evaluate the equilibrium gradient approach, the force-restore approach, and a modified force-restore approach when they are integrated as part of a complete energy and mass balance snowmelt model. The force-restore and modified force-restore approaches have not been incorporated into the UEB in early versions, even though Luce and Tartoton have done work in calculating the energy components using these approaches. In addition, we evaluate a scheme for representing the penetration of a refreezing front in cold periods following melt. We introduce a method to adjust effective conductivity to account for the presence of ground near to a shallow snow surface. These parameterizations were tested against data from the Central Sierra Snow Laboratory, CA, Utah State University experimental farm, UT, and subnivean snow laboratory at Niwot Ridge, CO. These tests compare modeled and measured snow surface temperature, snow energy content, snow water equivalent, and snowmelt outflow. We found that with these refinements the model is able to better represent the snowpack energy balance and internal energy content while still retaining a parsimonious one layer format...|$|R
