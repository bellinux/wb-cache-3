5|$|St Andrew's Church {{dates from}} the 12th century with a large 15th century pinnacled {{sandstone}} tower, a Norman font and a rood screen that is the full width of the church. In the church are several memorials to the Stracheys of Sutton Court together with a wooden effigy of a Knight cross-legged and leaning on <b>one</b> <b>elbow,</b> in 15th century armour, thought to be of Sir John de Hauteville or a descendant, and possibly transferred from a church at Norton Hautville before it was demolished.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{shooting}} {{attributed to}} the Son of Sam occurred in the Pelham Bay area of the Bronx. At about 1:10a.m. on July 29, 1976, Donna Lauria, 18, and her friend Jody Valenti, 19, were sitting in Valenti's Oldsmobile, discussing their evening at Peachtree's, a New Rochelle discotheque. Lauria {{opened the car door}} to leave and noticed a man quickly approaching the car. Startled and angered by the man's sudden appearance, she said, [...] "Now what is this..." [...] The man produced a pistol from the paper bag that he carried and crouched. He braced <b>one</b> <b>elbow</b> on his knee, aimed his weapon with both hands, and fired. Lauria was struck by one bullet that killed her instantly. Valenti was shot in her thigh, and a third bullet missed both women. The shooter turned and walked away quickly, without saying a word.|$|E
2500|$|John Gregory Bourke's {{memoir of}} his {{service in the}} Indian wars, On the Border with Crook, {{describes}} a different account of Crazy Horse's death. He based his account on an interview with Crazy Horse's rival, Little Big Man, who was present at Crazy Horse's arrest and wounding. The interview took place over a year after Crazy Horse's death. [...] Little Big Man said that, as Crazy Horse was being escorted to the guardhouse, he suddenly pulled two knives from under his blanket and held one in each hand. One knife was reportedly fashioned from an army bayonet. Little Big Man, standing behind him, seized Crazy Horse by both elbows, pulling his arms up behind him. As Crazy Horse struggled, Little Big Man lost his grip on <b>one</b> <b>elbow,</b> and Crazy Horse drove his own knife deep into his own lower back. The guard stabbed Crazy Horse with his bayonet in the back. The chief fell and surrendered to the guards.|$|E

2500|$|Early Roman art was {{influenced}} by the art of Greece and that of the neighbouring Etruscans, themselves greatly influenced by their Greek trading partners. An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in terracotta, usually lying on top of a sarcophagus lid propped up on <b>one</b> <b>elbow</b> in the pose of a diner in that period. As the expanding Roman Republic began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the Parthian far east, official and patrician sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period. By the 2nd century BCE, [...] "most of the sculptors working at Rome" [...] were Greek, often enslaved in conquests such as that of Corinth (146 BCE), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded. Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works.|$|E

60|$|It {{was not a}} {{pleasant}} prospect, {{and yet it was}} a reprieve. One is thankful for small mercies when a hairy savage with a blood-stained knife is standing at <b>one's</b> <b>elbow.</b> He dragged me from the room and I was thrust down the stairs and back into my cell. The door was locked and I was left to my reflections.|$|R
25|$|Lowering <b>ones</b> <b>elbow</b> {{below the}} knee during a 'pull' - known as 'Locking' - is a foul, as is {{touching}} the ground for extended periods of time. The rope must go under the arms; actions such as pulling the rope over the shoulders may be considered a foul. These rules apply in highly organized competitions such as the World Championships. However, in small or informal entertainment competitions, the rules are often arbitrarily interpreted and followed.|$|R

5000|$|Describing {{the song}} in AllMusic, it was said, [...] "There's a gentle lope and swing as much breezy '60s pop as there is roots revival intensity" [...] While the {{reviewer}} noted the oddly hollow drum sound, they concluded, [...] "Forster's ear for a lyrical image (check the part talking about hanging <b>one's</b> <b>elbow</b> {{out of the window}} of a car) and the soaring chorus make this number a winner in the end." ...|$|R

60|$|It takes a {{multitude}} {{to make such}} a stillness as followed that disorder of cheering. A man alone in a wilderness;--it's stillness of a sort no doubt, but he hears himself breathe, he hears himself move, he hears all sorts of things.

An Inglese! Corpo di Bacco! Who would have thought that a nation so maritime, and which lies so far off, would send so small a craft this vast distance! Why, Ghita, it is a voyage from Elba to Livorno, and yet, I dare say England is twenty times further." ...|$|R
50|$|Bursitis {{normally}} develops as {{a result}} either of a single injury to the elbow (for example, a hard blow {{to the tip of}} the elbow), or perhaps more commonly due to repeated minor injuries, such as repeated leaning on the point of the elbow on a hard surface. The chance of developing bursitis is higher if one's job or hobby involves a repetitive movement (for example, tennis, golf, or even repetitive computer work involving leaning on <b>one's</b> <b>elbow).</b> The likelihood of developing the condition is increased as one gets older.|$|R

50|$|Another {{frequent}} objection is {{that type}} identity theories fail {{to account for}} phenomenal mental states (or qualia), such as having a pain, feeling sad, experiencing nausea. (Qualia are merely the subjective qualities of conscious experience. An example {{is the way the}} pain of jarring <b>ones</b> <b>elbow</b> feels to the individual.) Arguments can be found in Saul Kripke (1972) and David Chalmers (1996), for example, according to which the identity theorist cannot identify phenomenal mental states with brain states (or any other physical state for that matter) because one has a sort of direct awareness of the nature of such qualitative mental states, and their nature is qualitative in a way that brain states are not.|$|R
5000|$|Lovelace often {{questioned}} basic assumptions {{by integrating}} poetry and science.

I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at <b>one's</b> <b>elbows</b> in <b>one</b> shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring [...] "the unseen worlds around us".|$|R

5000|$|He {{was known}} for {{submitting}} prisoners to punishment {{in the form of}} physical exercises, known as [...] "sport" [...] in the camp. Prisoners in quarantine were also made to do these exercises. On demand, a group of prisoners were expected to undertake any action, such as walking, singing, running, crawling on <b>one's</b> <b>elbows</b> and tips of the toes, roll around on the ground covered with gravel and crushed bricks, etc. Plagge was a specialist in the invention of these exercises, which were to be performed very quickly without any regard to the age and health of the prisoners. He would make prisoners run for hours while carrying his pipe between his teeth, and hit those who fell, forcing them to carry on. Prisoners nicknamed him das Pfeifchen (the little pipe).|$|R
