40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{push for}} leadfree microelectronics {{has caused the}} industry to revamp its design, material selection, and manufacturing processes of its products. However, the needs of industry have surpassed the current lead free standards set up by organizations such as JEDEC. This paper looks into how ANADIGICS defined internal standards, reviewed customer needs, and met them by using unique materials and processes prior {{to the release of}} leadfree standards for laminate based modules. Laminate based system in package products, which combine assembly process and materials, historically, have been limited to meeting Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL) 3 at 240 C. It is now possible to achieve this level at 260 C – a temperature requested by customers for leadfree assembly. The use of lead free solders has caused a significant rise in the reflow temperatures of packages and has therefore prompted the need for hightemperature <b>overmold</b> compounds. The high temperature capabilities of several <b>overmold</b> compounds {{that could be used to}} encapsulate laminate based modules were evaluated. Five <b>overmold</b> compounds were subjected to conditions specified for MSL 3 with a reflow peak temperature of 260 C. Three of the five <b>overmold</b> compounds that provided positive results were subjected to the more aggressive stress test of MSL 2 a at 260 C. Comparison of pre and post stress electrical tests to determine the change in electrical parameters, and comparison of pre and post stress sonoscan images to determine the change in percent delamination were used to judge the performance of the <b>overmold</b> compounds.

A new packaging method for microfluidic devices is proposed of polymer over-molding to form a fluidic manifold integrated with the device in a single step. The anticipated advantages of the proposed method of packaging are ease of assembly and low part count, making it suitable for low cost and high volume manufacturing. This paper reports the results of a preliminary investigation into this concept. Glass and silicon inserts of 25 times 20 mm in size, used to represent microfluidic devices, were over-molded in an injection molding process with a range of polymers. The inserts were found to survive the molding process intact. The adhesion between <b>overmold</b> and insert was investigated by subjecting the interface between the <b>overmold</b> and insert surface to a hydrostatic pressure of up to 100 lbf/in 2 (6. 9 bar). The durability of the interfacial adhesion to hydrolysis was investigated by immersion in water at 50 degC for 24 h before testing. Direct measurements of adhesion strength between polymer and glass were also attempted by tensile tests on lap-jointed samples. The best and most durable adhesion for glass and silicon inserts was found for polyamide (PA) 12, which is a low hygroscopicity PA. The ranking of polymers by their performances in the pressurization tests was consistent with the ranking by the calculated work-of-adhesion values for polymer/glass and polymer/silicon joints...|$|E

40|$|Reducing {{vehicle weight}} to {{decrease}} energy consumption and engine emissions {{is one of}} the major objectives of the automotive industry today. This goal is mainly achieved by developing new manufacturing technologies for structural lightweight components, such as the hybrid injection molding/composite forming process, which involves preforming a thermoplastic composite laminate and <b>overmolding</b> it to add ribs, attachment points and other features.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new {{experimental and}} numerical methods {{to characterize the}} transfer <b>overmolding</b> of substrates with epoxy polymer. We investigated Multi Chip Modules on ceramic panels {{as well as on}} printed circuit boards encapsulated as a Mold Array Package (MAP). Experiments show that the polymer flow during the <b>overmolding</b> process depends significantly on the mold height: While standard MAP-type mold cavities are filled homogeneously and symmetrically in most cases, low cavity heights (< 500 m) can cause the flow front to concentrate on a few flow paths (flow front fingering). We developed a numerical method to describe this inhomogeneous polymer flow. The reason for flow front fingering seems to be local variations of polymer viscosity which enforces a necking on distinct flow paths. Fingering can cause the formation of air traps and excessive wire sweep. We also developed new experimental methods to measure the pressure distribution within cavities: our sensor is based on commercially available, passive pressure sensitive films from FUJUFILM and is operational at temperatures up to 180 °...|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{thermoplastic}} prepreg {{composite materials}} stand out {{with regard to}} their ability to allow complex designs with high specific strength and stiffness. This makes them an excellent choice for lightweight automotive components to reduce mass and increase fuel efficiency, while maintaining the functionality of traditional thermosetting prepreg (and mechanical characteristics) and with a production cycle time and recyclability suited to mass production manufacturing. Currently, the aerospace and automotive sectors struggle to carry out accurate Finite Elements (FE) component analyses and in some cases are unable to validate the obtained results. In this study, structural Finite Elements Analysis (FEA) has been done on a thermoplastic fiber reinforced component designed and manufactured through an integrated injection molding process, which consists in thermoforming the prepreg laminate and <b>overmolding</b> the other parts. This process is usually referred to as hybrid molding, and has the provision to reinforce the zones subjected to additional stresses with thermoformed themoplastic prepreg as required and <b>overmolded</b> with a shortfiber thermoplastic resin in single process.
