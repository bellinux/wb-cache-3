The APCs were then split between the fire support bases, with 1 Troop assigned to 1 RAR and 2 Troop to 3 RAR, with Keldie appointed as local defence commander at FSB Coral in order to co-ordinate the actions of units on the perimeter. 1st Field Squadron also provided engineer teams to each combat arm, while other elements prepared command post bunkers and fortifications within the fire support bases.|$|E

They later destroyed supplies at Groot Marico, Zeerust and Ottoshoop, so that they would not fall into Boer hands. When it became apparent that their relief had been turned back, the Boer commander, de la Rey, seeking a way to end the siege before another relief force could be sent, ordered his men to cease fire and sent a messenger to the garrison calling upon them to surrender; his opposite number, however, rejected the offer and as a result the attack resumed and was subsequently continued throughout the night. Nevertheless, the defenders continued to improve their position, constructing stone sangars and digging their fighting pits deeper. Wood, salvaged from wagons that had been destroyed in the barrage, was used to provide <b>overhead</b> <b>protection</b> to the defenders' positions, several of which were linked with an underground tunnel.

Increasing run-time failures in memory, specifically in case of low-voltage low-power memory, {{has emerged as a}} major design challenge.

We validate the quality of the solution using an accurate SER estimator based on the new UGC particle strike model.
