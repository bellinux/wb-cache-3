40|$|Transcatheter {{arterial}} chemoembolization (TACE) with iodized oil and anticancer agents {{is widely}} used for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. To assess C-arm angiographic computed tomography (CCT) for detecting iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> during TACE, CCT images were obtained of 40 tumours (24 HCC patients). The primary CCT images showed complete iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> patterns (type I) in 29 / 40 (73 %) tumours, at which point embolization was terminated; incomplete iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> requiring further iodized oil embolization occurred in 11 / 40 (28 %) tumours and, of these, complete iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> patterns were achieved in eight tumours. Conventional CT scanning employed 1 week later showed the same iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> patterns as demonstrated in the latest CCT images (37 / 40 [93 %] tumours). In 24 additional HCC patients who underwent TACE but not CCT (control group), conventional CT scans obtained 1 week after TACE showed complete iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> in 32 / 42 (76 %) tumours. The rate of complete iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> pattern was significantly higher in patients undergoing CCT.

The effect of oil on pressure drop was found to be most profound at high vapor qualities where the local oil mass fractions are the highest. An analytical model for the annular flow pattern to estimate the <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> was developed. According to the analysis of CO 2 and oil flow in the suction line, the interfacial friction factor should be expressed as the function of CO 2 gas Reynolds number as well as the dimensionless oil film thickness. Furthermore, an empirical interfacial friction factor based on experimental results was developed. All simulation results for the suction line are bounded by ± 20 % from experimental results. In the case of heat exchangers, void fraction models were used to estimate the <b>oil</b> <b>retention.</b> Due to the changing oil properties, the heat exchangers were divided into segments.

The technical success, technique effectiveness rate and complications of RFA were then assessed. On pre-ablative and immediate follow-up CT after RFA, we evaluated the size of enhancing index tumors and iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention,</b> presence of abutting vessels, completeness of ablation of iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention,</b> {{and the presence of}} ablative margins greater than 5 mm. Also, the time interval between transarterial chemoembolization and RFA was assessed.

40|$|The {{design of}} any system needs to {{consider}} a number of parameters according different needs. In heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems the overall efficiency, {{the reliability of the}} components, the cost and volume, and the refrigerant/oil charge are only some examples of variables that can be optimized. An important aspect is the selection of lubricants that provide the same or improved characteristics relative to traditional mineral oils. In HVAC systems, the oil exists only because the compressor requires it for lubrication and sealing. Proper oil management is necessary in order to improve the compressor reliability, increase the overall efficiency of the system, and minimize the system cost by avoiding redundancy. Several literature sources focused on oil/refrigerant properties (Thome, 1995), oil return characteristics (Biancardi et al., 1996) and oil transport phenomena (Mehendale, 1998). An analytical and experimental study of the <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> has been developed for automotive air conditioning systems using carbon dioxide (Jun-Pyo Lee, 2002). However, a general comprehensive model for <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> and <b>oil</b> distribution in heat pump systems using other refrigerant/oil mixtures does not exist and is of importance to future design considerations. The purpose of this thesis is to experimentally and theoretically investigate the physics of <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> and <b>oil</b> transport in different components of the system. Condenser, evaporator, suction and liquid lines are studied using different pairs of refrigerant-oil mixtures. <b>Oil</b> <b>retention</b> is measured directly using an experimental apparatus, and oil film thickness is estimated. At oil mass fractions of 8 wt. %, the pressure drops increase up to 40 % in the suction line, 20 % in the evaporator and 30 % in the condenser as compared to oil-free operating conditions. New pressure drop correlations need to include this penalty factor due to <b>oil</b> <b>retention.</b> An analytical model for vapor and two-phase refrigerant flows utilizing minimal empirical data is developed. The model is able to estimate the oil distribution in the entire system providing good design guidelines for the selection of the proper refrigerant/oil mixture, the optimization of the component geometries, and the management of the oil/refrigerant charge...|$|R

Since the presence of oil residue in soils can pose an environmental threat, the high <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> capability of the stabilized soils is critical to its application. The behavior of the stabilized soils has been experimentally investigated in the laboratory. This study has concentrated on the evaluation of the mechanical properties of the stabilized soils, the <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> characteristics and its bonding mechanisms, and the leaching and migration behaviors of oil residue from the stabilized soils. The geotechnical investigation results indicated that the addition of 4 % oil residue, by weight, was sufficient to significantly enhance the strength performance of the tested soils. The geochemical tests showed that the bonds formed between the oil and the soil surfaces were predominantly Van der Waal's attraction, weak hydrogen bonding, and cation and water bridging. These bonds were found to be relatively weak but stable and insensitive to leaching forces. The geo-environmental results revealed good <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> in these samples, with less than 3 % of the oil residue by weight leached from the stabilized soils after 40 days of leaching in distilled water.

This is particularly highlighted during the environmental cleanups of industrial oily wastes and disasters involving petroleum oil spills. These damaging and ever-challenging conditions require novel, adaptive, cost effective materials and technologies that go beyond current practices. Carbon-based materials such as graphene have excellent potential hydrophobic and oleophilic properties. Some of the challenges to date with these adsorbent based materials include structural and stability issues, which hinder their advantages affording it good but limited properties as oil adsorbents. Although there are numerous novel adsorbents with outstanding adsorption capacities and excellent recyclability, {{there is still a}} gap between their performances in a laboratory setting and their actual field application. Under field conditions, other parameters such as buoyancy, geometry, strength and durability, transportation, economics, actual amount of oil recovered as well as its quality etc. must be considered altogether. This paper explores some of these topics with a focus on the development of new experimental parameters that allow investigators to study the <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> efficiency, adsorption capacity efficiency, and adsorption flux efficiency of an adsorbent. There have been many explorations and investigations on the net adsorption capacities of new materials, however, very few focus on the optimization of an adsorbent as a system, maximizing the synergistic effects between its porous structure, morphology and surface chemistry. In this thesis study, a super-oleophilic and hydrophobic polyurethane sponge (PU) was created by undergoing an acid-pretreatment and subsequently coated with 3 -methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (MPTS) functionalized reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Oil adsorption performances were compared between the samples and the controls in order to quantify the effects of acid-pretreatment, RGO and MPTS functionalization. Water and oil contact angles and water uptake were measured to study the hydrophobicity, oleophilicity and selectivity of the samples. Oil adsorption capacities were measured with protocols specifically designed to study <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> efficiencies. Recyclability and kinetics studies were also performed experimentally.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate a phenomenon, retention of Hispanic adult second language learners in Washington State's community colleges, from a qualitative paradigm and phenomenological approach. The focus {{of this study was to}} capture eight foreign-born Hispanic ESL non-continuators' voices and experiences, in their native language of Spanish, who dropped out of Washington State's community colleges and unveil the phenomenon behind the factors leading to their <b>retention</b> <b>barriers.</b> The following questions guided the research: (1) What are the <b>retention</b> <b>barriers</b> of Hispanic English as a Second Language population in Washington State Community Colleges? (2) What is the profile of the foreign-born Hispanic ESL learner in Washington State's Community Colleges? (3) Why do Hispanic ESL participants drop out? (4) What services are needed and provided to increase retention patterns of Hispanic ESL learners? (5) What services could make a difference in retention of Hispanic's English as a Second Language participants? A qualitative methodology and phenomenological approach of in-depth interviews was the research paradigm utilized for data collection. Participants were recruited from a survey implemented at various community colleges' and communitybased organizations' ESL programs in Washington State. Criteria for inclusion as a potential participant in this research required adult participants to be: (1) foreign-born Hispanic, (2) a resident of Washington state, (3) in the age range of eighteen to thirty years of age, (4) a prior drop out student from one of Washington State's community colleges adult basic education ESL programs, and (5) a volunteer to participate in the study. This study unveiled factors that caused <b>retention</b> <b>barriers</b> for eight foreign-born Hispanic ESL adult learners that dropped out of Washington State's community colleges Adult Basic Education ESL programs. In many Adult Basic Education ESL programs in Washington State, foreign-born Hispanic adults are largely voluntary candidates, and the role of student is just one of the countless roles competing for their time and attention. From the eight foreign-born Hispanic non-continuators' voices and experiences, the findings indicate that retention is a complex phenomenon involving various institutional, situational, and dispositional factors. This study's findings also unveiled structural issues for the eight foreign-born Hispanic participants, creating systemic structural barriers to their socioeconomic and education development in the United States. This means no one factor could provide an explanation for the retention phenomenon. The eight foreign-born Hispanic adult non-continuators' situational and dispositional factors overwhelmed their zeal for ESL instruction, ESL level completion, and/or ESL program completion. The interview question guide unveiled reasons often voiced as the causes for non-continuation: (1) family struggles and hardships, (2) lack of childcare, healthcare, and transportation, and (3) long work hours. At the same time, the eight foreign-born Hispanics adult non-continuators had pragmatic reasons for engaging in ESL, and felt that the programs would provide meaningful contextual learning for immediate or long-term goals for the home, workplace, or community...|$|R
