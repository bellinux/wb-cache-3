In 2007, Trevena lobbied against budget cuts to child care programs by Minister of State for Child Care Linda Reid; after significant opposition some cuts were restored {{later in the}} year. Trevena spoke out against a Ministry of Children and Family Development project to use MLA offices belonging exclusively to BC Liberal Party members to distribute 2,000 free automobile booster seats for children at public events. Trevena and party leader Carol James travelled the province hosting open houses regarding women's issues; they advocated for the [...] "restoration of funding for women's centres" [...] and the [...] "reinstatement of cancelled victims' services programs". On local issues, Trevena criticized the split of the Comox-Strathcona Regional District into two separate regional districts as being [...] "sudden and arbitrary decision" [...] by the Minister of Community Affairs Ida Chong made without public consultation; Trevena backed the CSRD request for a one-year delay which was denied. After Trevena complained {{about the lack of}} provincial spending on highways and roads in her constituency, the Minister of Transportation Kevin Falcon questioned her ability as an MLA, and she, in return, questioned his abilities as a minister. Beginning in 2008, Trevena sat on the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts, during the 4th and 5th Parliamentary sessions.

[...] John Brabender, an adviser to Santorum's Senate and Presidential races, reflected back on the book's controversies and said Santorum was warned that sections could bring political damage, and Santorum was not willing to change much of it simply to gain moderate supporters.

He wrote, [...] "... {{it is no surprise that}} Boston, a seat of academic, political and cultural liberalism in America, lies at the center of the storm." [...] His remarks were heavily criticized, especially in Massachusetts, and he was asked for an explanation. Santorum did not retract his statement and defended his premise that it was [...] "no surprise that the center of the Catholic Church abuse took place in very liberal, or perhaps the nation's most liberal area, Boston."

2500|$|Just {{as there}} are no rights to paid annual leave or maximum hours, there are no rights to paid time off for child care or family leave in federal law. There are minimal rights in some states. Most {{collective}} agreements, and many individual contracts, provide paid time off, but employees who lack bargaining power will often get none. There are, however, limited federal rights to unpaid leave for family and medical reasons. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 generally applies to employers of 50 or more employees in 20 weeks of the last year, and gives rights to employees who have worked over 12 months and 1250 hours in the last year. Employees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child birth, adoption, {{to care for a}} close relative in poor health, or because of an employee's own poor health. Child care leave should be taken in one lump, unless agreed otherwise. Employees must give notice of 30 days to employers if birth or adoption is [...] "foreseeable", and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged [...] "so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer" [...] according to medical advice. Employers must provide benefits during the unpaid leave. Under §2652(b) states are empowered to provide [...] "greater family or medical leave rights". In 2016 California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York had laws for paid family leave rights. Under §2612(2)(A) an employer can make an employee substitute the right to 12 unpaid weeks of leave for [...] "accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave or family leave" [...] in an employer's personnel policy. Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the US Supreme Court in Ragsdale v Wolverine World Wide, Inc held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor's job to enforce the law. After unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to his or her job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal [...] "is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer." [...] Employees or the Secretary of Labor can bring enforcement actions, but there is no right to a jury for reinstatement claims. Employees can seek damages for lost wages and benefits, or the cost <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>care,</b> plus an equal amount of liquidated damages unless an employer can show it acted in good faith and reasonable cause to believe it was not breaking the law. There is a two-year limit on bringing claims, or three years for willful violations. Despite the lack of rights to leave, there is no right to free child care or day care. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsize parents' costs.|$|E
