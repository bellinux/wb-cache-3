Registration records of the College from school year 1936–1937 showed that Imelda did not enrol again. This disappearance was easily accounted for by two sets <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> Imelda, which were taken at her First Communion at the Holy Infant Academy in Tacloban, Leyte.|$|E
5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still get {{to see more of the}} action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Ed Roberts and Bill Yates {{finished}} the first prototype in October 1974 and shipped it to Popular Electronics in New York via the Railway Express Agency. However, it never arrived {{due to a}} strike by the shipping company. Solomon already had a number <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> the machine and the article was based on them. Roberts got to work on building a replacement. The computer on the magazine cover is an empty box with just switches and LEDs on the front panel. The finished Altair computer had a completely different circuit board layout than the prototype shown in the magazine.|$|E

50|$|After {{the initial}} {{publication}} of the magazine edition <b>of</b> The <b>Picture</b> <b>of</b> Dorian Gray (1890), Wilde expanded the text from 13 to 20 chapters and obscured the homoerotic themes of the story. In the novel version <b>of</b> The <b>Picture</b> <b>of</b> Dorian Gray (1891), chapters 3, 5, and 15 to 18, inclusive, are new; and chapter 13 of the magazine edition was divided, and became chapters 19 and 20 of the novel edition. In 1895, at his trials, Oscar Wilde said he revised the text <b>of</b> The <b>Picture</b> <b>of</b> Dorian Gray because of letters sent {{to him by the}} cultural critic Walter Pater.|$|R
5|$|Entwistle's son, Christopher, gave a {{statement}} supporting the Who's decision to carry on. The US tour {{began at the}} Hollywood Bowl with touring bassist Pino Palladino. Townshend dedicated the show to Entwistle, and ended with a montage <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> him. The tour lasted until September. The loss of {{a founding member of}} the Who caused Townshend to re-evaluate his relationship with Daltrey, which had been strained over the band's career. He decided their friendship was important, and this ultimately led to writing and recording new material.|$|E
5|$|Kapoor's {{personal}} {{life is the}} subject of fervent tabloid reporting in India. During the filming of Fida in 2004, he began dating Kareena Kapoor and they both publicly spoke of the relationship. They were involved in a well-publicised scandal when Mid Day published a set <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> them kissing in public. Despite claims by the couple that the pictures were fabricated, the newspaper denied any wrongdoing. The couple separated in 2007 during the filming of Jab We Met. Since their split, Kapoor decided to keep his {{personal life}} away from media attention. However, tabloids speculated on his relationship with several other actresses, including Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, Krøyer started Chez Moi, {{a series}} of watercolours of Marie and their {{daughter}} Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen in a style inspired by the Art Nouveau approach adopted by Carl Larsson whom Krøyer probably met during his time in Paris. Larsson had started painting in watercolours while {{a member of the}} Grez-sur-Loing artists' colony in France. On returning to Sweden, he had begun a series <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> family life with his wife and children in Sundborn in the mid-1890s, publishing it as Ett hem (A home) in 1899. Krøyer's paintings display no signs of disturbance or frustration but leave an impression of a happy family environment, no doubt in accordance with Krøyer's own desires. He exhibited the three from Skagen in 1889 at Den Frie – the exhibition of the artists' association that had been formed in 1891 with Krøyer's support – under the collective title Fra mit Skagenshjem (From my Skagen Home).|$|E
5|$|In April 1553 Dudley was {{commanded}} by the King to release {{cloth of silver}} and gold and velvet for the marriage of his nephew Lord Guildford to Lady Jane Grey, which was celebrated on 25 May. In June, Jehan de Scheyfve reported that Dudley himself would marry Margaret Clifford, a granddaughter of Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and cousin of Lady Jane, {{and that he would}} be made Lieutenant-Governor of the North. Dudley had even reserved a number of items from the wardrobe at Westminster for the marriage, including jewels, silver and gilt cups, a hair-brush, velvet dog-collars, and a pair <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> Diana and Actaeon. However, Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, having named Lady Jane Grey as his heir.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{meets his}} girlfriend Elisa's {{grandmother}} (Teresa Yenque). The grandmother {{does not like}} Jack because he reminds her of the Generalissimo, the antagonist from her favorite Mexican telenovela Los Amantes Clandestinos. Jack buys Los Amantes Clandestinos and tries to kill the Generalissimo off, but the actors on the show refuse to cooperate. Jack then meets Hector Moreda (also played by Baldwin), the actor who plays the Generalissimo, and asks why he will not follow the script. According to Hector, {{his role as the}} Generalissimo allows him to cut in line at Disney World, among other perks. Jack shows him a picture of Elisa, explaining that he wants to kill off the character for her. Understanding Jack's feelings, Hector agrees to help Jack by making the character fall in love with an elderly Hispanic woman, thereby winning the affection of Elisa's grandmother. The grandmother subsequently accepts Jack as Elisa's boyfriend, but makes one more request of him: to make NBC News less depressing. Jack responds by airing a montage <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> Puerto Rican babies to the music of Tito Puente on The Today Show, much to the displeasure of Matt Lauer.|$|E

5|$|Jill {{begins to}} work for {{cosmetics}} company Jabot and its owner, John Abbott (Jerry Douglas), promotes her to head of merchandising, impressed by her work. They become involved, but she cheated on him with his son, Jack Abbott (Terry Lester). John dumped her and she filed a sexual harassment suit worth $10,000 against Jack when {{he will not be}} with her. She reunites with John and they married in 1982. However, Abbott family housekeeper, Mamie Johnson (Veronica Redd), seemed to be a thorn in Jill's new marriage. Mamie, who wants to protect John, kept and eye on Jill, who had another affair with Jack. Katherine gets a hold <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> Jack and Jill and showed them to John, who has a stroke. Jill divorced John in 1986 and gets 20% of Jabot in their settlement, and a seat {{on the board of directors}} after threatening to sell her story turning it into a novel or film. Jill strives at her business, but is later found in her shower having been shot, just as her son Phillip returned to town after years away at boarding school. The three main suspects in the shooting are John, Jack, and Katherine. Jack confesses so that his affair with her won't become public. The real culprit is Sven, a masseur at the Genoa City Hotel. He had been rejected by Jill earlier in the night and shot her after getting drunk. Sven kidnaped Jill and locked her in a meat freezer. Jack rescued her and Sven escaped. Jill and Katherine fight over her son Phillip, who is now a teenager and had a past of acting out. Phillip turned to alcoholism but quit with help from Jill and Katherine. Phillip has sex with Nina Webster (Tricia Cast) and she ends up pregnant. He later died after driving under the influence, devastating both women. Jill hired a former con man Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker) to seduce Katherine. Rex's real name was Brian Romalotti, father of Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian) and Gina Roma (Patty Weaver). He married Katherine, but Jill then wanted Rex for herself and convinced him to divorce Katherine. In reality, Katherine had been replaced by a look alike Marge Cotrooke who pushed Rex away. He divorced her, and married Jill, but the real Katherine finally returned and reunited with Rex. Rex eventually was shot and killed while Jill began romancing John again.|$|E

This led to Romantic rejections of this in favor <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of Goethe.

40|$|We {{designed}} our experimental {{task based}} on previous experience with behavioral tasks in the intraoperative en-vironment [1] raised the concern that patients would suffer a lack of motivation during a study if a complicated reward-learning paradigm was attempted. In previous DBS surgeries, we found that single unit activity recorded from the ventral striatum is minimal unless patients are prompted to contemplate pleasant thoughts, specifically pleasant images or sensations. We therefore designed a study in which the participant played a simple video game {{in order to receive}} reward stimuli. During her pre-operative consultation, the participant performed a task in which her preferences for different categories of visual stimuli were assessed. The goal was to identify the most and least preferred categories of stimuli to insure that the images used as reward stimuli during the intraoperative task were salient to the individual, and therefore more likely to elicit a response in reward-sensitive cells in the ventral striatum. Eleven categories were selected, and 120 different images from each category were compiled from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database and supplemented from additional internet image archives [2]. The categories were selected in an attempt to appeal to a range of aesthetic tastes. The eleven categories were: <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> attractive men, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> attractive women, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> celebrities <b>of</b> both sexes, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> beautiful nature scenery, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> beautiful urban/structure scenery, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> savory foods, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> sweet foods, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> smoking/cigarette paraphernalia, <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> alcoholic beverages and alcohol paraphernalia, picture...|$|R
