5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.|$|E

25|$|Social {{psychology}} is an empirical science {{that attempts to}} answer questions about human behavior by testing hypotheses, both in the laboratory and in the field. Careful attention to sampling, research design, and statistical analysis is important; results are published in peer reviewed journals such as the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin and the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> Psychology. Social psychology studies also appear in general science journals such as Psychological Science and Science.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that gender {{stereotyping}} plays a big role in influencing women’s academic and career aspirations by reducing their interest in male-typed occupations like engineering, leadership and mathematics. In a 2002 study published in the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> Psychology, a group of researchers found that gender-stereotypic television commercials can restrain women academically and professionally. Exposure to the stereotypic commercials resulted in women underperforming on a subsequent math test and avoiding math items in favor of verbal items. Furthermore, the women who viewed the stereotypic commercials expressed less interest in quantitative fields and more interest in verbal domains, both academically and professionally.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVery {{little is}} known about the psychosocial {{correlates}} of psychological morbidity among Chinese people with epilepsy (PWE). No studies have investigated the association between <b>social</b> relationships <b>and</b> psychological morbidity, while most studies examined only the negative impact <b>of</b> maladaptive <b>personalities</b> on psychological adjustment in PWE. This study examined the association of psychological morbidity with a broad array <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> traits <b>and</b> <b>social</b> skills in a sample of 54 Chinese PWE. Respondents completed the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), the Social Performance Survey Schedule (SPSS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) via semi-structured interview. Regression analyses revealed that, independent of demographic and medical variables and perceived impact, Harm Avoidance was positively associated with anxiety and depression whereas Self-Directedness was negatively associated with anxiety and depression; that Cooperativeness was inversely associated with anxiety. Social skills were inversely associated with depression whereas negative social skills were inversely associated with anxiety. Clinical implications <b>of</b> adaptive <b>personality</b> traits <b>and</b> <b>social</b> skills functioning are discussed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> {{psychology}} is a scientific method used by health professionals for researching personal <b>and</b> <b>social</b> motivators in <b>and</b> {{between the individual}} and society, as well as applying them to the problems people have in the context <b>of</b> society. <b>Personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> psychologists study how people think about, influence, and relate to one another. By exploring forces within the person (such as traits, attitudes, and goals) as well as forces within the situation (such as <b>social</b> norms <b>and</b> incentives), they seek to provide insight into issues as wide-ranging as prejudice, romantic attraction, persuasion, friendship, helping, aggression, conformity, and group interaction.|$|R
