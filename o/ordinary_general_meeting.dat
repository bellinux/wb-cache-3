25|$|From the 1880s onwards {{there had}} been no central body to {{co-ordinate}} the Inter-Colonial Tournaments and matches, select composite West Indian XIs for tours and against touring sides and to organise the West Indian tours of England, Canada and the United States. Such organisation as there was, was done by an informal coalition of the major clubs in the region. West Indian cricketers however had felt the need for the establishment of such an organisation although geography and culture were to make such a task difficult. However, with the help of one influential Marylebone Cricket Club member, R. H. Mallet (the manager of the 1906 and 1923 West Indian tours and future manager of the 1930–31 West Indian tour to Australia), representatives of the various territories finally got together and ultimately formed the West Indies Cricket Board of Control. The preliminary meeting was in Bridgetown, Barbados, from which the informal West Indies Cricket Conference was founded in 1926. The West Indies Cricket Conference held its first official meeting on 22 January 1927 at the Bridgetown Club in Barbados attended by Mallett and representatives from the Windward Islands, Trinidad & Tobago, Barbados and Demerara (British Guiana). Delegates from Jamaica and the Leeward Islands were invited by unfortunately were unable to attend. At this January meeting the delegates present decided to form the West Indies Cricket Board of Control (WICBC) which would be composed of a president, a secretary and two delegates each from Barbados, Demerara, Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago and one delegate each from the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands. The WICBC's first meeting was held on 17 and 18 June 1927 in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad with Harold Austin (the former captain of the 1906 and 1923 West Indian tours of England) serving as the first president. The Board as constituted was enlarged in 1982 when the Leeward and Windward Islands were given the same representation as the other full Members. The President was appointed by the Board at an <b>Ordinary</b> <b>General</b> <b>Meeting</b> and had to be a person resident in the West Indies who had shown a keen and active interest in West Indies cricket. His term of office was for two years (and eligible for re-election) or until his successor was appointed. Board members were also thenceforce to be appointed by their Cricket Associations although in British Guiana the Georgetown Cricket Club held this responsibility until 1943, and in Trinidad the Queens Park Oval Club until 1981 when their respective Cricket Associations were given recognition. There was a provision for Associate Members who would be entitled to attend Meetings but not to move resolutions or vote. Bermuda and Belize had been the only members in this category prior to their cessation as Associate Members. According to Ram Hiralal, former President of the Suriname Cricket Association, up until 2002 when Suriname applied for and gained affiliate membership of the ICC, it was also an associate member of the West Indies Cricket Board.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes {{and tests}} a new method {{to extract the}} value of {{corporate}} voting rights from market prices of American-style single-stock options. The method models voting-right values as non-cash dividends and backs them out via numerical optimization from prices of equity options. Simulation experiments show that the method is accurate and outperforms existing option-based approaches by reducing their measurement error from 17. 2 % to 1. 57 % in terms of root mean squared errors and almost eliminates their bias. The paper also contributes an empirical analysis of corporate voting-right values in European companies in the time period between 2003 and 2010. Voting rights have an annualized average value of 0. 37 % of the share price and are significantly worth more in months in which either <b>ordinary</b> or extraordinary <b>general</b> <b>meetings</b> take place but no single shareholder holds a majority stake in the company.

The Eastern Smelting Company, Penang was registered in August 1907, and in November that year, its prospectus was advertised in various newspapers offering shares to the public. Governor Sir John Andserson officiated at its opening in January 1908. The company appeared to be doing well and at its first <b>ordinary</b> <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> in October that year a 5 per cent dividend was declared based on the good performance of the prior six months work. Problems arose the following year {{and by the end of}} it its works manager had resigned, accusing the managing director and other directors of financial mismanagement. By March 1911 it had been decided to sell off the business to a London company. Newspapers in July 1911 carried the prospectus of the new London-based company that was to acquire the business of the Malayan company. The chairmanship of the London-based public company was Chung Thye Phin's old friend, former British Resident, Sir Ernest Birch. By the end of November 1911 the transfer from old to new company had been completed and the first general meeting of the new London-based company took place.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{evaluates the}} effects of the audit {{committee}} and the fiscal council with their different characteristics on earnings quality in Brazil. The proxies of earnings quality used are: relevance of accounting information, timeliness, and conditional conservatism. The sample consists of Brazilian companies listed on the Brazilian Securities, Commodities, and Futures Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA) with annual liquidity above 0. 001 within the period from 2010 to 2013. Data were collected from the database Comdinheiro and the Reference Forms of companies available on the website of the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) or the BM&FBOVESPA. The samples used in the study totaled 718, 688, and 722 observations for the value relevance, timeliness, and conditional conservatism models, respectively. The results indicate that different arrangements of the fiscal council and the existence of the audit committee differently impact the accounting information properties. The presence of the fiscal council positively impacted the relevance of equity, while the presence of the audit committee, the relevance of earnings. Conditional conservatism is evidenced in the group of companies with a permanent fiscal council, demonstrating that it is significant as a governance mechanism, rather than the installation for temporary operation when asked by shareholders in an <b>ordinary</b> <b>general</b> <b>meeting.</b> The presence of both showed significant earnings for the market, but they were not timely, something which exposes restriction to the relevance found.
