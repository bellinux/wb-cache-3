Calafia, in turn, convinces her people to take their ships, weapons, armor, riding beasts, and 500 griffins, and sail with her to Constantinople to fight the Christians, though she has no concept <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be Moslem or Christian. Her {{subjects}} arm themselves with weapons and armor made of gold, {{as there is no}} other metal in California. They fill their ships with supplies and hasten to sea.|$|E
5|$|Grunge became commercially {{successful}} in the early 1990s, due to releases such as Nirvana's Nevermind, Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Superunknown, Alice in Chains' Dirt and Stone Temple Pilots' Core. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of rock music at the time. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, they influenced modern rock music, as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into pop culture and added introspection and an exploration <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be true to oneself. Grunge was also an influence on subsequent genres such as post-grunge (a derivative of grunge) and nu metal.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo's 1927 polemical book Mother India, which vilified Indian culture. Allusions to Hindu mythology are {{abundant}} in the film, and its lead character {{has been seen as}} a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values and the concept <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be a mother to society through self-sacrifice. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The film was shot in Mumbai's Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh states. The music by Naushad introduced Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra to Hindi cinema.|$|E

25|$|The idea of freely debating {{rights to}} {{political}} representation took form during the Putney Debates of 1647. Beginning {{in the late}} 17th century, philosophers {{began to think of}} rights not as privileges to be granted by the government or the law, but as a fundamental part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be a person. John Locke (1632–1704), {{one of the most influential}} of Enlightenment thinkers, argued that property - which to him included life, liberty and possessions - was an unalienable human right, that is, one which cannot be taken away. He articulated that every person is created equal and free but, in return for the advantages of living in an organised society, a person may need to give up some of this freedom.|$|E
25|$|The de Ménils, however, did {{not limit}} their {{acquisitions}} to modern art, and their eclectic tastes became {{a hallmark of}} their collecting practices. As modernists, they recognized the profound formal and spiritual connections between contemporary works {{of art and the}} arts of ancient and indigenous cultures, broadening their collection to include works from classical Mediterranean and Byzantine cultures, as well as objects from Africa, Oceania, and the Pacific Northwest. Influenced by the teachings of Father Couturier and Father Congar, the de Menils developed a particular humanist ethos in which they understood art as a central part of the human experience. Their collection was motivated by their shared interest in the many ways individuals over different cultures and eras reveal through art their understanding <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be human.|$|E
25|$|Anzac Day {{has been}} criticised {{by a number}} of Australians and New Zealanders. At its inception, Anzac Day faced {{criticism}} from the Australian labor movement, and in the country at large, there was opposition to political exploitation of what was seen as a day of mourning. One controversy occurred in 1960 with the publication of Alan Seymour's classic play, The One Day of the Year, which dramatised the growing social divide in Australia and the questioning of old values. In the play, Anzac Day is critiqued by the central character, Hughie, as a day of drunken debauchery by returned soldiers and as a day when questions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be loyal to a nation or Empire must be raised. The play was scheduled to be performed at the inaugural Adelaide Festival of Arts, but after complaints from the Returned Services League, the governors of the Festival refused permission for this to occur.|$|E

25|$|The Doctor {{initially}} dismisses Jenny as an echo <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be a Time Lord, but as {{they spend}} more time together he begins to accept her. The Doctor confides privately to Donna that he is resistant to Jenny coming {{with them in the}} TARDIS because she reminds him too much of Gallifrey and everything he lost in the Time War. Donna also becomes intrigued by a series of numbered plaques that she notices in each room. When they reach the location of the Source, {{it turns out to be}} a terraforming device within a colonising spaceship. Donna realises that the plaques represent the dates each part of the building was completed, which was a mere seven days previous. The humans and Hath have bred so many generations through the progenation machines that their own history has degraded into myth. The original cause of the conflict is determined by the Doctor to have been the death of the mission commander.|$|E
25|$|For Shakespeare as {{he began}} to write, both traditions were alive; they were, moreover, {{filtered}} through the recent success of the University Wits on the London stage. By the late 16th century, the popularity of morality and academic plays waned as the English Renaissance took hold, and playwrights like Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe revolutionised theatre. Their plays blended the old morality drama with classical theory to produce a new secular form. The new drama combined the rhetorical complexity of the academic play with the bawdy energy of the moralities. However, it was more ambiguous and complex in its meanings, and less concerned with simple allegory. Inspired by this new style, Shakespeare continued these artistic strategies, creating plays that not only resonated on an emotional level with audiences but also explored and debated the basic elements <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be human. What Marlowe and Kyd did for tragedy, John Lyly and George Peele, among others, did for comedy: they offered models of witty dialogue, romantic action, and exotic, often pastoral location that formed the basis of Shakespeare's comedic mode throughout his career.|$|E

He attains self-awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused— and then he wins his pool game."

500|$|Angelou's goal, {{beginning}} {{with her first}} autobiography, was to [...] "tell {{the truth about the}} lives of black women", but her goal evolved, in her later volumes, to document {{the ups and downs of}} her own life. Angelou's autobiographies have the same structure: they give a historical overview of the places she was living in at the time, how she coped within the context of a larger white society, and the ways that her story played out within that context. Critic Selwyn Cudjoe stated that in Gather Together, Angelou is still concerned with the questions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be a Black female in the US, but focuses upon herself at a certain point in history, in the years immediately following World War II. The book begins with a prologue describing the confusion and disillusionment of the African-American community during that time, which matched the alienated and fragmented nature of the main character's life. According to McPherson, African Americans were promised a new racial order that did not materialize.|$|E

Although Chekhov did not fully realise it at the time, Chekhov's plays, such as The Seagull (written in 1895), Uncle Vanya (written in 1897), The Three Sisters (written in 1900), and The Cherry Orchard (written in 1903) served as a revolutionary backbone to what is common sense to the medium of acting to this day: an effort to recreate and express the [...] "realism" [...] of how people truly act and speak with each other and translating it to the stage to manifest the human condition as accurately as possible in hopes to make the audience reflect upon their own definition <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be human, warts and all.|$|E
