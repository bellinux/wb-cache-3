5|$|After Jay Pritzker's {{death in}} 1999, other Pritzker family members {{challenged}} Tom, Nick, and Penny's control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>businesses</b> in multiple lawsuits. Penny's brothers joined {{in one of}} the lawsuits. In 2001 Tom, Nick, and Penny decided to sell family assets to allow eleven cousins to receive a share, dissolving the family's business ties. Disentangling the family's business interests took nearly a decade. The family sold its controlling stake in the Marmon Group to Bershire Hathaway for $4.5billion in 2008. The Pritzker Realty Group sold Parking Spot, an airport parking management business Penny co-founded in 1998, to Green Courte Partners LLC for $360million in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Penny {{was named}} {{as one of}} three successors to the {{retiring}} Jay Pritizker besides his son Tom and his cousin Nick. Tom was named the official head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>businesses,</b> Nick and Penny each named vice-chairman. Together, the three were to oversee the Pritzker family assets. Jay intended to keep the family business together, devising a system of trusts that would allow individual family members to receive money from the trusts to meet their needs; however, the family's wealth was to be primarily maintained in the trusts to grow the businesses and fund philanthropic endeavors. The Pritzker business empire contained over 200 businesses and was valued at $15billion.|$|E
5|$|Passage of the {{national}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 had {{paved the way for}} an even stronger civil rights bill in the 1966 legislative session. The Assembly easily passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act opening all public accommodations to people of every race and prohibiting racial discrimination in employment by firms that employed eight or more people. The act applied to many kinds of businesses not covered by the federal statute, and approximately ninety percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>businesses</b> in Kentucky were affected, compared to only sixty percent that were covered by the federal statute. The act was {{the first of its kind}} passed in a southern state. In 1966, Breathitt was presented with the Lincoln Key Award for his leadership in the bill's passage. In 1966 and 1967, he was chair of the Southern Governors' Conference's Committee on Regional and Interstate Cooperation. He was also the only state governor named to the President's Council on Human Rights.|$|E

5|$|The {{first call}} from the scene to {{emergency}} services was received at 10:11a.m. While waiting for help to arrive, Giffords' intern Daniel Hernández Jr. applied pressure to the gunshot wound on her forehead, and made sure she did not choke on her blood. Hernández was credited with saving Giffords' life. David and Nancy Bowman, a married doctor and nurse who were shopping in the store, immediately set up triage and attended to nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. Police {{arrived on the scene}} at 10:15a.m., with paramedics arriving at 10:16a.m. Badger observed the assailant attempting to discard a small bag containing money and identification, which was recovered by the officers. Following the shooting, the police shut down roads surrounding the shopping center until late in the day. The intersection was cordoned off and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>businesses</b> in the shopping center were closed throughout the weekend during the initial investigation. The Safeway store reopened a week later, with a makeshift memorial erected near the front of the store.|$|E
5|$|The square itself held {{an array}} of coal mining offices, privately owned business, grocery and {{department}} stores, pharmacies and bars. During {{the closing of the}} coal mining era, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>businesses</b> left the square and moved to the main drag of Rt. 45, constructed in 1926. The courthouse built by John W. Gaddis was replaced with a modern, more efficient building in 1967 after the older building was condemned. Over the years, the architecture that graced Harrisburg square has slowly turned to rotting older structures mixed in with a hodge-podge of newer updated buildings. Currently there are a few privately owned downtown renovation projects in progress on and around the square.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the initial silver rush, a town site was platted {{and the town}} was built. The first permanent business building established in Silver Reef was a store {{at the intersection of}} the roads from the Buckeye, White, and East reefs. By 1878, the town's business district consisted of a hotel, boarding houses, nine stores, six saloons, five restaurants, a bank, two dance halls, a newspaper called The Silver Echo (which later became the Silver Reef Miner), and eight dry goods stores. Two cemeteries, one Catholic and one Protestant, were located south of Silver Reef's business district. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>businesses</b> in Silver Reef were situated along a mile-long Main Street. The mining district consisted of 37 mines and five stamp mills: the Christy, Stormont, Leeds, Buckeye and Barbee & Walker mills. Although it was surrounded by settlements with large Mormon populations, the town never had a Mormon meeting house. A Catholic church was the only church located within the town. After the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, many of the Chinese workers who had been hired to build it were out of work. Some returned to China, but others remained in Utah. A group of 250 of these workers set up a Chinatown in a level area just south of Silver Reef. Silver Reef's Chinatown had a Chinese mayor and several businesses. By 1879, Silver Reef's population had reached 2,000, and the town also had a horse race track, a brewery, and a brass band. Shooting matches among members of the Silver Reef Rifle Club and sometimes residents of nearby towns took place on the horse race track.|$|E

5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, the British {{steamship}} Rosina {{encountered the}} hurricane. The storm damaged the pipes and smokestacks, ripped out the ventilator, and washed 30,000oranges into the sea. Additionally, a Greek sailor was swept overboard and presumably drowned. The storm sunk or drove many ships ashore along the Yucatán Peninsula. Communications were disrupted {{in many areas}} after telegraph lines fell, while a number of roads were left impassible after trees toppled. In the Tampico area, there was considerable damage to the port and many ships being sunk or driven ashore. All of the bridges along Monterey and Mexican Gulf Railroad were destroyed. The roof at the general market was almost completely torn off. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>businesses</b> suffered serious losses after rain subsequently poured in the building, with damage reaching at least $4,200 (10,000pesos). The chamber of commerce building collapsed with people inside, though no injuries or deaths occurred. Much of the land between Tampico and Cárdenas in San Luis Potosí was submerged due to flooding. In Barra, a city in Tamaulipas, the hospital was nearly destroyed, as was the marketplace. In San Luis Potosí, the casino and restaurant in Tamasopo were demolished. Twenty bridges were destroyed in San Luis Potosí. Railroad traffic between San Luis Potosí and Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo León, was completely disrupted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{months of the}} Chamorro administration, social {{programs}} including free bus tokens for the education sector, pensions {{for the elderly and}} disabled, child care and child development services, and health care initiatives were cut. By 1991 the austerity measures adopted by Chamorro's administration were leading to massive strikes. Chamorro chose to recognize the workers' right to 25% of the shares of privatized state enterprises despite of the disapproval that generated both at home and abroad. The Sandinistas, who had removed some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>businesses</b> from the private sector during their administration were not in favor of privatization, but they were in favor of workers sharing in the revenues. The far-right of her own coalition was against making labor compromises of any kind. The US embassy and United States Agency for International Development both voiced displeasure at the concessions and speed with which the economic plan was being implemented. In spite of the other programs implemented, inflation was reduced by the renegotiation of the country's debt (called for by the Lacayo Plan). Through negotiations, Nicaragua was able to obtain a writedown of 75% of their international debt on the condition that they had no arrears. As noted previously, the US assisted Nicaragua in paying off the past-due debt to the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank through bridge loans and negotiating a 95% writedown of debts owed to Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These measures provided the means to end hyperinflation and reopen monetary markets, but they were overshadowed by high unemployment, underemployment and an overall recession. The trade deficit rose and GNP declined, and overall, low wages, reductions of education and health services caused poverty to escalate, and social tensions to rise.|$|E
