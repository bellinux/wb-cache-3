40|$|Under certain circumstances, {{external}} stimuli will elicit {{an involuntary}} shift of spatial attention, {{referred to as}} attentional capture. According to the contingent involuntary orienting account (Folk, Remington, & Johnston, 1992), capture is conditioned by top-down factors that set attention to respond involuntarily to stimulus properties relevant to one 2 ̆ 7 s behavioral goals. Evidence for this comes from spatial cuing studies showing that a spatial cuing effect is observed only when cues have goal-relevant properties. Here, we examine alternative, decision-level explanations of the spatial cuing effect that attribute evidence of capture to postpresentation delays in the voluntary allocation of attention, rather than to on-line involuntary shifts in direct response to the cue. In three spatial cuing experiments, delayed-allocation accounts were tested by examining whether items at the cued location were preferentially processed. The experiments provide evidence that costs and benefits in spatial cuing experiments do reflect the <b>on-line</b> <b>capture</b> of attention. The implications of these results for models of attentional control are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Early cancer diagnoses {{promise to}} improve {{treatment}} outcomes and patient survival rates. However, current cancer diagnostics often rely on finding a tumor, making early detection difficult and possibly compromising therapy outcomes. Screening for cancer without tumor detection can {{be based on}} assays of body fluids such as serum or plasma for cancer biomarker proteins to provide an instantaneous record of a patient’s disease status. Measurement of these biomarker proteins should be accurate, sensitive, cheap and preferably at point-of-care (POC) for translation to the clinic. In addition, due to low predictive power of some biomarker proteins and their over-expression by multiple cancer types, {{it is essential to}} measure panels of biomarker proteins as opposed to a single biomarker for reliable diagnosis of cancer. Simultaneous measurement of the levels of a panel of biomarker proteins can lead to more accurate diagnoses and offer clarity about disease characteristics and progression that may help guide treatment strategies. The long-term goal of this thesis research is to provide multiple biomarker-based diagnostics to enable accurate early detection of cancer and therapy monitoring. A simple, low-cost, 8 -electrode semi-automated modular microfluidic system for <b>on-line</b> <b>capture</b> and electrochemical detection of panels of cancer protein biomarkers was designed and validated. Proteins that were validated include oral cancer biomarkers (IL- 6 2 ̆ 6 IL- 8) and oral mucositis biomarkers (IL- 6, TNF-α, IL- 1 β and CRP). This thesis also describes our first electrochemical assay for parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP); a paraneoplastic peptide responsible for hypercalcemia in cancer patients and also implicated in cancer metastasis. Also described in the dissertation, is a novel 16 -electrode electrochemical set up for simultaneous detection of upto 8 -prostate cancer biomarkers, many of which are thought to be specific for aggressive prostate cancer.

40|$|Most of the {{blanking}} {{operations are}} now done on automatic high speed presses. The faster operation, closer dimensional and form tolerances, higher precision demand automatic supervision of blanking tool conditions {{in order to}} avoid producing a large volume of defective parts unnoticed. In this paper, an architecture of an automatic supervisory system for monitoring blanking punch wear under various die wear conditions is proposed. The system employs an autoregressive (AR) time-series model to predict the <b>on-line</b> <b>captured</b> peak blanking force. The AR model coefficients are updated by a modified least mean square (MLMS) adaptive filter so as to minimize the prediction error. An optimum number of AR model coefficients are selected to form the pattern vector which is classified by a least mean squared error (LMSE) classifier. Classification of the punch wear states is accomplished by a linear discriminant function (LDF). The performance of the system was evaluated through a series of blanking experiments. Experimental results indicated a high success rate for recognizing blanking punch wear under various die wear conditions. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|A {{hot topic}} in {{research}} recently is {{the manufacture of}} an advanced concrete system enhanced by Self-Healing (SH) characteristics. In general, material science {{is focused on the}} establishment of smart engineering concrete and cementitious composites that can extend their service life and remain durable and strong even when phenomena of decay appear. In the case of this study, formation of damage and recovery of the mechanical properties is investigated by application of an encapsulated healing agent. On experimental level, it is imperative to implement an optical, non- contact and <b>on-line</b> <b>capturing</b> optical technique to visualize and compare the crack propagation at the loading and reloading (when the initial cracks are filled by the healing agent) stage. For that reason, optical measurements by application of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) are performed during tests.

A step further, the visualization of the cracking phenomena by DIC offers a useful tool to apply fracture theories of concrete on healing systems...|$|R

Among the vision-based ones, we can point out fingerprint, face, palm, ear, iris and retina recognition.

Lots of vision-based biometric techniques have been projected in the past for personal identification. We present a novel one based on visual capturing of fingerprints using a Webcam. However, there is an open issue to use webcam in stead of any scanner because of the low price, available in the market and easy to adjust anywhere. In this paper, we describe our implementation of the fingerprint authentication system using webcam having Pentium IV CPU, 256 RAM and a piece of transparent glass and a light source.

40|$|A data {{processing}} system for the emergency laboratory was integrated in our clinical laboratory computer system, its prime objective being the service requirements of the laboratory. It included the possibility of simultaneous optical reading of request forms and <b>on-line</b> <b>capturing,</b> processing, and printing of laboratory test data. Priority request forms, which allow the clinician to specify the interval by which emergency test results must be available, are registered by an optical reader and arranged according to urgency by the computer. The production of worksheets is replaced by visual display of information required for accurate specimen analyses on a large colour TV screen. The individual processing status of all tests from as many as 30 request forms is displayed in a colour code. For process control the updated delay time for test performance is faded in. All reports are produced by direct machine transfer of verified test results. For security purposes all steps of sample processing (request, result, report) are recorded via line printers outside the emergency laboratory. The capacity of the computer for managing sample and {{data processing}} reduces the work load for technicians. This results in a reduction of the turn-round time of tests. 95 % of all requested tests are performed and reported within the requested time period and in emergencies, test results are available within 5 - 10 min.

Using modern computer vision, we have implemented <b>on-line</b> model <b>capture</b> and tracking which allows the rendering of textured graphical PD.

We formulate the problem into dividing the users of a social network into levels, such that three main metrics are minimized: agony induced by the reverse links in the hierarchy, support disorder resulting from users in higher levels having less impact, and support imbalance resulting from users in the same level having diverse impact.

Furthermore, convergence analyses for the proposed algorithms are presented. The effectiveness of the real-time algorithms is demonstrated by an application in optimal formation and coverage control of a networked system.
