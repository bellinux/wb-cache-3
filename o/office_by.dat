Dosanjh, 37 at the time, suffered a broken hand and received 80 stitches in his head.|$|E
5|$|After Kamo's {{release from}} prison, {{he worked in}} the Soviet customs <b>office,</b> <b>by</b> some {{accounts}} because he was too unstable to work for the secret police. He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling. Although there is no proof of foul play, some have theorized that Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that succession {{to the office of}} chief of seers of Anhur at Thinis was familial: in the Herakleopolitan period, one Hagi succeeded his elder brother, also called Hagi, and their father to the post; and, in the New Kingdom, Wenennefer was succeeded in the priestly <b>office</b> <b>by</b> his son, Hori.|$|E
5|$|A copy of {{the film}} leaked onto {{peer-to-peer}} file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters.

Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a {{copy of the}} film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production <b>office</b> <b>by</b> an employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges. The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.|$|E

5|$|Abbas died {{in autumn}} 861, after another raid into Byzantine territory, and was buried at Caltagirone; the Byzantines later exhumed and burned his corpse. As his replacement, the Sicilian Muslims chose his uncle Ahmad ibn Ya'qub. His tenure was short, as in February 862 he was deposed {{in favour of}} Abdallah, son of Abbas. Abdallah's general Rabah was able to capture a few Byzantine fortresses, despite {{suffering}} a defeat in battle at first. Abdallah's elevation, however, was not acknowledged by the Aghlabids, and he was replaced, after only five months in <b>office,</b> <b>by</b> Khafaja ibn Sufyan.|$|E

5|$|After 1530, it was {{the colonists}} {{themselves}} who held the keys to power, installing new governors and removing them from <b>office.</b> <b>By</b> 1534, the Spanish colony in Honduras was close to collapse. Trujillo had a population of less than two hundred; {{it was the}} only Spanish settlement in Honduras, and very little territory beyond the town itself had been conquered. The Spanish were beset by infighting, and had provoked widespread indigenous uprisings. Simultaneously, the native population had collapsed as a result of disease, mistreatment, and the export of large numbers to work on the sugar plantations of the Caribbean islands.|$|E
5|$|Although many Old Court supporters—typically the state's wealthy aristocracy—gravitated to the National Republican Party (later to {{be called}} Whigs) that formed in the 1820s, it is {{inaccurate}} to assume the Anti-Relief Party as a whole became National Republicans and the Relief Party became Democrats. The primary factor in determining which party Kentuckians aligned with was their faith in Whig Party founder and native son, Henry Clay. From the election of Thomas Metcalfe in 1828 to the expiration of John L. Helm's term in 1851, only one Democrat held the office of governor: John Breathitt, who died {{a year and a}} half into his term and was succeeded in <b>office</b> <b>by</b> his lieutenant governor, James Turner Morehead, a National Republican.|$|E

Leslie continued to practice law well into his eighties, and was being considered for a district court judgeship in Montana when he fell ill with pneumonia and died on February 7, 1907, at the age of 87.|$|E
