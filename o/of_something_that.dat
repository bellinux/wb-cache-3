She was once noted as saying: The Democratic party is one that I've always observed. I have struggled greatly in life from the day I was born and I am honored {{to be a part}} <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> focuses on working class citizens and molds them into a proud specimen. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy have done so much in that regard for the two generations they've won over during their career course.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this was evidence <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie {{had succeeded in}} knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium {{as a source for}} what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.|$|E

25|$|Leavis {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} the 'third realm' as a name for the method of existence of literature; works which are not private like a dream or public in the sense <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can be tripped over, but exist in human minds as a work of collaborative re-constitution.|$|E
25|$|The {{violations}} of Bell's inequalities, due to quantum entanglement, provide near definitive demonstrations <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was already strongly suspected: that quantum physics cannot {{be represented by}} any version of the classical picture of physics. Some earlier elements that had seemed incompatible with classical pictures included complementarity and wavefunction collapse. The Bell violations show that no resolution of such issues can avoid the ultimate strangeness of quantum behavior.|$|E

25|$|Being-in-the-world is Heidegger's {{replacement}} for {{terms such as}} subject, object, consciousness, and world. For him, the split of things into subject/object, as we find in the Western tradition and even in our language, must be overcome, as is indicated by the root structure of Husserl and Brentano's concept of intentionality, i.e., that all consciousness is consciousness <b>of</b> <b>something,</b> <b>that</b> there is no consciousness, as such, cut off from an object (be it the matter of a thought or of a perception). Nor are there objects without some consciousness beholding or being involved with them.|$|E
25|$|Mark Strong as Pinbacker, {{the murderous}} captain of Icarus I, the first ship {{that was sent}} to reignite the Sun. Pinbacker was {{inspired}} by the character of Sergeant Pinback from Dark Star. The character's disfiguring burns were influenced by the injuries suffered by F1 driver Niki Lauda. Boyle described the character of Pinbacker as a representation of fundamentalism. The director also described the potentially unrealistic presence of Pinbacker as an example <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> breaks the pattern of realism, similar to his scene in Trainspotting (1996) in which Ewan McGregor's character dives into a toilet.|$|E
25|$|A {{reference}} {{model in}} general is a model <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> embodies the basic goal or idea of something and can then be looked at as a reference for various purposes. A business reference model is a means to describe the business operations of an organization, independent of the organizational structure that perform them. Other types of business reference model can also depict {{the relationship between the}} business processes, business functions, and the business area’s business reference model. These reference model can be constructed in layers, and offer a foundation for the analysis of service components, technology, data, and performance.|$|E

25|$|DSM-IV-TR defines trauma {{as direct}} {{personal}} experience {{of an event}} that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury; threat to one's physical integrity, witnessing an event that involves the above experience, learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death, injury experienced by {{a family member or}} close associate, or a state of awareness <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you usually don't think about, but occurs and leaves you distressed and concerned. Memories associated with trauma are implicit, pre-verbal and cannot be recalled, but can be triggered by stimuli from the in vivo environment. The person's response to aversive details of traumatic event involve intense fear, helplessness or horror. In children it is manifested as disorganized or agitative behaviors.|$|E

[...] "The overarching goal for us was about building an ensemble of genuinely interesting characters we wanted to interact with," [...] said Matthies. They also strived to connect the thoughts and actions of all characters to the human experience, allowing players to know [...] "why a person is doing what they are doing". Matthies feels that all characters, particularly the allies, contain some dimension of his own personality.

500|$|Following Slovak's death Kiedis fled {{town and}} {{did not attend the}} funeral, {{considering}} the situation to be surreal. Although he found the death to be a shock, he was not initially [...] "scared straight" [...] and continued to use heroin. [...] However, a few weeks later his friend convinced him both to check into rehab and visit Slovak's grave, which inspired him to get clean. Irons was unable to cope with Slovak's death and subsequently quit the band, saying {{that he did not want}} to be part <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> resulted in the death of his friend. Irons has suffered from severe depression since Slovak's death. Kiedis and Flea decided to continue making music, hoping to continue what Slovak [...] "helped build".

[...] Kurt has twice been portrayed as a child: in the episode [...] "Grilled Cheesus", a series of flashback scenes show Kurt at the age of eight, in which the character is played by Adam Kolkin. Although Kolkin was thirteen {{at the time of the}} audition, which called for an eight-year-old, he was chosen in part because his resemblance to Colfer was [...] "so uncanny even the casting directors were taken aback". Kurt has also been shown even younger—in the episode [...] "The Substitute", club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) comes down with the flu and has a hallucination of the students as preschoolers; all twelve glee club members, including Kurt, are played by very young children.|$|E
500|$|The production's $4 {{million budget}} {{was funded by}} the French {{financier}} BSM Studio. Post-production on the film was completed ten days before its premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The score was composed by Ilan Eshkeri, who wanted to work on Still Alice because of his experience with people affected by Alzheimer's disease in his personal life. He had worked on several Alzheimer's-related projects before, including the 2012 film Ashes, Tim Wheeler's 2014 album Lost Domain, and an advertising campaign for the Alzheimer's Society; he said of working on Still Alice, [...] "in many ways this was a culmination of an artistic expression <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> has deeply touched me." [...] Eshkeri wrote the score to be performed on piano, which he intended to represent Alice's family life, and by a string trio, of which he thought the challenge of composition was similar to [...] "the challenge of coping with the disease".|$|E

At {{the height of}} his popularity, which was called [...] "Todd-mania" [...] and [...] "the Todd Manning phenomenon", Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show's writers had begun to redeem the character. [...] In a September 1995 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that [...] "his villainous character became such a fan favorite". In October 1995, Howarth told SOD, [...] "People have {{come up to me and}} said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' But I have to say, it's disturbing." [...] He gave credit to the show's writers for Todd's popularity, saying that the rapists' trial was well constructed and added, [...] "I think, right now, we're just riding the wave <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> started last summer.
