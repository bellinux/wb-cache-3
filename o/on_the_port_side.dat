5|$|The maindeck of Chesapeake {{was almost}} deserted, having been swept by Shannons gunfire; the {{surviving}} gun crews had either {{responded to the}} call for boarders or had taken refuge below. Two American officers, Lieutenant Cox (who had returned from carrying Captain Lawrence down to the surgeon) and Midshipman Russell saw that the aftmost 18-pounders <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> still bore on Shannon and working between them managed to fire both.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{a pair of}} 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns, one gun at the bow and {{the other}} on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. Two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were also fitted. In 1926 the rangefinders were upgraded and a fixed aircraft catapult was mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side</b> of the forecastle for a Macchi M.18 seaplane.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, British Airways and Singapore Airlines {{shared a}} Concorde for flights between London and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar via Bahrain. The aircraft, BA's Concorde G-BOAD, was painted in Singapore Airlines livery <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side</b> and British Airways livery on the {{starboard}} side. The service was discontinued after three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government; {{it could only}} be reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian airspace in 1979. A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace, so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980.|$|E
50|$|In Cornish pilot gigs, the bow rower's oar is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> (left) <b>side</b> and {{therefore}} bow <b>side</b> refers to <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> boat.|$|R
60|$|I saw <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cryptic's <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> {{as she lay}} half a {{mile away}} across the glassy water, four neat white squares in outline, a white blur in the centre.|$|R
5000|$|Externally a [...] "V-frame" [...] {{arrestor}} hook was fitted. The [...] "snap gear" [...] which {{released the}} hook was {{operated by a}} Bowden cable from a lever mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cockpit <b>port</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
5|$|On U.S. Navy vessels, even-numbered {{compartments}} {{are found}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> but zero {{is reserved for}} compartments that intersect the centerline. That is, the numbers read 6-4-2-0-1-3-5 from port to starboard. In the game of roulette, the number 0 does not count as even or odd, giving the casino an advantage on such bets. Similarly, the parity of zero can affect payoffs in prop bets when the outcome depends on whether some randomized number is odd or even, {{and it turns out}} to be zero.|$|E
5|$|The second torpedo struck Bismarck in her stern <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> {{near the}} port rudder shaft. The {{coupling}} {{on the port}} rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, the Enola Gays weaponeer, was {{concerned}} about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so he decided not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side.</b> Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb's circuits.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{aircraft}} converted as Nuclear, {{biological and}} chemical warfare reconnaissance versions of the An-24B, carrying RR8311-100 air sampling pods low <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forward fuselage and a sensor pod on a pylon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> fuselage <b>side.</b>|$|R
50|$|The boat {{comes with}} a galley with a {{standard}} water capacity of 5 gallons and 4 bunks. Below decks headroom is 4.5 ft. The boat has an outboard engine placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transom (<b>port</b> <b>side).</b>|$|R
25|$|ELC-1 was {{installed}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Unpressurized Cargo Carrier Attachment System #2 (UCCAS 2) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> P3 (<b>port</b> <b>side)</b> segment of <b>the</b> main truss.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck abreast 'B' turret. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a tetrapodal mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ships were equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time, {{one or both of the}} ships was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side</b> of the forecastle.|$|E

50|$|Double ended open {{boat with}} a {{standing}} lug main, small offset mizzen with bumkin and a jib, a folding rudder and galvanised steel centreplate. An outboard motor well is incorporated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aft <b>port</b> <b>side</b> {{to carry a}} small (2 hp) outboard motor. The forerunner to the Peterboat 4.5m.|$|R
50|$|A small {{waterfall}} {{can be found}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Port</b> Dover <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> Lynn River. However, the waterfall is surrounded by private property; making roadside viewing the only safe and legal way to view the waterfall. Stately homes can be found along the Lynn River; some with prices fetching up to nearly $3,000,000 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open real estate market.|$|R
5|$|The E-4 variant {{was fitted}} with {{external}} bomb racks also {{and the empty}} bomb bay space was filled with an 835L (221US gal) tank for aviation fuel and a further 115L (30US gal) oil tank. This increased the loaded weight but increased range to 1,800km (1,130mi). The modifications allowed the He 111 to perform both long- and short-range missions. The E-4's eight internal vertically aligned bomb racks could each carry a 250kg (550lb) bomb. The last E Variant, the He 111E-5, was powered by the Jumo 211A-3, and retained the 835L (221US gal) fuel tank <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side</b> of the bomb bay. Only {{a few of the}} E-4 and E-5 were built.|$|E
5|$|The Italian fleet was reorganized on 9 December, and Pola {{joined her}} three sister {{ships in the}} 3rd Division of the 1st Squadron, which was now {{commanded}} by Admiral Angelo Iachino. On 14 December, a British air raid on Naples slightly damaged Pola. Two bombs hit the ship, both amidships <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side.</b> The hits damaged three of the ship's boilers and caused significant flooding and a significant list to port. Pola was drydocked on 16 December for repair work that lasted until 7 February 1941. She returned to Taranto on 13 February, and she joined Zara and Fiume for extensive maneuvers off Taranto on 1117 March. A nighttime training operation followed on 2324 March.|$|E
5|$|The Navy Department {{conducted}} an international design competition for Texas {{and the winner}} was the Naval Construction & Armaments Co. of Barrow-in-Furness, England. The winning design placed Texass forward turret <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side</b> and her aft turret to starboard. The need for cross-deck fire caused the superstructure to be separated into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between the sections of the superstructure. This significantly limited the gun's ability to fire to the opposite beam as the superstructure still restricted each gun's arc of fire. Furthermore, neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired, as demonstrated during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba when her starboard deck was damaged.|$|E
50|$|Goldfish: the Goldfish has a main gun on its prow, and two {{secondary}} guns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> and starboard <b>sides.</b> It {{relies on}} its moderate speed and high maneuverability.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>port</b> {{also uses}} {{straddle}} carriers (also known as shuttle carriers), which move containers between the automated container stacking {{area and the}} quay cranes. Terminal tractors and trans lifter trailers - which move cassettes, onto which containers are loaded - are used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port's</b> land <b>side</b> to move containers between the automated stacking area and <b>the</b> <b>port's</b> rail terminal and inspection facilities.|$|R
50|$|The Reservoir {{is home to}} Edgbaston Watersports {{who provide}} water and land {{activities}} for school, college & youth groups from their base <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Icknield <b>Port</b> Road <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> reservoir.|$|R
5|$|The {{third and}} most {{damaging}} attack developed at about 13:40. At least four bombs hit the ship's superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25mm anti-aircraft gun crews. Many near misses drove in her outer plating, compromising her defense against torpedoes. Most serious were four more torpedo impacts. Three exploded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> increasing water {{flow into the}} port inner engine room and flooding yet another fireroom and the steering gear room. With the auxiliary steering room already under water, the ship lost maneuverability and became stuck in a starboard turn. The fourth torpedo most likely hit the starboard outer engine room, which, along with three other rooms on the starboard side, was being counterflooded to reduce the port list. The torpedo strike accelerated the rate of flooding and trapped many crewmen.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Ark Royal, the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds. As the Swordfish approached, Bismarck fired her main battery at Sheffield, straddling the cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on Sheffield, killing {{three men and}} wounding several others. Sheffield quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; Bismarck began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers. One torpedo hit amidships <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.|$|E
5|$|At 05:13 on 5 August, Bridgeports lookouts spotted Ushant Light. At 06:40, SC-48 sighted a torpedo {{and sounded}} a warning. Two minutes later, men {{on board the}} tender saw the torpedo wake on Bridgeports port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and full speed ahead. Bridgeport swung barely out of harm's way as men on her stern {{observed}} the torpedo disappear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side</b> and reappear to starboard. It passed five feet astern, barely clearing the rudder. The starboard battery fired one shot {{in the direction of}} the torpedo—which broached on the starboard quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the torpedo had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward the spot where the torpedo wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. Bridgeport ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. Through all this activity, no one actually saw the submarine that had fired the torpedo.|$|E
50|$|Plans {{have been}} {{unveiled}} {{for a new}} building to be constructed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> West <b>Port</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> block between Lady Lawson Street and Lauriston Street, to be called Westport 102. This would be built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same site as the old Post Office headquarters, which famously collapsed during demolition, leading to several roads being closed {{in the area for}} an extended period of time.|$|R
50|$|In turn, the new antennas and radar {{location}} {{meant that}} the funnels had to be modified. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Lütjens the exhaust gases were emitted sideways with two pipes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> and starboard <b>side</b> of each funnel.|$|R
2500|$|PT PAL {{confirmed}} that the SSVs will be designed to support one [...] gun <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foredeck as the main armament. Two stern-facing [...] guns will also be fitted, one each <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> and starboard <b>sides.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E
5|$|Engineers laid {{wire mesh}} on the beaches, felled trees, built roads and {{established}} supply dumps. While the LSTs were unloaded quickly enough, the seven bulk loaded LCTs were not, due to insufficient troops being designated to help unloading. The last was not unloaded until 14:30. At 13:00, six LSTs heading for Red Beach {{were attacked by}} a force of about 70 Japanese aircraft. Some 48 Lockheed P-38 Lightnings were vectored to assist. USS LST-473 was rocked by two bomb hits and two near misses from Val dive bombers. Eight Americans were killed and 37 Americans and Australians wounded. USS LST-471 was torpedoed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side</b> aft by a Betty bomber; 43 Americans and Australians were killed and 30 were wounded. Particularly hard hit were the commandos of the 2/4th Independent Company, which lost 34 dead and 7 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> <b>side</b> of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and {{had the ability to}} be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
5000|$|Captain Brindel {{ordered the}} {{starboard}} side flooded to keep <b>the</b> hole <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hull's <b>port</b> <b>side</b> above water. This helped prevent the Stark from sinking. Brindel quickly dispatched a distress call after the first missile hit. It was received by , {{which was in the}} area, and Conyngham with [...] of its crew on liberty in Bahrain. Waddell and Conyngham arrived to provide damage control and relief to Starks crew.|$|R
50|$|Stowed {{in an open}} {{recessed}} compartment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forward <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> {{just below}} top deck, was a collapsible crane used to retrieve the submarine's Seiran floatplanes. The crane had an electrically operated hoist and was capable of lifting approximately 4.5 tonne ST. It was raised mechanically to a height of 8 m via a motor inside the boat. The boom extended out to a length of 11.8 m.|$|R
50|$|It {{lasted until}} its {{destruction}} in the severe flood of October 1903. A new Barrett Bridge was built shortly thereafter, using a design {{similar to the}} current bridge. In 1922 it {{was taken over by}} the new Joint Interstate Bridge Commission set up by the two states to manage their Delaware River bridges; tolls were eliminated. <b>The</b> toll house <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Port</b> Jervis <b>side</b> still stands and has been incorporated into the popular Flo-Jean restaurant.|$|R
