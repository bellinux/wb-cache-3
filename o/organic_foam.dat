Aiming to contribute with this ecological strategy, we previously developed a new <b>organic</b> <b>foam</b> based on tannins and lignosulfonate. Our promising results lead us to analyze the role and impact of additives on the foaming process {{as well as on}} the solid foam properties. In fact, additives are critical factors in foam characterization since they define foam's properties. Thus, in the present study, we tested different additive concentrations, such as hexamine, glyoxal and tween 80, in order to have a better understanding of their impact on foam properties characteristics and performances aiming to improve foam fabricating process. The densities of the obtained foams varied from 105 to 188  kg/m 3 and our study reveals that the mixture viscosity during foaming seems to play a crucial role in foam properties. Solvent, by diluting the mixture, tend to decrease mixture viscosity resulting in lower mechanical properties and density of the final material. Conversely, hexamine which act as bonding agent tend to increase mixture viscosity leading to higher density and mechanical resistance.

Add different contents of photo starches and contrast {{the results of the}} experiments, and then it could conclude that 20 g photo starches could bond the bamboo fibers and adhesives well. By selecting different kinds of foamed reagents and researching the suitable ratio of them, it could concludes that <b>organic</b> <b>foamed</b> adhesive AC should be 0. 3 g, and inorganic foamed adhesive should be (3 gNaHCO 3 : 2 gNH 3 HCO 3 : 1 g(NH 3) 2 CO 3).

40|$|The Small Particles Intact Capture Experiment (SPICE) {{will develop}} {{technologies}} and engineering techniques necessary to capture nearly intact, uncontaminated cosmic and interplanetary dust particles (IDP's). Successful capture of such particles {{will benefit the}} exobiology and planetary science communities by providing particulate samples that may have survived unaltered since {{the formation of the}} solar system. Characterization of these particles may contribute fundamental data to our knowledge of how these particles could have formed into our planet Earth and, perhaps, contributed to the beginnings of life. The term 'uncontaminated' means that captured cosmic and IDP particles are free of organic contamination from the capture process and the term 'nearly intact capture' means that their chemical and elemental components are not materially altered during capture. The key to capturing cosmic and IDP particles that are organic-contamination free and nearly intact is the capture medium. Initial screening of capture media included <b>organic</b> <b>foams,</b> multiple thin foil layers, and aerogel (a silica gel); but, with the exception of aerogel, the requirements of no contamination or nearly intact capture were not met. To ensure no contamination of particles in the capture process, high-purity aerogel was chosen. High-purity aerogel results in high clarity (visual clearness), a useful quality in detection and recovery of embedded captured particles from the aerogel. P. Tsou at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) originally described the use of aerogel for this purpose and reported laboratory test results.

In this paper the status on the development of concepts for a TFF to produce targets for a heavy ion fusion (HIF) reactor, such as HYLIFE II, and a laser direct drive fusion reactor such as Sombrero, is discussed. The baseline target that is produced in the HIF TFF is similar to the close-coupled indirect drive target designed by Callahan-Miller and Tabak at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. This target consists of a cryogenic hohlraum that is made of a metal case and a variety of metal <b>foams</b> and metal-doped <b>organic</b> <b>foams.</b> The target contains a DT-filled CH capsule. The baseline direct drive target is the design developed by Bodner and coworkers at Naval Research Laboratory. HIF targets can be filled with DT before or after assembly of the capsule into the hohlraum. Assembly of targets before filling allows assembly operations to be done at room temperature, but tritium inventories are much larger due to the large volume that the hohlraum occupies in the fill system. Assembly of targets cold after filling allows substantial reduction in tritium inventory, but this requires assembly of targets at cryogenic temperature. A model being developed to evaluate the tritium inventories associated with each of the assembly and fill options indicates that filling targets before assembling the capsule into the hohlraum, filling at temperatures as high as possible, and reducing dead-volumes in the fill system as much as possible offers the potential to reduce tritium inventories to acceptable levels. Use of enhanced DT ice layering techniques, such as infrared layering can reduce tritium inventories significantly by reducing the layering time and therefore the number of capsules being layered. Current processes for fabrication of ICF capsules can most likely be easily scaled up to produce capsules at rates needed for an IFE plant...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{study of}} foams formed on the marine Lake Mir, Croatia, and {{elsewhere}} on the same coast demonstrates, for the first time, that they are fractionated (enrichened) in org-I by up to 630 times relative to the water from which they form. The {{results are consistent with}} an I/C mole ratio for in-situ <b>organic</b> matter. <b>Foams</b> created artificially in the laboratory from natural samples of water from Lake Mir were similarly fractionated, although to a lesser degree. These differences were effectively removed when enrichments were expressed as molar ratios, e. g., Ptot/Itot, rather than straightforward concentrations. This similarity in the behaviour to enrichment for organic forms of I, N and P suggests that the time over which foams age is a major determinant of the enrichment they display. It is argued that this period allows time for the seawater occluded in the interstitial spaces between bubbles, to drain away. Since foam production is ubiquitous over the oceans it seems likely that this process local to coastal environments is much more common than at first might appear to be the case.

40|$|The {{physics of}} {{hypervelocity}} impacts into foams {{is of interest}} because of the possible application to interplanetary dust particle (IDP) capture by spacecraft. We present {{a model for the}} phenomena occurring in such impacts into low-density <b>organic</b> polymer <b>foams.</b> Particles smaller than foam cells behave as if the foam is a series of solid slabs and are fragmented and, at higher velocities, thermally altered. Particles much larger than the foam cells behave as if the foam were a continuum, allowing the use of a continuum mechanics model to describe the effects of drag and ablation. Fragmentation {{is expected to be a}} major process, especially for aggregates of small grains. Calculations based on these arguments accurately predict experimental data and, for hypothetical IDPs, indicate that recovery of organic materials will be low for encounter velocities greater than 5 km s^(− 1). For an organic particle 100 μm in diameter, ∼ 35 % of the original mass would be collected in an impact at 5 km s^(− 1), dropping to ∼ 10 % at 10 km s^(− 1) and ∼ 0 % at 15 km s^(− 1). For the same velocities the recovery ratios for troilite (FeS) are ∼ 95 %, 65 %, and 50 %, and for olivine (Mg_ 2 SiO_ 4) they are ∼ 98 %, 80 %, and 65 %, demonstrating that inorganic materials are much more easily collected.

Water activity was estimated from global medium composition by the UNIFAC-LLE group contribution method. UNIFAC calculations were also used to compare experimental bulk medium compositions with the theoretical composition of a monophasic or a biphasic system. For most experimental conditions, the organic phase composition was consistent with the presence of a water phase with no influence of the presence of enzyme in the foams. The influence of foam hydrophilicity was only significant for low water content systems (< 0. 05 %, v/v).

Foaming has raised major concerns for the water utilities due to significant impacts on process efficiency and operational costs. Several foaming causes have been suggested {{over the past few}} years by researchers. However, the supporting experimental information is limited and in some cases site specific. The present report aimed to provide a better understanding of the anaerobic digestion foaming problem and to identify the underlying mechanisms of foaming. Field and laboratory investigation identified organic loading as a cause of foaming. Bench scale batch digestion studies in sludge showed that the critical <b>organic</b> loading for <b>foaming</b> was at 2. 5 kg VS. m - 3 while the 5 kg VS. m - 3 resulted in persistent foaming. Moreover, full scale foaming digesters exhibited higher foaming potential in digested sludge under aeration in the laboratory than the full scale non- foaming digesters indicating that the concentration of surface active agents was higher. Further investigation of the effect of the surface active compounds, BSA and n-valeric acid on foaming showed that both compounds induced persistent foaming at all the examined concentrations. Filamentous bacteria contribution to foam initiation and stabilization was considered insignificant, apart from one occasion (FI: 5), due to the abundance of filaments in foaming sludge (FI≤ 3) and their partitioning in foam (FI≤ 3). Part of the current work also assessed the cost implications of a foaming incident at the full scale. The antifoam cost was found to be of major concern for the water utilities costing between £ 1. 30 and £ 13. 00 per 1000 m 3 of digester volume per day. However, there was no information on biogas and energy loss whereas the information provided on cleaning, maintenance costs and manpower working hours was poor.
