5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} two-level utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism {{was criticized for}} implying {{that in some cases}} an individual should pursue a course <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>that</b> would obviously not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E
5|$|Accepting {{the offer}} on January 19, 2009, Ryan {{immediately}} began {{to carry out a}} plan <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>that</b> he had outlined for the franchise's future. He planned to remove the players from distractions {{on and off the field}} and allow them get to know one another to build team chemistry. Thus, training camp was moved to the campus of SUNY Cortland, where the team would be relatively secluded from the media and any other distractions. Ryan and general manager Mike Tannenbaum were also determined to draft a quarterback who could lead and be the face of the franchise. As a result, the team traded up to select Mark Sanchez of USC in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Johnston decided upon {{a course}} <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>that</b> {{forfeited}} the initiative across {{most of his}} defensive line, tacitly admitting that the Confederate defensive strategy for Tennessee was a sham. On February 7, at a council of war held in the Covington Hotel at Bowling Green, he decided to abandon western Kentucky by withdrawing Beauregard from Columbus, evacuating Bowling Green, and moving his forces south of the Cumberland River at Nashville. Despite his misgivings about its defensibility, Johnston agreed to Beauregard's advice that he should reinforce Fort Donelson with another 12,000 men, knowing that a defeat there would mean the inevitable loss of Middle Tennessee and the vital manufacturing and arsenal city of Nashville.|$|E

25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of these drugs derives from two factors: their target, the H+/K+ ATPase {{which is responsible for}} the last step in acid secretion; therefore, their action on acid secretion is independent of the stimulus to acid secretion, of histamine, acetylcholine, or other yet to be discovered stimulants. Also, their mechanism of action involves covalent binding of the activated drug to the enzyme, resulting in a duration <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>that</b> exceeds their plasma half-life.|$|E

25|$|Characterisation {{is one of}} the {{key element}} in demarcating the choice of law and {{jurisdiction}} issues.Once the forum court decides that it has jurisdiction to hear the case, it must characterise or classify the cause(s) <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> <b>That</b> is regarded as the most important and difficult problem in conflict of laws as trade and travel between states have become the norm and the effects of broken promises, defective goods, traffic accidents and marital squabbles are no longer confined to the sovereign territory of one particular state or nation.|$|E
25|$|Compatibilists {{maintain}} that mental reality {{is not of}} itself causally effective. Classical compatibilists have addressed the dilemma of free will by arguing that free will holds {{as long as we}} are not externally constrained or coerced. Modern compatibilists make a distinction between freedom of will and freedom <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> <b>that</b> is, separating freedom of choice from the freedom to enact it. Given that humans all experience a sense of free will, some modern compatibilists think it is necessary to accommodate this intuition. Compatibilists often associate freedom of will with the ability to make rational decisions.|$|E

25|$|President Kruger and the Transvaal {{government}} found {{every possible}} objection to this policy. Their actions in {{what became known}} as the Vaal River Drift Question best illustrates the plan <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>that</b> the Transvaal government thought best. A series of disagreements arose over the termination of the 1894 agreement between the Cape government railway and the Netherlands railway. The Cape government had advanced the sum of Â£600,000 to the Netherlands railway and the Transvaal government conjointly for the purposes of extending the railway from the Vaal River to Johannesburg. At the same time, it was stipulated that the Cape government have the right to fix the rate of traffic until the end of 1894, or until the Delagoa Bay-Pretoria line was completed.|$|E
25|$|People {{started to}} feel that the police were taking sides with the city council and Faderhuset. Tensions boiled over when a {{demonstration}} on 24 September was attacked by the police. The reason for the police attack apparently was a bottle being thrown at a police van. The police responded with a full frontal baton-charge on the demonstration. This led to several hours of street fighting between police and demonstrators. During the street fighting, three hundred people were arrested, many of which had not been involved with the fighting. A lot of these later claimed to have been brutally treated while in police custody. This sparked anger amongst the supporters of Ungdomshuset and many stated that violent resistance was now not only necessary and justified but the only right course <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>that</b> they could choose.|$|E
25|$|While he {{supported}} the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king, his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers. He argued for representing truth in language, and honesty was of paramount importance. Even in facial expression, truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. In discussing {{the relationship between a}} king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors are considered to be taking a course <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>that</b> is wrong. Confucius believed in ruling by example, if you lead correctly, orders by force or punishment are not necessary.|$|E

25|$|Pepys learned {{arithmetic}} from {{a private}} tutor and used models of ships {{to make up for}} his lack of first-hand nautical experience, and ultimately came to {{play a significant role in}} the board's activities. In September 1660, he was made a Justice of the Peace; on 15 February 1662, Pepys was admitted as a Younger Brother of Trinity House; and on 30 April, he received the freedom of Portsmouth. Through Sandwich, he was involved in the administration of the short-lived English colony at Tangier. He joined the Tangier committee in August 1662 when the colony was first founded and became its treasurer in 1665. In 1663, he independently negotiated a Â£3,000 contract for Norwegian masts, demonstrating the freedom <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>that</b> his superior abilities allowed. He was appointed to a commission of the royal fishery on 8 April 1664.|$|E
25|$|The {{challenge}} to the Court in its analysis and decision was devising a proper course <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>that</b> was both coordinate and consonant between the sovereign authorities (the Congress over itself and its members, {{the people and the}} states over the Congress) each in their own sphere, over the choosing of members to the Congress. The Court looked at the historical precedent of the House, the history of its candidate members, {{and the role of the}} states and their voters in choosing their representatives. The Court concluded that the US Constitution (the word and will of the people), the weight of history (the record of how the people have used their constitution), and the federal structure of the government (the role of the states in organizing and managing elections within their borders) required the Court to decide that the sovereign will of the people, as expressed in the democratic process, and the coordinate role of their states must be made consonant and held supreme, in the responsibility to create candidate members for the Congress.|$|E
25|$|Side effects such as {{hyperalgesia}} and allodynia, sometimes {{accompanied by}} a worsening of neuropathic pain, may be consequences of long-term treatment with opioid analgesics, especially when increasing tolerance has resulted in loss of efficacy and consequent progressive dose escalation over time. This appears to largely {{be a result of}} actions of opioid drugs at targets other than the three classic opioid receptors, including the nociceptin receptor, sigma receptor and Toll-like receptor 4, and can be counteracted in animal models by antagonists at these targets such as J-113,397, BD-1047 or (+)-naloxone respectively. No drugs are currently approved specifically for counteracting opioid-induced hyperalgesia in humans and in severe cases the only solution may be to discontinue use of opioid analgesics and replace them with non-opioid analgesic drugs. However, since individual sensitivity to the development of this side effect is highly dose dependent and may vary depending which opioid analgesic is used, many patients can avoid this side effect simply through dose reduction of the opioid drug (usually accompanied by the addition of a supplemental non-opioid analgesic), rotating between different opioid drugs, or by switching to a milder opioid with a mixed mode <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>that</b> also counteracts neuropathic pain, particularly tramadol or tapentadol.|$|E
