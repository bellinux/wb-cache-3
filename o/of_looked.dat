There was this moment where I felt like he had sort <b>of</b> <b>looked</b> at her and reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself and you go. That’s what {{it was for me}} in that moment when I witnessed it." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{returning}} from Havana to record the Buena Vista Social Club album, Ry Cooder began working with German film director Wim Wenders on the soundtrack to Wenders' film The End of Violence, the third such collaboration between the two artists. According to Wenders, it {{was an effort to}} force Cooder to focus on the project, [...] "He always sort <b>of</b> <b>looked</b> in the distance and smiled, and I knew he was back in Havana." [...] Although Wenders knew nothing about Cuban music at the time, he became enthused by tapes of the Havana sessions provided by Cooder, and agreed to travel to the island to film the recording of Buena Vista Social Club Presents: Ibrahim Ferrer, the singer's first solo album, in 1998.|$|E

500|$|Hornish again {{returned}} to Penske in 2006. The team changed manufacturers, joining Honda when Toyota and Chevrolet left the series after the 2005 season. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, {{when he passed}} Marco Andretti for the lead on the final lap {{to win in the}} second-closest margin of victory in the race's history. Hornish later said about the pass, [...] "I figured I came all this way, I ought to give myself one more shot at it. I kind <b>of</b> <b>looked</b> at it as, I was going to drive over him if I had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what." [...] His second win of the season was at Richmond (after leading for all but 38 laps), and he took the points lead after winning the next race at Kansas. His fourth and final win of the season was at Kentucky, when he started second and led for 57 laps. In the season-ending race at Chicagoland Hornish qualified for the pole position and finished third, clinching his third series championship and Penske's first. Although he and Dan Wheldon finished the year with the same number of points, the tie was broken by wins; Hornish had four, and Wheldon two.|$|E
500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't know any of that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort <b>of</b> <b>looked</b> 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E

Keys had {{requested}} {{to be a part}} of Houston's album and Houston decided she wanted to work with Keys after hearing her perform at one of Clive Davis' parties. Houston said for MTV News that “When she performed at one of [...] parties the year before last, I kind <b>of</b> <b>looked</b> at her, and it was when she had [...] record out, and it was the only record that came on the radio that inspired me”. “I walked over to her, and off the cuff said, ‘Hey, do you think you could produce me?’ She said, ‘Yeah, I think I can,’ ” Houston explained.|$|E
30|$|The factor κ {{can be used}} to {{minimise}} {{the effects}} of detector saturation, as observed in the practical implementation of the CFAR detector (7).

Such a number <b>of</b> <b>looks</b> will only be achieved if the radar’s scan rate is slow. Hence, the factor κ should be able to mitigate the effects of having only a small number <b>of</b> <b>looks.</b>|$|R

2500|$|At the 2009 Grammy Awards, Nas {{confirmed}} he was collaborating on {{an album}} with reggae singer Damian Marley which {{was expected to}} be released in the fall of 2009. Nas said of the collaboration in an interview [...] "I was a big fan of his father and of course all the children, all the offspring, and Damian, I kind <b>of</b> <b>looked</b> at Damian as a rap guy. His stuff is not really singing, or if he does, it comes off more hard, like on some street shit. I always liked how reggae and hip-hop have always been intertwined and always kind of pushed each other, I always liked the connection. I'd worked with people before from the reggae world but when I worked with Damian, the whole workout was perfect". A portion of the profit was planned to go towards building a school in Africa. He {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "too early to tell the title or anything like that". The Los Angeles Times reported that the album would be titled Distant Relatives.|$|E
