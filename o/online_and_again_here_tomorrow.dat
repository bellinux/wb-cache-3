40|$|The {{terrorist}} threat {{has returned to}} Brussels but this time is different: everyone is feeling on edge and life is still far from normal. There are many that show defiance and, slowly, people in Brussels are returning to school and work, but the sense of threat remains. Unfortunately, this is far from unusual for many cities around Europe, as Paris and many others can testify, {{and is likely to}} be replicated <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>here</b> in Brussels <b>and</b> across the continent...|$|R
60|$|Terrible was {{the sight}} indeed. In many places the dead lay thickly piled on the ground, {{and the manner}} in which Englishmen, Russians, and Frenchmen lay mixed {{together}} showed how the tide of battle had ebbed and flowed, and how each patch of ground had been taken <b>and</b> retaken <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> <b>Here</b> Russians <b>and</b> grenadiers lay stretched side by side, sometimes with their bayonets still locked in each other's bodies. Here, where the shot and shell swept most fiercely, lay the dead, whose very nationality was scarcely distinguishable, so torn and mutilated were they.|$|R

40|$|Presented at the 10 th International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD 2004) Auditory Displays {{are quite}} {{well known in}} the {{research}} community, but very little of this experience is being transferred to product designers. The method of Design Patterns is well known to a number of design domains and is used to describe ``solutions to problems in context'' {{in such a way that}} they can be reused <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> <b>Here</b> we present six new prototype Design Patterns for Auditory Display: SystemMonitoring, SituationalAwareness, SonifiedLineGraph, AuditoryIcon, Attenson, and Personalisation.

60|$|August 26th.--All past affairs, all home conclusions, {{all people}} whom I have known in America <b>and</b> meet <b>again</b> <b>here,</b> are strangely {{compelled}} {{to undergo a}} new trial.

40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} that vaccinating mice {{with a live}} attenu-ated influenza vaccine (LAIV) led to substantial increases in the dynamics of nasal colonization by important and common bacterial respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneu-moniae and Staphylococcus aureus (1). However, as Coelingh and Belshe point out (2) and as we emphasize both in that paper <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>here,</b> in contrast to what occurred when mice were vacci-nated against seasonal influenza viruses, mice vaccinated with LAIVdid not exhibit increased susceptibility to bacterial disease in the lower respiratory tract, which is of particular concern when considering {{what is known about}} interactions between influenza viruses and bacterial pathogens (3). Our investigation received considerable attention, but unfor-tunately, a large portion of it came from the antivaccine move-ment.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to obtain {{empirical}} evidence of secrecy of disordered eating, body dissatisfaction, and body checking among non-clinical women. Female undergraduate students without a history of eating disorders (N = 212) completed questionnaires <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> in the lab a week later under the pretense that their responses were private or would be public. Changes in self-report from the online questionnaires to those completed in the lab indicated secrecy of the relevant construct. The results revealed that women are secretive about their desire to be thin, concerns with food intake, bulimic symptoms, body dissatisfaction, and body checking, but not about dietary restraint. Generally, women for whom appearance is a defining feature of the self, and who are low in fear of negative evaluation tended to be most secretive. Thus, it these women may have been most motivated and willing to engage in impression management...|$|R

50|$|There {{is also a}} {{different}} version of Sheila (Downey) Fury's past life. Whereas in The Furys her past is a mystery, about which her husband Desmond never questions her (neither does her lover Peter Fury), in An End and a Beginning, the reader learns that when she first met Desmond, {{she gave him a}} full account of past <b>and</b> family. <b>Again</b> <b>here</b> {{there is no mention of}} her being a prostitute, or that Peter in The Secret Journey had seen her with a businessman at a hotel.|$|R

6000|$|Throughout this interview, my {{conscience}} {{was a good}} deal exercised; and I was moved to throw myself on my knees and own the intended treachery. But then I had Hanson to consider. I was in much the same position as Old Rowley, that royal humourist, whom [...] "the rogue had taken into his confidence." [...] <b>And</b> <b>again,</b> <b>here</b> was Ronalds on the spot. He must know the day of the month as well as Hanson and I. If a broad hint were necessary, he had the broadest in the world. For a large board had been nailed by the crown prince on the very front of our house, between the door and window, painted in cinnabar--the pigment of the country--with doggrel rhymes and contumelious pictures, and announcing in terms unnecessarily figurative, that the trick was already played, the claim already jumped, {{and the author of the}} placard the legitimate successor of Mr. Ronalds.
