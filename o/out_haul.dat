60|$|Bill hurried forward. The {{other hand}} had hauled in the traveller, {{to which the}} bolt rope of the jib was still attached, and hauling on this had got the block down and in {{readiness}} for fastening on the new jib. The sheets were hooked on, and then while one hand ran the sail out with the <b>out</b> <b>haul</b> to the bowsprit end, the other hoisted with the halliards. By this time the boat {{was close to the}} broken water. As the sail filled her head payed off towards it. The wind lay her right over, and before she could gather way there was a tremendous crash. The Susan had struck on the sands. The next wave lifted her, but as it passed on she came down with a crash that seemed to shake her in pieces. Joe Chambers relaxed his grasp of the now useless tiller.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, Henri, {{by dint of}} yelling, {{throwing}} his arms wildly about, and digging his heels into {{the sides of his}} long-legged horse, succeeded in coming close up with the bull, which once or twice turned his clumsy body half round and glared furiously at its pursuer with its small black eyes. Suddenly it stuck out its tail, stopped short, and turned full round. Henri stopped short also. Now, the sticking out of a buffalo's tail has a peculiar significance which it is well to point out. It serves, in a sense, the same purpose to the hunter that the compass does to the mariner; it points out where to go and what to do. When galloping away in ordinary flight the buffalo carries his tail like ordinary cattle, which indicates that you may push on. When wounded, he lashes it from side to side, or carries it over his back, up in the air; this indicates [...] "Look <b>out!</b> <b>haul</b> off a bit!" [...] But when he carries it stiff and horizontal, with a slight curve in the middle of it, it says plainly, [...] "Keep back, or kill me as quick as you can," [...] for that is what Indians call the mad-lazy, and is a sign that mischief is brewing.|$|E

Some early <b>out</b> <b>haul</b> designs had a metal bail attached aft end through which a wire outhaul ran, swagged {{to a wire}} and run to a cleat {{on the bottom of}} the boom near the main sheet block through a groove in the boom's and the tag runs to a cleat.|$|E

40|$|The annual {{cycle of}} all {{pinnipeds}} includes seasonal changes in behaviour linked to key {{events such as}} reproduction, moult, and in some species, migration.

Weather conditions have been shown to influence the <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> pattern of some pinniped species but these studies have also had limited seasonal scope. This study measured activity levels (seal body movements per minute) and <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> behaviour of nine captive harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) using modified time-depth recorders for a fourteen-month period. Solar radiation, temperature, wind velocity, and relative humidity were concurrently monitored throughout the study. The harp seal was selected for study because relatively little quantitative information exists for this species' behaviour and because circannual patterns in their food intake and energy demands have been detected.

Seals spent significantly more time <b>hauled</b> <b>out,</b> and time of day of <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> shifted closer to midday during moult.

40|$|Surveying the habitat, {{interactions}} between harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and the habitat and also their behavior {{is important to}} better understanding these seals. The number of seals <b>hauled</b> <b>out</b> on each site was compared to tide height {{and the number of}} seals in the water was compared between those in the fast current and those in the slow current. Distance was also measured from the lookout point to each site and compared to the number of seals on each <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> site. As the tide height increased, the number of seals <b>hauled</b> <b>out</b> on sites A and F decreased dramatically, while those on B, D and E remained the relatively the same, which shows that those from A and F did not move to the closer <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> sites. The tide height and what time of day seemed to {{have an effect on the}} number of seals in the water and the proportion of how many were in the fast current compared to those in the slow current. Also, distance may be an important factor because more seals were <b>hauled</b> <b>out</b> on A and F, which are much further away from observers on land than other sites. The closer sites were used mainly by nursing mom‐pup pairs...|$|R
