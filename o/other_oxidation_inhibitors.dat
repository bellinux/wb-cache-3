40|$|Electrical {{insulating}} {{mineral oils}} are mainly manufactured from naphthenic crude sources, {{with a small}} number being produced from paraffinic crudes and gas-to-liquids technology. The resulting products are most frequently free of additives, except for certain types of phenol-based <b>oxidation</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> and of a very low percentage by weight, only up to 0. 4 %. The main specifications for electrical insulating oils, Doble TOPS, ASTM D 3487 and IEC 60296, only allow <b>oxidation</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and any <b>other</b> additives must be agreed upon by the entities involved in the selling and purchasing of the product. Over the years, other additives have been used, sometimes unbeknownst to the purchaser, some of which include pour point depressants, gassing tendency additives, <b>other</b> types of <b>oxidation</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> passivators and metal deactivators. This paper discusses the uses of passivators and how they work in transformer systems. Presently, passivators {{are being used to}} control issues with corrosive sulfur but they have also been used to control oxidation stability of the oil and streaming (static) electrification.

40|$|AbstractCO 2 {{absorption}} with reversible {{chemical reaction}} using aqueous amine solution is currently the most appropriate method for low pressure CO 2 source like a coal fired power plant. Solvents have been used extensively {{for the removal of}} CO 2 from natural gas and flue gas via chemical absorption. Among the industrially utilized solvents, alkanolamines are the most widely used for CO 2 absorption because of the properties toward CO 2 capture such as high absorption capacity, fast reaction kinetics, and high solubility. However, a major problem associated with the chemical absorption is solvent degradation. We examined the oxidative degradation of alkanolamines such as MEA, DEA, AMP, and MDEA. The oxidative degradation rate of the amines was in the order MEA > DEA > AMP = MDEA. The effect of <b>oxidation</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> EDTA and DTPMP, on the oxidative degradation of MEA was investigated and the products of oxidative degradation of MEA were analyzed.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in agricultural systems in which the use of herbicides is forbidden. Therefore, soils treated with herbicides atrazine and metolachlor for the last 20 years were compared with soil samples from the same field {{that had never been}} treated (control soil). We determined the pollution induced community tolerance (PICT) by evaluating the methane oxidation capacity of soil samples after adding increasing amounts of a methane <b>oxidation</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16 S rRNA genes assessed whether the soil methanotrophic community differed between the two treatments. Addition of 60 µg 2, 4 -D per g soil clearly inhibited methane oxidation in both soils but increased the time needed to oxidize 5 % methane in the headspace by 250 % for the control soil compared with 175 % for the herbicide-treated soil. This indicates that the soil with a long-term herbicide history had a greater tolerance to the methane <b>oxidation</b> <b>inhibitor</b> than did the control soil. The DGGE of 16 S rRNA genes amplified directly from soil community DNA could also distinguish the two treatments. The banding patterns of the Type I methanotrophs contained fewer bands in the herbicide-treated soil.

Three composites were examined. Composite A was a baseline C(sub f) /SiC(sub m) composite that incorporated a approx. 0. 4 micron pyrolytic carbon (PyC) fiber coating to promote strength and toughness, and a CVI-derived SiC matrix.
