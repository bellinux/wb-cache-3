Makgill's claim was that the Act <b>of</b> <b>Settlement</b> 1701 prevented a person born outside Britain or its dominions from being a Privy Counsellor. In December 1915, Lord Chief Justice Lord Reading rejected the application {{on the grounds that}} the relevant sections of the Act <b>of</b> <b>Settlement</b> had been repealed by later legislation.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Commonwealth realms is such that any change to the laws governing succession to the shared throne requires the unanimous consent of all the realms. Succession is governed by statutes such as the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act <b>of</b> <b>Settlement</b> 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707. The rules of succession may only be changed by an Act of Parliament; {{it is not possible}} for an individual to renounce his or her right of succession. The Act <b>of</b> <b>Settlement</b> restricts the succession to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714), a granddaughter of James I.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the experience of the}} completed studies <b>of</b> the rural <b>settlement</b> system in the Republic of Mordovia. At the first stage, a spatial database <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> was created, which contains information on the currently existing and extant populated areas. At the second stage, with the help of modern methods of cartographic visualization and mathematical-cartographic modeling, spatio-temporal features of the process <b>of</b> population <b>settlement</b> on the territory of Mordovia were revealed. The functionality of raster GIS allows you to analyze the environment of each cell and build models of spatial distribution of values of any indicator based on discretely specified information. Obtained simplified models <b>of</b> density <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> allowed us to analyze the spatio-temporal change in the network <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> <b>of</b> Mordovia in 1931 – 2014. An increase in the number <b>of</b> rural <b>settlements</b> in Mordovia in the 1930 s was revealed. On the basis of the created database and GIStechnologies, various thematic maps characterizing the population distribution have been compiled. When studying the formation and development of the network <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> in the Republic, it is possible to retrospectively restore it for different time periods, since the database contains information about the time of origin and disappearance <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> and their old names. In ArcMap application, a temporary cartographic animation was created demonstrating the change in the network <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> in the Republic of Mordovia in 1951 – 2014, where each object was characterized by the time of existence. The article considers the reasons for the reduction <b>of</b> the <b>settlement</b> network and the current trends in the formation and development of the network <b>of</b> rural <b>settlements</b> in the unified system of resettlement of the republic. </p...|$|R

5|$|George's {{second cousin}} once removed, Queen Anne, ascended the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1702. She had no {{surviving}} children, {{and by the}} Act <b>of</b> <b>Settlement</b> 1701 the English Parliament designated Anne's closest Protestant blood relations, George's grandmother Sophia and her descendants, as Anne's heirs in England and Ireland. Consequently, after his grandmother and father, George was third in line to succeed Anne in two of her three realms. He was naturalized as an English subject in 1705 by the Sophia Naturalization Act, and in 1706 he was made a Knight of the Garter and created Duke and Marquess of Cambridge, Earl of Milford Haven, Viscount Northallerton and Baron Tewkesbury in the Peerage of England.

5|$|Mycenaean {{domestic}} architecture originates {{mainly from}} earlier Middle Helladic traditions (c. 2000–1650 BC) both in shape, {{as well as}} in location <b>of</b> <b>settlement.</b> The observed uniformity in domestic architecture came probably {{as a result of a}} shared past among the communities of the Greek mainland rather than as a consequence of cultural expansion of the Mycenaean Koine.

30|$|Kosovo {{settlement}} {{are different}} in terms of territorial and demographic size. Change is evident in hypsometric scale and time and depending on the infringer’s population and type, their number also varies according to the hypsometric zones and range size. On the threshold of hypsometric {{of the first and}} second zone or < 750  m lies the largest number <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> where depending on the time period their numbers increase or decrease. Also, by increasing the number of overall population also varies the range size <b>of</b> <b>settlements,</b> such as in 1948 about 67 % <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> in Kosovo have been of size < 500  inh, 31.21 % of size 500 – 2500  inh and only 1.38 % of size 5000 – 25, 000  inh and none settlement greater than 25, 000  inh. Never the less the same situation is in census of 1953. This is mainly the period when Kosovo’s economic base dominated by the primary sector, mainly extensive agriculture and forestry. While in the census of 1961 the majority <b>of</b> the <b>settlements</b> or 57.50 % of them belonged to range size < 500  inh, while 41.03 % belongs to range sizes of 2500 – 5000  inh, and only 0.63 % or 9 settlements belonged to the group <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> 5000 – 50, 000  inh, where 5 of them belonged to range size 5000 – 25, 000  inh and only four settlements from 25, 000 to 50, 000  inh. By increasing the economic base of Kosovo, namely the increase of industrialization also increases the number <b>of</b> larger <b>settlements</b> and reduce the number of smallest, such as in the censuses of 1961 dominated the settlements size < 500  inh with a number <b>of</b> 824 <b>settlements.</b> A decade later the number <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> reduced to 688, while the number <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> from 500 to 2500  inh increased by 588 – 710 representing the largest group <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> in Kosovo. Growing marks, the <b>settlements</b> <b>of</b> range size 2500 – 5000  inh increased by 12 – 21, group <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> 5000 – 25, 000  inh grow for two settlements, while it appeared {{for the first time the}} type <b>of</b> range size <b>settlements</b> > 50, 000  inh (Prishtina). In terms of hypsometric participation, it is the same situation almost since the first registration census. In the 1981 group <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> with over 50, 000  inh added the 3 settlements. Growing settlements marks in range size 500 – 25, 000  inh while the range size settlements < 500  inh continue to decline.
