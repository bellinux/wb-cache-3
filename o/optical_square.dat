The novel scheme exploits nonlinear effects and gain saturation phenomenon in the semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). This technique uses gain-compression dynamics between the input pulses and the generated ones in gain-saturated SOA to form square pulses. The center wavelength of the generated <b>optical</b> <b>square</b> pulse can be tuned from 1530 to 1570 nm by adjusting the center wavelength of the optical band pass filter (OBPF) in the SOA-based mode-locked fiber ring laser. The duty cycle of the output pulse can be tuned from 12. 7 to 88. 4 %, which strongly depends on the input power and intra-cavity power. Chinese Academy of Science...|$|E

40|$|We predict new generic {{types of}} vorticity-carrying soliton {{complexes}} {{in a class}} of physical systems including an attractive Bose-Einstein condensate in a <b>square</b> <b>optical</b> lattice (OL) and photonic lattices in photorefractive media. The patterns include ring-shaped higher-order vortex solitons and supervortices. Stability diagrams for these patterns, based on direct simulations, are presented. The vortex ring solitons are stable if the phase difference ∆φ between adjacent solitons in the ring is larger than π/ 2, while the supervortices are stable in the opposite case, ∆φ < π/ 2. A qualitative explanation to the stability is given. Recent experimental observations of two-dimensional (2 D) solitons [1] and localized vortices [2] in photonic lattices in self-focusing photorefractive crystals (PRCs), and prediction of similar structures in the 2 D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for a self-attractive Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) loaded into the <b>square</b> <b>optical</b> lattice (OL) [3, 4], have drawn interest to solitons of this type...|$|R

40|$|Mott {{insulators}} {{with both}} spin and orbital degeneracy are pertinent {{to a large}} number of transition metal oxides. The intertwined spin and orbital fluctuations can lead to rather exotic phases such as quantum spin-orbital liquids. Here we consider two-component (spin 1 / 2) fermionic atoms with strong repulsive interactions on the $p$-band of the <b>optical</b> <b>square</b> lattice. We derive the spin-orbital exchange for quarter filling of the $p$-band when the density fluctuations are suppressed, and show it frustrates the development of long range spin order. Exact diagonalization indicates a spin-disordered ground state with ferro-orbital order. The system dynamically decouples into individual Heisenberg spin chains, each realizing a Luttinger liquid accessible at higher temperatures compared to atoms confined to the $s$-band.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{critical}} behavior of Bose-Einstein condensation {{in the second}} band of a bipartite <b>optical</b> <b>square</b> lattice in a renormalization group framework at one-loop order. Within our field theoretical representation of the system, we approximate {{the system as a}} two-component Bose gas in three dimensions. We demonstrate that the system is in a different universality class than the previously studied condensation in a frustrated triangular lattice due to an additional Umklapp scattering term, which stabilizes the chiral superfluid order at low temperatures. We derive the renormalization group flow of the system and show that this order persists in the low energy limit. Furthermore, the renormalization flow suggests that the phase transition from the thermal phase to the chiral superfluid state is first order. Comment: 15 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a system of}} fermions on a two-dimensional <b>optical</b> <b>square</b> lattice in the strongly repulsive coupling regime. In this case, the interactions can be controlled by laser intensity {{as well as by}} Feshbach resonance. We compare the energetics of states with resonating valence bond d-wave superfluidity, antiferromagnetic long range order and a homogeneous state with coexistence of superfluidity and antiferromagnetism. We show that the energy density of a hole e_hole(x) has a minimum at doping x=x_c that signals phase separation between the antiferromagnetic and d-wave paired superfluid phases. The energy of the phase-separated ground state is however found to be very close to that of a homogeneous state with coexisting antiferromagnetic and superfluid orders.

By varying the spin-orbit coupling parameters, we find both a semimetal/insulator phase transition and a topological phase transition between insulating phases with different numbers of edge states. The spin is not a conserved quantity of the system and the topological phase transitions can be detected by analyzing its polarization in time of flight images, providing a clear diagnostic for the characterization of the topological phases through the partial entanglement between spin and lattice degrees of freedom.
