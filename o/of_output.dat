5|$|Divergence and convergence: In {{the human}} cerebellum, {{information}} from 200 million mossy fiber inputs is expanded to 40 billion granule cells, whose parallel fiber outputs then converge onto 15 million Purkinje cells. Because {{of the way}} that they are lined up longitudinally, the 1000 or so Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone may receive input from as many as 100 million parallel fibers, and focus their own output down to a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells. Thus, the cerebellar network receives a modest number of inputs, processes them very extensively through its rigorously structured internal network, and sends out the results via a very limited number <b>of</b> <b>output</b> cells.|$|E

5|$|The end-fire array trades a few {{decibels}} <b>of</b> <b>output</b> {{power for}} directionality, so it requires more enclosures {{for the same}} output power as a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of enclosures.

Because of the physical size of the end-fire array, few concert venues are able to implement it.

Introduction Neural networks have as one of their main functions the prediction <b>of</b> <b>outputs</b> from inputs in large, multi-component, complex systems, through extrapolation from example inputs and <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> such systems.

5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss <b>of</b> <b>output</b> from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} {{reserves}} of salt in the mines range from 82 million tons to 600 million tons. In raw form it contains negligible amounts of Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sulphates and moisture, with Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Lead as trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Himalayan salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent. In {{the early years of}} British rule, the Khewra mine produced about 28,000 to 30,000 tons per annum; it increased to about 187,400 tons per annum for the five fiscal years ending 1946–7 and to 136,824 tons for the two years ending 1949–50 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth. The mine's output was reported in 2003 to be 385,000 tons of salt per annum, which amounts to almost half of Pakistan's total production of rock salt. At that rate <b>of</b> <b>output,</b> the tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not only}} {{receptive}} fields that define the microzone structure: The climbing fiber input from the inferior olivary nucleus is equally important. The branches of a climbing fiber (usually numbering about 10) usually activate Purkinje cells belonging to the same microzone. Moreover, olivary neurons that send climbing fibers to the same microzone tend to be coupled by gap junctions, which synchronize their activity, causing Purkinje cells within a microzone to show correlated complex spike activity on a millisecond time scale. Also, the Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone all send their axons to the same small cluster <b>of</b> <b>output</b> cells within the deep cerebellar nuclei. Finally, the axons of basket cells are much longer in the longitudinal direction than in the mediolateral direction, causing them to be confined largely to a single microzone. The consequence of all this structure is that cellular interactions within a microzone are much stronger than interactions between different microzones.|$|E

5|$|The deep nuclei of the {{cerebellum}} are {{clusters of}} gray matter lying {{within the white}} matter {{at the core of}} the cerebellum. They are, with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei, the sole sources <b>of</b> <b>output</b> from the cerebellum. These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. The four nuclei (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex. (The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals is much larger than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei—its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead.|$|E
