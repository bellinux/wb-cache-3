25|$|On Sundays, {{at each of}} the Great Feasts of the Lord—from the day of {{the feast}} until its apodosis (leavetaking)--on each day of Holy Week, and {{throughout}} Bright Week there are special phrases which are added {{at the beginning of the}} dismissals. These are used at both the Lesser and the Greater Dismissals, and are inserted before the words: Christ <b>our</b> <b>true</b> God....|$|E

60|$|Let {{each and}} every one of us, my friends, imitate David's loyalty, and be <b>true</b> to <b>our</b> duty, <b>true</b> to <b>our</b> masters, <b>true</b> to <b>our</b> country and <b>true</b> to <b>our</b> queen, through {{whatever}} trials and temptations. Above all, let us learn from David to obey; and remember that to obey we need not become cringing and slavish, or give up independence and high spirit. David did neither. Unless you learn to obey, as David did, you will never learn to rule. Imitate David--and so you will imitate David's greater son, even our Lord Jesus Christ. For herein David is a type of Christ.|$|R
25|$|Other Zen-teachers {{have also}} {{expressed}} sudden insight followed by gradual cultivation. Jinul, a 12th-century Korean Seon master, followed Zongmi, and also emphasized that insight into <b>our</b> <b>true</b> nature is sudden, but {{is to be}} followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full buddhahood. This is also the standpoint of the contemporary Sanbo Kyodan, according to whom kenshō is {{at the start of the}} path to full enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|May Christ <b>our</b> <b>true</b> God, {{through the}} intercessions of His most pure Mother; of the holy, glorious and all-praised apostles, * of (the {{patron saint of}} the church or monastery), of (the saint whose feast day it is), of the holy and righteous {{ancestors}} of God, Joachim and Anna; {{and of all the}} saints, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and the Lover of mankind.|$|E
25|$|<b>Our</b> <b>true</b> {{academic}} mission — to liberally educate {{each and}} every student — is a timeless reminder of the lives we change here at Wabash College, one young man at a time. For while the problems facing higher education and the world are complex, the solutions need not be. Amidst the jostle and the fray and the haranguing static and noise that often surround our academic endeavor, stands our foundation: the simple gifts of the liberal arts. These profound gifts — the ability to act, to see, and to speak — are the bedrock that underpin teaching and learning at Wabash College.|$|E

25|$|Prophet {{grew up in}} a {{home that}} was mainly non-religious except for major holidays. Her father was Lutheran, her mother Catholic. Yet it was her mother's {{interests}} in Theosophy, the I AM Activity, and Christian Science that had the most influence on Elizabeth. In Theosophy and the I AM Activity she heard about the Ascended Masters, Karma, and Reincarnation; in Christian Science she was told that matter was not the only reality and that the spirit part of us made in the image of God was <b>our</b> <b>true</b> nature. Prophet stayed with Christian Science until she met Mark Prophet at the age of 22.|$|E
500|$|As {{the sacred}} texts of ancient Hindu and Buddhist {{philosophy}} became available in German translations in the 18th and 19th centuries, they influenced philosophers such as Schopenhauer {{to hold that}} in a healthy mind only deeds oppress our conscience, not wishes and thoughts; [...] "for it is only our deeds that hold us up to the mirror of our will"; the good conscience, thought Schopenhauer, we experience after every disinterested deed arises from direct recognition of our own inner being in the phenomenon of another, it affords us the verification [...] "that <b>our</b> <b>true</b> self exists not only in our own person, this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives. By this the heart feels itself enlarged, as by egotism it is contracted." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bama Boyz almost {{intentionally}} {{left the}} instrumental for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] out, since {{they thought that}} the song did not sound like the tracks Beyoncé was recording for her upcoming album, at that particular time. However, Jesse Rankins explained that they later decided to put the instrumental for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] in the email because they knew that Solange likes weird records, but, they made sure to send it last. Out of all the mainstream-inspired attempts The Bama Boyz sent to Solange, she eventually chose that last and most unexpected track and penned [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". Jonathan Wells commented: [...] "When they heard Solange's demo, we were excited because that track was more <b>our</b> <b>true</b> sound {{than any of the}} others , but we still kinda didn't believe Beyoncé would cut it...but we hoped!" ...|$|E

500|$|Gibson {{said she}} took a moment before agreeing, as she had just wrapped up work on Gaga's Monster Ball HBO special {{but she could not}} resist in the end. [...] "It's a phenomenal video: really powerful, really impactful. She's such a strong, {{committed}} artist. Her loyalty to me is something I will be forever grateful for. We're spiritually connected. We need each other ... and 'Judas' is ultimately a representation of <b>our</b> <b>true</b> bond," [...] she added. With The Hollywood Reporter, Gibson explained that within the video they created a new Jerusalem. The shock value in the video was purposefully added, but ultimately the story was about oppression; and about following one's heart and the glory of being free. With NME magazine Gaga revealed that the video involved motorbikes and a death sequence. She also described the portrayal of her character as being [...] "beyond repentance", which evolved from the continuous media accusations towards her that [...] " [...] trashy. or pretentious or this and that. [...] is my way of saying 'I've crossed the line, I won't even try to repent. Nor should I'." [...] Forgiveness and destiny also played a part in the video, and Gaga wanted to portray a Federico Fellini-esque story with apostles being revolutionaries in a modern-day Jerusalem. They are led to Jesus, by Gaga as Magdalene. Although initially reported to be premiered during an episode of the tenth season of American Idol, the music video premiered on May 5, 2011, on E! News at 7 pm.|$|E
500|$|Fight Club {{examines}} Generation X angst as '"the middle {{children of}} history". [...] Norton said, Fight Club examines the value conflicts of Generation X, {{as the first}} generation raised on television [...] "having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture", including values such as one could achieve [...] "spiritual happiness through home furnishing", later {{to wake up to}} the emptiness of this [...] "received value system." [...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so {{for the first time we}} can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with <b>our</b> <b>true</b> feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many, like {{journalist}} Marisa Meltzer, {{have argued}} this contemporary standard of beauty {{to be described}} as anorexic thinness, an unhealthy idea that is not representative of a natural human body: [...] "Never before has the ‘perfect’ body been at such odds with <b>our</b> <b>true</b> size." ...|$|E

2500|$|The early Buddha-nature {{concept as}} {{expressed}} in the seminal 'tathagatagarbha sutra' named the Nirvana Sutra is, according to Kevin Trainor, as follows: [...] "Sentient beings are said to possess a sacred nature that {{is the basis for}} them becoming buddhas [...] this buddha-nature is in fact <b>our</b> <b>true</b> nature [...] universal and completely unsullied by whatever psychological and karmic state an individual may be in." ...|$|E
