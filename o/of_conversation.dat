5|$|During {{his final}} years, Narayan, ever fond <b>of</b> <b>conversation,</b> would spend almost every evening with N.

The apathy towards interviews {{was the result of}} an interview with Time, after which Narayan had to spend a few days in the hospital, as he was dragged around the city to take photographs that were never used in the article.|$|E
5|$|Goffman {{uses the}} metaphor <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> being a stage play. A plays tone will shift {{throughout}} the performance {{due to the}} actions taken by the actors; {{this is similar to}} how a discussion is keyed – based on what either person says or does over the course of an interaction, the key will change accordingly. The parallels go further, though. Goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information. They invite the listener to empathize and, as was explained above, they’re often not meant to be stirred to take action, but rather to show appreciation; during a play this generally takes the form of applause.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the link between talk and action in interorganizational collaboration. We {{integrate}} research on the micro-dynamics <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> with narrative theory to focus on both conversational activity – the who, where, and when <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> – and the narratives and stories produced – the what <b>of</b> <b>conversations.</b> We argue that the activity and content <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> discursively produce identities, skills and emotions which, in turn, enable and constrain action. We then apply this model to {{a case study of}} interorganizational collaboration...|$|R

5|$|In May 2007, U.S. diplomats {{spoke with}} the TFG's Ambassador to Ethiopia. Among the topics <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> were Somali {{security}} forces, and Ambassador Abdulkarim Farah said that the TFG had trained nearly 7,000 militia in Baledogle who were now patrolling throughout Somalia, from Kismayo to Puntland. Another 3,500 militia were undergoing training. Farah said that on May 18 he planned to his hometown of Beledweyne to establish a militia training camp there, at the instruction of President Yusuf. Farah estimated that approximately 60 per cent of the militia were Darod, 30 per cent were Hawiye, and the remaining 10 per cent were from other clans; the majority of security forces in Mogadishu were Darod. He said that the TFG had not sought to exclude Darod from the militia, and attributed the imbalance to Hawiye having primarily supported the Council of Islamic Courts (CIC).|$|E
5|$|Late on 28 November 1980, {{the night}} before the team's {{departure}} for Italy, goalkeeper Józef Młynarczyk and forward Włodzimierz Smolarek, both of Widzew Łódź, left the team hotel in Warsaw, the Hotel Vera, without permission. According to Smolarek they did this to get some dinner because they did not like the food at the hotel. They met a friend of Młynarczyk's, sports journalist Wojciech Zieliński, at the Adria nightclub. According to Andrzej Iwan, another member of the team, the main topic <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> was Zieliński's estranged wife, who had been caught prostituting herself around Warsaw, and had since moved to Italy. Several Poland players knew her, and Młynarczyk had just been to Italy to play for Widzew Łódź against Juventus. According to Iwan, the journalist encouraged Młynarczyk to drink as they talked, hoping the goalkeeper might have news of her. Smolarek left the club around 02:00, but Młynarczyk and Zieliński stayed until about three hours later.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates dynamic {{semantics}} <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> {{from the}} point of view of semantical closedness, presuppositions and shared belief/common knowledge updates, by analyzing the meta-expression "what do you mean (by X) ?" into three major usages: semantic repair initiation, intentional repair initiation, and inferential repair initiation, since these three usages are deeply related with three types of semantical closedness: closedness of denotations, closedness of intention and closedness <b>of</b> inference <b>of</b> <b>conversations.</b> As a result, the proposed dynamic semantics <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> is semantically closed in terms of shared beliefs of the conversants...|$|R

5|$|Sam & Max Save the World is a 3D graphic {{adventure}} game {{in which}} the player controls the character of Sam. The player has Sam explore the environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Depending on the type of in-game entity a player selects using the cursor, the player can have Sam walk around an area, look at and comment on objects, pick up certain items or otherwise try to use them. Sam may also engage in conversation with non-player characters; when this occurs, the game presents a dialog tree with several subjects to pick from. Topics <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> may directly involve the story or provide assistance with the game's puzzles, while others may be entirely unconnected. In some cases, the player may be able to choose dialog for Max to speak as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{impending}} {{dinner with}} Mr. Burns divides the Simpson household. Homer pragmatically supports Mr. Burns, while Marge and Lisa oppose him. Before the dinner arrives, Mr. Burns's advisers prepare {{the family for}} the event, even giving them pre-written questions to ask in lieu <b>of</b> <b>conversation.</b> Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all, but Marge tells her not to worry. To everyone's surprise, Marge serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns tries {{to act as if}} it does not bother him, but is not able to keep from spitting it out. The cameras flash as the bite flies through the air, {{and by the time the}} chunk hits the floor the press is gone and his governatorial campaign dissolves. Bailey wins the election and, despite Mr. Burns saying that Homer's dreams will be unfulfilled for as long as he is alive, the Simpson family happily get together again.|$|E
5|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the 2011 Orange Bowl focused on {{the manner in which the}} two teams involved had reversed their fortunes during the 2010 college football season. Stanford had its longest winning streak since 1991 its most wins in history, and was four years removed from a one-win season, while Virginia Tech became the first team in college football history to win 11 consecutive games in a season after losing its first two. The two teams had never played each other, but they shared a common 2010 opponent, Wake Forest. Before the Orange Bowl, Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said he didn't see much difference in quality. Another point <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> was the poor performance of the ACC in nonconference games and Virginia Tech's poor past performance against teams ranked in the top 5. The Hokies had won just one of 27 games against teams in that category. Partially because of this factor, spread bettors favored Stanford by three points when the first odds were released December 10, a margin that various organizations either kept constant or raised to 3.5 points by the day of the game. It was the first time all season the Hokies were point spread underdogs.|$|E

40|$|The current paper {{examines}} {{younger and}} older adults’ cognitive representations <b>of</b> intergenerational <b>conversations.</b> In interviews, {{younger and older}} adults were asked to imagine various types <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> with older and younger targets. They were prompted to provide {{a wide variety of}} information about the targets and the conversations. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed to uncover types <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> commonly reported. Through a combination of coding and hierarchical cluster analysis, a hierarchical arrangement <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> emerged in younger and older adults’ descriptions. Each of the types is described in detail. In a second study, exemplars of each type were sorted by younger and older adults and subjected to multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis. The results supported the validity of the types from Study 1, and suggested dimensions underlying this arrangement (positive-negative and helping–not helping for the younger adults; positive-negative and high-low change orientation for the older adults). The findings are discussed in terms of the communication predicament of aging model, and the role that these representations <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> may play in future research. It is argued that knowledge of these cognitive representations of communication provides a new perspective on the ways in which intergenerational interactions may progress...|$|R
