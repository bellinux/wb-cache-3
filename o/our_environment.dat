5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about <b>our</b> <b>environment</b> in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E

25|$|Richard Dawkins {{outlines}} in The Selfish Gene (1976) {{that humans}} are machines made of genes and genes are the grounding for everything we do. The gene-centric view outlines that natural selection, evolution and all behaviour must {{be traced back to}} the survival of competing genes as an extension of Darwin’s theory being the survival of competing individuals. The main goal of individuals, coming from the instinct of our genes, is to reproduce and thrive, where thriving involves protection, conquering competition and future growth. Therefore, everything that we do relates to thriving in <b>our</b> <b>environment</b> above competition, including the way we consume as a form of survival in <b>our</b> <b>environment</b> when simply purchasing the basic physiological needs of food, water and warmth. We also consume to thrive above others, for example in conspicuous consumption where a luxury car represents money and high social status and the application of makeup makes the person and their genes seem more attractive and worthy of passing to offspring.|$|E

25|$|The {{auditory}} {{findings are}} further concretized by research on shadowing tasks (Cherry, 1966). These tasks involve two distinct auditory messages presented simultaneously to both ears. One message {{in one ear}} {{is supposed to be}} shadowed (repeated) while the other message in the other ear is supposed to be ignored. Participants generally perform well at repeating familiar messages in the attended channel. However, when there was a significant change in frequency in the message in the unattended channel, it was detected; moreover, when their names were presented in the unattended channel, they noticed that as well. These shadowing tasks reinforce the idea that the gap between knowledge and experience is explained by our innate perceptual capacities that enhance our experience and optimize our knowledge gained from <b>our</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{least some}} of our {{behaviour}} must be influenced by our genes because behaviour depends on the interaction of molecules and neurons in the brain. These interactions {{are a result of}} our genes code, however the influence on behaviour cannot go much further than this. Dawkins likened genes to a computer. They have been pre-programmed to build cells, develop cells and make them work together. Like a computer, the hardware is set in stone, but the software can change how they work, just like <b>our</b> <b>environment.</b> Genes indirectly influence our behaviour as the nervous system and our brain is the intermediary in the transaction decision because it reasons and processes all of the gene instructions into one decision, movement or behaviour. The way our neurons connect is dependent on the environment, learning and experience. This introduces the nurture side of the nature nurture debate.|$|E

The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 20000 cubics of liquid waste daily. (Stanko, 2013) The daily life of local people is significantly affected as Buriganga River is their source of bathing, irrigation and transportation. Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time. Air is being highly polluted in such area because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops is also an environmental issue as it is not only causing harm to the human right of labour but also their living environment.|$|E

[...] "Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset." [...] Her definition is similar to the French thinker Jacques Ellul's concept of technique. Like Ellul, Franklin asserts that technological methods dominate the modern world. [...] "Technology has built the house in which we all live," [...] she writes, [...] "today there is hardly any human activity that does not occur within this house." [...] As such, {{technology is}} a central element of the here and now. [...] "In the broadest sense of the term, the here and now is <b>our</b> <b>environment,</b> that is, all that is around us—the ever-changing overlay of nature, the built environment, the institutional and social structures within which human activities take place, as well as the activities themselves—'the way things are done around here.'" [...] Franklin sees her studies of technology as an attempt to understand how technological practices affect the advancement of justice and peace.|$|E
500|$|Miss Freda Whitlam (born 1920), {{sister of}} Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was {{principal}} between 1958 and 1976. It {{was a period}} of great social transition.

[...] Technology is taking the drudgery out of our lives and opening up exciting opportunities for those who have a good general education and are willing to think positively and creatively. [...] Here we help the girls with this aim in view.' In 1970, after the Rev. Bill McLeod spoke to some of the seniors and advised those intending to become a nurse or a teacher to learn Greek or Italian (to aid communication with immigrants), Miss Whitlam took up the suggestion: 'We have people with time to do something after the exams {{at the end of each}} year - let's organise Greek classes for them'. In March 1972 the school also produced a newsletter ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ ΝΕΑ providing background on Greek culture and language and a bibliography of relevant books in the school library.|$|E
