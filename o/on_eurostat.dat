It also examines the discrepancy between the accountancy in the public sector, based on the cash flow principle (cash basis) and the Accrual Based principle applied in the process of budgetary surveillance in the EU (ESA 95, 2011). The emphasis is laid on the strong dependency of the statistical information at the European level {{on the quality of the}} accounting and information basis of public finances and <b>on</b> <b>Eurostat’s</b> willingness to create a system of harmonized accounting standards, based on the Accrual Based accounting, which are in compliance with ÅSA and applicable to all agents in the State Management sector.

The conclusion is reached that IPSAS are an indisputable staring point to develop harmonized reports in the EU public sector.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} inflation in EU member countries {{during the crisis}} period of 2008 - 2013. The aim is to analyze inflation trends in the EU {{in the context of}} current economic crisis and monetary regimes. The first theoretical chapter summarizes theoretical basis, types, causes and consequences of inflation, methods of measurement and principles of the inflation targeting regime. The second chapter examines development of inflation during this period based <b>on</b> <b>Eurostat's</b> data about consumer prices measured by harmonized indices of consumer prices. This paper does not analyze each of twenty seven member countries. Rather, according to monetary policy regimes are countries divided into groups, from which individual countries are selected for detailed analyses. The third and final chapter analyzes the context, causes and consequences of inflation trends in the European Union. Inflation trends are analyzed on the basis of data presented in the second chapter in the context of monetary policy regimes, and specific decisions of central banks in response to economic and financial crisis, expressed by macroeconomic indicators. Methods of description, analysis and comparison are used. Due to the topicality of the issues analysed, the bibliography cites mainly electronic sources such as statistical databases and information provided by central banks.

40|$|The {{economic}} performance of city-regions is {{closely linked to}} the performance of the national economy. However, the performance of the national economy can also depend on the performance of one or more major city-regions, that act as growth poles. Because of their sectoral structure and other characteristics, some cities are better equipped to become growth poles than others. This paper studies 46 major city-regions across Europe. The sectoral structure and changes in the sectoral structure of city-regions are studied using data from CE’s European Regional Database, itself based <b>on</b> <b>Eurostat’s</b> Regio database. The data analysis attempts to explain city-region performance by drawing parallels between sectoral structure and {{economic performance}}. The data analysis is supplemented by local anecdotal evidence provided by CE’s annual European reporting system ‘European Regional Prospects’, for example the historical importance of river and seafront activities. The paper goes on to discuss {{the extent to which the}} sectoral structure of cities can explain why some city-regions grow faster than others. The data analysis will be used to group cities in ‘hard’ typologies according to sectoral specialisation. These sectoral typologies are then compared with typologies according to the local, ‘softer’, evidence provided by CE’s regional consultants. This evidence will also be used to draw out the more subtle influences on city-region growth and these will be used to group cities in ‘soft’ typologies. ...|$|R
