25|$|The Hispanic population, {{particularly}} the large Mexican American {{population in the}} Southwest and the large Puerto Rican and Dominican populations in the Northeast, have been strong supporters of the Democratic Party. In the 1996 presidential election, Democratic President Bill Clinton received 72% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hispanic</b> vote. In following years, however, the Republican Party gained increasing support from the Hispanic community, especially among Hispanic Protestants and Pentecostals. With his much more liberal views on immigration, President Bush was the first Republican president to gain 40% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hispanic</b> vote (he did so in the 2004 presidential election). Yet the Republican Party's support among Hispanics eroded in the 2006 midterm elections, dropping from 44% to 30%, with the Democrats gaining in the Hispanic vote from 55% in 2004 to 69% in 2006. Democrats increased their share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hispanic</b> vote in the 2008 presidential election, with Barack Obama receiving 67%.
