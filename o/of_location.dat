5|$|Despite {{being set}} in Yorkshire, the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>location</b> filming {{was moved to}} Buckinghamshire, although Levisham railway station {{and the surrounding area}} in North Yorkshire were used. The location shooting of the film began on 18 August 1986, at St. Mary's church in Radnage. Filming was periodically hindered by inclement weather – the perfect summer in which the book was set was not forthcoming, and scenes were filmed during breaks in heavy rain. Interiors were shot at Bray Studios in Berkshire.|$|E

5|$|Other {{methods for}} elucidating the {{cellular}} location of proteins requires {{the use of}} known compartmental markers for regions such as the ER, the Golgi, lysosomes or vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membrane, etc. With the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers, it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest. For example, indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration <b>of</b> <b>location.</b> Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} October 1988, {{in and around}} Los Angeles, California. Shortly before the beginning <b>of</b> <b>location</b> shooting, Hollywood union truck drivers or teamsters went on strike to protest pay cuts and overtime changes. With deadlines looming, the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that the Teamsters might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks exploded in the studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to Yosemite National Park {{under cover of darkness}} with a police escort.|$|E

5|$|Agreeing to fund {{half of the}} {{proposed}} £1million budget, the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers became partners in the film's production. Elder brother Sir Run Run Shaw is credited as the presenter of Inseminoid in the opening titles. With a production staff of 75, principal photography commenced on 12 May 1980. John Metcalfe, camera operator for Satan's Slave and Terror, {{assumed the role of}} cinematographer. His former role fell to the less experienced Dick Pope. Three weeks <b>of</b> <b>location</b> filming at the Chislehurst Caves in Kent preceded a one-week indoor session at Lee International Studios at Wembley Park in London. The second unit completed special effects and linking shots in a fifth week, based at Film House in Wardour Street. To simulate the desolate landscape of the alien planet in long shots, the production team departed for the island of Gozo off Malta for a final shoot of two days, capitalising on the strong Mediterranean sun to produce good lighting.|$|E
5|$|Barry Took, who had {{produced}} {{a series of}} ultimately unsuccessful documentaries for the BBC about working men's clubs, was partially responsible for the choice <b>of</b> <b>location</b> for the exterior shots. The programme which drew the highest ratings of the series focused on Burnlee Working Men's Club, a club in the small West Yorkshire town of Holmfirth and Took saw Holmfirth's potential as the backdrop of a television show. Took's idea was passed to James Gilbert and Roy Clarke via Duncan Wood, who {{was at that time}} filming Comedy Playhouse. Gilbert and Clarke then travelled to Holmfirth and decided to use it as the setting for the pilot of Last of the Summer Wine.|$|E

5|$|Female-female {{aggression}}, {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing {{one out of}} the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance <b>of</b> <b>location.</b> At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the empty cenotaph, another new form of memorial, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, used the idea of burying one of the unidentified bodies from the war as a symbolic memorial {{to all of the}} lost soldiers. This idea had begun to emerge {{towards the end of the}} war, and was actively promoted by some British veterans' groups in 1919. Initially, however, it failed to gain traction with the government because of the success of the Whitehall Cenotaph, and a second memorial was felt to be unnecessary. Finally, in 1920, following lobbying by British cleric David Railton, Britain and France both decided to create a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, choosing an unknown body and creating a special memorial around it; the tombs were inaugurated on Armistice Day. The choice <b>of</b> <b>location</b> for the French tomb proved controversial, however, and it was not finalised until the following year, when the body was laid to rest under the Arc de Triumph. The concept proved popular, and encouraged similar memorials in other countries.|$|E
5|$|Italian neorealism of the 1940s, {{with its}} {{emphasis}} on quasi-documentary authenticity, was an acknowledged influence on trends that emerged in American noir. The Lost Weekend (1945), directed by Billy Wilder, another Vienna-born, Berlin-trained American auteur, tells the story of an alcoholic in a manner evocative of neorealism. It also exemplifies the problem of classification: one of the first American films to be described as a film noir, it has largely disappeared from considerations of the field. Director Jules Dassin of The Naked City (1948) pointed to the neorealists as inspiring his use <b>of</b> <b>location</b> photography with non-professional extras. This semidocumentary approach characterized a substantial number of noirs in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Along with neorealism, the style had an American precedent cited by Dassin, in director Henry Hathaway's The House on 92nd Street (1945), which demonstrated the parallel influence of the cinematic newsreel.|$|E

5|$|Paramount Pictures {{commissioned}} the film after the positive critical and commercial reaction to The Wrath of Khan. Nimoy directed the film, {{becoming the first}} Star Trek cast member to do so. Producer Harve Bennett wrote the script starting from the end and working back, and intended {{the destruction of the}} Enterprise to be a shocking development. Bennett and Nimoy collaborated with effects house Industrial Light & Magic to develop storyboards and new ship designs; ILM also handled the film's many special effects sequences. Aside from a single day <b>of</b> <b>location</b> shooting, all of the film's scenes were shot on Paramount and ILM soundstages. Composer James Horner returned to expand his themes from the previous film.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, on 21 October 1968, with the first scene shot being an aerial view of Bond climbing the stairs of Blofeld's mountain retreat. The scenes were shot atop the now-famous revolving restaurant Piz Gloria, located atop the Schilthorn {{near the village of}} Mürren. The location was found by production manager Hubert Fröhlich after three weeks <b>of</b> <b>location</b> scouting in France and Switzerland. The Swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule. In March 1969 production moved to England, with London's Pinewood Studios being used for interior shooting, and M's house being shot in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In April the filmmakers went to Portugal, where principal photography wrapped in May. Filming finished on 23 June, two months later than planned, which was largely due to the warm Swiss winter, which had hampered shooting.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 16, 1988, in the Tabernas Desert in Spain's Almería province. Spielberg originally had planned the chase to {{be a short}} sequence shot over two days, but he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action-packed centerpiece. Thinking he would not surpass the truck chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark (because the truck was much faster than the tank), he felt this sequence should be more story-based and needed to show Indiana and Henry helping each other. He later said he had more fun storyboarding the sequence than filming it. The second unit had begun filming two weeks before. After approximately ten days, the production moved to Bellas Artes to film the scenes set in the Sultan of Hatay's palace. Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park {{was used for the}} road, tunnel and beach sequence in which birds strike the plane. The Spanish portion <b>of</b> <b>location</b> filming finished on June 2, 1988, in Guadix, Granada, with filming of Brody's capture at İskenderun train station. The filmmakers built a mosque near the station for atmosphere, rather than adding it as a visual effect.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} Gregory's main motivation was {{to increase the}} number of Christians; others wonder if more political matters such as extending the primacy of the papacy to additional provinces and the recruitment of new Christians looking to Rome for leadership were also involved. Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under Æthelberht could have had some bearing on the choice <b>of</b> <b>location.</b> Also, the mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards. At the time of the mission Britain was the only part of the former Roman Empire which remained in pagan hands and the historian Eric John argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.|$|E
5|$|The call to open {{a college}} in West Texas began shortly after {{settlers}} arrived {{in the area in}} the 1880s.
