25|$|The Supreme Soviet {{was elected}} on 18 March 1990; {{it was the}} first {{election}} in Soviet Latvia in which multiple parties were allowed to participate. 201 deputies were elected. The declaration was adopted on 4 May 1990, in an <b>open</b> <b>vote,</b> a majority of two thirds — 132 votes — was required, 138 deputies voted for adoption of the declaration, 1 abstained, while others did not participate in the vote and therefore there were no votes against the declaration.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of TDs quickly grew disillusioned with Haughey's {{leadership}} and threw their support behind O'Malley {{in an effort to}} oust the incumbent leader. On 1 October 1982, a challenge to Haughey was initiated by the Kildare TD, Charlie McCreevy. O'Malley was on holiday in Spain at the time but rushed back to put his own name forward as a possible alternative to Haughey. He and his supporters resigned from the Cabinet. Haughey won an <b>open</b> <b>vote</b> by 58 votes to 22, with the result that those TDs who voted against Haughey, including O'Malley, became known as the Gang of 22.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of a Student Union is rather simple and comprises two bodies: The General Assembly and the Board of Directors. The General Assembly consists of all student-members of the Union. It takes place {{on a regular basis}} and is the only decision-making body. During the General Assembly, many topics of student interest are discussed and the decisions are taken after <b>open</b> <b>vote.</b> The Board of Directors makes sure that the decisions of the General Assembly will be materialized. Moreover, the members of the Board of Directors, among which is the Union's President, participate in various university administrative bodies as representatives of all students in the Union.|$|E
40|$|The {{secret ballot}} is {{considered}} a central feature of {{free and fair elections}} all over the world. While the reasons to uphold it seem to be overwhelming, we argue that the secret ballot is only second-best at best and that a modified version of <b>open</b> <b>voting</b> might prove to be more democratic. Instead of denying the various problems and difficulties that an open system might encounter, we want to offer a genuine proposal that can avoid these numerous pitfalls. After rehearsing the various arguments pro and contra <b>open</b> <b>voting,</b> we draw attention to the role of shame, which has been neglected by both sides in the debate. While shame plays a pivotal role in the democratic argument pro <b>open</b> <b>voting,</b> it also brings out new problems that tell against opening up the vote. This means that, if we want to draw on the democratic potential of <b>open</b> <b>voting,</b> we will have to find a system that minimizes the undesirable effects of shame. In the third and final section, we will formulate a concrete proposal of <b>open</b> <b>voting</b> that we believe is more democratic than the current secret ballot and is able to avoid potential worries. Even if this proves to be highly speculative, it serves as an invitation for further empirical research. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Parliamentary voting {{began on}} 9 January, {{with the first}} round of voting being {{completed}} on 15 January. Opposition politicians criticised the rushed way in which the votes were conducted, with four to five votes taking place in a day with no adjournments. The votes were marred by numerous irregularities, with CHP Members of Parliament filming AKP MPs openly casting their vote or intimidating uncertain MPs to vote 'Yes'. The Minister of Health, Recep Akdağ, was filmed casting an <b>open</b> <b>vote,</b> which is disallowed by the constitution, and openly admitting that he had committed a crime afterwards. AKP MPs responded to attempts to film them with hostility, with fights occasionally breaking out between government and opposition MPs. CHP MP Fatma Kaplan Hürriyet was allegedly strangled by AKP Parliamentary Group Leader Mustafa Elitaş after she filmed Elitaş and Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım casting open votes. Several MPs were hospitalised, while the podium where MPs rose to make speeches was dislocated with one of its €15,000 microphones being reported as missing. The second round of voting was completed on 20 January, with all of the proposed amendments being approved. A final motion to enact the approved amendments was approved by 339 votes, surpassing the 330-vote threshold to hold a referendum but falling short of the 367-vote threshold needed to enact the amendments directly.|$|E
25|$|On 18 February 1959, the Constitution Preparation Committee {{decided the}} 1959 plenary {{session of the}} Assembly would begin on 29 April 1959 (subsequently brought forward a week) and would discuss {{the form of the}} state and government, the {{preamble}} to the constitution and the broad outlines of state policy. However, the following day, the cabinet decided to implement Sukarno's concept of Guided Democracy under the 1945 Constitution. Army Chief of Staff General Abdul Haris Nasution had first proposed a return to Indonesia's original constitution in August 1958. Although the PNI agreed to his proposal in early 1959, the NU leadership only did in the face of threats that pending corruption charges against party leaders would be taken to court, although the party membership was not consulted. The PKI followed suit once it realized the restoration of the constitution was inevitable. However Masjumi members were strongly opposed because of the potential to turn the nation into a dictatorship, as it would be very easy for the president to abuse his power. There were also calls for the human rights clauses agreed by the assembly {{to be included in the}} 1945 Constitution. Prime Minister Djuanda admitted there were shortcomings in the Constitution, but said that it could be amended at a later date. Meanwhile, the Army organized demonstrations in favor of the return to the 1945 Constitution. Sukarno left the country on a tour on 23 April, with the government confident of a two-thirds majority on the Assembly - sufficient to reintroduce the 1945 Constitution. However, the debate in the Assembly turned away from constitutional issues into the question of Islam, splitting the membership. The government tried to pressure the NU, but on 23 May, the proposal to include the Jakarta Charter was defeated in a plenary session of the Assembly and the NU turned against a return to the 1945 Constitution. At the first vote on 30 May, despite it being open to put pressure on NU members to follow the leadership's line, the vote was 269 in favor and 199 against - short of the two-thirds necessary. A secret ballot, allowing the NU members to change their votes without it being known, was held on 1 June, but also failed, as did a final <b>open</b> <b>vote</b> on 2 June, with just 56% in favor. The next day, 3 June 1959, the Assembly went into recess, never to meet again.|$|E

40|$|When {{committees}} make decisions, {{the voting}} rule that determines {{the outcome is}} coupled with one of three information-disclosure rules: <b>open</b> <b>voting,</b> in which each committee member’s individual vote is revealed; anonymous voting, in which only an anonymized tally is publicized; and secret voting, in which only the outcome is disclosed. I focus on strategic voters who care about maintaining {{the privacy of their}} vote, and show that, despite these privacy concerns, the amount of information disclosed has a non-monotonic effect on both the accuracy of the decision and the welfare of the voters. In particular, the first-best accuracy is often attained at the extremes—in <b>open</b> <b>voting,</b> when all information is disclosed, and in secret voting, when no information is disclosed—but is not attained in anonymous voting, when some but not all information is disclosed. Furthermore, while welfare is always minimal in <b>open</b> <b>voting,</b> it is sometimes maximal in anonymous rather than secret voting. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{deadline}} {{to approve the}} plan by the State Assembly was April 7, 2008, {{for the city to}} be eligible to receive US$354 million in federal assistance for traffic congestion relief and mass transit improvements. On April 7, 2008, after a closed-door meeting, the Democratic Conference of the State Assembly decided not to vote on the proposal, [...] "...the opposition was so overwhelming,...that he would not hold an <b>open</b> <b>vote</b> of the full Assembly," [...] Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker said. Afterwards, the USDOT announced that they will seek to allocate those funds to relief traffic congestion in other cities.

2500|$|The {{political}} crisis of 1458 {{was the first}} serious challenge to the Medici rule. The cost of wars had been borne by the great families of Florence, and disproportionately so by Medici's opponents. A number of them (Serragli, Baroncelli, Mancini, Vespucci, Gianni) were practically ruined and had to sell their properties, and those were acquired by Medici's partisans at bargain prices. The opposition used partial relaxation of Medici control of the republic institutions to demand political reforms, freedom of speech in the councils and a greater share in the decision-making. [...] Medici's party response was to use threats of force from private armies and Milanese troops and arranging a popular assembly dominated by Cosimo's supporters. It exiled the opponents of the regime and introduced the <b>open</b> <b>vote</b> in councils, ``in order to unmask the anti-Medician rebels".|$|E

60|$|Though the {{abstract}} reasoning might be unanswerable, the concrete case {{the other way}} was irresistible. Experience showed that without secrecy in its exercise the suffrage was not free. The farmer was afraid of his landlord, and the labourer {{was afraid of the}} farmer; the employer could tighten the screw on the workman, the shopkeeper feared the power of his best customers, the debtor quailed before his creditor, the priest wielded thunderbolts over the faithful. Not only was the <b>open</b> <b>vote</b> not free; it exposed its possessor to so much bullying, molestation, and persecution, that his possession came to be less of a boon than a nuisance.|$|E
6000|$|In {{about two}} years Norway was all gone over with a rough harrow of conversion. Heathenism at least {{constrained}} to be silent and outwardly conformable. Tryggveson, next {{turned his attention to}} Iceland, sent one Thangbrand, priest from Saxony, of wonderful qualities, military as well as theological, to try and convert Iceland. Thangbrand made a few converts; for Olaf had already many estimable Iceland friends, whom he liked much, and was much liked by; and conversion was the ready road to his favor. Thangbrand, I find, lodged with Hall of Sida (familiar acquaintance of [...] "Burnt Njal," [...] whose Saga has its admirers among us even now). Thangbrand converted Hall and one or two other leading men; but in general he was reckoned quarrelsome and blusterous rather than eloquent and piously convincing. Two skalds of repute made biting lampoons upon Thangbrand, whom Thangbrand, by two opportunities that offered, cut down and did to death because of their skaldic quality. Another he killed with his own hand, I know not for what reason. In brief, after about a year, Thangbrand returned to Norway and king Olaf; declaring the Icelanders to be a perverse, satirical, and inconvertible people, having himself, the record says, [...] "been the death of three men there." [...] King Olaf was in high rage at this result; but was persuaded by the Icelanders about him to try farther, and by a wilder instrument. He accordingly chose one Thormod, a pious, patient, and kindly man, who, within the next year or so, did actually accomplish the matter; namely, get Christianity, by <b>open</b> <b>vote,</b> declared at Thingvalla by the general Thing of Iceland there; the roar of a big thunder-clap at the right moment rather helping the conclusion, if I recollect. Whereupon Olaf's joy was no doubt great.|$|E
