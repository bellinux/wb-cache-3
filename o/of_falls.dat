Within the park, this type <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation.

5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E
40|$|Background. Fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> is {{a common}} and {{potentially}} modifiable health problem among older persons. However, relatively {{little is known about}} who develops fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> or why. Methods. From a representative cohort of community-living persons aged 72 years or older, we evaluated 313 women who had no fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> These participants underwent a comprehensive in-home assessment and were reassessed for fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> 1 year later. Fall events were ascertained monthly using a validated fall calendar. Results. 84 (27 %) participants developed fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> at 1 year and 77 (25 %) participants experienced at least one fall event. The predisposing factors for developing fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> included age 80 years or older (adjusted relative risk 1. 48; 95 % confidence intervals 1. 04 – 2. 12), visual impairment (1. 42; 1. 01 – 2. 00), a sedentary lifestyle (1. 96; 1. 35 – 2. 84), and no available emotional support (2. 64; 1. 57 – 4. 41). The occurrence <b>of</b> a subsequent <b>fall</b> event was also significantly associated with developing fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> (unadjusted relative risk 1. 70; 1. 18 – 2. 45), although this effect was observed only among participants who had at least one predisposing factor. Conclusions. Among community-living older women, fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> develops due to a combination of predisposing factors and subsequent fall events. Since many of the predisposing factors are related to fall risk, preventive efforts to reduce fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> may also decrease the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> FEAR <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> {{is a common}} and potentially disablingproblem among community-living older persons.

40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{identify}} the prevalence and {{risk factors for}} fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> among robust community-dwelling older people. Background: Different models including various risk factors emerged when previous studies attempted to explore the factors' multivariate associations with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Attempting to detect fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> by a single question in some previous studies {{may not have been}} sufficiently sensitive, particularly in a robust population. Although some studies used a validated instrument to detect participants' fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> their self-perceived efficacy in performing various activities was seldom reported. Information to provide an insight into the planning of well-targeted interventions to reduce fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> has been lacking. Design: A cross-sectional study of 445 robust community-dwelling older people aged ≥ 65. Methods: Besides their demographic and fall-related background, participants' fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> level was assessed using the Chinese Fall Efficacy Scale-International. Other instruments included the timed up and go test, the Chinese Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form, the Chinese Anxiety Disorder Scale, the Chinese Lubben Social Network Scale and the Chinese Personal Wellbeing Index, which were used to assess different variables that may be associated with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Results: <b>Of</b> the 64 · 73 % of participants who had fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> 65 · 63 % had no history <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> but still had fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> This result was higher than in most previous studies. Participants' main concerns were walking on slippery/uneven surfaces, in crowded places and up/down a slope. Multivariate analyses showed that being female, suffering from poor vision and arthritis, poor performance in the timed up and go test, expressing more depressive and anxiety symptoms and low self-perceived well-being are multiply associated with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Conclusion: Fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> is prevalent among robust community-dwelling older people regardless <b>of</b> their <b>fall</b> history.

Method: Using longitudinal data collected on 321 Chinese primary care patients 65 years of age and older, the authors investigated the reciprocal relationship between fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and depression and examined whether functional disability and social functioning mediated the link between fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and depression. Participants were recruited from three primary care units in Hong Kong. Subjects were assessed in Cantonese by two trained assessors with Minimum Data Set-Home Care twice over a period of one year. Results: Findings revealed that fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> at baseline significantly predicted depression at 12 month follow-up assessment after age, gender, marital status, education and depression at baseline were adjusted, but depression at baseline did not predict fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> at 12 months after fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> at baseline was adjusted. Moreover, social functioning mediated the impact <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> on depression.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the relationship between <b>falls</b> efficacy, perception <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> risk and fall prevention behavior in frail elderly. The data was collected from 300 elderly through the questionnaire. 1) the mean score <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> efficacy was 34. 3 ± 11. 5, perception <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> risk was 34. 3 ± 11. 5, and fall prevention behavior was 17. 7 ± 2. 75. 2) Fall efficacy was significantly different according to falls experience(t= 2. 905, p<. 05). Perception <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> risk was significantly different according to falls experience (t= 2. 704, p<. 05) and Fall prevention behavior was significantly different according to falls experience (t= 2. 706, p<. 05). 3) It showed the negative relation between fall efficacy and perception <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> risk. It showed the positive relation between falls efficacy and falls prevention behaviors, and falls prevention behaviors and perception <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> risk. According to this study, it showed relation between <b>fall</b> efficacy, perception <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> risk and falls prevention behaviors. Thus it is highly recommended to include reinforce of efficacy and perception <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> risk in an effectiv...|$|R
40|$|The {{aging process}} brings changes to one’s body balance and may trigger a fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> The aim <b>of</b> {{this study was}} to compare and verify {{correlation}} between different methods that assess body balance among elderly individuals who exercise, according to different levels <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> The sample was composed of 186 individuals (68. 28 ± 6. years) who exercise. Balance assessment used Timed Up and Go, Unipedal Stance, Sitting-Rising and Functional Reach tests. A question about fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> was applied {{in the form of an}} interview. Statistical analysis used Spearman and Kruskall Wallis correlation. In results, Timed Up and Go (7. 13 ± 1. 6 s), Unipedal Stance (20. 52 ± 9. 9 s), Sitting-Rising (12. 43 s± 3. 2 s) and Functional Reach (29. 51 ± 6. 5) showed significant correlation with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Individuals less afraid <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> showed better balance performance when compared to those not afraid <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> In conclusion, better balance performance can contribute to decreasing fear <b>of</b> <b>falling...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to cross-sectionally and {{longitudinally}} identify risk factors for <b>falls,</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> and falls efficacy in late-middle-aged African Americans. Design and Methods: We performed in-home assessments on a probability sample of 998 African Americans and conducted two annual follow-up interviews. Multiple logistic regression modeled the associations with falls (any fall or injurious fall) during 2 years prior to the baseline interview, and baseline fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and falls efficacy with 2 -year prospective risks for <b>falling</b> and fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Results: The most consistent association for all outcomes was depressive symp-toms. Age was associated with increased risk of prior and prospective falls. Lower-body functional limita-tions were associated with prior <b>falls,</b> baseline fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> and low falls efficacy, whereas low ability with one-leg stands prospectively predicted fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> The greatest prospective risk for incident falls was having had a prior fall (odds ratio = 2. 51), and the greatest prospective risk for fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> was having been afraid <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> at baseline (odds ratio= 8. 14). Implications: <b>Falls,</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> and low falls efficacy are important issues for late-middle-aged as well as older persons. Interventions should focus on younger adults and attend especially to lower-body function and depressive symptoms as well as building self-efficacy for safe exercise, dealing with falls risks, and managing falls themselves...|$|R
