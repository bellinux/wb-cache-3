5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by {{the front}} door of the house that appear to be human. Based on the weight distribution, however, the assailant evidently travels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> its feet rather than from heel to toe. Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house in order to get to Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E
5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} algebra of uniformly {{continuous}} holomorphic symmetric functions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> # p, investigating {{in particular the}} spectrum of such algebras. To do so, we examine the algebra of symmetric polynomials on # p - spaces as well as finitely generated symmetric algebras of holomorphic functions. Such symmetric polynomials determine the points in # p up to a permutation. In recent years, algebras of holomorphic functions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unit <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> standard complex Banach spaces have been considered {{by a number of}} authors and the spectrum of such algebras was studied in [1],[2], [7]. For example, properties of A u (BX), the algebra of uniformly continuous holomorphic functions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> a complex Banach space X have been studied by Gamelin, et al. Unfortunately, this analogue of the classical disc algebra A(D) has a very complicated, not well understood, spectrum.

2500|$|Wide heels do not {{necessarily}} offer more stability, and any raised heel with too much width, such as found in [...] "blade-heeled" [...] or [...] "block-heeled" [...] shoes, induces unhealthy side-to-side torque to the ankles with every step, stressing them unnecessarily, while creating additional impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> the feet. Thus, the best design for a high heel is one with a narrower width, where the heel {{is closer to the}} front, more solidly under the ankle, where the toe box provides room enough for the toes, and where forward movement of the foot in the shoe is kept in check by material snug across the instep, rather than by the toes being rammed forward and jamming together in the toe box or crushed into the front of the toe box.|$|E
