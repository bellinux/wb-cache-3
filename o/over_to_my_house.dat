Aguilera recorded the song at two studios: The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, and Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood. Prior to the collaboration with Aguilera, Perry {{had written the}} song and originally wished to keep the [...] "personal" [...] record for her own singing career. Perry initially previewed the song for Pink during the recording sessions of Pink's second studio album Missundaztood (2001), on which Perry is a producer. However, after hearing Aguilera sing the song at Perry's house to [...] "break the ice", Perry was very impressed and allowed Aguilera to include the track on her then upcoming record Stripped, effectively deciding not to pursue a solo career. The choice resulted in a feud between Pink against Aguilera and Perry, with the former commenting that it was [...] "annoying" [...] for the latter to collaborate with artists [...] " [...] didn't like". Perry later revealed to ASCAP, [...] "When Christina came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> to start working, {{she asked me to}} play some songs to break the ice. [...] I had a long conversation with my manager about it. We both decided to hear Christina sing it. We demoed the song with her singing it, and I was like, 'Wow'. That rough vocal is what is out there on radio. It was that vocal that got her the song". Perry's wife Sara Gilbert confirmed on her show The Talk that the final version was [...] "just a demo." [...] Gilbert also revealed that Aguilera wanted to rerecord the song because she didn't like the initial vocals. Perry denied the request because the song is supposed to be about imperfection and being vulnerable.|$|E

She said I did not look as if I would kill anybody, so, as a proof of good faith I leveled my rifle and wounded a Chinaman {{who happened to be}} passing the house. She said she knew whole families that could do a thing of that kind, but Bill Ridley was a horse of another color. She said, however, that I would find him over {{on the other side of}} the creek in the sheep lot; and she added that she hoped the best man would win.|$|R

Then if she still refuses, if she still chooses to scorn the honourable position which I offer her, I shall act on Carrier's suggestion. It {{will be at the}} Rat Mort to-night that she and I will have our final interview, and there when I dangle the prospect of Cayenne and the convict's brand before her, she may not prove so obdurate as she has been up to now." ...|$|R

From this moment the affair must {{be treated as a}} party question, and be decided on party principles; though the {{majority}} must rule. Oh! here, neighbor Willis; will you just step <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> and ask Miss Newcome (Anglice, Mrs. Newcome) to hand you the last volume of the State Laws? Perhaps they have a word to say in the matter." [...] Here neighbor Willis did as desired, and moved out of the crowd. As I afterward discovered, he was a warm Presbyterian, who happened, unfortunately for his sect, to stand so directly before the moderator, as unavoidably to catch his eye. I suspected that Squire Newcome would now call a vote on the main question. But I did not know my man. This would have been too palpably a trick, and he carefully avoided committing the blunder. There was plenty of time, since the moderator knew his wife could not very readily find a book he had lent to a magistrate in another settlement twenty miles off; so that he did not hesitate to have a little private conversation with one or two of his friends.|$|E
60|$|I {{had not the}} {{slightest}} doubt that she was fond of flowers, and for her sake now, as I used to do for my own sake, I visited the flower beds and borders. Not far from the house there was a cluster of old-fashioned pinks which I was sure were not doing very well. They had been there too long, perhaps, and they looked stunted and weak. In the miller's garden I had noticed great beds of these pinks, and I asked his wife if I might have some, and she, considering them as mere wild flowers, said I might {{have as many as}} I liked. She might have thought I wanted simply the blossoms, but the next morning I went <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> with a basket filled with great matted masses of the plants taken up with the roots and plenty of earth around them, and after twenty minutes' work in my own bed of pinks, I had taken out all the old plants and filled their places with fresh, luxuriant masses of buds and leaves and blossoms. How glad she would be when she saw the fresh life that had come to that flower-bed! With light footsteps I went away, not feeling the weight of the basket filled with the old plants and roots.|$|E

5000|$|The album also {{features}} a guest bass and vocal appearance by Glenn Hughes of Deep Purple and Black Sabbath fame, performing on the Crow cover [...] "Evil Woman". Hughes also heavily contributed to the album's songwriting. Kevin said of Hughes' contribution [...] "biggest contribution was actually more the songwriting and the background vocals to the other songs. Because {{he was a big}} participant on the songs that Frankie Banali had written with Neil, that I couldn't complete, because they were so far out of my normal vocabulary.

5000|$|Lavigne {{worked with}} Evan Taubenfeld in four songs for the album, {{including}} [...] "Hot". About working with Dr. Luke, {{the producer of}} the track, Lavigne said, [...] "I met Luke Gottwald and we hit it off. I didn’t even know who he was. He came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> and we talked {{and we ended up}} in the studio for four months!." [...] After the success of the first two singles from [...] "The Best Damn Thing" [...] (2007), [...] "Girlfriend" [...] (which topped the Billboard charts, among others) and [...] "When You're Gone" [...] (which became a top-ten hit in many countries), Lavigne responded a lawsuit that was brought against her claiming she copied a song for her hit 'Girlfriend' and the accusations of songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk, who suggested that Lavigne ripped off one of her songs. Later, Lavigne released [...] "Hot" [...] as the album's third single, amidst the plagiarism controversies, on October 23, 2008.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Celebrate" [...] was filmed on May 30, 2012. The video was shot {{over two days}} in down town Los Angeles and is {{directed}} by Marcus Raboy. A preview of the video premiered on Entertainment Tonight on June 4, 2012. The music video made its world premiere on BET's 106 & Park on June 27, 2012. The music video treatment originally was set to include both Sparks and Houston, But with her unexpected passing in February 2012 before the video was shot the treatment had been changed. Sparks says [...] "When we did the song, we planned on it being Whitney and me. But she's not here, {{so we wanted to}} make it a tribute to her. So it's fun, upbeat and exciting — there are clips from the movie and the main cast is in the video too. It's me, Tika Sumpter, Carmen Ejogo, Derek Luke, Omari Hardwick ... Goapele is in it and Mike Epps. We're all just having a good time the premise is they all come <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> singing along to Whitney's music. And we're missing her and celebrating her as well. It's actually pretty simple, but when you watch it and hear her voice along with it, it makes it so much more." ...|$|E
5000|$|Owsley himself said, [...] "I didn't {{much care}} for the {{whimsical}} tone of Spectacular Spider-Man, and tried to nudge writer Al Milgrom out of the seat {{in favor of the}} brilliant newcomer Peter David... I put Peter David and Rich Buckler on Spectacular, focusing on stories with a serious, [...] "grown-up" [...] tone and more complex themes." [...] David combined Owsley's idea of killing off Jean DeWolff with story ideas of his own: [...] "I wanted to do a story in which Spider-Man was confronted by a villain who committed crimes so heinous, so appalling, that Spider-Man was pushed to the edge and over. It always struck me as unrealistic how super heroes could turn fights on and off. When you're in a fistfight, adrenaline flows, your heart is thumping. If you knock the guy down and he's not getting up, most times you kick him because you're so pumped and angry. You don't back off and say [...] "Had enough?" [...] Usually someone has to pull you off the guy. I wanted to do that to Spider-Man because I felt it would bring some hard-edged reality to him. I also wanted to do a story underscoring the philosophical differences between Daredevil and Spider-Man... "The Death of Jean DeWolff" [...] incorporated all three stories to varying degrees. This was accomplished when Owsley came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> early one evening and stayed until after midnight as we hammered out all the kinks in the story in a marathon, four-issue’s-worth head-banging session." ...|$|E

5000|$|Simmons went to {{work with}} Bob Dylan. The music was written at Simmons's guesthouse, and while Simmons was to write the lyrics to the song, {{he thought they were}} not {{completed}} and asked Dylan to write them. Dylan insisted that Simmons write the lyrics. Simmons explained the meeting with Dylan: [...] "I wanted to write a song with Dylan. So, like most things I do, I bullheadedly picked up the phone, tracked down his manager, and said, 'Hi, I'm that guy who sticks his tongue out, and I wanna write a song with Dylan,' or words to that effect. The results could only be 'yes' and 'no.' Dylan said yes. He came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> a few years back, and we sat down and started throwing ideas around. Bob came up with a melody/chordal pattern... I chimed in with a melody/chorus idea and voila, we had a song. Lyrics weren't written as yet. I demoed the track with Tommy Thayer. Bob came down to visit and listen. When the demo was done, I asked Bob to write the lyric. He said no, why don't I write it. I have tried to write a meaningful lyric, but it has eluded me. I've bumped into Bob a few times... in Tokyo, while he was on tour, and every time I ask him to write the lyric, and he always says, 'Mr. KISS, you write it.' The song, originally titled [...] "Laughing When I Want to Cry," [...] was later renamed to [...] "Waiting for the Morning Light" [...] and released on Simmons's second studio album Asshole.|$|E

5000|$|On the 31st of May, Tung Fuhsiang had an {{audience}} of the Throne and upon being questioned stood up and accepted all responsibility {{in the war of}} extermination of Foreigners, which he strongly advocated, staking his head on his ability in successfully combating the Foreign Powers. The result was that instead of ordering the suppression of the Boxers, the policy of the Government was suddenly changed, and an Imperial decree was immediately issued appointing Kang Yi and Chao Shu-chiao, Imperial High Commissioners, to organise the Boxers in the vicinity of Peking and bring them under Government control. During this crisis the various Foreign Powers also sent some 400 odd troops into Peking to protect their Legations. By the 4th of June, the Boxer outlaws had begun to tear up and destroy the Railway between Peking and Tientsin, and from that day also began to enter the city walls of Peking, crowding in at the rate of over a thousand a day. Altars (or gathering-places for recruits, etc.) were erected by them all over the city. At this time also these outlaws began the wholesale slaughter of Christians, and burning of churches outside of Peking, until none of the latter have been left standing. As many as could escape, amongst the Christians, then poured into the capital, taking refuge in the Legations situated in the Tung-chiao-ming street (otherwise known as Legation street). This state of affairs, I may say, existed in the capital during the first days of June, from which time I began to jot down the following diary of events as they occurred before my own eyes and were personally experienced by me.13th June, 1900: 17th day of the 5th moon 26th year of Kuang Hsü:— About dusk, while in the University Peking. I saw four places on fire, whereupon I immediately returned to my house, subsequently learning that all the Churches and mission properties inside the [...] "Eastern City" [...] had been set fire to and entirely destroyed, the conflagration in the Lamplight Market (Night Bazaar) having been especially destructive, lasting far into the next day.14th June.—I passed the Panshih Residence this morning. The building in the rear of this is now the headquarters of Tung Fu-hsiang and his Kansu troops, who I may state, had already entered the city a few days previously. Kansu troops, ever since their arrival from Kansu in the autumn of 1898, had always been kept encamped outside Peking and prohibited from entering the City walls.At noon, my friend Yang Ch'ao-chió, a Military Chüjén graduate, sent a servant <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> suggesting that we should join our families together and escape from Peking in company from the dangers threatening all, and fixing to-morrow morning as our time of departure. I, fortunately as it turned out for us all, firmly refused to go with Yang's party, as I had just heard the rumour that steamers had stopped running to Tientsin. I had also heard that the road to T'ungchou was greatly infested by marauding bands of outlaws, that the railway to Tientsin had been destroyed, and the telegraph lines cut. Further, that a relief force of Foreign troops {{was on its way to}} Peking from Tientsin, and that that city was in great confusion. With these considerations in my mind, I decided to remain where I was for the present. The Japan Daily Mail ...|$|E
