These include <b>ON-Delay,</b> OFF-Delay, Single Shot, Retriggerable Monostable, and Accumulative software-based timers. Using hardware programmable counter/timer chip (DAQ-STC- 24 bit) and PCI MIO- 16 E- 1 DAQ board, another two precise timers are designed. At the end of the paper, for illustration purposes, an electro-pneumatic drive system was developed and controlled utilizing designed <b>on-delay</b> timers VI functions.

40|$|Abstract—Programmable logic Controllers (PLC) are {{embedded}} {{systems that are}} widely used in industry. We propose a formal semantics of the Instruction List (IL) language, {{one of the five}} programing languages defined in the IEC 61131 - 3 standard for PLC programing. This semantics support a significant subset of the IL language that includes <b>on-delay</b> timers. We formalized this semantics in the proof assistant Coq and used it to prove some safety properties on an example of PLC program. I...|$|E
40|$|Industrial timer {{requirements}} are multifaceted. <b>On-delay,</b> off-delay, cyclic or sequential timing requirements, with usual time range varying from seconds to days, {{depending on the}} process. Custom build timers cannot provide all of these requirements simultaneously and hence an advanced timer rectifying this shortcoming has been designed and fabricated in this work. This timer {{is based on the}} real time clock chip used in mother boards. Our design can be programmed for a specific time requirement and can later be put to work in standalone mode. A demonstration board is fabricated and tested...|$|E

For {{the measurement}} of drinking behaviour, a new method was devised using a capacity-relay, an off-delayed timer, a digital clock and a counter.

40|$|Abstract—Solving a {{time-dependent}} two-dimensional local {{thermodynamic equilibrium}} (LTE) model simulation of Ar and Ar–H 2 atmospheric pressure, a high-power RF-induction thermal plasma was performed. The effects of shimmer current level (SCL) in pulse-modulated mode and hydrogen concentrations on different flow fields were predicted. The radiation intensities of ArI (751 nm) for different SCL were calculated from the tem-perature fields. For the same operating conditions as simulation, plasma was successfully generated in pulse-modulated mode and spectroscopic measurements were carried out to investigate the effects of SCL upon temporal plasma properties. Response times (rising, falling, <b>on-delay,</b> and off-delay time) of temporal radiation intensity were crosschecked for both experimental and simulate...|$|E
40|$|The {{pulse-modulated}} induction {{thermal plasma}} (PMITP) {{was established in}} Ar gas with additional gases such as H 2, O 2, N 2 and CO 2 to investigate the effects of various gas inclusions upon the transient characteristics of thermal plasma. The dynamic response times of the thermal plasmas were estimated from the measured time-varying radiation intensity of Ar spectral line. Furthermore, time evolution of the Ar excitation temperature {{was determined by the}} two-line method. The results indicated that especially in Ar-CO 2 PMITP, decreasing lower current level in a modulation cycle raised the <b>on-delay</b> time which means a recovery time from low temperature state to high temperature one. In addition, the inclusion of CO 2 in Ar PMITP caused lower temperatures just before the on-operation compared with other gases used in the experiment...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} step towards certifying safety-critical systems is {{to check their}} conformance to hard real-time requirements. A promising way to achieve this is by building the systems from pre-verified components and verifying their correctness in a compositional manner. We previously reported a formal approach to verifying function blocks (FBs) using tabular expressions and the PVS proof assistant. By applying our approach to the IEC 61131 - 3 standard of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), we constructed a repository of precise specification and reusable (proven) theorems of feasibility and correctness for FBs. However, we previously did not apply our approach to verify FBs against timing requirements, since IEC 61131 - 3 does not define composite FBs built from timers. In this paper, based on our experience in the nuclear domain, we conduct two realistic case studies, consisting of the software requirements and the proposed FB implementations for two subsystems of an industrial control system. The implementations are built from IEC 61131 - 3 FBs, including the <b>on-delay</b> timer. We find issues during the verification process and suggest solutions.

40|$|The {{sustainability}} criterion {{in the manufacturing}} industries is imperative, especially in the automobile industries. Currently, efforts are being made by the industries to mitigate CO 2 emission by the total vehicle weight optimization, machine utilization and resource efficiency. In lieu of this, {{it is important to}} understudy the manufacturing machines adopted in the automobile industries. One of such machine is the hot stamping machine that is used for about 35 % of the manufacturing operations within the automobile industries. Therefore, the standardization and optimization of the hot stamping process could reduce the carbon footprint within the automobile industries. This work understudied the <b>on-delay</b> timer functional valve of the hot stamping machine in order to determine various process parameters affecting it. The detailed physical model of the pneumatic and electro-pneumatic cylinder systems for the control is simulated and optimized for both the pneumatic and electro-pneumatic cylinder systems. Experimental and simulation model were established at the FESTO work station and FESTO FluidSIM® 5. 1 respectively to evaluate the effective velocity, accelerations, displacement, and flow rate for the pneumatic and electro-pneumatic actuator on both systems. Comparisons were made between pneumatic and electro-pneumatic cylinder systems on their characteristic curve in order to optimize the process variables. The result favours the electro-pneumatic cylinder systems in stability and in designing hot stamping machines. The result obtained could elucidate the understanding of the pressing arm of a hot stamping machine...|$|E

The circuit is made up of a comparator with four detecting inputs and without hysteresis voltage. Especially, PT (Pin 16) is prepared for an extra OVP input or another protection signal. UVP (Under voltage protection) section It also has UVP functions for + 3. 3 V, + 5 V, + 12 V outputs. The block is made up of a comparator with three detecting inputs and without hysteresis voltage. Remote on/off section Remote on/off section is used to control SMPS externally. If a high signal is supplied to the remote on/off input, PWM signal becomes a high state and all secondary outputs are grounded. The remote on/off signal is transferred with some <b>on-delay</b> and off-delay time of 8 ms, 24 ms respectively. Precision reference section The reference voltage trimmed to ± 2 % (4. 9 V<Vref< 5. 1 V) PG (Power good signal generator) section Power good signal generator is to monitor the voltage level of power supply for safe operation of a microprocessor.

Response times (rising, falling, <b>on-delay,</b> and off-delay time) of temporal radiation intensity were crosschecked for both experimental and simulated ones. The rising time increased gradually with the decrease of SCL, though the falling time remained almost unchanged with SCL. For example, for Ar plasma at 86 percent, 79 percent, 72 percent, 65 percent, 50 percent, and 40 percent SCL the rising times were 2. 7, 3. 0, 3. 4, 3. 4, 3. 6, and 3. 8 ms, respectively. And for Ar-H 2 plasma (2. 4 percent H 2), at 87 percent, 77 percent, 72 percent, 63 percent, 55 percent, and 45 percent SCL, rising times were 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 0, 3. 4, 3. 7, 3. 9, and 4. 0 ms, respectively. Hydrogen inclusion slowed down the plasma response during the off-to-on pulsing transition at lower SCL and constricted the plasma axially. Finally, part of the simulated results was compared with experimental determinations and acceptable agreements were found. The discrepancies, in few cases, explicated mainly that the LTE assumption did not prevail in pulse-modulated plasma, especially around the on-pulse transitio...|$|E
40|$|Residential gas {{furnaces}} contain blowers {{to distribute}} warm air. Currently, furnace blowers use either a Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) or a Brushless Permanent Magnet (BPM) motor. Blowers {{account for the}} majority of furnace electricity consumption. Therefore, accurate determination of the blower electricity consumption is important for understanding electricity consumption of furnaces. The electricity consumption of blower motors depends on the static pressure across the blower. This paper examines both types of blower motors in non-condensing non-weatherized gas furnaces at a range of static pressures. Fan performance data is based on manufacturer product literature and laboratory tests. We use field-measured static pressure in ducts to get typical system curves to calculate how furnaces would operate in the field. We contrast this with the electricity consumption of a furnace blower operating under the DOE test procedure and manufacturer rated conditions. Furnace electricity use is also affected by operating modes that happen {{at the beginning and end}} of each furnace firing cycle. These operating modes are the pre-purge and post-purge by the draft inducer, the <b>on-delay</b> and off-delay of the blower, and the hot surface ignitor operation. To accurately calculate this effect, we use the number of firing cycles in a typical California house in the Central Valley of California. Cooling hours are not considered in the DOE test procedure. We also account for furnace blower use by the air conditioner and stand-by power. Overall BPM motors outperform PSC motors, but the total electricity savings are significantly less than projected using the DOE test procedure conditions. The performance gains depend on the static pressure of the household ducts, which are typically much higher than in the test procedures...|$|E
