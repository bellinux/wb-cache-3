He {{received}} his B.A. in philosophy from the University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> Barbara and both his M.A. and Ph.D in linguistics from Stanford University. He started his career in theoretical linguistics, working in syntactic and semantic theory, and taught initially at Stanford University {{and later in the}} School of Language and Communication at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. After doing some research in psycholinguistics at Northeastern University in Boston and at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands, Prof. Gee's research focus switched to studies on discourse analysis, sociolinguistics, and applications of linguistics to literacy and education. He went on to teach in the School of Education at Boston University, where he was the chair of the Department of Developmental Studies and Counseling, and later in the Linguistics Department at the University of Southern California. At Boston University he established new graduate programs centered around an integrated approach to language and literacy, combining programs in reading, writing, bilingual education, ESL, and applied linguistics. From 1993 to 1997 he held the Jacob Hiatt Chair in Education in the Hiatt Center for Urban Education at Clark University in Massachusetts.

40|$|Size {{can play}} an {{important}} role in determining reproductive success through the establishment of dominance hierarchies and mate selection. We explored the relationship between size of individuals and courtship success in the kelp perch, Brachyistius frenatus, off the coast <b>of</b> southern <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> Catalina Island. Courtship displays were timed and the length of the interaction was used as a proxy for courtship success. In addition, we observed how much of their time individuals spent performing different activities throughout the day in two adjacent habitats dominated by different macroalgae. We found that body size played a significant role in determining the success of courtship. Large males were slightly more successful than small males, but the male: female size ratio was the best predictor of mating success of male B. frenatus, with males that were large relative to the female they were courting being most successful. Time allocated to different activities varied significantly with time of day and habitat. A greater proportion of time was spent on foraging in the morning than in the afternoon, and females spent more of their time foraging than did males. Behaviors other than foraging were only observed in one habitat type (understory algae) and courtship behavior was only observed during the afternoon. Smaller males tended to spend more time searching for receptive females than did larger males. Introductio...|$|R

Guilbert commented that [...] "material girl" [...] designated a certain type of liberated women, thus deviating from its original coinage which meant a girl who is tangible and accessible. Author Nicholas Cook said that the meaning and impact of [...] "material girl" [...] was no more circumscribed by the video, rather by its song.

40|$|OBJECTIVETo compare two {{validated}} closed-loop (CL) algorithms versus patient self-control with CSII {{in terms}} of glycemic control. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThis study was a multicenter, randomized, three-way crossover, open-label trial in 48 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least 6 months, treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Blood glucose was controlled for 23 h by the algorithm of the Universities of Pavia and Padova with a Safety Supervision Module developed at the Universities <b>of</b> Virginia and <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Santa</b> Barbara (international artificial pancreas [iAP]), by the algorithm of University of Cambridge (CAM), or by patients themselves in open loop (OL) during three hospital admissions including meals and exercise. The main analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. Main outcome measures included time spent in target (glucose levels between 3. 9 and 8. 0 mmol/L or between 3. 9 and 10. 0 mmol/L after meals). RESULTSTime spent in the target range was similar in CL and OL: 62. 6 % for OL, 59. 2 % for iAP, and 58. 3 % for CAM. While mean glucose level was significantly lower in OL (7. 19, 8. 15, and 8. 26 mmol/L, respectively) (overall P = 0. 001), percentage {{of time spent in}} hypoglycemia (< 3. 9 mmol/L) was almost threefold reduced during CL (6. 4 %, 2. 1 %, and 2. 0 %) (overall P = 0. 001) with less time 2. 8 mmol/L (overall P = 0. 038).

40|$|A {{number of}} {{antibodies}} {{have been developed}} that induce lethal iron deprivation (LID) by targeting the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR 1 /CD 71) and either neutralizing transferrin (Tf) binding, blocking internalization of the receptor and/or inducing its degradation. We have developed recombinant antibodies targeting human TfR 1 (ch 128. 1 and ch 128. 1 Av), which induce receptor degradation and are cytotoxic to certain malignant B-cells. We now show that internalization of TfR 1 bound to these antibodies can lead to its sequestration and degradation, as well as reduced Tf uptake, and the induction of a transcriptional response consistent with iron deprivation, which is mediated in part by downstream targets of p 53. Cells resistant to these antibodies do not sequester and degrade TfR 1 after internalization of the antibody/receptor complex, and accordingly maintain their ability to internalize Tf. These findings are expected to facilitate the rational design and clinical use of therapeutic agents targeting iron import via TfR 1 in hematopoietic malignancies.
