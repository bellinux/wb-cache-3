5|$|Religious {{language}} is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity. This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language <b>of</b> <b>goodness.</b> This raises {{the problem of how}} (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all, which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life. The French philosopher Simone Weil expressed this problem in her work Waiting for God, in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation <b>of</b> <b>goodness,</b> maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} power of {{different}} exact tests of differentiation for diploid populations. Since there is not necessarily random mating within populations, the appropriate hypothesis to construct exact tests is that of independent sampling of genotypes. There are two categories of tests, F(ST) -estimator tests and <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> fit tests. In this latter category, we distinguish ``allelic statistics'', which account for the nature of alleles within genotypes, from ``genotypic statistics'' that do not. We show that {{the power of}} F(ST) -estimator tests and <b>of</b> allelic <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> fit tests are similar when sampling is balanced, and higher than the power <b>of</b> genotypic <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> fit tests. When sampling is unbalanced, the most powerful tests are shown to belong to the allelic <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> fit group...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Many {{works have}} been carried out to compare the {{efficiency}} <b>of</b> several <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> fit procedures for identifying whether or not a particular distribution could adequately explain a data set. In this paper a study is conducted to investigate the power <b>of</b> several <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> fit tests such as Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS), Anderson-Darling(AD), Cramer- von- Mises (CV) and a proposed modification <b>of</b> Kolmogorov-Smirnov <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> fit test which incorporates a variance stabilizing transformation (FKS). The performances of these selected tests are studied under simple random sampling (SRS) and Ranked Set Sampling (RSS). This study shows that, in general, the Anderson-Darling (AD) test performs better than other GOF tests. However, there are some cases where the proposed test can perform as equally good as the AD test. Keywords—Empirical distribution function, goodness-of-fit, order statistics, ranked set sampling.

25|$|Ahmadi Muslims view Zoroaster as a Prophet of God and {{describe}} the expressions of Ahura Mazda, the god <b>of</b> <b>goodness,</b> and Ahraman, the god of evil, as merely referring to the coexistence of forces {{of good and evil}} enabling humans to exercise free will. Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the fourth Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, in his book Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth views Zoroaster as Prophet of God {{and describe}}s such the expressions to be a concept which is similar to the concepts in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.|$|E
25|$|The Fragility <b>of</b> <b>Goodness</b> {{confronts the}} ethical dilemma that {{individuals}} strongly committed to justice are nevertheless vulnerable to external {{factors that may}} deeply compromise or even negate their human flourishing. Discussing literary as well as philosophical texts, Nussbaum seeks {{to determine the extent}} to which reason may enable self-sufficiency. She eventually rejects the Platonic notion that human goodness can fully protect against peril, siding with the tragic playwrights and Aristotle in treating the acknowledgment of vulnerability as a key to realizing the human good.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people in}} the world reject older {{situated}} ethics and localized religious views. However small-community-based and ecology-centric views have gained some popularity in recent years. In part, this has been attributed to the desire for ethical certainties. Such a deeply rooted definition <b>of</b> <b>goodness</b> would be valuable because it might allow one to construct a good life or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration or prioritisation. Ones that relied only on local referents one could verify for oneself, creating more certainty and therefore less investment in protection, hedging and insuring against consequences of loss of the value.|$|E

25|$|After {{her death}} on the pyre, the woman is finally {{transformed}} {{into the shape of}} the satimata, an spiritual embodiment <b>of</b> <b>goodness,</b> with her principal concern of being a family protector. Typically, the satimata occurs in the dreams of the family members, teaching for example, the women how to be good pativratas, herself through her sacrifice having proved she was the perfect pativrata. However, although the satimata's intentions are always {{for the good of the}} family, she is not averse to let, for example, children become sick, or the cows' udders wither, if she thinks this is an appropriate lesson to the living wife who had neglected her duties as pativrata.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{responds}} to the death-penalty verdict by first addressing the jurors who voted for his death. He says that their condemnation of him resulted not {{from a lack of}} arguments, but from a lack of time — and an unwillingness to pander for pity, as expected of a man condemned to death. Socrates repeats that the prospect of death does not absolve him from following the path <b>of</b> <b>goodness</b> and truth. He prophesies that younger and harsher critics shall follow in his stead, philosophers who will spur ethical conduct from the citizens of Athens, in a manner more vexing than that of Socrates (39d).|$|E
25|$|One {{problem with}} the thinkings of Rawls {{is that it is}} overly {{procedural}} as found in defenders of natural law. Procedurally fair processes of the type used by Rawls may not leave enough room for judgment, and therefore, reduce the totality <b>of</b> <b>goodness.</b> For example, if two people are found to own an orange, the standard fair procedure is to cut it in two and give half to each. However, if one wants to eat it while the other wants the rind to flavor a cake, cutting it in two is clearly less good than giving the peel to the baker and feeding the core to the eater.|$|E
50|$|The maximum {{likelihood}} method has many advantages {{in that it}} allows researchers to compute {{of a wide range}} of indexes <b>of</b> the <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> fit of the model, it allows researchers to test the statistical significance of factor loadings, calculate correlations among factors and compute confidence intervals for these parameters. ML is the best choice when data are normally distributed because “it allows for the computation {{of a wide range of}} indexes <b>of</b> the <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> fit of the model and permits statistical significance testing of factor loadings and correlations among factors and the computation of confidence intervals”. ML should not be used if the data are not normally distributed.|$|R
