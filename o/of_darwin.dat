5|$|The naval {{threat to}} Australia {{increased}} dramatically following {{the outbreak of}} war in the Pacific. During the first half of 1942, the Japanese mounted a sustained campaign in Australian waters, with Japanese submarines attacking shipping and aircraft carriers conducting a devastating attack on the strategic port <b>of</b> <b>Darwin.</b> In response to these attacks the Allies increased the resources allocated to protecting shipping in Australian waters.|$|E

Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in June 1942, he led the Beauforts on bombing and torpedo missions against Japanese targets in the New Guinea campaign.|$|E
5|$|Poulton was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} <b>of</b> <b>Darwin,</b> {{through a period}} {{when there was no}} adequate theory of heredity and both natural selection and sexual selection had become unpopular among scientists, and was attacked for his support both in The Colours of Animals and outside it. And he is recognised as the first scientist to identify frequency-dependent selection, as described in this book. By 1919, the book was being described in Nature as a classic work.|$|E

5|$|SS Mauna Loa was a steam-powered {{cargo ship}} of Matson Navigation Company that was sunk {{in the bombing}} <b>of</b> <b>Darwin</b> in February 1942.

At {{the time of her}} {{completion}} in 1919, the ship was inspected by the United States Navy for possible use as USS West Conob (ID-4033) but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever commissioned.|$|E
5|$|A monsoon trough {{was noted}} {{along the coast}} of Australia's Northern Territory in late November into early December 1988. This system led to {{sporadic}} heavy rain in the region. On 12December, a tropical low consolidated from the monsoon trough over the Timor Sea, west <b>of</b> <b>Darwin,</b> Northern Territory. Moving southwest, the system skirted the Kimberley coast before turning west. Acquiring gale-force winds by 00:00UTC on 13December, the low was classified as a Category1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Ilona by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Perth, Western Australia. At this time it was situated near Adele Island. Twelve hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories, dubbing it Tropical Cyclone 03S. Decelerating somewhat, Ilona steadily intensified over the following days and achieved severe tropical cyclone status—having ten-minute sustained winds of at least —around 12:00UTC on 15December. Similarly, the JTWC assessed the system to have reached the equivalent of a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS) by 18:00UTC.|$|E
5|$|After a brief posting to Point Cook {{in early}} 1940, Cresswell {{undertook}} the instructors' course at Central Flying School in Camden, New South Wales. He then became {{an instructor at}} No.2 Service Flying Training School, which was formed at Wagga Wagga in July and operated Avro Ansons and CAC Wirraways. The school's commander, Frederick Scherger, advised Cresswell to grow a moustache to overcome his youthful appearance. He was promoted to flight lieutenant in January 1941. Following the bombing <b>of</b> <b>Darwin</b> by Japanese forces on 19February 1942, Cresswell was posted to Williamtown as a liaison officer with the 9th Squadron of the US 49th Pursuit Group (later the 49th Fighter Group), which operated P-40 Kittyhawks and would shortly transfer to Darwin to provide air defence for the North-Western Area.|$|E

5|$|Although Australia was {{remote from}} the main battlefronts, there was {{considerable}} Axis naval activity in Australian waters during the Second World War. A total of 54 German and Japanese warships and submarines entered Australian waters between 1940 and 1945 and attacked ships, ports and other targets. Among the best-known attacks are the sinking of HMAS Sydney by a German raider in November 1941, the bombing <b>of</b> <b>Darwin</b> by Japanese naval aircraft in February 1942, and the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour in May 1942. In addition, many Allied merchant ships were damaged or sunk off the Australian coast by submarines and mines. Japanese submarines also shelled several Australian ports and submarine-based aircraft flew over several Australian capital cities.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942, Lindwall helped the St. George Dragons rugby league team to reach the grand final for the second {{consecutive}} year and also finished the season as the League's top point-scorer. Lindwall and his brother Jack, who played on the wing, scored all of the team's points in the grand final, Jack scoring a try and Ray kicking three goals. However they were denied by a last-minute penalty goal and St. George were defeated by Canterbury-Bankstown 11–9. All the while, the Japanese were inching ever closer to Australia. Malaya had fallen and the northern Australian city <b>of</b> <b>Darwin</b> had been the subject of Japanese air raids.|$|E
5|$|Enlisting in the United States Army Air Corps as {{a flying}} cadet in 1927, Wurtsmith was {{commissioned}} in 1928. Over the next 13 years, {{he served in}} instructional and command positions. He took over command of the 49th Pursuit Group in December 1941 and between March 1942 and January 1943, his fighters downed 78 enemy aircraft in the defense <b>of</b> <b>Darwin</b> in northern Australia, against Japanese air attacks. In 1943 he assumed command of the V Fighter Command, part of Major General George Kenney's Fifth Air Force. In 1945, he commanded the Thirteenth Air Force in the Southern Philippines and Borneo campaigns. After the war Wurtsmith served with the Strategic Air Command.|$|E

5|$|In early April 1996, a {{surge in}} the trade winds interacted with the monsoon trough to produce an area of convection. On 2April, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) first {{identified}} {{the system as a}} low to mid-level low pressure area over Indonesia north <b>of</b> <b>Darwin,</b> Australia. Despite strong wind shear, the system slowly became better organized as it moved southward, aided by improving upper-level outflow. Early on 5April, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 25S as the system began a westward track, steered by a building mid-level ridge to the south. Shortly thereafter, the BoM upgraded the system to a Category1 cyclone, designating the storm as Tropical Cyclone Olivia.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{botanist}} Asa Gray, an American colleague <b>of</b> <b>Darwin,</b> {{negotiated with}} a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, but learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning {{to exploit the}} absence of international copyright to print Origin. Darwin was delighted by {{the popularity of the}} book, and asked Gray to keep any profits. Gray managed to negotiate a 5% royalty with Appleton's of New York, who got their edition out in mid January 1860, and the other two withdrew. In a May letter, Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, {{but it is not clear}} if this referred to the first printing only as there were four that year.|$|E
5|$|On 21November, a cyclone watch {{was raised}} for coastal and nearby inland areas of Western Australia between Wyndham and Beagle Bay. This watch was soon {{expanded}} to encompass areas {{east to the}} Western Australia–Northern Territory border and west to the Mitchell Plateau. Additionally, areas from Mitchell Plateau to Cockatoo Island were placed under a cyclone warning. The following day, watches extended to Cape Hotham Light in the Northern Territory, including the city <b>of</b> <b>Darwin</b> and the Tiwi Islands. As the cyclone intensified, warnings gradually spread eastward. Warnings reached as far east as Point Stuart prior to Alessia's landfall. All watches and warnings were dropped on 24November as Alessia moved inland and degraded to a tropical low.|$|E
