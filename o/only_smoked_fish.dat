40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a {{ubiquitous}} bacterium, {{widely distributed}} in the environment; morover, its ability to survive at low temperatures and form protective biofilms makes it colonise and persist in food processing plants. Epidemiological data provided by EFSA in 2009 show that ready-to-eat (RTE) food – in particular, soft and semi-soft cheese, and fishery and meat products subjected to heat treatment –represents the most likely contaminated foodstuff. For this reason, the European Commission has developed (Dec. 2010 / 678 /EU) a monitoring plan designed to evaluate the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in these products. The programme, developed in detail with reference to each member state, involved, among others, the city of Turin and has been set out from June to December 2011.

The method of smoking {{has also been}} developed from traditional, which had used a simple technology to the modern method. In recent years, preparation of liquid smoke manufactured from certain varieties of wood pyrolysates have been successfully used {{as a substitute for}} the traditional smoking in a kiln. Material and methods : The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the effect of cold smoking of mackerel fish on the proximate composition, water activity, salt content and microbial aspect of <b>smoked</b> <b>fish</b> treated using oak sawdust and liquid smoke either salted or un-salted. Sensory analysis was carried out by using score sheet organoleptic and hedonic test. Identification of pathogenic bacteria was done by API- 20 E method.

This means that the quality between two products were similar. Only moisture content of the products were very significantly different (p> 0. 01) caused by the phenomenon of osmosis between moisture of fish and brine. Study of liquid smoke treatment was found that liquid smoke was easier compared to oak sawdust smoke. It was also found that smoking reduces the number of colonies of bacteria.
