DESIGN: Prospective assessment of antibiotics prescription over time, before and after the intervention, in comparison with a control ward. SETTING: The medical and surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. PATIENTS: All patients hospitalized in the medical or surgical ICU between February 1 and April 30, 1997, and July 1 and August 31, 2000, for whom antibiotics were prescribed. INTERVENTION: Formatting of the medical <b>order</b> <b>sheet</b> in the surgical ICU in 1998. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compliance with the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists' criteria for prescription safety was measured. The proportion of safe orders increased in both units, but the increase was 4. 6 times greater in the surgical ICU (66 % vs. 74 % in the medical ICU and 48 % vs. 74 % in the surgical ICU). For unsafe orders, the proportion of ambiguous orders decreased by half in the medical ICU (9 % vs. 17 %) and nearly disappeared in the surgical ICU (1 % vs. 30 %). The only missing criterion remaining in the surgical ICU was the drug dose unit, which could not be preformatted. The aim of antibiotics prescription (either prophylactic or therapeutic) was indicated only in 51 % of the <b>order</b> <b>sheets.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Formatting of the <b>order</b> <b>sheet</b> markedly increased security of antibiotics prescription. These findings must be confirmed in other settings and with different drug classes.

Two-phase observational study consisting of two consecutive 4 -month phases: pre-intervention (phase 0) and post-intervention (phase I) conducted in an 11 -bed NICU in a Swiss university hospital. Interventions consisted of the introduction of a new preformatted medical <b>order</b> <b>sheet</b> with explicit information supplied, coupled with a staff introductory course on appropriate prescription and medication errors. The main outcomes measured were formal aspects of prescription and frequency and nature of prescription errors. Eighty-three and 81 patients were included in phase 0 and phase I, respectively. A total of 505 handwritten prescriptions in phase 0 and 525 in phase I were analysed. The rate of prescription errors decreased significantly from 28. 9  % in phase 0 to 13. 5  % in phase I (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Compared with phase 0, dose errors, name confusion and errors in frequency and rate of drug administration decreased in phase I, from 5. 4 to 2. 7  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), 5. 9 to 0. 2  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), 3. 6 to 0. 2  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), and 4. 7 to 2. 1  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), respectively. The rate of incomplete and ambiguous prescriptions decreased from 44. 2 to 25. 7 and 8. 5 to 3. 2  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), respectively. CONCLUSION: Inexpensive and simple interventions can improve the intelligibility of prescriptions and reduce medication errors. WHAT IS KNOWN: ? Medication errors are frequent in NICUs and prescription is one of the most critical steps. ? CPOE reduce prescription errors, but their implementation is not available everywhere. What is New: ? Preformatted medical <b>order</b> <b>sheet</b> coupled with an introductory course decrease medication errors in a NICU. ?

40|$|Background and objective: Medical record documentation, {{often use}} {{to protect the}} {{patients}} legal rights, also providing information for medical researchers, general studies, education of health care staff and qualitative surveys is used. There {{is a need to}} control the amount of data entered in the medical record sheets of patients, considering the completion of these sheets is often carried out after completion of service delivery to the patients. Therefore, in this study the prevalence of completeness of medical history, operation reports, and physician <b>order</b> <b>sheets</b> by different documentaries in Jahrom teaching hospitals during year 2009 was analyzed. Methods and Materials: In this descriptive / retrospective study, the 400 medical record sheets of the patients from two teaching hospitals affiliated to Jahrom medical university was randomly selected. The tool of data collection was a checklist based on the content of medical history sheet, operation report and physician <b>order</b> <b>sheets.</b> The data were analyzed by SPSS (Version 10) software and Microsoft Office Excel 2003. Results: Average of personal (Demography) data entered in medical history, physician order and operation report sheets which is done by department's secretaries were 32. 9, 35. 8 and 40. 18 percent. Average of clinical data entered by physician in medical history sheet is 38 percent. Surgical data entered by the surgeon in operation report sheet was 94. 77 percent. Average of data entered by operation room's nurse in operation report sheet was 36. 78 percent; Average of physician order data in physician <b>order</b> <b>sheet</b> entered by physician was 99. 3 percent. Conclusion: According to this study, the rate of completed record papers reviewed by documentary in Jahrom teaching hospitals were not desirable and in some cases were very weak and incomplete.

A particular example is LaCoO 3, a zero spin, nonmagnetic material in the bulk, whose strong ferromagnetism in a thin film remains enigmatic despite a decade of intense research. Here, we use scanning transmission electron microscopy complemented by X-ray and optical spectroscopy to study LaCoO 3 epitaxial thin films under different strain states.

The modulation entails the formation of ferromagnetically <b>ordered</b> <b>sheets</b> comprising intermediate or high spin Co 3 +, thus offering an unambiguous description for the exotic magnetism found in epitaxially strained LaCoO 3 films.

40|$|Medication {{errors are}} among the most common medical errors in the hospitals.

Error was defined as any deviation in transcribing medication order from the previous step (order on the <b>order</b> <b>sheet,</b> administration nursing note and/or cardex, documentation of the order in the pharmacy database). A total of 287 charts with 558 opportunities for error were reviewed. Of those opportunities for error 167 (29. 9 %) resulted in an error. Omission (the patient did not receive the medication that was ordered) was the highest (52 %) transcription error type seen in this study.

The method presented started with mechanical grinding of kaolinite, followed by grafting with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). The mechanical grinding treatment destroyed the <b>ordered</b> <b>sheets</b> of kaolinite, formed fine fragments and generated broken bonds (undercoordinated metal ions). These broken bonds served as new sites for the condensation with APTES. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the existence of CH 2 from APTES. 29 Si cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (29 Si CP/MAS NMR) showed that the principal bonding mechanism between APTES and kaolinite fitted a tridentate silylation model (T 3) with a chemical shift at 66. 7 ppm. The silane loadings of the silylated samples were estimated from the mass loss obtained by TG-DTG curves.

From these parameters, a two-dimensional Al-Si ordering scheme was deduced. The transition temperature Tc for this two-dimensional ordering is 1900 K. These are several possible ordering schemes in three dimensions, based on different stacking sequences of <b>ordered</b> <b>sheets</b> of tetrahedral sites. Monte Carlo simulations of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional ordering were performed, but in the three-dimensional simulation only the two-dimensional ordering is seen, implying that three-dimensional ordering is too slow to be attained during the timescale of the simulation. The effect of the three-dimensional interactions is to raise the two-dimensional ordering temperature to 2140 K. From the three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation, the frequency of occurrence of 4 SiOAl, 3 Si 1 Al, 2 Si 2 Al and 1 Si 3 Al clusters was determined, which match those inferred by 29 Si MAS-NMR measurements reasonably well. In fact, the match suggests that the cation ordering seen in experiments corresponds to a configuration with considerable short-range order but no long-range order, similar to a state that is at a temperature just above an ordering phase transition...|$|R
