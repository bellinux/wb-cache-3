This paper is primarily focused on analyzing English classrooms in three Malaysian schools: <b>National</b> <b>School,</b> <b>National</b> Chinese <b>Type</b> <b>School,</b> and <b>National</b> Tamil <b>Type</b> <b>School.</b> The analysis is planned out by looking at how teachers teach reading, writing, speaking and listening English in each classroom and proposes a revision of said teaching strategies. The outcome of this paper proposes {{that there should be a}} much deeper approach to teaching English by creating more meaningful English lessons rather than the surface level approach of teaching by rote memorization and repetition. Finally, in order for Malaysia to become a contender in the global workforce, global academia, and global economy, Malaysia students need to be sufficiently proficient in the English language first through meaningful English lessons in schools...|$|R

Data were collected using questionnaire and interview techniques. The questionnaire was distributed to a total of 300 randomly selected teacher respondents and 194 questionnaires were returned, however only 186 questionnaires were appropriately completed and able to be used for analysis. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings revealed that the level of four dimensions of school climate namely collegial leadership, achievement press, institutional vulnerability and communication were at the moderate level. Among these variables, professional teacher behavior dimension was identified at the high level. In addition, findings indicated that there was'no significant difference in teacher’s perception of school climate based on gender and school location. On the other hand, the finding indicated that teachers from different <b>types</b> of <b>school</b> are having different perceptions toward collegial leadership, achievement press, institutional vulnerability and communication. This study indicated that was no significant relationship between the two dimensions namely professional teacher behavior and institutional vulnerability. Besides that, these two dimensions were not positively associated with each other.

40|$|AbstractComposition {{writing is}} an {{important}} component in teaching and learning process of Bahasa Malaysia (Malaysian official language) in primary schools. Students write essays based on several formats. Students„ essays lead to contents and elaborations. Students are giving less attention in the usage of proverbs while writing essays as a whole. In this research, a total of 82 script samples were chosen to be analyzed. The research samples were chosen from Standard 5 students out of three schools in Chemor, Perak. The Hermeneutic Pedagogical approach is used in analyzing the essays to identify the existence of proverbs in them. The findings through Hermeneutic Pedagogical approach give interpretation (metatexts) that there is existence of proverbs and information processing experienced by students both consciously and subconsciously while writing essays. Research findings suggest that students from national schools were using more proverbs while writing essays compared to those from <b>national</b> <b>type</b> <b>schools</b> (Chinese/Tamil). Information processing experienced by students since primary schools through formal and informal education helps students in using proverbs in their essays.

40|$|This {{research}} critically {{evaluates the}} weaknesses and obstacles faced {{in the implementation}} of sports policies in the multilingual Malaysian schools which comprise mainly of government managed <b>schools</b> and <b>national</b> <b>type</b> <b>schools</b> which are largely ethnically based. The understanding of the joint responsibility of the Federal, the local government and the school management involvement in sports is an essential ingredient in analysing sports in the school which faces enormous challenges, largely due to the ethnic divide in schools and thereby an ethnic inequality. The government policies as well as government assertion on this issue {{and the extent to which}} they are centrally controlled, leave very little space at the grass root level for greater expression in implementing sports policies. This correspondingly reduced or even eliminated the role of the local government who should have been an integral part of the policy maker. The development of competitive sports in schools had often been highlighted at the ministerial level but appears to be not sufficiently researched and so strategies and measures remain obscure. The consequence of this was that there are no known major policy concerns relating to sports curriculum in schools and hence sports among students in schools were largely individual or collective efforts. The research methodology involves primary data collection which are obtained from the responses on the questionnaires who were made up of educationist, sports organisers, and policy makers. Sampling based on academic work of other researchers in this area are scrutinised, reviewed and summarised for the purpose of a well organised analysis. This article examines and evaluates the centralising of sports policies by the government,while stressing the need for freedom of expression at the grass - roots and ascending beyond ethnic divide in achieving interculturalism in sports, in a polarised society of Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the Japanese {{model of}} Lesson Study was {{introduced}} {{as a teacher}} professional development programme to nine low-performing primary schools in Malaysia. The objectives {{of this study were}} to examine to what extent Lesson Study can improve low-performing primary mathematics and science teachers' stages of concern about the implementation of Lesson Study in their schools and their teaching quality as well as student learning performance. The sample consisted of 97 primary mathematics and science teachers from three types of primary schools: the National <b>School</b> (SK); the <b>National</b> <b>Type</b> Chinese <b>School</b> (SJKC) and the <b>National</b> <b>Type</b> Tamil <b>School</b> (SJKT). Before the implementation of Lesson Study, a workshop was conducted in every school to introduce participating teachers to the concepts of Lesson Study and the research procedure. After the workshop, the participating teachers were asked to complete the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ) in order to identify their initial stages of concern about the implementation of Lesson Study in their schools. The SoCQ was developed based on the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM). It consists of 35 items, categorising teachers' concerns into seven stages: Stage 0 (Awareness); Stage 1 (Informational); Stage 2 (Personal); Stage 3 (Management); Stage 4 (Consequence); Stage 5 (Collaboration) and Stage 6 (Refocusing) (George, Hall & Stiegelbauer, Measuring implementation in schools: The stages of concern questionnaire (2006)). The same SoCQ was also given to the participating teachers after every Lesson Study cycle to determine whether their stages of concern changed before and after the implementation of Lesson Study cycles. In this paper, only the data collected from the first SoCQ given were analysed. The results showed that the profiles of the SK, SJKC and SJKT teachers' initial stages of concern about the implementation of Lesson Study in their schools were quite similar. The SK, SJKC and SJKT teachers' concerns were the highest in Stage 0 and the lowest in Stage 4, indicating that these teachers had a high level of concern about a number of other initiatives, tasks, and activities besides Lesson Study and they had quite a low level of concern about the consequences of implementing Lesson Study for their students, respectivel...|$|R

In addition, school administrators also provide support by release time either during the school day or after school for teachers to finalize the lesson plan, prepare materials and revise the lesson.
