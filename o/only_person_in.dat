5|$|After Mayor Quimby {{makes an}} {{offensive}} joke about France, {{and refuses to}} apologize, the French president launches a neutron bomb directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from Herman's military surplus store. After the blast, Homer emerges from the shelter {{and seems to be}} the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> town to survive the blast, but he is soon confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants. Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge and the children kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding behind their backs and the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E
5|$|Baker is {{considered}} one of the greatest ice hockey players of his era, and the first great American hockey player. He was one of the first nine players inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame upon its founding in 1945, the first American so honored, and was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame as one of its charter members in 1973. Baker was posthumously awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy by the National Hockey League and USA Hockey in 1987 for his contributions to hockey in the United States. In 1975, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and is the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> both the College Football and Hockey Halls of Fame. Baker was also inducted into the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Stanford's defense {{improved}} {{under new}} defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who was {{given credit for}} much of the team's success in that department. At the end of the regular season, Stanford was first in the Pac-10 and 11th of 120 teams nationally in scoring defense (allowing an average of 17.83points per game) and 24th in total defense (permitting 326yards per game). In 2009, Stanford was 69th in scoring defense (26.5) and 90th in total defense (403yards per game). A prominent player on Stanford's defense was Owen Marecic, the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> major league college football that season to play both offense and defense. On defense, Marecic accrued 45 tackles and 2 interceptions as a linebacker; on offense, he gained 117yards and 4 touchdowns as the team's fullback.|$|E
5|$|Lazard {{turns to}} Fox Mulder and Dana Scully for help. She tells them of Michelle's claims {{that a man}} had {{attacked}} Barbala, {{even though she was}} the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> the room when the detective was killed. The agents have Michelle describe the alleged attacker for a computerized facial composite; the computer seemingly glitches, displaying a face that Michelle identifies as the killer. The composite matches that of a Detective Charlie Morris — who died nine years previously in an apparent gangland hit. Mulder speaks to Michelle's psychiatrist, Dr. Braun, who tells him that she habitually mutilated dolls in a uniform manner during their sessions together, removing the same eye and arm each time; Mulder realizes that these mutilations match the circumstances of Morris' death.|$|E
5|$|The top {{individual}} competitors at the Olympics were Finnish ski jumper Matti Nykänen and Dutch speed skater Yvonne van Gennip as {{they each}} won three gold medals. Italy's Alberto Tomba won gold in two skiing events, his first of five career Olympic medals {{en route to}} becoming the first alpine skier to win medals at three Winter Games. East Germany's Katarina Witt defended her 1984 gold medal in women's figure skating, capturing a second gold in Calgary. Her compatriot Christa Rothenburger {{won the gold medal}} in the 1000metre race in speed skating, then went on to win a silver medal in the team sprint cycling event at the 1988 Summer Games to become the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> Olympic history to win medals at both Olympic Games in the same year. The Soviet Union won gold in hockey as Scandinavian neighbours Finland and Sweden took silver and bronze, respectively.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to conservative pressure to constrain Röhm, Hitler left for Neudeck {{to meet with}} Hindenburg. Blomberg, who had been meeting with the President, uncharacteristically reproached Hitler for not having moved against Röhm earlier. He then told Hitler that Hindenburg was close to declaring martial law and turning the government over to the Reichswehr if Hitler did not take immediate steps against Röhm and his brownshirts. Hitler had hesitated for months in moving against Röhm, {{in part due to}} Röhm's visibility as the leader of a national militia with millions of members. However, the threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying Röhm and settling scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and Göring welcomed Hitler's decision, since both had much to gain by Röhm's downfall– the independence of the SS for Himmler, and the removal of a rival for the future command of the army for Göring.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August, at 2:40 pm, Pym led {{an attack}} on Duperré's {{squadron}} without waiting for Iphigenia and Magicienne, entering the channel {{that led to the}} anchorage at Grand Port. He was followed by Nereide, but Willoughby had refused to allow Pym to embark the harbour pilot: the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> the British squadron who knew the passage through the reefs. Without guidance by an experienced pilot, Sirius was aground within minutes and could not be brought off until 8:30 am on 23 August. Nereide anchored nearby during the night to protect the flagship. At 10:00 am, Iphigenia and Magicienne arrived and at 2:40 pm, after a conference between the captains as to the best course of action, the force again attempted to negotiate the channel. Although the squadron was now guided by Nereides pilot, Sirius again grounded at 3:00 pm and Magicienne 15 minutes later after over-correcting to avoid the reef that Sirius had struck. Nereide and Iphigenia continued the attack, Iphigenia engaging Minerve and Ceylon at close range and Nereide attacking Bellone. Long-range fire from Magicienne was also directed at Victor, which was firing on Nereide.|$|E
