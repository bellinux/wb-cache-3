40|$|A {{great deal}} of effort has been {{directed}} towards determining the minimum number <b>of</b> binary comparisons <b>sufficient</b> to produce various partial orders given some partial order. For example, the sorting problem considers the minimum number <b>of</b> comparisons <b>sufficient</b> to construct a total order starting from n elements. The merging problem considers the minimum number <b>of</b> comparisons <b>sufficient</b> to construct a total order from two total orders. The searching problem {{can be seen as}} a special case of the merging problem in which one of the total orders is a singleton. The selection problem considers the minimum number <b>of</b> comparisons <b>sufficient</b> to select the i th largest of n elements. Little, however, is known about the minimum number <b>of</b> comparisons <b>sufficient</b> to produce an arbitrary partial order. In this paper we briefly survey the known results on this problem and we present some first results on partial orders which can be produced using either restricted types of comparisons or a limited n [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Quarrying ceased in {{the early}} 1960s (1962–1965), when the stones {{extracted}} were no longer <b>of</b> <b>sufficient</b> quality.

5|$|A long bar of Danish territories in {{the south}} and lack <b>of</b> <b>sufficient</b> year-round {{ice-free}} ports severely limited Sweden's access to Baltic trade. Nevertheless, the country prospered due to exports of timber, iron and most notably copper, coupled with the advantages of a growing navy and proximity to the Livonian ports across the narrow Gulf of Finland. Before the Livonian war, Sweden had sought expansion into Livonia, but the intervention of the Russian tsar temporarily stalled these efforts through the Russo-Swedish War of 1554–1557, which culminated in the 1557 Treaty of Novgorod.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} only general {{aviation}} at Værnes, organized by two clubs, Værnes flyklubb and NTH flyklubb. From 1 August 1946 to 31 July 1947, there were 1,221 take-offs from Værnes, mostly during the summer. During parts of 1946 and 1947, the airport {{was used as a}} pasture for sheep. The first scheduled service was introduced with a Douglas DC-3 operated to Oslo by DNL during the winter of 19467–48. While there were initially many customers, the lack <b>of</b> <b>sufficient</b> deicing caused low regularity and fewer customers through the season. The route was not reopened the following year.|$|E

5|$|After {{his victory}} in the Spanish Civil War, Francisco Franco's plans for the Spanish Navy {{included}} the acquisition of four modern battleships, and {{a variation on the}} Italian s was the favored candidate to fill the requirement. In late 1939, a Spanish mission to Italy received assurances of technical support for the construction of ships of the class in Spanish yards, and a slipway <b>of</b> <b>sufficient</b> size to construct two ships at a time was built at Ferrol. However, Italy's entry into the Second World War in 1940, combined with the limited resources of Spain, led to the cancellation of the project.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{reflecting}} {{both the}} threat of possible invasion by the Soviet Union and the realities of nuclear warfare, Swiss military doctrine changed to that of a dynamic (mobile) defense that included missions for the Swiss Air Force outside of its territory, in order to defeat standoff attacks and nuclear threats, including the possibility of defensive employment of air-delivered nuclear weapons. However the inability to field an air force <b>of</b> <b>sufficient</b> capability to carry out such missions led to a return of traditional doctrine.|$|E

In 2006, Biman took the unprecedented step of removing the business–class seats from its dedicated Hajj flights to accommodate more economy-class passengers. Procedural irregularities by the Hajj agencies delayed the confirmation of pilgrims' visas, and Biman had to cancel 19 flights owing to lack <b>of</b> <b>sufficient</b> passengers.

5|$|Commercially viable natural {{deposits}} of graphite occur {{in many parts}} of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first <b>of</b> <b>sufficient</b> size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller {{deposits of}} graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.|$|E

Himmler then allowed a 10 percent Christian component, but the recruitment <b>of</b> <b>sufficient</b> Muslims continued to prove difficult, resulting in the induction of 2,800 Catholic Croats into the division. To Himmler's dismay, this was greater than the ratio of Catholics to Muslims that he had wanted.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{centralized}} logistical system, the Polish armies were encumbered {{by large}} baggage trains. To some degree, this was turned into an advantage {{with the development of}} the tabor– military horse-drawn wagons, usually carrying army supplies. The wagon use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent used by other Commonwealth units. The Commonwealth army relied on cavalry, which the nobility saw as a much more respectable type of a troop than the infantry. Despite the reforms of the 17th century, it lost much of its military significance in the 18th century; the primary reason for this was a lack <b>of</b> <b>sufficient</b> funding.|$|E
