5|$|The Nobel Prize medals, minted by Myntverket in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902, are {{registered}} trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal has an image <b>of</b> <b>Alfred</b> Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image <b>of</b> <b>Alfred</b> Nobel {{and the years}} of his birth and death (1833–1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design. The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design of Nature, as a Goddess, whose veil is held up by the Genius of Science. These medals and the ones for Physiology/Medicine and Literature were designed by Erik Lindberg in 1902.|$|E
5|$|The Nobel Prizes {{are awarded}} {{annually}} by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Swedish Academy, the Karolinska Institute, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee {{to individuals who}} make outstanding contributions {{in the fields of}} Chemistry, Physics, Literature, Peace, Physiology or Medicine and Economics. All but the economics prize were established by the 1895 will <b>of</b> <b>Alfred</b> Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. The Nobel prize in Economics, or The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory <b>of</b> <b>Alfred</b> Nobel, was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, for outstanding contributions in the field of Economics. Each prize is awarded by a separate committee; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics, the Swedish Academy awards the Prize in Literature, the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a cash prize that has varied throughout the years.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Bede in 735, Latin prose in England declined. It reached its lowest level in the ninth century, when few books and {{charters}} were produced, and they were of poor quality. King Æthelstan's grandfather, Alfred the Great (871–899) embarked on an extensive programme to improve learning, and by the 890s the standard of Latin in charters was improving. Few charters survive from the reigns <b>of</b> <b>Alfred</b> and his son, Edward the Elder (899–924), and none from 909 to 925. Up to then charters had generally been plain legal documents, and King Æthelstan's early diplomas were similar.|$|E
