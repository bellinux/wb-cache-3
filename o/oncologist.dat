5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an <b>oncologist,</b> is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror.

40|$|ObjectiveOncologists {{must have}} empathy when {{breaking}} bad news {{to patients who}} have incurable advanced cancer, {{and the level of}} empathy often depends on various individual characteristics. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between these characteristics and empathic behavior in Japanese <b>oncologists.</b> MethodsWe videotaped consultations in which <b>oncologists</b> conveyed news of incurable advanced cancer to simulated patients. Oncologists’ empathetic behaviors were coded, and regression analysis was performed to determine the existence of any relationships with factors such as age, sex, and specialism. ResultsSixty <b>oncologists</b> participated. In a multivariate model, only age was related to the empathy score (r = 0. 406, p = 0. 033); younger <b>oncologists</b> scored higher than did older <b>oncologists.</b> ConclusionsWe found that empathic behaviors were more frequent in younger <b>oncologists.</b> Practice implicationsThis information could be useful in determining the best approach for implementing future empathy and communication training programs for experienced <b>oncologists</b> in Japanese medical institutions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{interest}} in evidence-based medicine (EBM) is still increasing throughout medicine, but the precise role of EBM {{in the field}} of pediatric oncology remains unclear. We undertook this survey to evaluate the attitude of Dutch pediatric <b>oncologists</b> and pediatric <b>oncologists</b> in training towards EBM and their views on how to move from opinion-based medicine to EBM. PROCEDURE: A questionnaire was sent to all pediatric <b>oncologists</b> (n = 44) and pediatric <b>oncologists</b> in training (n = 13) of the 8 university medical centers in the Netherlands. RESULTS: The questionnaire was returned by 71 % of the pediatric <b>oncologists</b> and pediatric <b>oncologists</b> in training. The majority had a positive attitude towards EBM, but at the moment only approximately 50 % of their clinical practice was thought to be evidence-based. The most important barrier to practicing EBM in pediatric oncology was a lack of time. However, only a minority of the respondents thought that more time was an appropriate method to facilitate the use of EBM in pediatric oncology. The majority of pediatric <b>oncologists</b> and pediatric <b>oncologists</b> in training would prefer {{to be able to use}} EBM summaries, guidelines and protocols. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the positive attitude of the majority of pediatric <b>oncologists</b> and pediatric <b>oncologists</b> in training towards EBM, only half of clinical practice is currently believed to be evidence-based. By using EBM summaries, guidelines and protocols as time-saving methods the use of EBM in pediatric oncology practice may be improved. Pediatr Blood Cancer (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, In...|$|R

40|$|Background Although {{people with}} cancer {{want and need}} {{information}} from their <b>oncologists,</b> patients and <b>oncologists</b> often disagree about what information was discussed during clinical interactions. Most patients have companions present during oncology visits; we investigated whether companions process information more accurately than patients. Specifically, we examined whether patients and companions differed in agreement with <b>oncologists</b> about what was discussed. We also investigated the effect of topic on agreement and patient/companion self‐reported understanding of discussions. Methods Patients with companions {{were invited to participate}} on first visits to a cancer center in Detroit, MI. Patients, companions, and <b>oncologists</b> independently completed questionnaires immediately following visits. Participants were asked whether five topics were discussed (diagnosis, prognosis, metastasis, treatment/treatment goals, and side effects) and, if discussed, what <b>oncologists</b> said. Participants were also asked to estimate their own and each other's understanding of discussions. Results A total of 66 patient–companion–oncologist triads participated. Agreement was higher regarding whether topics were discussed than what <b>oncologists</b> said. Agreement did not differ by dyad type. Patients, companions, and <b>oncologists</b> were equally likely to be the source of triadic disagreements. Agreement was high about diagnosis (> 90 %) but much lower about other topics, particularly side effects. Patients and companions reported greater understanding of discussions than <b>oncologists</b> estimated and more accurately estimated each other's understanding than did <b>oncologists.</b> Conclusions Companions and patients showed similar levels of agreement with <b>oncologists</b> about what they discussed during visits. Interventions are needed to improve communication of information to both patients and companions, especially about particular topics. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The National Comprehensive Cancer Network {{clinical}} practice guidelines in oncology-gastric cancer guidelines {{have been widely}} used to provide appropriate recommendations for the treatment of patients with gastric cancer. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the adherence of surgical <b>oncologists,</b> medical <b>oncologists,</b> and radiation oncologists' to the recommended guidelines. Methods A questionnaire asking the treatment options for gastric cancer cases was sent to 394 Chinese oncology specialists, including surgical <b>oncologists,</b> medical <b>oncologists,</b> and radiation <b>oncologists</b> working in hospitals joined in The Western Cooperative Gastrointestinal Oncology Group of China. The questionnaire involved a series of clinical scenarios regarding the interpretation of surgery, neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and advanced treatment planning of gastric cancer. Results Analysis of 358 respondents (91 %) showed variations between each specialization and from the recommended guidelines in the management approaches to specific clinical scenarios. The majority of specialists admitted that less than 50 % of patients received multidisciplinary evaluation before treatment. The participants gave different responses to questions involving adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and advanced settings, compared to the recommended guidelines. Conclusions These results highlight the heterogeneity of the treatment of gastric cancer. Surgical <b>oncologists,</b> medical <b>oncologists,</b> and radiation <b>oncologists</b> are not adhering to the recommended guidelines. </p...|$|R

25|$|Cumulative {{effects from}} this process {{should not be}} {{confused}} with long-term effects—when short-term effects have disappeared and long-term effects are subclinical, reirradiation can still be problematic.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether UK <b>oncologists</b> follow current anthracycline dose modifications when treating patients with liver dysfunction was addressed through a questionnaire. <b>Oncologists</b> were asked the dose of doxorubicin or epirubicin they would prescribe for a woman with breast cancer and liver metastases who had one of four different patterns of abnormal liver chemistry. In each case, the median dose of anthracycline {{that would have been}} prescribed was close to that currently recommended. There was, however, wide variation in the dose that <b>oncologists</b> said they would prescribe, some avoiding an anthracycline altogether, whereas others would give full-dose treatment. Medical <b>oncologists</b> would prescribe a significantly lower dose of anthracycline than clinical <b>oncologists</b> for a patient with the most severely disturbed liver tests. Overall, medical <b>oncologists</b> were also significantly more likely to prescribe epirubicin. These results show the need for new, widely accepted anthracycline dose modifications for patients with liver dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Context: Nondisclosure {{of cancer}} {{diagnosis}} {{is common in}} many Eastern countries. Consequently, immigrant families often approach <b>oncologists</b> with requests for nondisclosure in Western countries. Aims: To explore differences in the attitudes and practices of Western-born and nonWestern born <b>oncologists</b> in Australia {{when faced with a}} nondisclosure request. Settings and Design: Using a cross-sectional design, <b>oncologists</b> were interviewed over the telephone. Methods: Using the snowball method, 14 Australian (Western = 9, non-Western = 5) <b>oncologists</b> were recruited. <b>Oncologists</b> participated in a semi-structured interview exploring their experiences of, and response to, a request for nondisclosure, and their perceptions of how their cultural background influenced these attitudes and responses. Analysis: The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: Six main themes emerged from the study: (1) Barriers to truthful communication, (2) an ethical and moral dilemma, (3) high costs of nondisclosure, (4) cultural influences on interpretation and understanding of requests for nondisclosure, (5) emotional impact of bad news on patients, families and <b>oncologists,</b> and (6) truthful disclosure as a gentle balancing act. Conclusions: All <b>oncologists</b> felt that the family request for nondisclosure was difficult, with many cultural and emotional nuances to take into consideration. Some immigrant Australian <b>oncologists</b> who had a similar cultural background as the patient/family, felt they could better understand the desire for nondisclosure. Irrespective of their cultural background, all <b>oncologists</b> acknowledged that breaking bad news had to be done in a gentle, gradual manner. The study suggests a need to develop a culturally sensitive cancer communication model...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that groups of cancer sub-specialists differ in their stated {{willingness}} to undergo treatment for diseases lying within their area of expertise. In order to learn whether <b>oncologists</b> feel similarly about other forms of cancer, medical, radiation, and surgical <b>oncologists</b> were asked to fill out a questionnaire indicating whether {{they would be willing to}} undergo either chemotherapy or radiation therapy for a variety of common malignancies, or recommend them to a spouse or sibling. Subjects were also asked whether they would undertake an experimental therapy (interleukin- 2) for any of three malignancies, or recommend such treatment to a spouse or relative. Fifty-one <b>oncologists</b> (14 radiation <b>oncologists,</b> 14 surgical <b>oncologists,</b> and 23 medical <b>oncologists)</b> were recruited from the staff of four university teaching hospitals. Although they agreed about accepting or declining therapy for some examples, there was considerable heterogeneity in their responses. In only 37 % of the 30 cases involving standard therapies did greater than or equal to 85 % of the <b>oncologists</b> agree that they would accept or refuse therapy. Only some of the variation of the responses could be attributed to the sub-specialty orientation of the <b>oncologists.</b> Physicians were as willing to recommend standard therapies for themselves as a spouse or sibling. Physicians were also divided in their opinion about whether they would accept a particular experimental therapy if diagnosed with one of three neoplasms. They were significantly more likely, however, to recommend it for a spouse or sibling than to accept it for themselves. Variation in the proportion of patients who receive anti-cancer therapies may relate, in part, to differences in opinion concerning the worth of such therapies among <b>oncologists</b> or primary physicians. This study shows that <b>oncologists</b> are quite heterogeneous with regard to their personal preferences for anti-cancer treatments for a variety of malignancies. Further studies are required to learn if such attitudes (among <b>oncologists</b> or primary physicians) directly affect the administration of such therapies...|$|R

40|$|Accuracy in the {{assessment}} of performance status by <b>oncologists</b> has not been well evaluated. We investigated possible discrepancies in {{the assessment}} of performance status among patients, nurses, and <b>oncologists,</b> and evaluated the prognostic importance of each assessment. Two hundred and six inpatients with inoperable, advanced non-small cell lung cancer were investigated prospectively. Weighted Kappa statistics for inter-observer agreement were 0. 53 between <b>oncologists</b> and patients and 0. 63 between <b>oncologists</b> and nurses. There was a significant difference among the assessments by the three groups (P < 0. 001). <b>Oncologists</b> gave the healthiest performance status assessment, nurses an intermediate assessment, and patients the poorest. When included separately in the Cox model, the assessment by each group was significantly correlated with survival. However, the assessment by the patients themselves failed to distinguish survival of patients with performance status 1 and 2. Among the three models including patient-, nurse-, and oncologist-assessed PS, that including oncologist-assessed PS best fitted to the observed survival data. These results showed that the assessment by the patients themselves is different from those by the nurses and the <b>oncologists</b> and provided additional support {{for the use of the}} assessment by <b>oncologists</b> in clinical oncology. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|R
