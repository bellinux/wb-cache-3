He {{was one of the}} Romanian delegates to the International Socialist Congress, hosted by the Second International in Stuttgart. It was there that Russian socialist <b>opinion</b> <b>leader</b> Vladimir Lenin publicized a thesis according to which the Romanian revolt and the Russian Revolution of 1905 were similar, in both character and impact. Back in Romania, Cocea was resuming his contacts with Dobrogeanu-Gherea, who was by then all but withdrawn from active socialist politics. As Cocea later wrote, the veteran leader confessed to him that he was being brought down by acute insomnia.|$|E

From 1990–1994 he was the parliamentary opposition leader and continued his outspoken and independent style when his party was part of the government from 1994.

2500|$|At {{some point}} in 1921, with Mussolini's acquiescence, Bacaloglu {{established}} an Italo–Romanian fascist association, later known as National Italo-Romanian Cultural and Economic Movement (MNFIR). Her followers began setting up fascist leagues in Romania—one {{of the very first}} such clubs was founded in the Transylvanian regional capital, Cluj. The main difference between the Italian and Romanian fascists was their respective stance on the [...] "Jewish Question": the Italo-Romanian Movement was antisemitic; the original Fasci were not. The goal was supported by other Constantin Bacaloglu, in his work at Iași University. Working with the antisemitic <b>opinion</b> <b>leader,</b> A. C. Cuza, he gave endorsement to rioters who called for the expulsion of most Romanian Jewish students, and tolerated fascist symbolism. However, according to political scientist Emanuela Costantini, the antisemitic agenda of the Movement was comparatively [...] "moderate"; she highlights instead Bacaloglu's other ideas: [...] "an anti-industrialism in the populist mold", and a version of nationalism heavily inspired by the Action Française.|$|E

Methods: We surveyed surgeons and pathologists in Ontario to identify <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> for colorectal cancer in 2003 and 2005 and to identify <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> for breast cancer in 2005. We explored whether <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> for colorectal cancer identified in 2003 were re-identified in 2005.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{only limited}} {{empirical}} {{evidence about the}} effectiveness of <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> as health care change agents. Aim To test the feasibility of identifying, and the characteristics of, <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> using a sociometric instrument and a self-designating instrument in different professional groups within the UK National Health Service. Design Postal questionnaire survey. Setting and participants All general practitioners, practice nurses and practice managers in two regions of Scotland. All physicians and surgeons (junior hospital doctors and consultants) and medical and surgical nursing staff in two district general hospitals and one teaching hospital in Scotland, as well as all Scottish obstetric and gynaecology, and oncology consultants. Results Using the sociometric instrument, the extent of social networks and potential coverage of the study population in primary and secondary care was highly idiosyncratic. In contrast, relatively complex networks with good coverage rates were observed in both national specialty groups. Identified <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> {{were more likely to have}} the expected characteristics of <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> identified from diffusion and social influence theories. Moreover, <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> appeared to be condition-specific. The self-designating instrument identified more <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders,</b> but it was not possible to estimate the extent and structure of social networks or likely coverage by <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders.</b> There was poor agreement in the responses to the sociometric and self-designating instruments. Conclusion The feasibility of identifying <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> using an off-the-shelf sociometric instrument is variable across different professional groups and settings within the NHS. Whilst it is possible to identify <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> using a self-designating instrument, the effectiveness of such <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> has not been rigorously tested in health care settings. <b>Opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> appear to be monomorphic (different leaders for different issues). Recruitment of <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> is unlikely to be an effective general strategy across all settings and professional groups; the more specialised the group, the more <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> may be a useful strategy. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Marketers target {{influential}} {{people on}} social media who are recognised as being opinion leaders and opinion-formers to send messages to their target audiences and amplify {{the impact of their}} message. A social media post by an <b>opinion</b> <b>leader</b> can have a much greater impact (via the forwarding of the post or [...] "liking" [...] of the post) than a social media post by a regular user. Marketers have come to the understanding that [...] "consumers are more prone to believe in other individuals" [...] who they trust (Sepp, Liljander, & Gummerus, 2011). OL's and OF's can also send their own messages about products and services they choose (Fill, Hughes, & De Francesco, 2013, p.216). The reason the <b>opinion</b> <b>leader</b> or formers have such a strong following base is because their opinion is valued or trusted (Clement, Proppe, & Rott, 2007). They can review products and services for their followings, which can be positive or negative towards the brand. OL's and OF's are people who have a social status and because of their personality, beliefs, values etc. have the potential to influence other people (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189). They usually have a large number of followers otherwise known as their reference, membership or aspirational group (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189. By having an OL or OF support a brands product by posting a photo, video or written recommendation on a blog, the following may be influenced and because they trust the OL/OF a high chance of the brand selling more products or creating a following base. Having an OL/OF helps spread word of mouth talk amongst reference groups and/or memberships groups e.g. family, friends, work-friends etc. (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189). The adjusted communication model shows the use of using opinion leaders and opinion formers. The sender/source gives the message to many, many OL's/OF's who pass the message on along with their personal opinion, the receiver (followers/groups) form their own opinion and send their personal message to their group (friends, family etc.) [...] (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010, p.39).|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{critical}} role that <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> (or influentials) play in the adoption process of new products. Recent existing reseach evidence indicates a limited effect of <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> on diffusion processes, yet these studies take into account merely the network position of <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> without addressing their influential power. Empirical findings of our study show that <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders,</b> {{in addition to having}} a more central network position, possess more accurate knowledge about a product and tend to be less susceptible to norms and more innovative. Experiments that address these attributes, using an agent-based model, demonstrate that <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> increase the speed of the information stream and the adoption process itself. Furthermore, they increase the maximum adoption percentage. These results indicate that targeting <b>opinion</b> <b>leaders</b> remains a valuable marketing strategy...|$|R

5000|$|Opinion Leaders can {{act like}} {{reference}} groups {{in that they}} exert considerable social influence because of their product knowledge, expertise and credibility. In the marketing literature, opinion leaders are also known as influencers, mavens and even hubs.
