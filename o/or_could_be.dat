5|$|Many {{fragments}} {{that are}} securely {{attributed to the}} Catalogue, {{some of which are}} relatively substantial, cannot be placed within the poem because their content is either too obscure <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> assigned to different individuals or genealogies which are themselves difficult to locate within the five books.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} many {{disclosures}} and exposés dating {{as far back as}} the 18th century. These often lack context, may be outdated for various reasons, <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> outright hoaxes on the part of the author, as in the case of the Taxil hoax.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{religions}} were tolerated {{insofar as}} they did not interfere with public order, <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> assimilated with the traditional Roman religion. The worship of Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty, to an extent not seen again until the reign of Commodus. Veneration of Serapis and Isis, who were identified with Jupiter and Minerva respectively, was especially prominent.|$|E

3000|$|In many cases, some notifiers {{classified}} the substance, {{whereas others}} did not. <b>Could</b> the differences <b>be</b> due to differences {{of the biological}} material used? <b>Or</b> <b>could</b> they <b>be</b> due to pesticidal or other contaminations, impurities, solvent residues, or added stabilizers <b>or</b> preservatives? <b>Or</b> <b>could</b> they <b>be</b> due to oxidation or other reaction processes of the ingredients?

50|$|Mollie later pulls Trotter aside; Trotter {{says that}} while the police suspect the elder boy to be the killer, the dead boy also had {{relatives}} and loved ones who {{might be interested in}} revenge: the children's father, an Army sergeant, for example; or the dead boy's sister, who would now be a young woman. Trotter notes that Metcalf <b>or</b> Paravicini <b>could</b> <b>be</b> the father, Miss Casewell <b>or</b> Mollie <b>could</b> <b>be</b> the sister, and Giles <b>could</b> <b>be</b> the elder boy. Mollie, aghast, objects to the notion that either she <b>or</b> Giles <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a murderer, but Trotter forces her to admit that they know little about each other's pasts.|$|R
5|$|Section 2 {{gives the}} third party various protections {{once they have}} chosen to enforce the act - the parties cannot alter or end the {{contract}} if the third party has told them that he wishes to enforce the contract or relied on the contract (and the promisor knows this <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> expected to have known this). If the contract is breached, the third party has all the rights {{that he would have}} if he had been a party to the initial contract.|$|E
5|$|The OT {{supplied}} {{supervisors and}} labour {{as well as}} organising supplies, machinery and transport to supplement the staff and equipment of construction companies, {{many of them were}} German however construction companies in occupied counties bid for contracts. Companies could apply for OT work <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> conscripted. Companies failing to complete their work on time, which was always possible as the OT controlled the material and manpower of each firm, could find themselves closed down, or more likely fined, or taken over or merged with another firm to make a more efficient larger unit, successful firms however could make attractive profits.|$|E
5|$|Tillman was the {{dominant}} {{figure of the}} convention, chairing the Committee on the Rights of Suffrage, which was to craft language to accomplish the disenfranchisement. Constrained by the requirement of the federal Fifteenth Amendment that men of all races be allowed to vote, the committee sought language that though superficially nondiscriminatory would operate <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to take the vote from most African Americans.|$|E
50|$|FUN1 <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{called to}} set T to 1 before falling into FUN2 <b>or</b> T <b>could</b> <b>be</b> set to {{something}} else and call FUN2. If T register specified which file handle to write to then either FUN1 <b>could</b> <b>be</b> called to always output to terminal <b>or</b> T <b>could</b> <b>be</b> specified to handle a file itself in T and call FUN2 to output to that file.|$|R
50|$|A powder flask <b>or</b> powder horn <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{used to hold}} black powder. Powder {{measures}} were small tube-like devices used to measure out exact amounts of powder. Once measured, the powder <b>could</b> <b>be</b> loaded directly into the barrel, <b>or</b> it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> placed in a paper cartridge for later loading.|$|R

5|$|The Hello Pappy scandal, {{alluding}} to the nickname of involved host Willie Revillame and the Hello Garci scandal, was a scandal surrounding an incident during the August 20, 2007 episode of the Filipino variety show Wowowee, broadcast by ABS-CBN. During the episode, a technical error occurred during the final jackpot round of the show's Wilyonaryo segment which raised allegations within the media that the segment was, <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> rigged by the producers. The incident prompted {{an investigation by the}} country's Department of Trade and Industry, and was also the catalyst of an on-air feud between Revillame and Joey de Leon, a personality from the rival GMA Network.|$|E
5|$|The main method {{employed}} by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1960s and 70s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often {{powered by a}} car battery), with a long wire antenna slung up between two trees. Around this time, VHF/FM transmitters were being built by more adventurous builders. A surge in pirate radio occurred when cheap portable transmitters became available and by the mid-1980s a 50 watt radio transmitter could be obtained for around £200, <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> built for less. The operation of a pirate radio station required a good quality cassette recorder, a transmitter and a high roof, with tower blocks providing the ideal transmission site for pirate radio stations. A 40 watt transmitter broadcasting {{from the roof of}} a fifteen storey tower block could reach a forty-mile radius. Radio shows were often pre-recorded at home, with the pirate radio station operators setting up temporary transmitters on the roof of tower blocks.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the earlier}} {{probation}} statute (repealed 1987), a defendant convicted of violating a statute which provided for a mandatory minimum sentence {{could still be}} placed on probation, with his sentence suspended, <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made eligible for immediate parole. Since United States v. Booker, the sentencing guidelines have become advisory but courts are nonetheless unable to impose probation {{in lieu of a}} mandatory minimum imposed by statute.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent to}} which Dodgson's Alice may be <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{identified}} with Liddell is controversial. The two Alices are clearly not identical, and though it was long assumed that the fictional Alice was based very heavily on Liddell, recent research has contradicted this assumption. Dodgson himself claimed in later years that his Alice was entirely imaginary and not based upon any real child at all.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in understanding sexual harassment, is that it involves a range of behaviors. In most cases (although not in all cases) {{it is difficult for}} the victim to describe what they experienced. This can be related to difficulty classifying the situation <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> related to stress and humiliation experienced by the recipient. Moreover, behavior and motives vary between individual cases.|$|E

25|$|UzAvtosanoat is {{the only}} truck {{manufacturer}} of Central Asia and plans to become a monopolistic company of the commercial vehicle sector. After the collapse of their former SamKochAvto joint venture, MAN is a promising partner for the company. Håkan Samuelsson, the German contract agent of MAN, was involved into the MAN-bribes scandal which became known in the late 2009. There have been suggestions that the UzAvtosanoat entangled in it, <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> affected.|$|E
25|$|Justus Lipsius {{invented a}} {{specific}} terminology to distinguish {{different forms of}} what could be called a cross or crux. His basic twofold distinction was between the crux simplex (a simple stake) and the crux compacta (a composite of two pieces of wood). The victim could be affixed to the crux simplex <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> impaled on it. Lipsius then subdivided the crux compacta into three types: the crux decussata (X-shaped), crux commissa (T-shaped) and crux immissa (†-shaped).|$|E
25|$|Logistics, nonetheless, {{were very}} bad for both armies, {{supported}} by whatever equipment was left over from World War I <b>or</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> captured. The Polish Army, for example, employed guns made in five countries, and rifles manufactured in six, each using different ammunition. The Soviets had many military depots at their disposal, left by withdrawing German armies in 1918–19, and modern French armaments captured in great numbers from the White Russians and the Allied expeditionary forces in the Russian Civil War. Still, they suffered a shortage of arms; both the Red Army and the Polish forces were grossly underequipped by Western standards.|$|E
50|$|Strict press {{censorship}} {{was enacted}} by a decree from 17 February 1852. No newspaper dealing with political <b>or</b> social questions <b>could</b> <b>be</b> published without {{the permission of}} the government, fines were increased, and the list of press offenses was greatly expanded. After three warnings, a newspaper <b>or</b> journal <b>could</b> <b>be</b> suspended <b>or</b> even permanently closed.|$|R
