Many varnishes and paints are well known emitters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> be acidic, and thus {{have the potential to}} damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these coatings should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.|$|E

5|$|A {{string of}} forts was {{constructed}} in the north-east (some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> date from the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely {{known to have been}} permanently occupied during this incursion before the troops were withdrawn again to Hadrian's Wall circa 213. There is some evidence that these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, both <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> {{increase the risk}} because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E

5|$|After the Mariner and Viking {{spacecraft}} {{had returned}} pictures of Mars as it really is, an apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars {{had to be}} abandoned, and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, the best known <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> be Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy. Pseudo-scientific speculations about the Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations {{continue to be a}} popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{possibility is}} that 55 Cancri e is a solid planet made of carbon-rich material rather than the oxygen-rich material that makes up the terrestrial planets in our solar system. In this case, roughly {{a third of the}} planet's mass would be carbon, much <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> be in the form of diamond {{as a result of the}} temperatures and pressures in the planet's interior.

5|$|Benzylpiperazine is, however, to be {{the subject}} of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) risk assessment, the results <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> {{determine}} what, if any, control will placed on BZP throughout the European Union. The risk assessment comes about {{as the result of a}} joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007. The report concluded that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008.|$|E

5|$|Dinefwr Park has {{a history}} of {{occupation}} spanning at least two millennia. A polished stone axe dated to the Neolithic period was unearthed on the site in 1976, and during the Iron Age, a farm existed on the property. The Romans later built a pair of forts here, with one partly overlying the other. There are traces of Roman roads and tracks, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> {{have been part of the}} Carmarthen–Llandovery Roman road. A Roman milestone and a coin hoard were unearthed near Dinefwr Castle, and pieces of amphorae and Samian items have been excavated near Dinefwr Farm.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Patterson {{engaged in}} a gun duel with the Japanese column. Patterson {{received}} a shell hit aft, causing moderate damage and killing 10 crew members. Patterson continued to pursue and fire at the Japanese ships and may have hit Kinugasa, causing moderate damage. Patterson then {{lost sight of the}} Japanese column as it headed northeast along the eastern shore of Savo Island. Bagley, whose crew sighted the Japanese shortly after Patterson and Canberra, circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes {{in the general direction of}} the rapidly disappearing Japanese column; one or two <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> have hit Canberra. Bagley played no further role in the battle. Yūnagi exchanged non-damaging gunfire with Jarvis before exiting the battle area to the west with the intention of eventually rejoining the Japanese column north and west of Savo Island.|$|E
5|$|Flies are {{adapted for}} aerial {{movement}} and typically have short and streamlined bodies. The first tagma of the fly, the head, bears the eyes, the antennae, and the mouthparts (the labrum, labium, mandible, and maxilla {{make up the}} mouthparts). The second tagma, the thorax, bears the wings and contains the flight muscles on the second segment, which is greatly enlarged; {{the first and third}} segments have been reduced to collar-like structures, and the third segment bears the halteres, which help to balance the insect during flight. The third tagma is the abdomen consisting of 11 segments, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> be fused, and with the 3 hindermost segments modified for reproduction.|$|E

Ashbee also suspected that sarsens from this monument had been broken up for use in the repairs and extensions to the local church in the nineteenth century. The barrow was further damaged by the construction of the small road running through the middle of it.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Faisalabad {{was among}} four districts in Punjab, which {{included}} Gujranwala, Jhelum and Gujrat, that were experiencing low literacy rates, due primarily {{to either a}} lack of resources or family pressure; the latter <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> also be attributable to illiteracy. In 1998, Faisalabad progressed to a higher literacy rate with the most improvement realised at the primary school level. In 2008, Faisalabad District ranked 51.9% which placed the district 9th in literacy out of the 34 Punjab districts.|$|E

5|$|Insects possess {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} a hard-jointed outer covering, the exoskeleton, made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, one to three simple eyes (ocelli) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax {{and one or two}} pairs of wings. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> be fused and houses the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive systems. There is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Male spiders {{identify}} themselves {{by a variety}} of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females. Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short life spans. Females weave silk egg-cases, each <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> contain hundreds of eggs. Females of many species care for their young, for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them. A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals. Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, to co-operative hunting and food-sharing. Although most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Most insects, however, lead short {{lives as}} adults, and rarely {{interact}} {{with one another}} except to mate or compete for mates. A small number exhibit some form of parental care, where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> be simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food. This sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps.|$|E
