30|$|Increased production, {{oligomerization}} and aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are hallmark pathologies <b>of</b> Alzheimer’s disease (<b>AD).</b> Expressing familial AD mutations (amyloid {{precursor protein}} and/or presenilins mutations), the Aβ-pathologies <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> has been recapitulated in animal models <b>of</b> <b>AD.</b> Very few primary cell culture-based models <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> {{are available and}} they exhibit very weak Aβ-pathologies compared to what is seen in AD patients and animal models <b>of</b> <b>AD.</b> CNS stem/progenitor cells are present in both embryonic and adult brains. They can be isolated, grown as neurospheres and differentiated into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. It is not yet known whether CNS stem/progenitor cells can support the production of Aβ peptides in culture. In this report, we have established Aβ-pathologies such as production, secretion, oligomerization and aggregation of Aβ peptides utilizing neurosphere cultures {{to create a new}} cellular model <b>of</b> <b>AD.</b> These cultures were developed from E 15 embryonic brains of transgenic mice carrying the Swedish mutations in humanized mouse APP cDNA and the exon- 9 deleted human presenilin 1 cDNA both regulated by mouse prion protein gene (Prnp) promoter. Results demonstrated the expression of transgene transcripts, APPswe protein and its processed products only in transgene positive neurosphere cultures. These cultures generate and secrete both Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 peptides into culture medium at levels comparable to the Aβ load in the brain <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> patients and animal models <b>of</b> <b>AD,</b> and produce pathogenic oligomers of Aβ peptides. The Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 ratio in the medium of transgene positive neurosphere cultures is higher than any known cellular models <b>of</b> <b>AD.</b> Conformation dependent immunocytochemistry demonstrated the possible presence of intracellular and extracellular aggregation of Aβ peptides in neurosphere cultures, which are also seen in AD brain and animal models <b>of</b> <b>AD.</b> Collectively, our neurosphere cultures provide robust Aβ-pathologies <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> better than existing cellular model of Alzheimer’s disease.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{volume of}} {{research}} involving adjustment disorder (AD) is limited. The scientific neglect <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> seems {{to result from}} the inadequate operationalisation <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> in DSM-IV and ICD- 10. The aims of the present proposal are to discuss the shortcomings <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> conceptualisations and to present recommendations for the future. Sampling and methods: This conceptual paper {{is based on an}} iterative process of debate between the authors. Results: The current operational definition <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> is characterised by 3 main limitations: (1) the inadequately defined clinical significance criterion, (2) the relegation <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> behind other diagnoses and (3) the missed recognition of the importance of contextual factors, such that normal human adaptive processes might be pathologised. Furthermore, subtypes <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> lack operational clarity. Based on a discussion of the limitations, recommendations for DSM-V are presented, including the addition of new subtypes. Conclusions: The revision <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> criteria will reduce the likelihood of false-positive and false-negative diagnoses. These changes will enable the scientific exploration of this common and relevant disorder, and will make epidemiological studies, and ultimately service planning based on these, more reliable than at present...|$|R

40|$|Insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), {{part of an}} {{evolutionary}} conserved signaling pathway in both mammalian and non-mammalian species, is inferred in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A murine model for AD shows that reduced IGF- 1 signaling prevents AD-like characteristics. However, variation in serum levels of IGF- 1 and risk <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> in humans {{has yet to be}} determined. We used a proven family design, comparing middle-aged offspring with and without a parental history <b>of</b> <b>AD.</b> The offspring under study carry an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> but do not yet experience cognitive impairment. A total of 206 offspring from 92 families with a parental history <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> were compared with 200 offspring from 97 families without a parental history <b>of</b> <b>AD.</b> Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotypes and serum IGF- 1 levels were compared in subjects with and without a parental history <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> using linear regression, adjusted for APOE genotype and other possible demographic and clinical confounders.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Published studies now show a clear {{association}} between Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) and the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele (APOE* epsilon 4). The clinical {{value of this}} information to estimate a healthy individual 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime risk <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> has not been well delineated. Physicians dealing with AD may not know either the lifetime risk <b>of</b> developing <b>AD</b> or {{the effect of the}} APOE genotype on this risk. Because the lifetime risk <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> depends in part on life expectancy, and available figures on APOE are not population based, a computation is necessary to derive risk estimates useful to physicians. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the lifetime risk <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> and the effect of APOE genotype information on that risk and to assess the knowledge of these risks among physicians who manage patients with dementia. DESIGN: Estimation <b>of</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> and survey <b>of</b> physician awareness. The lifetime risk <b>of</b> developing <b>AD</b> without APOE genotype information was first computed for 65 -year-olds from existing epidemiologic studies <b>of</b> age-related <b>AD</b> incidence and an actuarial life-table analysis. Using this computed a priori risk <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> and published studies of APOE genotypes in individuals with and without AD, we used a Bayesian analysis to determine the risk <b>of</b> developing <b>AD,</b> with and without an APOE* epsilon 4 allele, for unaffected 65 -year-olds. To assess physician knowledge of the lifetime risk <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> and the effect of APOE genotyping on the risk, 50 neurologists, internists, geriatricians, geriatric psychiatrists, and family physicians who manage patients with dementia were randomly selected to participate in a questionnaire-driven telephone survey. RESULTS: In a person with no family history <b>of</b> <b>AD,</b> the epidemiologic/actuarial lifetime risk <b>of</b> <b>AD</b> is approximately 15...|$|R
