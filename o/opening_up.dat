5|$|Increased {{experimental}} precision {{combined with}} vastly improved scientific instrumentation was <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> exciting new fields.

5|$|The {{freedom to}} display {{femininity}} and gender equality seem incompatible in Chinese society. Gender equality appeared prevailing only when women were restricted to desexualization in the Mao era. <b>Opening</b> <b>up</b> policy guarantees women's freedom for resexualization, but it simultaneously brings back gender inequality.|$|E

5|$|A local architect, Thomas Fosbrooke, {{carried out}} the first archaeological {{investigation}} of the site in 1900, and extensive restoration work took place the following years. The Rawdon family were given a government grant for further repairs in 1912 {{and they began to}} start charging visitors for entry. The family found themselves unable to afford to maintain the castle, and by the early 1930s the walls had become unstable and dangerous. The castle was placed into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1932, who carried out repairs, replacing some stonework and <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> the surrounding grounds to visitors.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> of China {{from the}} 1980s, tomb robbery was rampant and many {{artifacts}} were looted and smuggled {{across the border}} to Hong Kong, then a British territory. Ma Chengyuan was active in recovering many of the items from the Hong Kong antique market. In 1992, he purchased the 3,000-year-old Jin Hou Su bianzhong (晉侯穌鐘), which were listed by the Chinese government {{as one of the first}} 64 national treasures forbidden to be exhibited abroad in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.|$|E

Quintin Speers also helped drivers by pushing cars to safety and distributing blankets to those in need.|$|E
5|$|As {{outlined}} in the 3,500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to {{his opposition to the}} hydrogen bomb. By including the hydrogen bomb, the AEC changed the character of the hearing, by <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> an inquiry into his activities as a postwar government adviser.|$|E

Phát's promotion coincided with a coup by General Nguyễn Khánh against the officers who removed Diệm. Many of these, such as Generals Trần Văn Đôn, Lê Văn Kim, Tôn Thất Đính and Mai Hữu Xuân were put under house arrest, <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> vacancies for other generals.|$|E

5|$|Henry's son, John, {{inherited}} the castle in 1780, {{but when his}} son, also called John, inherited in 1816 he chose to live in London instead, <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> Dunster Castle to the public. By 1845 the castle appeared to visitors to be past its prime: with only two of John's sisters living there and no horses or hunting dogs left in the castle grounds, the remaining servants had little to do. John's brother Henry inherited in 1857, but he too lived in London rather than at Dunster.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} {{aviation}} market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, Indonesia {{is not yet a}} full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E
5|$|Later, the cytological {{basis of}} the gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} extended from about 1900–1944 and was initiated by the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's (1822–1884) laws of plant heredity first published in 1866 in Experiments on Plant Hybridization and based on cultivated pea, Pisum sativum: this heralded the <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> of plant genetics. The cytological basis for gene-chromosome theory was explored through the role of polyploidy and hybridization in speciation and it was becoming better understood that interbreeding populations were the unit of adaptive change in biology.|$|E

50|$|Alidades A and C {{are similar}} to B but have a slit or {{circular}} hole without a wire. In the diagram, the openings are exaggerated in size to show the shape; they would be smaller in a real alidade, perhaps 2 mm or so in width. One can look through the openings and line the <b>openings</b> <b>up</b> with the object {{of interest in the}} distance. With a small opening, the error in sighting the object is small. However, if a dim object such as a star is observed through a small hole, the image is difficult to see.|$|R
5|$|More new lands were <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> to European colonial powers, {{the botanical}} riches being {{returned}} to European botanists for description. This was a romantic era of botanical explorers, intrepid plant hunters and gardener-botanists. Significant botanical collections came from: the West Indies (Hans Sloane (1660–1753)); China (James Cunningham); the spice {{islands of the}} East Indies (Moluccas, George Rumphius (1627–1702)); China and Mozambique (João de Loureiro (1717–1791)); West Africa (Michel Adanson (1727–1806)) who devised his own classification scheme and forwarded a crude theory of the mutability of species; Canada, Hebrides, Iceland, New Zealand by Captain James Cook's chief botanist Joseph Banks (1743–1820).|$|E
5|$|NBN {{was one of}} many {{stations}} {{opposed to}} aggregation, and offered an alternative by <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> a second station which it would operate {{for a period of time}} before selling it. This proposal was however rejected, and aggregation occurred on 31 December 1991, with NBN acquiring Nine Network affiliation. Following aggregation, the station's coverage expanded to cover all of northern New South Wales, whilst concurrently programming extended to twenty-four hours in a day, in stereophonic sound. In 1994, NBN Television's logo was updated to a pseudo-Nine logo, similar to fellow affiliate WIN Television.|$|E
5|$|Neither he nor Greenfield had {{run as a}} {{candidate}} in the election, and neither {{was a member of}} the legislature. Percival Baker, the UFA member elected for Ponoka, had died on election day, <b>opening</b> <b>up</b> a seat for one of them. A second seat, Peace River, became available when incumbent Donald MacBeth Kennedy resigned to run in the 1921 federal election. Greenfield seemed a more reasonable candidate for that rugged northern riding than the urban lawyer Brownlee, and so Brownlee was acclaimed as Ponoka's MLA December 9, 1921.|$|E
