5|$|A {{number of}} species are adapted to {{spending}} {{a portion of their}} time feeding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> a very small minority have abandoned trees entirely and nest in holes in the ground. The ground woodpecker is one such species, inhabiting the rocky and grassy hills of South Africa, and the Andean flicker is another.|$|E
5|$|Active {{during the}} night, Transandinomys talamancae lives <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> eats plants and insects. Males move more and have larger home ranges than females. It breeds {{throughout}} the year, but few individuals survive {{for more than}} a year. After a gestation period of about 28 days, two to five young are born, which reach sexual maturity within two months. A variety of parasites occur on this species. Widespread and common, it is of no conservation concern.|$|E
5|$|Apple scab: Apple scab causes {{leaves to}} develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also {{develops}} similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple leaves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.|$|E

5|$|Crickets {{are found}} in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies {{are found in}} the upper tree canopy, in bushes, and among grasses and herbs. They also occur <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> in caves, and some are subterranean, {{excavating}} shallow or deep burrows. Some make galleries in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of pools.|$|E
5|$|Distraction {{displays}} {{attract the}} attention of predators away from an object, typically the nest or young, that is being protected. Distraction displays are performed by some species of birds, which may feign a broken wing while hopping about <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> by some species of fish.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{foraging}} birds may feed actively on {{the substrate}} or pick grains dropped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> these strategies may be chosen {{according to the}} situation. Early departures occur more often when expected searching time decreases and when competition intensity increases. Competition intensity {{is expected to increase}} when more scroungers are present or when patches are smaller.|$|E

5|$|In the game, Richardson set a {{new career}} high with his 203 rushing yards and tied Mark Ingram Jr. for the most 100-yard rushing games in a season with nine. The defense held Auburn to 140 total yards of offense, with only 78 yards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> zero {{offensive}} touchdowns in the victory. The victory brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 41–34–1.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the ground}} {{consisted}} {{only of the}} pitch, around which an estimated 12,000spectators could congregate. The addition of stands in 1891 increased the capacity to about 15,000.

5|$|It has {{a unique}} method of {{capturing}} tent-making bats. It looks for roosting bats by looking for their tents (which are made of a folded leaf). When it finds a bat it climbs {{to a higher level}} and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat.

5|$|The British {{suffered}} casualties as well. No. 17 Squadron {{lost one}} Hurricane and one pilot killed. No. 32 Squadron suffered {{the loss of}} one Hurricane destroyed; No. 65 Squadron lost one Hurricane shot down and one pilot missing. No. 111 Squadron lost one Hurricane destroyed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> one damaged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> three shot down in aerial combat, but all pilots survived. No. 501 Squadron suffered heavy losses amounting to five Hurricanes destroyed, two pilots killed, one seriously wounded. No. 601 lost two Hurricanes and both pilots killed while No. 602 Squadron lost three Spitfires and one damaged with one pilot wounded. No. 615 Squadron also took crippling casualties. It lost three Hurricanes with one pilot killed and another wounded. However, a further six of their Hurricanes were destroyed in the Kenley raid by 9 Staffel./KG 76. The casualties of 615 have been challenged by another source which indicates 615 Squadron lost only three {{on the ground at}} Kenley (P3158, P3487, R4186).|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{believed}} they had struck a mortal blow against the ALA. German post-operation analysis indicated a resounding success. It suggested {{a long list of}} wrecked French factories and destroyed aircraft <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> in the air. The Germans claimed to have destroyed 75 French aircraft in the air and 400 on the ground. Such was the perceived success, the Luftwaffe concentrated against ports on the northern French coast thereafter. The damage inflicted by the Luftwaffe was far less than the Germans thought. Only 20 French aircraft (16 of them fighters) were destroyed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> 15 of their fighters were shot down in aerial combat, a loss rate of 19 percent, suggesting German over claiming of over 4:1 in the air and 16:1 on the ground. Six of the sixteen airfields hit reported serious damage, while fifteen factories reported slight damage. French casualties on the ground were heavy, including 254 dead and 652 injured. The French shot down 10 German aircraft, including four bombers. They claimed 16, suggesting mutual over claiming. A further 21 vehicles were destroyed. All the French airfields were back in operation 48 hours later.|$|E
