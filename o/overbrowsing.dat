We sampled study plots with 16 1 -m 2 quadrats and recorded herb and tree seedling species presence and abundance.

Plants also differ in their palatability to herbivores. At high densities of herbivores, plants that are highly selected as browse may be missing small and large individuals from the population. At the community level, intense browsing by deer in forests leads to reductions in the abundance of palatable understory herbaceous shrubs, and increases in graminoid and bryophyte abundance which are released from competition for light.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} causes of overabundant herbivores and {{subsequent}} <b>overbrowsing.</b> Herbivores {{are introduced to}} landscapes in which native plants have not evolved to withstand browsing, and predators have not adapted to hunt the invading species. In other cases, populations of herbivores exceed historic levels due to reduced hunting or predation pressure. For example, carnivores declined in North America throughout the last century and hunting regulations became stricter, contributing to increased cervid populations across North America. Also, landscape changes due to human development, such as in agriculture and forestry, can create fragmented forest patches between which deer travel, browsing in early successional habitat at the periphery. Agricultural fields and young silvicultural stands provide deer with high quality food leading to overabundance and increased browsing pressure on forest understory plants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Overbrowsing</b> {{can lead}} plant {{communities}} towards equilibrium states which are only reversible if herbivore numbers are greatly reduced for a sufficient period, and actions {{are taken to}} restore the original plant communities. Management to reduce deer populations takes a three-pronged approach: (1) large areas of contiguous old forest with closed canopies are set aside, (2) predator populations are increased, and (3) hunting of the overabundant herbivore is increased. Refugia {{in the form of}} windthrow mounds, rocky outcrops, or horizontal logs elevated above the forest floor can provide plants with substrate protected from browsing by cervids. These refugia can contain a proportion of the plant community that would exist without browsing pressure, and may differ significantly from the flora found in nearby browsed areas.

40|$|A {{century of}} fire {{suppression}} and <b>overbrowsing</b> by deer have likely altered patterns of forest regeneration, with detrimental {{consequences for the}} future diversity, composition, and function of old-growth stands. We quantified the diversity and composition of tree species in the canopy and understory layers of 19 old-growth stands in Pennsylvania to evaluate the consequences of existing regeneration patterns for the future composition of these communities. Despite relatively high canopy diversity across all stands, the understory composition of all stands converged to a homogeneous subset of the canopy species. In addition, understory layers had unusually low stem densities, lower species diversity than their respective canopies, and showed a significant lack of mid-tolerant species. Oak species, which often require fire to regenerate, were common in the canopy of 12 stands, but absent from the understory layer of all stands. Our findings suggest that deer browsing and fire suppression are partly responsible for this dramatic alteration of understory species composition.

40|$|Forest {{managers}} are often required to restore forest stands following natural disturbances, {{a situation that}} may become more common and more challenging under global change. In parts of Central Europe, particularly in mountain regions dominated by mixed temperate forests, the use of relatively low intensity, uneven-aged silviculture is a common management approach. Because this type of management is based on mimicking less intense disturbances, the restoration of more severe disturbance patches within forested landscapes has received little attention. The goal {{of this paper is}} to synthesize research on the restoration of forests damaged by disturbances in temperate forests of Slovenia and neighbouring regions of Central Europe, where uneven-aged silviculture is practiced. Research indicates that active management aimed at favouring mixed uneven-aged forest reduces the risk of disturbance and improves the resilience of stands. Salvage logging may have positive or negative effects on regeneration, much of which is due to the method applied and the quality of work. The most prominent factors that negatively affect restoration are: lack of advanced regeneration and decomposed woody debris, high altitude, steep slopes, dense ground vegetation, and <b>overbrowsing.</b> Planting or sowing should be applied in post-disturbance forests where many negative factors interact and where a high demand for sustainability of forest ecosystem services is present...|$|E

This is due to good site quality, prevalence of conifers (84 %) and dominant endogenous processes in recent decades. In all three OG forests, indicators of structural change exhibited progression of European beech over time. Historical evidence revealed the occurrence of warm summers and droughts followed by bark beetle outbreaks in the 1920 s, 1940 s and early 1950 s, which in turn influenced a marked conifer decline.

Beneficial effects of restoration will arise from scientifically based practices that are efficient and effective. On the island of Newfoundland, moose (Alces alces) have become overabundant since their introduction in early 1900 ’s. Intensive selective browsing by moose on foundation species such as balsam fir (Abies balsamea) interacts with natural insect disturbance and limits advanced regeneration, creating moose meadows.

Results indicate that (1) priority for restoration should be given to insectdisturbed areas > 5 ha rather than smaller gaps, and (2) that active restoration should be implemented following scientifically determined field planting protocols, as no substantial benefit was detected following ground treatment.

Herbivore <b>overbrowsing</b> can have profound effects on ecosystem processes through overconsumption or by altering organic inputs of leaves and roots as well as changing soil physical and chemical properties. We evaluated the fate of transplanted seedlings of four tropical tree species and nutrient availability in open control plots and enclosed plots that permitted free access by insects and excluded vertebrates and collected soil samples in old-fields, early secondary forests and old-growth forests. Seedling damage predominantly occurred in the dry season and produced an overall seedling mortality of 72 %, with values of 43 % and 86 % in the plots that prohibited and permitted vertebrate access, respectively. Except for Myrsine coriacea in the old-fields and Syagrus romanzoffiana in the early secondary forest, seedlings suffered greater rates of damage and mortality in the open plots, showing that the aboveground large herbivores, such as capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), might prevent or at least delay plant recruitment in tropical areas supporting elevated densities. However, delayed deaths from disease by soil fertility-related factors were observed in late summer in the old-field seedlings, suggesting that previous activities in these areas had led to profound changes in the soil properties. Herbivores may have important consequences for tropical forest regeneration, as overconsumption may slow down nutrient cycling, promote cascading bottom-up effects on consumers, and ultimately lead to ecological meltdown.

40|$|In {{the lower}} Florida Keys, {{endangered}} Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium) herbivory, along with fire, can affect pine rocklands, an endangered plant community. We compared pineland vegetation from three studies over approximately 50 years on four islands with either {{high or low}} deer density (historical analysis). We also compared extant vegetation samples between two islands with high or low deer density, which contained pinelands burned 10 years and 14 years prior to sampling and control areas (unburned for > 50 yr). In addition, experimental deer exclosures and control plots established in pineland were prescribe burned and analyzed for deer effects on an island with high density of Key deer. The historical analysis suggests that, over time, deer-preferred plant species declined while less-preferred species increased, regardless of fire history on islands. The extant vegetation analysis suggests that fire and Key deer herbivory both reduce hardwood plant density and growth. Densities of deer-preferred woody species were higher on an island with low deer density than on an island with high deer density in burn treatments, but relatively similar in control areas. On the high deer density island, a fire effect was evident in that the control area had higher densities of woody species than burned areas, and herbaceous species richness was higher in the control area, indicating a possible refuge from deer herbivory. In deer exclosures, preferred woody species and herbaceous species tended to increase after fire, but decrease in adjacent open plots. Results suggest that Key deer herbivory, along with fire, shapes pine rockland plant communities, and that <b>overbrowsing</b> might have substantial impacts on preferred herbaceous and woody species in pinelands.

40|$|The recent range contractions and {{population}} declines of many grouse species worldwide {{have been attributed}} to loss and fragmentation of their habitats, although the empirical evidence for the actual drivers is often weak. In case of the willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus in Fennoscandia, ungulate <b>overbrowsing</b> of willows has been hypothesized to exert such negative habitat-related impacts. Moreover, a steep population decline of willow ptarmigan in southern Fennoscandia has recently been attributed to community interactions linking the fate of the willow ptarmigan to a change in keystone tundra rodent populations. Community and habitat factors may also interact in their impact on willow ptarmigan abundance. Here we assess whether willow thicket structural characteristics sensitive to ungulate browsing impacted willow ptarmigan habitat occupancy and whether such impacts depended on small rodent population dynamics. We employed an extensive survey approach spatially encompassing three riparian tundra regions and covering the phases of increase, peak and crash of the small rodent cycle. Willow ptarmigan habitat occupancy increased with the areal extent of willow thickets, whereas it decreased with increasing degree of thicket fragmentation (i. e. habitat shredding). Both of these effects were consistent with ungulate over-browsing impacting willow ptarmigan abundance negatively. Over the 4 -year study period, willow ptarmigan habitat occupancy declined steeply independently of spatial variation in willow thicket areal extent and fragmentation. Moreover, the expected increase in ptarmigan populations during the increase/peak phase of the rodent cycle was not observed. Thus although our study provides support for the hypothesis that intense ungulate browsing negatively impacts willow ptarmigan, our study also suggests that causes of the current steep decline of ptarmigan populations in northern Fennoscandia should be sought in factors other than habitat fragmentation and changed rodent population dynamic...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{immediate}} impacts of elevated deer (Odocoileus spp.) browsing on forest regeneration {{have been well}} documented, {{few studies have examined}} the longer term consequences. A deer exclosure experiment was initiated in 1991 in an old-growth northern mixed mesic forest in northeastern Minnesota, and resampled in 2008 to examine changes in composition, structure and productivity. Decades of <b>overbrowsing</b> by white-tailed deer have led to almost complete recruitment failure in size classes 3 ̆e 2. 5 cm dbh for preferred deer browse species Thuja occidentalis and Pinus strobus in unprotected plots. Other palatable browse species have been severely limited in understory development (Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, Fraxinus nigra). Within exclosures, P. strobus gained in all size classes 3 ̆c 20 cm dbh, while F. nigra, B. papyrifera, T. occidentalis all showed significant gains. Non-preferred Picea glauca increased outside exclosures, but has also gained within exclosures. The increase in P. glauca across treatments indicates a long-term legacy effect of preferential browsing. Browsing induced suppression of subcanopy density of preferred species and failure of canopy tree replacement may lead to a more open woodland structure dominated by P. glauca. Browsing pressure may negatively impact productivity, as whole tree biomass in exclosures increased at a rate twice that of unprotected plots. The low biomass levels recorded in 2008 (unprotected: 98. 0 mg/haÿ 1, exclosure: 104 mg/haÿ 1) are approximately 1 / 2 of values typically recorded in later successional forests in this region indicating lower productivity may be another longer-term legacy of elevated deer population. Continued high browsing pressure is one of many factors contributing to the restructuring of northern Great Lakes forests away from historical variability conditions towards a novel and more homogeneous forested landscape. These simplified forests may be less resilient to the suite of emerging stressors such as climate change and less able to provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage, biological diversity and forest products. Sustained restoration efforts, along with reductions in deer density will be needed to restore species and structural diversity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Overbrowsing</b> by {{ungulates}} is a {{major cause}} of poor aspen stand regeneration across North America and Eurasia. In general, factors driving ungulate browser preferences include concentrations of plant secondary compounds and the nutritional composition (non structural carbohydrates, protein and minerals) of foliage. While each of these phytochemical factors has been shown to independently inﬂuence ungulate preference, the relative impact of each factor is unknown, as no study to date has examined them simultaneously. Plant ﬁtness depends not only on the capacity of plants to resist browsing, but also on their capacity to tolerate browsing once it has occurred. Little is known of aspen tolerance to browsing, which inﬂicts a different form of damage than insect herbivory. We employed multiple aspen genotypes, replicate trees of which were subjected to different soil nutrient treatments, to investigate: (i) the effects of aspen genotype, nutrient treatment and genotype 9 nutrient interactions on susceptibility to browsing by white-tailed deer, (ii) the phytochemical basis for the patterns observed in (i), and (iii) the effects of genotype, soil nutrients and their interaction on short-term tolerance to deer browsing. Aspen genotypes varied markedly in their vernal susceptibility to deer browsing. Genetic variation in early season levels of non-structural carbohydrates (sugars), protein and multiple macro- and trace minerals had the strongest inﬂuence on tree susceptibility to browsing. In contrast, levels of phytochemical defences had minimal effects, although the range of levels expressed in this study was small. Soil nutrient availability did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence deer preference. The extent of browsing affected post-browse tolerance across genotypes. Soil nutrient treatment had little differential effect on tolerance, and, for the most part, genotypes did not display differential tolerance to browsing, regardless of which soil nutrient treatment they experienced. Synthesis. Genetic variation for susceptibility to browsing indicates that ungulate browsers have the potential to be agents of selection in aspen populations. In contrast with previous studies in aspen highlighting the importance of phytochemical defences in shaping preferences of browsing mammals, our results indicate that the nutritional composition of foliage (sugars, protein and mineral concentrations) can have sizable effects on preference. The observed lack of inﬂuence of soil nutrient availability on tree browsing tolerance contrasts with predictions of the limiting resource model, the prevailing model for plant tolerance...|$|E
40|$|In forest communities, the {{composition}} and abundance of plants in the understory is generally mediated via a complex interplay between herbivory and competition. Nonetheless, most research assesses the effect of herbivory and competition independently and rarely investigates potential interactions between the two factors. In this dissertation, I examine how herbivory and competition, alone and in concert, influence forest understory plant diversity. At one extreme, herbivory is hypothesized to reduce interspecific competition, thus allowing for greater species coexistence in the understory. In chapter one, I test this hypothesis in the herbaceous community of a tropical forest in central Panamá. I found mammals limited the abundance of the dominant herbs while simultaneously limiting the establishment of rare species. In contrast, intense herbivory may reduce {{the diversity of the}} most palatable species allowing browse-resistant species to rapidly expand and overtake the forest understory. In chapter two, I explore this alternative by reviewing the processes leading to the formation of recalcitrant understory layers worldwide and summarizing the mechanisms by which these layers inhibit tree seedling regeneration and alter forest succession. In chapter three, I experimentally examining how a recalcitrant understory layer limits tree species recruitment via direct competitive as well as indirect, apparent competitive interactions. Specifically, by providing a favorable microhabitat for small mammals, a dense understory canopy can facilitate increased granivory, thereby indirectly limiting tree recruitment. I found a dense hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula) understory exerts strong apparent competitive effects on the emergence of black cherry (Prunus serotina) and strong competitive effects on emergence and survival of red maple (Acer rubrum). In chapter four, I explore the potential interactions between white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and a dense canopy of hay-scented fern. This work demonstrates that in light limited, closed-canopy forests, a dense understory layer strongly suppresses germination and survival of several shade intolerant tree species. Furthermore, I argue that century-long legacy of deer <b>overbrowsing</b> has resulted in a depauperate forest community that predisposes future declines in plant diversity and increased monodominance. In all, these findings stress the need to discriminate among multiple ecological factors and assess their relative importance in structuring natural communities...|$|E
