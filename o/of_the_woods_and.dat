5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, the area's legal and {{political}} status was disputed. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War in 1783, had defined the northern border between the United States and Canada based on the inaccurate Mitchell Map. Ownership of the area between Lake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Woods</b> <b>and</b> Lake Superior was unclear, with the United States claiming the border was further north at the Kaministiquia River and Canada claiming it was further south beginning at the Saint Louis River. In 1842, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty clarified {{the border between the}} United States and Canada using the old trading route running along the Pigeon River and Rainy River (today the BWCAW's northern border).|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, on the Roman left wing, Severus {{must have}} {{suspected}} the prepared ambush, and held back from advancing into the woods, according to Ammianus. Libanius contradicts this, {{claiming that the}} Romans charged the enemy and flushed {{them out of their}} hiding places. But Ammianus' version is more likely, as the Romans would hardly have benefited from advancing straight into a prepared trap. Ammianus does not report further action in this sector. But {{it is likely that the}} hidden Germans eventually lost patience, advanced out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> charged at Severus' division, only to be routed by Severus' crack troops.|$|E
5|$|The French First Army, {{with the}} 1st and 133rd {{divisions}} and {{a division of}} the Belgian army, planned to occupy the Merckem peninsula in stages, by an attack on the south-east of the peninsula, then to extend the attack to the north. On 26 October, after an intensive bombardment, French troops crossed the lower Steenbeek, advanced into Papegoed Wood, Lucannes Farm and the pillboxes in between. The French then forced the Germans from the remaining pillboxes to the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> forded the Corverbeek, which in places was shoulder-high. The French soon captured the pillboxes opposite and occupied the Steenstraate–Dixmude road round Langewaede. In the evening, the Germans rushed the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division into the Merckem peninsula as a reinforcement.|$|E

5|$|The manor of Ruislip {{became part}} of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District, though it {{remained}} under the ownership of King's College, Cambridge. A town-planning competition led to a design being chosen that envisaged the clearance of much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> historic sites in Ruislip to make way for 7,642 homes, enough for 35,000 residents, across the manor. A planning scheme adapted from the original was presented to the public in February 1913 and was approved by the Local Government Board in September 1914. The outbreak of the First World War halted all construction work, by which time only three new roads had been completed. It did not resume again until 1919.|$|E
5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{became a}} full-scale battle by 4:00p.m. After the Americans drove Captain Pipe's Delawares out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> onto to prairie, the Delawares were reinforced by Dunquat's Wyandots. Elliott also {{arrived on the}} scene and coordinated the actions of the Delawares and the Wyandots. Pipe's Delawares skillfully outflanked the American position and then attacked their rear. A few Indians crept close to the American lines in the tall prairie grass. The Americans responded by climbing trees to get a better shot at them. Gunsmoke filled the air, making it difficult to see. After {{three and a half hours}} of incessant firing, the Indians gradually broke off the attack with the approach of nightfall. Both sides slept with arms at the ready, and surrounded their positions with large fires to prevent surprise night attacks.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{district}} council worked with King's College to establish plots {{of land for}} development around Ruislip and Ruislip Manor. A town planning competition was held, won by A & J Soutar, town planners from Wandsworth, who sought to create a symmetrical design spreading across Ruislip parish. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> historic sites including Manor Farm were to be demolished and cleared {{as part of the}} plan, making way for a projected total of 7,642 homes, enough for 35,000 residents. Only the church in Ruislip, St. Martin's, would have been spared. An outline map was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections. A local board inquiry followed on 17 February 1911, which required negotiations with landowners to allow for a full planning scheme to be compiled. This was presented in February 1913 with an adaptation of the original Soutars plan and received approval from the Local Government Board in September 1914.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Brazil is world's greater {{producer}} <b>of</b> charcoal, and <b>the</b> Brazilian state Minas Gerais presents <b>the</b> greater production <b>of</b> said product. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> proprieties influence <b>the</b> charcoal quality, making {{important to}} know them, {{it is known that}} these proprieties vary according to <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree. With that being said, this research aimed to determine the correlations existing between age, <b>the</b> proprieties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> charcoal proprieties. Three Eucalyptus sp. clones from Gerdau S/A were evaluated, at four ages, 3, 4, 5 and 7. From each tree, five discs were removed (0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % corresponding to <b>the</b> commercial height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trunk). We determined the core/sapwood relationship, basic density, chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> <b>the</b> calorific value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charcoal, the gravimetric yields, apparent relative density and charcoal chemical analysis, in addition to <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condensable and non-condensable gases. Correlations between age, proprieties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> charcoal were performed. It was observed a negative correlation between <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> charcoal ashes content, regardless the clones evaluated. A positive correlation between <b>the</b> basic density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> apparent density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coal and a positive correlation between <b>the</b> lignin <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> content <b>and</b> <b>the</b> coal apparent density were observed, as well. The siringil/guaiacil relation, which determines <b>the</b> quantity <b>of</b> each type of lignin existent on <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> presented a negative correlation with the gravimetric yields in charcoal. Therefore, it is concluded that <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree influenced <b>the</b> proprieties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> regardless <b>the</b> clone; <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genetic material did not influence the gravimetric yield in charcoal; the GG 680 clone presented greater potential to produce charcoal, considering only <b>the</b> proprieties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood...</b>|$|R

25|$|Lusignan, Saint-Julien, and Alois Liechtenstein {{called for}} another effort. One of Vukassovich's hussar regiments swept {{out of the}} woods, heading for the 57th Line's flank. The left {{battalion}} of the 57th formed square and drove off the horsemen. With their generals displaying front-line leadership, the Austrian attack roared out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> fell on the French troops lining the first ridge. The push collapsed {{in the face of}} converging musketry from the defenders' concave line and a thrust against its left flank by the 3rd Line.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} the {{advantage}} that the French had enjoyed in the action was suddenly reversed. Le Marchant led his dragoon guards out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> they formed their ranks whilst accelerating into the charge. The 5th Dragoon Guards attacked with their squadrons in echelon, their left refused, and struck the deep and exposed left flank of the French formation to considerable effect. Simultaneously with Le Marchant's charge the 16th Light Dragoons, led by Cotton, appeared to Ponsonby's right-rear; they jumped a stone wall in line, and also charged. The French cavalry were thrown into instant confusion and were swiftly broken.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} {{the rest of the}} XII Corps {{returned}} late that night, Confederate troops had occupied some of the Union defensive line on the southeastern slope of the hill, near Spangler's Spring. This caused considerable confusion as the Union troops stumbled in the dark to find enemy soldiers in the positions they had vacated. Gen. Williams did not want to continue this confused fight, so he ordered his men to occupy the open field in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> wait for daylight. And while Steuart's brigade maintained a fragile hold on the lower heights, Johnson's other two brigades were pulled off the hill, also to wait for daylight. Geary's men returned to reinforce Greene.
