40|$|The {{design of}} {{buildings}} {{is a complex}} task {{for a variety of}} reasons. In the conceptual stage, particularly in the inception phase, a small number of people make decisions that have far reaching impact on the final result in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Decision-making in the inception phase of design relies on available information which may be incomplete, (e. g. maintenance costs), or overly complex (e. g. code requirements). Furthermore, in the near future the consideration of life-cycle issues will be essential if not compulsory in all construction projects. Therefore, a smart, interactive, and easy-to-use system that provides a way of viewing the potential consequences of their design decisions would be useful to all participants involved in early design. This paper presents results from ongoing research at the Eindhoven University of Technology concerning the development of such a Decision Support System (DSS) for the design of indoor environments for <b>offices.</b> <b>Items</b> addressed include the utilisation of existing databases and expert knowledge about the entire building life-cycl...|$|R
5000|$|Primarily {{utilizing}} a Toyo-Field 45CF 4-by-5 camera, Nick Albertson's work combines photography, video, and sculptural forms. Albertson’s recent {{body of work}} utilizes the repetitive patterning of everyday household items such as rubber bands, cups, straws, paper napkins, and plastic bags. When framed through Nick Albertson’s photographic lens, these mundane objects undergo a transformation. Through patterning, light and shadow, sculptural formations, and post-production editing, Albertson’s work blurs the lines between abstraction and representation, playing to the repetitive nature of the objects in question and the viewer’s familiarity with common household products. [...] "In my work, I strip utilitarian objects of their functions, repurposing them to create visceral experiences." [...] One reviewer noted that in some of Albertson's works, it is obvious to tell which household or <b>office</b> <b>item</b> he is utilizing in his works. Others, not so much. The repeated motif leads towards abstraction {{in a way that}} is both mesmerizing and deceptive.|$|R

He made a distinction between how these knowledge workers and secretaries - who were the common computer users at the time - wanted to use a computer. To introduce a computer that knowledge workers could easily understand and interact with, Smith believed it was imperative to incorporate objects and ideas they were already familiar with. This led him to represent common <b>office</b> <b>items,</b> such as documents, folders, file cabinets, and wastebaskets, in his icon designs for the Star.|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} of short-notice random inspections (SNRIs) for inventory-change verification {{can enhance the}} effectiveness and efficiency of international safeguards at natural or low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel fabrication plants. According to this approach, the plant operator declares the contents of nuclear material items before knowing if an inspection will occur to verify them. Additionally, items about which declarations are newly made should remain available for verification for an agreed time. Then a statistical inference {{can be made from}} verification results for items verified during SNRIs to the entire populations, i. e. the entire strata, even if inspectors were not present when many items were received or produced. A six-month field test of the feasibility of such SNRIs took place at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation Commercial Nuclear Fuel Division during 1993. Westinghouse personnel made daily declarations about both feed and product items, uranium hexafluoride cylinders and finished fuel assemblies, using a custom-designed computer ``mailbox``. Safeguards inspectors from the IAEA conducted eight SNRIs to verify these declarations. They arrived unannounced at the plant, in most cases immediately after travel from Canada, where the IAEA maintains a regional <b>office.</b> <b>Items</b> from both strata were verified during the SNRIs by meant of nondestructive assay equipment...|$|E

Kadłubka 10 - 11, 71 - 521 Szczecin Abstract Hypothyroidism is a common form of endocrinopathy, it can be a problem for up to 10 % of population. Women are five times more likely to suffer from thyroid diseases, and the frequency of morbidity raises with age. Family doctor in Poland is able to perform TSH, FT 3, FT 4 examination, and thyroid ultrasound when it comes to thyreology. It allows to treat patients with hypothyroidism, however it does not allow to precisely determine the cause. In order to determine the cause, family doctor needs to consult endocrinologist. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are not specific and rarely make patients inclined to visit the doctor. Treatment of hypothyroidism consists of L-thyroxine substitution in a certain dose. It is recommended to treat subclinical hypothyroidism with small doses of L-thyroxine when level of TSH > 10 mIU/L. When concentration level of TSH is lower than 10 mIU/L it is vital to individually assess risk factors and patients clinical situation. Decision whether to start the treatment should be made on those grounds. Key words: Hypothyroidism, hashimoto diseas...|$|R
