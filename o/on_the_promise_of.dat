5|$|By {{the end of}} 1936, Aberhart's {{government}} had made no progress towards the promised dividends, leaving many Albertans disillusioned and frustrated. These Albertans included some of Aberhart's own Social Credit MLAs, who had been elected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> dividends and were angry at Aberhart's failure to follow through. Some of them felt that, while the idea of social credit was sound, Aberhart lacked a real understanding of Douglas's theory and could not implement it. These MLAs wanted Douglas or somebody from his British organization to come to Alberta and deliver on Aberhart's campaign promises. One such MLA, Samuel Barnes, had been expelled from the Social Credit caucus and from the Social Credit League for voicing these views.|$|E
5|$|The French king, Henry II, {{proposed}} to unite France and Scotland by marrying the young queen to his three-year-old son, the Dauphin Francis. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> French military help, and a French dukedom for himself, Arran {{agreed to the}} marriage. In February 1548, Mary was moved, again for her safety, to Dumbarton Castle. The English {{left a trail of}} devastation behind once more and seized the strategic town of Haddington. In June, the much awaited French help arrived at Leith to besiege and ultimately take Haddington. On 7 July 1548, a Scottish Parliament held at a nunnery near the town agreed to a French marriage treaty.|$|E
5|$|In Digital Devil Saga 2, the Embryon {{appear in}} the real world, which is slowly being {{destroyed}} by the Black Sun: the only ones able to survive the sun's rays are those infected with the demon virus. Serph, Cielo, Argilla and Gale learn that Sera is the captive of Angel and Madame Cuvier at the Karma Society headquarters. With the help of Roland and a young boy named Fred, the group infiltrate the Karma Society's building. While they attempt to rescue Serah, Angel plans to subvert Cuvier and use the demon virus to create a society ruled by the strong. The Embryon are also faced by Heat, who is working with Cuvier <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> Sera's safety. Reaching the EGG, a man-made replica of God, the party rescue Sera, but Heat appears and seems to kill Serph. Both fall into the EGG, and God begins absorbing the Earth's data: in the chaos, Angel kills Cuvier, while the remaining Embryon and Sera, now able to assume a demon form herself, shut down the Power Plant in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the EGG. In the process, both Roland and Argilla are killed by a powerful demon. Returning to the EGG so Sera can speak with God, they are confronted by Heat, who has fused with the EGG and gone berserk. Inside the EGG, Serph is met by a higher being calling itself Schrödinger, who reveals {{the truth about what}} happened.|$|E

According to Berdella, he plied Howell with alcohol, Valium and acepromazine both in his car and at his house until the youth became unconscious.

25|$|To control flooding, the Kissimmee River was {{straightened}} from 1962 to 1970. While {{the project}} delivered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> flood protection, it also destroyed {{much of a}} floodplain-dependent ecosystem that nurtured threatened and endangered species, as well as hundreds of other native fish and wetland-dependent animals. More than 90 percent of the waterfowl that once graced the wetlands disappeared {{and the number of}} bald eagle nesting territories decreased by 70 percent. After the waterway was transformed into a straight, deep canal, it became oxygen-depleted and the fish community it supported changed dramatically. It is expected to be completed in 2011.|$|E

However, following Nissan's decision to cancel the P35 due to economic difficulties, and {{with a lack of}} entries announcing their participation, the FIA cancelled the 1993 season.

Although the fortunes of war had largely favored the South prior to 1863, events were now starting to favor the Union. In the Eastern Theater, Ulysses S. Grant had Robert E. Lee pinned down in the Siege of Petersburg; Jubal Early had been driven back from the outskirts of Washington, D.C., while Philip Sheridan was now pursuing him in the Shenandoah Valley; and William T. Sherman had captured Atlanta. With foreign recognition for the Confederacy not forthcoming, Southerners realized that President Abraham Lincoln's re-election would be disastrous for their cause, especially as Lincoln's primary opponent, George McClellan, had campaigned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> conciliating the South with offers of peace.|$|E
