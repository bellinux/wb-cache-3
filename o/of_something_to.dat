He often carried a hip flask in case he ran out <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships {{are considered to be}} one reason for his drinking. Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{internal}} conflicts, the band broke up in 2005. Three years later, the band reunited {{to support the}} tenth anniversary re-release <b>of</b> <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> Write Home About, and soon afterward entered the studio to write new material. In early 2010, the band released Simple Science, their first release in six years, followed in 2011 by the full-length There Are Rules.|$|E

The tenth anniversary edition of the album includes a code to download bonus demo tracks from the original recording <b>of</b> <b>Something</b> <b>To</b> Write Home About from the Vagrant Records website, and a DVD containing a band retrospective and other content, including archive footage, and their live performance from March 13, 2009 at Liberty Hall in Lawrence. The show took place Sunday, November 16, 2008 at the record bar in Kansas City. The band played their album Something To Write Home About from beginning to end, {{as well as a}} six song encore.|$|E

5|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} {{a consideration of the}} value <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood, including many nonhuman animals and some humans, do not have an interest in liberty or not being used by others, and so have no prima facie right to freedom. They do, however, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed.|$|E
5|$|Jerold J. Abrams and Elizabeth F. Cooke, in {{the book}} The Philosophy of TV Noir argue that the episode {{stresses}} abductive reasoning, a type of logic that goes from data or a description <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data and seeks to explain relevant evidence. Abductive reasoning follows the logic: a surprising fact, C, is observed (Result); If A, the hypothesis, were true, C would make perfect sense (Rule); Thus, {{there is reason to}} suspect that A is true (Case). An example that has been given is: the lawn is wet. But if it is raining, then it would be unsurprising that the lawn is wet. Therefore, it is raining. This logical method is favored by Mulder throughout most of the show. In this episode, however, it is Scully who first uses the method. She takes three separate facts—the massive size of some types of mushrooms, the hallucinogenic properties of some fungi, and the carnivorous nature of certain types of plants—and formulates an abductive conclusion: she and Mulder are trapped underground, experiencing a hallucination, and slowly being digested.|$|E
25|$|During that time, {{in order}} to {{capitalize}} on the success <b>of</b> <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> Write Home About, as well as to keep fans interested until the next album came out, Vagrant Records released Eudora, a B-Sides and Rarities collection in 2001.|$|E

The article also included quotes from Matt Pryor, who said that Vagrant Records will be re-releasing the album in a special 10th-anniversary edition, including a DVD and photo book.

25|$|Since none of {{the means}} of knowing were found to be worthy to {{establish}} the invariable connection between middle term and predicate, Charvakas concluded that the inference could not be used to ascertain metaphysical truths.

Many women, hungry and exhausted, would leave their famished children on the roadside, and continue their tortuous journey.

500|$|Critics {{have tended}} to {{emphasize}} {{different aspects of the}} process.

Also, noted by both Bate and Jennifer Wagner, the structure of the verse reinforces the sense <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> come; the placing of the couplet before the end of each stanza creates a feeling of suspension, highlighting the theme of continuation.|$|E

Madonna has performed the song live on the British television program Top of the Pops and on selected US shows of her 2001 Drowned World Tour.

500|$|Samuel Johnson {{pointed out}} that an appeal to {{conscience}} should not allow the law to bring unjust suffering upon another. Conscience, according to Johnson, {{was nothing more than}} a conviction felt by ourselves <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be done or something to be avoided; in questions of simple unperplexed morality, conscience is very often a guide that may be trusted. But before conscience can conclusively determine what morally should be done, he thought that the state of the question should be thoroughly known. [...] "No man's conscience", said Johnson [...] "can tell him the right of another man... it is a conscience very ill informed that violates the rights of one man, for the convenience of another." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording of {{the song}} was done in Brooklyn Studios and {{assisted}} by Ronnie Rivera.

Simon Franglen provided synclavier programming for the song. Only three instruments {{were used for the}} song—acoustic guitar played by Dean Parks, electric guitar played by Michael Thompson and keyboard played by Foster. A Spanish version {{of the song}}, titled [...] "Verás", was recorded by Madonna at Gloria and Emilio Estefan's studio in Miami. The song was translated into Spanish by Paz Martinez and was included as a bonus track on the Latin American editions <b>of</b> <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> Remember.

Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't seem to me there was much point in thinking <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say if we'd have to abort landing." [...] In 2012, brother Dean Armstrong claimed that Neil had shown him a note with a draft of the line months before the launch, although historian Andrew Chaikin, who had interviewed the astronaut in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon, disputed that he had ever claimed coming up with the line spontaneously during the mission.|$|E
500|$|Something to Remember was {{released}} in some European countries on November 3, 1995. In Madonna's native country, the album {{was released}} on November 7, 1995.

[...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] was re-released three months prior the compilation as a double A-side record with [...] "Human Nature", the final single from Bedtime Stories. Receiving gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), the song was added to Something to Remember track listing {{in the hope of}} boosting the album sales in the region. In Latin America, the album included the bonus track [...] "Verás", the Spanish version of [...] "You'll See". In 2001, WEA Records released a box set <b>of</b> <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> Remember and The Immaculate Collection to coincide with the release of Madonna's second greatest hits package, GHV2.|$|E
