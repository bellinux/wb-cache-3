The site was characterized by a quartz-rich sand deposit. low ground-water table, poor vegetation and <b>orthic</b> <b>podzol.</b> In the morphological analyses the mor was separated into different horizons. Micromorphological studies showed that fungi were very important in the decomposition process. Soil animals were of less significance. The formation of the fermentation horizon was a fast process. After a period of 20 years a fermentation horizon had developed although it was characterized by a low content of altered organic matter. The formation of a humus substance horizon was a much slower process...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{different}} sizes of soil aggregates on the hysteresis of their water retention characteristics was determined. Soil aggregates were separated from the arable layer of <b>Orthic</b> <b>Podzol,</b> Eutric Cambisol and Haplic Phaeozem. The {{results of the study}} showed that the impact of aggregate size was significant. It was found that differences in water content during the drying and wetting processes varied not only for the chosen soil water potential and aggregate size, but also for the type of soil. The maximum differences in water content between the drying and wetting processes at the same soil water potential reached nearly 15 % vol. in absolute values. Thus it can be stated that negligence of the hysteresis effect can cause inaccuracy of estimation of soil moisture...|$|E
40|$|Humic acids {{have been}} widely {{investigated}} by spectroscopic methods, especially NMR and FTIR, and they are known to show significant differences according to their origin. Low resolution methods such as NMR and FTIR, however cannot easily distinguish different input sources or establish relations between SOM chemistry and vegetation or land use in general. High resolution methods, such as analytical pyrolysis and pyrolysis combined with methylation do offer such possibilities. Therefore, HAs from five reference soils called the Eurosoils, including a Vertic Cambisol (E 1, Italy), a Rendzina (E 2, Greece), a Dystic Cambisol (E 3, Great Britain), an Orthic Luvisol (E 4, France) and an <b>Orthic</b> <b>Podzol</b> (E 5, Germany), that were previously characterized a. o. by NMR, FTIR and ESR, were also analyzed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) and subsequent analysis by GC/MS. The <b>Orthic</b> <b>Podzol</b> sample showed the largest aliphaticity, and the strongest degradation of aliphatics and lignin. The Dystric Cambisol featured the least decomposed HA, which was reflected by a large content of long-chain alkanes, and little lignin degradation. Both the Dystric Cambisol and the Orthic Luvisol HAs contained {{a significant amount of}} microbial organic matter. Polyaromatics, which indicate the presence of charred material, were most abundant in the Vertic Cambisol and the Podzol HAs and lowest in the Dystric Cambisol and the Rendzina HAs. THM was able to distinguish between the various vegetations/land uses. Although quantifications by NMR and py-GC/MS are essentially different, the general results largely coincided. NMR appears to underestimate aromaticity and overestimate aliphaticity, but a molecular mixing model yielded reasonable correlations between NMR and pyrolysis data. Classification by `degradation state¿ based on py-GC/MS largely coincided with acidity determined by titration, but FTIR data did not coincide. Py-GC/MS, with its much larger resolution, is a better tool to distinguish effects of vegetation, microbial input, and degradation. HA's produce the same variety of compounds upon pyrolysis as total SOM extracts and are therefore chemically not more simple than SOM. HA chemistry, however can be understood in the light of land use history and SOM dynamic...|$|E

40|$|Urbanization is {{responsible}} for large environmental changes worldwide. Although traditionally urbanization was related to negative environmental impacts, recent research also highlights positive impacts like the potential of urban areas to store soil organic carbon. The net effect of urbanization on soil organic carbon is poorly understood. Negative influences of construction and soil sealing may be compensated by the establishment of green areas. Possible net effects of future urbanization on soil organic carbon stocks were explored for the Moscow Region, based on the soil survey and land conversion model. The regional urbanization was modelled {{as a function of}} environmental, socio-economic and neighbourhood factors. This yielded three alternative scenarios for urbanization: i) including neighbourhood factors; ii) excluding neighbourhood factors and focusing on environmental drivers; and iii) considering the New Moscow Project that includes the establishment of 1500 km 2 of new urbanized area following governmental regulation. The three scenarios showed substantial expansion of urban areas on 30, 10 and 80 %. The model, considering neighbourhood effect was the most accurate with 91 % of correct predictions. Urbanization in the region mainly converted forests, fallow and arable lands. The negative effect of urbanization (i. e soil sealing and excavation of topsoil for building construction) was compensated by positive effect (e. i. urban greenery and “cultural layers”). In result an increase of soil organic carbon stocks of 4. 2 ± 1. 7 to 11. 0 ± 2. 6 Tg C was shown for all three scenarios. The highest increases in soil organic carbon stocks occurred on the less fertile <b>Orthic</b> <b>Podzols</b> and Eutric Podzoluvisols, whereas SOC stocks in Orthic Luvisols, Luvic Chernozems, Dystric Histosols and Eutric Fluvisols increased less. Subsoil C-stocks were much more affected with an extra 4 ± 1. 6 to 10 ± 2. 4 Tg soil organic carbon than those in the topsoils. The highest increase of both topsoil and subsoil soil organic carbon stocks occurred in the New Moscow scenario with the highest urbanization. Even when the relatively high uncertainties of the absolute C-stocks are considered, the outcomes highlight the potential of cities to enhance soil organic carbon storage. This will progressively become more important in the future following the increasing world-wide urbanization. </p...|$|R

[...] There is {{inadequate}} information concerning herbicide persistence in soils of the boreal forest. A field study of herbicide behaviour in an <b>Orthic</b> Humo-Ferric <b>Podzol</b> {{began in the}} spring of 1983 in northeast central Newfoundland on a south-facing slope near Gambo Pond. 2, 4 -D, dicamba, hexazinone, tebuthiuron and picloran were applied on 5 test plots within a clear-cut site. Under stringent controls the LF, Ae, Bf, BC and C soil horizons were sampled up to 486 days after application. Residue analyses of samples from the soil horizons show the distribution of herbicides through the profile over time, and indicate each herbicide's propensity to leach and persist. Results show that all herbicides leach to all depths sampled indicating that there is the potential for contamination of lower levels including groundwater. The amounts detected in the lowermost horizon range from 0. 9 mg a. i. per m² for picloram to 74. 5 mg a. i. per m² for hexazinone (mg active ingredient values are adjusted for recovery, soil moisture, bulk density and horizon thickness). Initial application rates, varied between herbicides and are reflected in the residue concentrations detected. With the exception of tebuthiuron, 90 % of the herbicides disappeared from the soil 5 months after application. With the exception of picloram the herbicides persisted within the range of time intervals suggested by other authorities. Each ecosystem has particular sensitivities which must be buffered by environmental parameters (e. g., bulk density, clay and organic matter content, soil moisture and ambient temperature) limiting the movement and distribution of herbicides in the soil. Thus, herbicide use must be carefully managed to safeguard the natural environment...|$|R
40|$|Saltwater Forest is a Dacrydium cupressinum-dominated lowland forest {{covering}} 9000 ha {{in south}} Westland, South Island, New Zealand. Four thousand hectares is managed for sustainable production of indigenous timber. The {{aim of this}} study was to provide an integrated analysis of soils, soil-landform relationships, and soil-vegetation relationships at broad and detailed scales. The broad scale understandings provide a framework in which existing or future studies can be placed and the detailed studies elucidate sources of soil and forest variability. Glacial landforms dominate. They include late Pleistocene lateral, terminal and ablation moraines, and outwash aggradation and degradation terraces. Deposits and landforms from six glacial advances have been recognised ranging from latest Last (Otira) Glaciation to Penultimate (Waimea) Glaciation. The absolute ages of landforms were established by analysis of the thickness and soil stratigraphy of loess coverbeds, augmented with radiocarbon dating and phytolith and pollen analysis. In the prevailing high rainfall of Westland soil formation is rapid. The rate of loess accretion in Saltwater Forest (ca. 30 mm ka⁻¹) has been low enough that soil formation and loess accretion took place contemporaneously. Soils formed in this manner are known as upbuilding soils. The significant difference between upbuilding pedogenesis and pedogenesis in a topdown sense into an existing sediment body is that each subsoil increment of an upbuilding soil has experienced processes of all horizons above. In Saltwater Forest subsoils of upbuilding soils are strongly altered because they have experienced the extremely acid environment of the soil surface at some earlier time. Some soil chronosequence studies in Westland have included upbuilding soils formed in loess as the older members of the sequence. Rates and types of processes inferred from these soils should be reviewed because upbuilding is a different pedogenic pathway to topdown pedogenesis. Landform age and morphology were used as a primary stratification for a study of the soil pattern and nature of soil variability in the 4000 ha production area of Saltwater Forest. The age of landforms (> 14 ka) and rapid soil formation mean that soils are uniformly strongly weathered and leached. Soils include Humic Organic Soils, Perch-gley Podzols, Acid Gley Soils, Allophanic Brown Soils, and <b>Orthic</b> or Pan <b>Podzols.</b> The major influence on the nature of soils is site hydrology which is determined by macroscale features of landforms (slope, relief, drainage density), mesoscale effects related to position on landforms, and microscale influences determined by microtopography and individual tree effects. Much of the soil variability arises at microscales so that it is not possible to map areas of uniform soils at practical map scales. The distribution of soil variability across spatial scales, in relation to the intensity of forest management, dictates that it is most appropriate to map soil complexes with boundaries coinciding with landforms. Disturbance of canopy trees is an important agent in forest dynamics. The frequency of forest disturbance in the production area of Saltwater Forest varies in a systematic way among landforms in accord with changes in abundance of different soils. The frequency of forest turnover is highest on landforms with the greatest abundance of extremely poorly-drained Organic Soils. As the abundance of better-drained soils increases the frequency of forest turnover declines. Changes in turnover frequency are reflected in the mean size and density of canopy trees (Dacrydium cupressinum) among landforms. Terrace and ablation moraine landforms with the greatest abundance of extremely poorly-drained soils have on average the smallest trees growing most densely. The steep lateral moraines, characterised by well drained soils, have fewer, larger trees. The changes manifested at the landform scale are an integration of processes operating over much shorter range as a result of short-range soil variability. The systematic changes in forest structure and turnover frequency among landforms and soils have important implications for sustainable forest management...|$|R
