40|$|Effects of {{dehulling}} {{on certain}} functional properties <b>of</b> <b>flours</b> <b>of</b> 10 different cultivars of dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were investigated. Dehulling improved {{the water and}} oil absorption capacities <b>of</b> bean <b>flours</b> by 3 - 39 % and 10 - 44 %, respectively. Foaming and emulsion capacities <b>of</b> bean <b>flours</b> increased {{as a result of}} dehulling. Foams and emulsions <b>of</b> dehulled bean <b>flours</b> were, however, less stable than those <b>of</b> whole bean <b>flours.</b> Foaming properties <b>of</b> bean <b>flours</b> were dependent on pH and concentration. Seed coat removal improved gelling properties of most cultivars investigated. Among the cultivars studied, small white beans showed excellent water absorption, gelling, and emulsion properties. Black beauty and cranberry flours gave the maximum increase in whipping volume, whereas foams prepared from dark red kidney beans were the most stable.

40|$|Different {{studies have}} {{developed}} a variety of breads using cassava flour, with similar characteristics to wheat flour breads. The use <b>of</b> cassava <b>flour</b> in bread making is a convenient alternative for promoting {{the use of a}} local crop as well as reducing imports <b>of</b> wheat <b>flour,</b> promoting the production of high quality cassava flour, offering a gluten-free product and developing biofortified and fortified foods. Although the substitution level <b>of</b> cassava <b>flour</b> is limited, in some products, the incorporation <b>of</b> additives or <b>flours</b> from other crops improve the nutritional value and breadmaking quality of the baked foods. Several limitations have hindered the success of initiatives to promote, in some cassava producing countries, the intensive use cassava flour in bread making. Among these include the costs and efficiency of processing technologies, standards of the quality <b>of</b> cassava <b>flour</b> and lack <b>of</b> favorable policies.

40|$|ABSTRACTThis {{paper is}} {{a review of}} how {{consumption}} of bread, other leavened products and unleavened products made from wheat flour has increased rapidly in Nigeria and other developing countries.
