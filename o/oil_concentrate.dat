The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the response of the omega- 3 index, the percentage of EPA + DHA in red blood cell membranes, to supplementation with two different n- 3 FA formulations in humans. Design: The study was conducted as a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. 150 volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) fish <b>oil</b> <b>concentrate</b> with EPA + DHA (1. 01 g + 0. 67 g) given as re-esterified triacylglycerides (rTAG-group); 2) corn oil (placebo-group); or 3) fish <b>oil</b> <b>concentrate</b> with EPA + DHA (1. 01 g + 0. 67 g) given as ethyl-esters (EE-group). Volunteers consumed four gelatine-coated soft capsules daily over a period of six months.

Results: The omega- 3 index increased significantly in both groups treated with n- 3 FA from the baseline to t 3 and t 6 (P< 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Spray {{adjuvants}} {{are often}} applied to crops {{in conjunction with}} agricultural pesticides in order to boost {{the efficacy of the}} active ingredient(s). The adjuvants themselves are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are therefore subject to minimal scrutiny and toxicological testing by regulatory agencies. Honey bees are exposed to a wide array of pesticides as they conduct normal foraging operations, meaning that they are likely exposed to spray adjuvants as well. It was previously unknown whether these agrochemicals have any deleterious effects on honey bee behavior. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An improved, automated version of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay {{with a high degree of}} trial-to-trial reproducibility was used to measure the olfactory learning ability of honey bees treated orally with sublethal doses of the most widely used spray adjuvants on almonds in the Central Valley of California. Three different adjuvant classes (nonionic surfactants, crop <b>oil</b> <b>concentrates,</b> and organosilicone surfactants) were investigated in this study. Learning was impaired after ingestion of 20 µg organosilicone surfactant, indicating harmful effects on honey bees caused by agrochemicals previously believed to be innocuous. Organosilicones were more active than the nonionic adjuvants, while the crop <b>oil</b> <b>concentrates</b> were inactive. Ingestion was required for the tested adjuvant to have an effect on learning, as exposure via antennal contact only induced no level of impairment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A decrease in percent conditioned response after ingestion of organosilicone surfactants has been demonstrated here for the first time. Olfactory learning is important for foraging honey bees because it allows them to exploit the most productive floral resources in an area at any given time. Impairment of this learning ability may have serious implications for foraging efficiency at the colony level, as well as potentially many social interactions. Organosilicone spray adjuvants may therefore contribute to the ongoing global decline in honey bee health...|$|R
40|$|Field and {{greenhouse}} {{studies were}} conducted in 2007 and 2008 to evaluate the foliar efficacy of saflufenacil on horseweed (Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq.). In the field, saflufenacil applied alone at the lowest rate (25 g/ha) resulted in less control than all other herbicide treatments that included saflufenacil. The addition of glyphosate to 25 g/ha of saflufenacil increased the level of control over either herbicide applied alone. However, the addition of glyphosate to 50 g/ha of saflufenacil or greater was not beneficial because saflufenacil alone provided at least 95 % control. Overall, horseweed height {{at the time of}} herbicide application had very little effect on the efficacy of saflufenacil applied alone or in combination with glyphosate. 	Application variables can enhance the foliar activity of saflufenacil. In the greenhouse, saflufenacil combined with glyphosate provided greater control than saflufenacil applied alone on both glyphosate-susceptible and -resistant horseweed populations. Regardless of horseweed population or glyphosate, saflufenacil had greater activity when crop <b>oil</b> <b>concentrate</b> rather than nonionic surfactant was used as the adjuvant. Decreasing light level within 24 hours of herbicide application resulted in greater saflufenacil activity. Applying saflufenacil in a pH 5 spray solution resulted in greater activity than pH 7 or pH 9. Although effects from saflufenacil applied under different temperatures were evident in early timings, there were no lasting effects on the efficacy of saflufenacil. 	Saflufenacil had significant activity on both glyphosate-susceptible and -resistant horseweed. Under certain conditions when complete control of horseweed is not achieved, such as low application rates, large target weeds, and varying environmental conditions, application variables including glyphosate tank-mixtures, crop <b>oil</b> <b>concentrate,</b> low spray solution pH, and low light level may increase the level of horseweed control from saflufenacil...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Emulsification is {{generally}} {{carried out by}} introducing mechanical stirring in a two phase systems. However such methods are {{not always easy to}} apply and are often costly, particularly to produce the extremely fine droplets found in the so-called mini or nanoemulsions. The present talk deals with emulsification methods in which stirring has essentially no effect in the breaking mechanisms, which are based on one or several of the following dynamic processes: surfactant mass transfer, spontaneous emulsification, transitional or/and catastrophic phase inversion. They are all produced by interfacial transient events (most often under low-energy homogeneization), either by putting into contact non-equilibrated phases or by changing the formulation, temperature, or the water-oil ratio of an equilibrated system.
