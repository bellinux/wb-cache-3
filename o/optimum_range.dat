Centaur was also slightly shorter than I-177. The observation of Centaur was made through a periscope, and submarine officers attest that at , the <b>optimum</b> <b>range</b> of attack for World War II–era Japanese submarines, some officers {{would not be able to}} clearly identify a target ship's profile or hull markings. With Centaurs bow floodlights out, and with the observation of the target made through the periscope, there is a possibility Nakagawa would not have seen the hospital ship's markings if he had been in the wrong position. Apart from the two bow floodlights, Centaur was lit up brilliantly. To attack, I-177 would have had to approach from [...] of Centaur, which was illuminated by both its own lights and a full moon.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common example of purely {{mechanical}} thermostat technology in use today is {{the internal combustion engine}} cooling system thermostat, used to maintain the engine near its optimum operating temperature by regulating the flow of coolant to an air-cooled radiator. This type of thermostat operates using a sealed chamber containing a wax pellet that melts and expands at a set temperature. The expansion of the chamber operates a rod which opens a valve when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature is determined by the composition of the wax. [...] Once the operating temperature is reached, the thermostat progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the <b>optimum</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{considerable}} {{range of}} soil pH is tolerated by white spruce (Nienstaedt 1957). Thrifty stands of white spruce in Manitoba have developed on soils of pH 7.6 at only 10nbsp&cm {{below the surface}}, and pH 8.4 at 43nbsp&cm below the surface (Stoeckeler 1938, USDA Forest Service 1938); rooting depth in those soils was at least 81nbsp&cm. An abundant calcium supply is common to most white spruce locations in New York state (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Chlorosis was observed in young white spruce in heavily limed nursery soils at about pH 8.3 (Stone, cited by Nienstaedt 1957). Wilde (1966) gave 4.7 to 6.5 as the approximate <b>optimum</b> <b>range</b> of pH for white spruce in Wisconsin, but optimum growth seems possible at pH levels up to 7.0 and perhaps higher (Sutton 1968). Alluvium on the floodplains of northern rivers shows pH levels from 5.0 to 8.2 (Zasada et al. 1977). High-lime ecotypes may exist (Pelletier 1966), and in Canada Forest Section B8 the presence of balsam poplar and white spruce {{on some of the}} moulded moraines and clays seems to be correlated with the considerable lime content of these materials (Rowe 1972, [...] Stiell 1976), while calcareous soils are favourable sites for northern outliers of white spruce (Hustich 1953).|$|E
