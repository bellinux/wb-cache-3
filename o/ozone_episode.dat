In this research, a serious and continuous high <b>ozone</b> <b>episode</b> in the Greater Tokyo Area (GTA) during the summer of 14 – 18 August 2010 was investigated using the observation data. We analyzed the ozone and other trace gas concentrations, as well as the corresponding weather conditions in this high <b>ozone</b> <b>episode</b> by WRF/Chem model. The simulation results revealed that the analyzed episode was mainly caused by the impact of accumulation of pollution rich in ozone over the Greater Tokyo Area. WRF/Chem has shown relatively good performance in modeling of this continuous high <b>ozone</b> <b>episode,</b> the simulated and the observed concentrations of ozone, NOx and NO 2 are basically in agreement at Kawasaki City, with best correlation coefﬁcients of 0. 87, 0. 70 and 0. 72 respectively. Moreover, the simulations of WRF/Chem with WRF preprocessing software (WPS) show a better agreement with meteorological observations such as surface winds and temperature profiles in the ground level of this area. As a result the surface ozone simulation performances have been enhanced in terms of the peak ozone and spatial patterns, whereas WRF/Chem has been succeeded to generate meteorological fields as well as ozone, NOx, NO 2 and NO...|$|E
40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{sensitivity}} of the Urban Airshed Model’s (UAM) ozone predictions to three assumptions in the motor vehicle emission calculations: trip average emission factor, average daily temperature, and uniform speed by road classification. These assumptions were tested by preparing a series of motor vehicle modeling inventories using conventional methodology, disaggregated emission factors, hourly temperature profiles, and speeds by road. These inventories were then merged with the area, point, biogenic, and nonroad mobile inventory for a 1988 <b>ozone</b> <b>episode</b> in Charlotte, North Carolina, and used in UAM simulations. Spatially and temporally allocating the disaggregated emissions to trip starts, trip ends, and trip mileage increased both the maximum gridded hourly emissions and the variability of gridded hourly emissions. VOC and CO showed a larger change than NO X. This reallocation moved emissions from major highway corridors to the central business district. Varying the temperature by hour had little effect on emissions. Assigning speeds to individual roads using output from a travel demand model decreased NO X and significantly increased VOC emissions. For this <b>ozone</b> <b>episode,</b> peak ozone changed by less than 3 ppb, but spatial ozone changes were more significant. Effect of this disaggregation methodology may be greater in other urban areas or future year scenarios with different VOC to NO X ratios. Also, the disaggregation methodology may be more important for CO calculations than for ozone...|$|E

40|$|For the {{identification}} of regional springtime <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes,</b> rural European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) ozone measurements from countries surrounding the western Mediterranean (Spain, France, Switzerland, Italy, Malta) have been examined with emphasis on periods of high ozone-mixing ratios, according to the variation of the daily afternoon (12 : 00 – 18 : 00) ozone values. For two selected high <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> in April and May 2008, composite NCEP/NCAR reanalysis maps of various meteorological parameters and/or their anomalies (geopotential height, specific humidity, vertical wind velocity omega, vector wind speed and temperature) at various tropospheric pressure levels have been examined together with the corresponding satellite Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) ozone measurements (at 3 and 10  km), CHIMERE simulations, vertical ozone soundings and HYSPLIT back trajectories. The observations show that high ozone values are detected in several countries simultaneously over several days. Also, the examined spring <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> over the western Mediterranean and in central Europe are linked to synoptic meteorological conditions {{very similar to those}} recently observed in summertime <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> over the eastern Mediterranean (Kalabokas et al., 2013, 2015; Doche et al., 2014), where the transport of tropospheric ozone-rich air masses through atmospheric subsidence significantly influences the boundary layer and surface ozone-mixing ratios.

40|$|Air {{quality in}} Hong Kong has been deteriorating {{in the past}} decade with an {{increasing}} number of <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> occurring over the territory. Ozone events mostly occur when a tropical cyclone or a developing low pressure area is located over the South China Sea or the western North Pacific. Owing to the non-linear characteristics of ozone formation and the complex terrain of Hong Kong, it has been a great challenge in predicting local <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes.</b> Therefore, this study attempts to unveil the mystery of the problem from the meteorological point of view. In this dissertation, meteorological data during the tropical cyclone seasons between 1999 and 2002 are analyzed. It is revealed that local <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> occur when tropical cyclones are located east or southeast of Hong Kong over the seas near Luzon and Taiwan. However, ozone event tends to happen when a stronger tropical cyclone is located farther away from the territory with a broader subsidence zone. The subsidence enhances cloud dissipation; thus a more efficient photochemical reaction. Besides, a detailed analysis of synoptic patterns, both at surface and the atmosphere aloft suggests that winds from appropriate direction that bring in ozone precursors from upstream region are crucial for the occurrence of episodes. To further investigate the wind information, a diagnostic wind field model is employed to simulate the 3 -dimensional wind fields over Hong Kong. It is revealed that <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> occur at Tung Chung when northwesterly winds prevail over northern coast of Lantau. Southwesterlies, however, blow over Tap Mun when ozone level rises in the afternoon. The simulated downward motion suppresses the growth of mixing layer and ozone precursors are capped which favour efficient photochemical reactions. Last but not least, based on the findings of the analysis and the model simulations, a forecast scheme is developed to predict the occurrence of <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes.</b> A set of meteorological and air quality parameters are selected to be criteria. Verifications using data in 2003 show promising results and the forecast scheme is capable to capture almost all episodic events with acceptable false alarm rate and false alarm ratio...|$|R

40|$|Although {{pollutant}} {{sources are}} usually in urban and industrialized areas, poor air quality is frequently encountered in downwind rural areas. This study utilized a tethered balloon {{to measure the}} pollutant concentrations in a downwind side (Caotun) of the Taichung Basin {{during the summer of}} 2002. Furthermore, an annular denuder system (ADS) was used to measure PM(2. 5) and gaseous pollutant concentrations. Concentrations of 55 VOCs species were measured continuously by a network of photochemical assessment monitoring stations in central Taiwan. This study discusses the correlation between the ozone concentration and the routes of an air mass during <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes.</b> Backward trajectory, ratio of particulate matter and photochemical indices were used to examine the aging degree of an air mass. During <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes,</b> the trajectory distribution had a clear sea-land breeze mechanism with a relatively slow wind speed, and the air mass primarily entered through the western coastal industrial area. Analytical results demonstrate that daytime ozone concentrations accompany HNO(3) concentrations by photochemical reactions and depend on the previous night's HNO(2) concentration. The sulfur and nitrogen conversion ratios, and the photochemical indices (ethylbenzene/ m,p-xylene, n-pentane/t- 2 -pentene and NO(2) /NO) increased with the ozone concentration. The downwind photochemical indices were strongly correlated with ozone concentration and were higher than those upwind. These phenomena indicate that the air mass during <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> belongs to the "more aged" category...|$|R
40|$|Sea-land breezes (SLBs) play an {{important}} role in transporting air pollution from urban areas on the coast. In this study, a meso-scale model MM 5 was used to simulate SLBs and to understand the transport of pollution during a prolonged <b>ozone</b> <b>episode</b> observed in Hong Kong in September 2001. With the designed settings, the model performed very well in the simulation of SLBs. The simulated surface winds and the planetary boundary layer (PBL) heights are presented to contrast the characteristics of dispersion and transport on pre-episode and episode days. The diurnal variations in horizontal and vertical winds on an episode day are then presented to illustrate the evolution of SLBs. The results indicate that on episode days the onset of sea breezes (SBs) was delayed to noontime due to offshore synoptic winds, while on pre-episode days the SBs had already penetrated deep inland by early afternoon. The simulation shows that SBs propagated in both onshore and offshore directions in the afternoon, leading to the formation of nocturnal regional-scale SBs. The maximum distance for the inland penetration of an SB front (SBF) was about 60 - 80 km, in contrast to 120 - 150 km for offshore propagation. With the aid of high-resolution trajectories, the main meteorological factors contributing to the occurrence of the observed <b>ozone</b> <b>episode</b> are discussed. It is believed that the offshore synoptic wind, the delayed SBs, as well as the low mixing height contributed to the daytime transport of pollution and high ozone on the coast. The trajectory analysis also indicates important contributions from regional sources of emission. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA two–stage {{strategy}} is proposed to predict regional peak <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> in the Houston–Galveston–Brazoria (HGB) area of Texas, USA. With the forecasted meteorological information, <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> can be predicted {{one day in}} advance.

40|$|Abstract. The air layer {{between the}} nocturnal {{boundary}} layer {{and the top}} of the daily mixing layer in an ozone-polluted area is known to serve as an ozone reservoir since the ozone that is produced in the mixing layer on the pre-ceding day is effectively preserved throughout the night in the air layer. Ozone reservoir layers existing at night can enhance the accumulation of surface ozone on the following day. However, our knowledge of the characteristics of ozone reservoir layers and their effects on the daily ozone accumu-lations is limited. In this work, ozone reservoir layers were experimentally investigated at a coastal, near-mountain site in southern Taiwan, 30 km away from the coastline.

40|$|Concentrations of {{tropospheric ozone}} often exceed Australian air quality goals in Sydney during summer. However, {{features}} in the occurrence of ozone in Sydney are yet to be fully explained. Meteorological conditions associated with <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> in Sydney are caused by complex interactions between synoptic and meso-scale processes. This paper discusses the meteorological influences behind <b>ozone</b> pollution <b>episodes</b> in Sydney. A synoptic climatology of <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> in Sydney was generated using multivariate statistical techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA) and a two-stage cluster analysis, to classify days into meteorologically homogeneous synoptic categories. Surface and upper air meteorological data for warm months (Oct–Mar) over a 10 -year period were used as input into the statistical analyses. Eleven synoptic categories were identified in Sydney during the warm season and ozone concentrations associated {{with each of the}} synoptic categories were investigated. One synoptic category was found to be associated almost exclusively with high pollution concentrations. High ozone concentrations were found to be associated with a high-pressure system located in the middle to eastern Tasman Sea producing light northwesterly gradient winds, an afternoon sea breeze, high afternoon temperatures, a shallow mixing height at the coast and warming aloft during the day. Over 90 % of all days exceeding current air quality goals for ozone in Sydney fell within the synoptic category associated with the highest ozone concentrations. It is envisaged that results from this research will be useful to Australian regulatory bodies from both a forecast point of view and for the siting of future ozone precursor sources in Sydney and surrounding regions. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{examined}} {{the response of}} surface ozone to future climate change over the eastern United States by performing simulations corresponding to present (1990 s) and future (2050 s) climates using an integrated model of global climate, tropospheric gas-phase chemistry, and aerosols. A future climate has been imposed using ocean boundary conditions corresponding to the IPCC SRES A 2 scenario for the 2050 s decade, resulting {{in an increase in}} the global annual-average surface air temperature by 1. 7 °C, with a 1. 4 °C increase over the surface layer of the eastern United States. Present-day anthropogenic emissions and CO 2 /CH 4 mixing ratios have been used in both simulations while climate-sensitive natural emissions were allowed to vary with the simulated climate. There is practically zero change in the spatiotemporally averaged ozone mixing ratios predicted over the eastern United States. However, the severity and frequency of <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> over the eastern United States increased due to future climate change, primarily as a result of increased ozone chemical production due to increased natural isoprene emissions. The 95 th percentile ozone mixing ratio increased by 5 ppbv and the largest frequency increase occured in the 80 ? 90 ppbv range. The most substantial and statistically significant (p-value < 0. 05) increases in episode frequency occurred over the southeast and midatlantic United States, {{largely as a result of}} 20 % higher annual-average natural isoprene emissions. Increased chemical production and shorter average lifetime are consistent features of the predicted seasonal surface ozone response, with the former's magnitude for a location largely a function of increased natural isoprene emissions, and the latter largely due to faster dry deposition removal rates. Future climate change is also predicted to lengthen the ozone season over the eastern United States to include late spring and early fall.

Four statistical models, three multiple regression and one ARIMA (0, 1, 2), for the prediction of the daily maximum 1 -hour ozone concentrations are developed. All models together, with a persistence forecast, are evaluated and compared with the 1993 's data, not used in the models development. Validation statistics {{were used to assess}} the relative accuracy of models. Analysis, concerning the models' ability to forecast real ozone episodes, was also carried out. Two of the three regression models provide the most accurate forecasts. The ARIMA model had the worst performance, even lower than the persistence one. The forecast skill of a bivariate wind speed and persistence based regression model for <b>ozone</b> <b>episode</b> days was found to be quite satisfactory, with a detection rare of 73 % and 60 % for O- 3 > 180 mu g m(- 3) and O- 3 > 200 mu g m(- 3), respectively...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} established that photochemical smog occurring in the Pearl River Delta Region (PRD) was associated with stagnant meteorological conditions. However, the photochemical smog (17 July to 20 July 2005) induced by typhoon Haitang was associated with moderate wind speed and nonstagnant meteorological conditions. The dynamic process of this <b>ozone</b> <b>episode</b> was studied using an integrated numerical model, that is, a mesoscale meteorological model and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Model performance has been evaluated using both ground-based meteorological and air quality observations. Analysis of simulated wind fields and ozone budget has been performed. This dynamic process is summarized into three physical factors. First, the westerly wind placed Hong Kong directly downwind of the PRD emissions. Second, the convergence of wind flow stimulated a vertical local circulation near the surface layer. This recirculation allowed primary and secondary pollutants to accumulate. Third, the conditions of high air temperature and low humidity resulted in active photochemical reactions. These combined effects resulted {{in the formation of}} high ozone in this episode.

40|$|The Urban Airshed Model (UAM) {{is used to}} {{evaluate}} emission control strategies for achieving the ozone standard. Uncertainties in the volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions have hampered {{the use of the}} UAM for control strategy evaluation. A methodology is described which uses sensitivity simulations with the UAM to investigate the effect of VOC emission uncertainties on the UAM's response to emission controls. The method uses comparisons of ambient VOC measurements with the emission inventory to estimate. the bias in VOC emissions. This bias estimate is further refined with UAM sensitivity simulations. A suite of UAM sensitivity simulations are made with emission inventory inputs that bound the range of uncertainty in VOC emissions. The results of the UAM simulations are analyzed to determine the effect of the uncertainty on the UAM response to emission controls. The method is illustrated with the August 26 - 29, 1987, <b>ozone</b> <b>episode</b> from the South Coast Air Basin of California. For this application, the VOC emission uncertainty did affect magnitude of the response of the UAM to emission reductions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a two-objective optimization methodology to select effective tropospheric ozone pollution control strategies on a mesoscale domain. The objectives considered are (a) the emission reduction cost and (b) the Air Quality Index. The control variables are the precursor emission reductions due to available technologies. The nonlinear relationship linking air quality objective and precursor emissions is described by artificial neural networks, identified by processing deterministic Chemical Transport Modeling system simulations. Pareto optimal solutions are calculated with the Weighted Sum Strategy. The two-objective problem has been applied to a complex domain in Northern Italy, including the Milan metropolitan area, a region characterized by frequent and persistent <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Polar Sunrise Experiment in 1998 {{measurements}} of hydrocarbons were made at the Canadian Arctic station Alert. Halogen atom concentrations {{play a key role}} in determining formaldehyde mixing ratios. Formaldehyde mixing ratios observed during <b>ozone</b> depletion <b>episodes</b> agree with those calculated from time integrated halogen atom concentrations. Formaldehyde is the most important loss mechanism for active bromine and at the same time an important source for HOx radicals. Via these reactions formaldehyde will indirectly influence chlorine chemistry and thus feedback mechanisms involving halogen atom concentrations and formaldehyde are likely to play a major role in the development of tropospheric <b>ozone</b> depletion <b>episodes</b> during polar sunrise...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMeasurements {{of ozone}} {{and other species}} from the European EMEP network in 2003 are presented. The European summer of 2003 was {{exceptionally}} warm and the surface ozone data for central Europe show the highest values {{since the end of}} the 1980 s. The concentrations were particularly high in June and August 2003. In this paper we argue that a number of positive feedback effects between the weather conditions and ozone contributed to the elevated surface ozone. Firstly, direct measurements of isoprene as well as the increased temperature and solar radiation indicate that biogenic emissions in Europe were increased during summer 2003 with a potential for enhanced ozone formation. Secondly, we show that the anticyclonic conditions during the <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> were accompanied by an extended residence time of air parcels in the atmospheric boundary layer, a low total ozone column and a reduced cloud cover, all favouring ozone formation. Thirdly, based on the Lagrangian dispersion model FLEXPART, we show that is very likely that extensive forest fires on the Iberian Peninsula, resulting from the drought and heat, contributed to the peak ozone values observed in North Europe in August. Additionally, forest fires in Siberia probably lead to an elevated background level of ozone and CO at northern latitudes during summer 2003 thereby increasing the level the peak <b>ozone</b> <b>episodes</b> sat on. Lastly, and most important, the heat wave presumably lead to less efficient ozone dry deposition due to stomata closure of the plants under drought stress. Due to climate change, situations like this may occur at a higher frequency in the future and may gradually overshadow the effect of reduced emissions from anthropogenic sources of VOC and NO x. This scenario also holds for secondary PM...|$|R
