5|$|Emulsions are {{a type of}} colloid {{in which}} surface tension plays a role. Tiny {{fragments}} of oil suspended in pure water will spontaneously assemble themselves into much larger masses.

5|$|As {{kerosene}} {{and gasoline}} grew in importance, Rockefeller's wealth soared {{and he became}} the richest person in the country, controlling 90% of all <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States at his peak. Oil was used throughout {{the country as a}} light source until the introduction of electricity and as a fuel after the invention of the automobile. Furthermore, Rockefeller gained enormous influence over the railroad industry, which transported his oil around the country. Standard Oil was the first great business trust in the United States. Rockefeller revolutionized the petroleum industry, and along with other key contemporary industrialists such as steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, defined the structure of modern philanthropy.|$|E
5|$|At that time, the Federal {{government}} was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to {{as high as}} $13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes {{in the ground and}} gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> place of water.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in Shetland since the Mesolithic period. The {{earliest}} written references to the islands date back to Roman times. The early historic period was dominated by Scandinavian influences, especially from Norway, and the islands did not become part of Scotland until the 15th century.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the few major operations, {{the first decade of}} the boom was {{dominated}} by numerous small producers.

5|$|In the {{interests}} of keeping the bread kosher (Angel Bakeries carries the hechsher of both the Edah HaChareidis and the Orthodox Union), Angel's son Ovadia, a trained chemist, collaborated with others at the Angel's-owned Adumim Chemicals plant {{to develop a new}} formula for the emulsifiers that bind water and <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bread-making process. In those early days, emulsifiers were made with animal-based fats which were not kosher.

30|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>oils</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rewapu Block {{are light}} and normal oils, which are {{distinctly}} {{different from those}} heavy <b>oils</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{northern part of the}} Halahatang region. Significant biodegradation can be eliminated due to lack of 25 -norhopanes and the absence of a “hump” on the baseline of chromatograms. Exceptions are extremely heavy <b>oils</b> <b>in</b> Wells RP 7 and RP 101 C. These oils have an apparent chromatographic baseline “hump,” but no 25 -norhopanes. The alkylated dibenzothiophenes were apparently reduced. Therefore, biodegradation was not severe and water washing appears to be the principal factor causing the origin of heavy <b>oils</b> <b>in</b> Wells RP 7 and RP 101 C. The local geological background presents conditions that are favorable for water washing alteration in these wells.|$|R

Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places.
