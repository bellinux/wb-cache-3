40|$|Abstract Background To quantitatively {{evaluate}} radiation-induced impaired oesophageal transit with oesophageal transit scintigraphy and {{to assess}} the relationships between acute oesophagitis symptoms and dysmotility. Methods Between January 1996 and November 1998, 11 patients affected by non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung not directly involving the oesophagus, requiring adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (RT) to the mediastinum were enrolled. Oesophageal transit scans with liquid and semisolid bolus were performed at three pre-defined times: before (T 0) and during radiation at 10 Gy (T 1) and 30 Gy (T 2). Two parameters were obtained for evaluation: 1) mean transit time (MTT); and 2) ratio between peak activity and residual activity at 40 seconds (ER- 40 s). Acute radiation toxicity was scored according to the joint EORTC-RTOG criteria. Mean values with standard deviation were calculated for all parameters. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests and paired t-Tests for all values were performed. Results An increase in the ER- 40 s from T 0 to T 1 or T 2 was seen in 9 of 11 patients (82 %). The mean ER- 40 s value for all patients increased from 0. 8306 (T 0) to 0. 8612 (T 1) and 0. 8658 (T 2). These differences were statistically significant (p 0. 05). Conclusion Using <b>oesophageal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> {{we were able to}} detect early alterations of oesophageal transit during the third week of thoracic RT. </p...|$|E
40|$|Comparison among {{different}} tests for diagnosis of oropharyngeal dysphagia. The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare videofluoroscopy (VFS), fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) and oro-pharyngo- <b>oesophageal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> (OPES) with regards to premature spillage, post-swallowing residue and aspiration to assess the reliability of these tests for detection of oro-pharyngeal dysphagia. Sixty patients affected with dysphagia of various origin were enrolled in the study and submitted to VFS, FEES and OPES using a liquid and semi-solid bolus. As a reference, we used VFS. Both the FEES and the OPES showed good sensitivity with high overall values (≥ 80 % and ≥ 90 % respectively). The comparison between FEES vs VFS concerning drop before swallowing showed good specificity (84. 4 % for semi-solids and 86. 7 % for liquids). In the case of post-swallowing residue, FEES vs VFS revealed good overall validity (75 % for semi-solids) with specificity and sensitivity well balanced for the semi-solids. OPES vs. VFS demonstrated good sensitivity (88. 6 %) and overall validity (76. 7 %) for liquids. The analysis of FEES vs. VFS for aspiration showed that the overall validity was low (≤ 65 %). On the other hand, OPES demonstrated appreciable overall validity (71. 7 %). VFS, FEES and OPES are capable of detecting oro-pharyngeal dysphagia. FEES gave significant results in the evaluation of post-swallowing residues...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility and {{autonomic}} neuropathy {{are common}} problems among diabetics with largely unknown aetiology. Many peptides {{are involved in}} the autonomic nervous system regulating the GI tract. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine if concentrations of oxytocin, cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin and vasopressin in plasma differ between diabetics with normal function and dysfunction in GI motility. Methods Nineteen patients with symptoms from the GI tract who had been examined with gastric emptying <b>scintigraphy,</b> <b>oesophageal</b> manometry, and deep-breathing test were included. They further received a fat-rich meal, after which blood samples were collected and plasma frozen until analysed for hormonal concentrations. Results There was an increase in postprandial oxytocin plasma concentration in the group with normal gastric emptying (p = 0. 015) whereas subjects with delayed gastric emptying had no increased oxytocin secretion (p = 0. 114). Both CCK and gastrin levels increased after the meal, with no differences between subjects with normal respective delayed gastric emptying. The concentration of vasopressin did not increase after the meal. In patients with oesophageal dysmotility the basal level of CCK tended to be higher (p = 0. 051) and those with autonomic neuropathy had a higher area under the curve (AUC) of gastrin compared to normal subjects (p = 0. 007). Conclusion Reduced postprandial secretion of oxytocin was found in patients with delayed gastric emptying, CCK secretion was increased in patients with oesophageal dysmotility, and gastrin secretion was increased in patients with autonomic neuropathy. The findings suggest that disturbed peptide secretion may be part of the pathophysiology of digestive complications in diabetics. </p...|$|R
