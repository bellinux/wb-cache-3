25|$|In physics, <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> of a {{spectral}} line from two viewpoints.|$|E
25|$|This means, essentially, that {{substance}} is just whatever {{can be thought}} of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> of a particular object, <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> of {{it as a kind of}} thing, e.g., x is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing (because it isn't a particular thing at all).|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{versions}} of this paradox that are closer to real-life situations and may be easier to understand for non-logicians. For example, the barber paradox supposes a barber who shaves all men who do not shave themselves and only men who do not shave themselves. When <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> about whether the barber should shave himself or not, the paradox begins to emerge.|$|E

25|$|Contemplation is a {{very old}} and {{important}} meditation technique. The practitioner meditates deeply on subtle facts. In agnya vichāya, one contemplates on seven facts life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of karmas, and the final accomplishment of liberation. In apaya vichāya, one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which eventually develops right insight. In vipaka vichāya, one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of karma. In sansathan vichāya, <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> about {{the vastness of the}} universe and the loneliness of the soul.|$|E
25|$|A {{cellular}} automaton is reversible if, for every current {{configuration of the}} {{cellular automaton}}, there is exactly one past configuration (preimage). If <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> of a cellular automaton as a function mapping configurations to configurations, reversibility implies that this function is bijective. If a cellular automaton is reversible, its time-reversed behavior can also {{be described as a}} cellular automaton; this fact is a consequence of the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata. For cellular automata in which not every configuration has a preimage, the configurations without preimages are called Garden of Eden patterns.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the idea that when people access a word's meaning, sensorimotor information that is used to perceive and act on the concrete object the word suggests is automatically activated. In the theory of grounded cognition, the meaning of a particular word is grounded in the sensorimotor systems. For example, when <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> of a pear, knowledge of grasping, chewing, sights, sounds, and tastes used to encode episodic experiences of a pear are recalled through sensorimotor simulation. A grounded simulation approach refers to context-specific re-activations that integrate the important features of episodic experience into a current depiction. Such {{research has}} challenged previously utilized amodal views. The brain encodes multiple inputs such as words and pictures to integrate and create a larger conceptual idea by using amodal views (also known as amodal perceptions. Instead of being representations in modality-specific systems, semantic memory representations had previously been viewed as redescriptions of modality-specific states. Some accounts of category-specific semantic deficits that are amodal remain even though researchers are beginning to find support for theories in which knowledge is tied to modality-specific brain regions. This research defines a clear link between episodic experiences and semantic memory. The concept that semantic representations are grounded across modality-specific brain regions can be supported by the fact that episodic and semantic memory appear to function in different yet mutually dependent ways. The distinction between semantic and episodic memory has {{become a part of the}} broader scientific discourse. For example, it has been speculated that semantic memory captures the stable aspects of our personality while episodes of illness may have a more episodic nature.|$|E

500|$|According to the Upanishad, {{the entire}} {{universe}} evolves by Sankalpa (a thinking, ideation process), one becomes what <b>one</b> <b>thinks,</b> metaphysics affects physics, and it is ideation that helps retain the appearances of the world. Following renunciation from this universe, which is also called a Sankalpa, the meditating mind is {{to be focused on}} the Nirvikalpa (the unchangeable) or the unchangeable part (metaphysical reality). Varaha in verse 2.64 compares the [...] "samsara" [...] (cycle of rebirth) to the domain of karma, states Billington, one that is like a long dream ("swapna"), a delusion, a sea of sorrow. It defines jivanmukta as someone who has overcome and attained liberation from this samsara through self-knowledge.|$|E

In an article for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen stated that [...] "the humor of Plankton comes from how his operative ambitions are constantly thwarted by a naïve, trusting kid". In 2015, Entertainment Weeklys Hillary Busis named Plankton one of the most devious characters on television, adding in her commentary that he is [...] "voiced to wicked perfection by Doug Lawrence". [...] of El Mundo favorably compared Plankton's plans to the stories of Georges Simenon in a 2013 article.|$|E

500|$|The passage {{concludes with}} a wry remark from Holly, [...] "I at last managed to get to sleep, a fact for which anybody who reads this narrative, if anybody ever does, may very {{probably}} be thankful". According to Stauffer, [...] "the disarming deflation of the passage {{goes a long way}} toward redeeming it, and is typical of the winning contradictions of the narrator's style". Tom Pocock in Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire has also highlighted the [...] "literary framework" [...] that Haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative, referencing Keats, Shakespeare, and Classical literature to imbue the story with a [...] "Gothic sensibility". Yet as Stauffer notes, [...] "Ultimately, however, <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> of Haggard's plots, episodes, and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence.|$|E
500|$|Having {{split from}} N.W.A, Dr. Dre's first solo album {{established}} {{him as one}} of the biggest hip hop stars of his era. Yahoo! Music writer S.L. Duff wrote of the album's impact on his status in hip hop at the time, stating [...] "Dre's considerable reputation is based on this release, alongside his production technique on Snoop's Doggystyle" [...] and his early work with N.W.A. Whatever <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> of the over-the-top bravado rapping, the tracks and beats Dre assembled are beyond reproach". The Chronic brought G-funk to the mainstream – a genre defined by slow bass beats and melodic synthesizers, topped by P-Funk samples, female vocals, and a laconic, laid-back lyrical delivery referred to as a [...] "lazy drawl". The album takes its name from a slang term for premium grade cannabis, chronic. The album cover is an homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers. Robert Christgau said that, although he [...] "can't stand" [...] it, he respects The Chronic [...] "for its influence and iconicity".|$|E
500|$|The vast {{majority}} of contemporary reviews were positive, with Sgt. Pepper receiving a widespread critical acclaim that matched its immediate commercial success. Kenneth Tynan of The Times described it as [...] "a decisive {{moment in the history}} of Western civilisation". Richard Poirier wrote: [...] "listening to the Sgt. Pepper album <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> not simply of the history of popular music but the history of this century." [...] Time magazine declared it [...] "a historic departure in the progress of music – any music". Newsweek Jack Kroll called it a [...] "masterpiece", comparing the lyrics with literary works by Edith Sitwell, Harold Pinter and T. S. Eliot, particularly [...] "A Day in the Life", which he compared to Eliot's The Waste Land. The New York Times Book Review characterised Sgt. Pepper as a harbinger of a [...] "golden Renaissance of Song" [...] and the New Statesman Wilfrid Mellers praised its elevation of pop music to the level of fine art.|$|E

500|$|In Stage three (good {{intentions}} {{as determined}} by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They {{try to be a}} [...] "good boy" [...] or [...] "good girl" [...] to live up to these expectations, having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the [...] "golden rule". [...] "I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." [...] Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> that [...] "they mean well".|$|E
500|$|Some would claim... {{that it is}} {{the most}} American of our orchestras, {{thinking}} no doubt of the Previn legacy, Bernstein's Presidency and Tilson Thomas's appointment. Others, looking back further to Pierre Monteux's reign, think it our most French orchestra, a quality nurtured by Previn and latterly Claudio Abbado. But what of their essaying of the Slavonic repertoire under Istvan Kertész, or of Mahler, whose idiom has been finely honed by Abbado? No, the LSO remains enigmatic, unpredictable and supremely individual. Of all the London orchestras the LSO seems to have more [...] "personalities", more [...] "individuals" [...] and has given the solo world more than its fair share of [...] "star" [...] performers. As an orchestra the LSO has never been prepared to submit to one principal conductor for long (<b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> of Karajan in Berlin, Haitink in Amsterdam or Mravinsky in Leningrad) but one of its greatest strengths remains its ability to attract fine conductors and dedicate itself wholeheartedly to creating a genuine performance.|$|E

Tommy said that [...] "Now I Want to Sniff Some Glue" [...] is the first positive piece on the album. The song served as an inspiration for one of the first punk fanzines, Mark Perry's Sniffin' Glue. [...] "I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement" [...] is also a minimalist piece, and was inspired by horror movies. The entire text is composed of three lines, and the composition was based on three major chords. With a playing time of 2:35, it is the longest piece on the album.|$|E

500|$|When {{writing the}} story, Uchikoshi {{made use of}} what he calls the [...] "inductive {{composition}} method", where a setting is created first, after which <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> about a core to the story {{that can be used to}} make the setting work. He did not recommend this way of writing, as he saw it as gamble that might not have resulted in an interesting story. This is in contrast to the deductive composition method, where a core story is thought of first, after which a setting is [...] "deduced", that matches the core. As an example of inductive composition used, Uchikoshi did not initially think up the story's [...] "main trick", and instead created two protagonists only because he thought it was getting stale with single-protagonist stories in visual novels, after which he thought about how to make two protagonists interesting. The writers only put little effort into hiding the 17-year gap between the Kid's and Takeshi's routes, writing each day of the story casually without a particular plan in mind. Rather, it took special effort to make it seem convincing when the game's secrets were revealed, with hints toward the truth added throughout the story, such as Tsugumi acting more suspicious when playing as the Kid due to having already experienced the events of Takeshi's route, or slight differences between the Kid's and Takeshi's routes due to the characters not being able to perfectly recreate events. While Coco was planned from the beginning as the character who knew the truth, Uchikoshi did not come up with the idea of leaving her on the bottom of the ocean until during the writing of the script.|$|E
