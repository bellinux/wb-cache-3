500|$|The {{character}} {{has appeared in}} numerous lists, often reflecting her good reception as a Star Wars character. IGN placed her at 81 in [...] "The Top 100 Star Wars Characters", noting her crypticness. She, {{along with the other}} Sith Lords in the game, came second-place in a modified list of the best Star Wars villains, based <b>on</b> <b>reader</b> requests for characters left out of the original list. The Lords of both the first and second Knights of the Old Republic were similarly grouped as some of gaming's best Star Wars characters by Joe Juba of Game Informer, calling most of them [...] "cooler and better developed" [...] than the Sith Lords in the actual Star Wars films. The character was ranked seventh among Game Informers [...] "Top Ten Female Villains in Video Games" [...] by Liz Lanier, saying that [...] "Kreia {{is one of the few}} female Sith Lords of the Star Wars universe, but she represents women of the dark side relatively ruthlessly." [...] The [...] "struggle" [...] against her was called one of [...] "25 greatest Star Wars moments in Xbox history" [...] by Edwin Evans-Thirlwell writing for GamesRadar, who called her reveal of her agenda [...] "compelling" [...] despite being exposition.|$|E
500|$|Asteroids {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} video game critics {{and has been}} regarded as Logg's magnum opus. Brett Alan Weiss, writing for Allgame, likened the monochrome vector graphics to minimalism and viewed its sound effects as memorable. Weiss found its overall design to be near-perfect and cites the intensity and controls as elements that make the game addicting. He admitted the game is easily understandable and [...] "holds up extremely well over time". William Cassidy, writing for GameSpy's [...] "Classic Gaming", noticed its innovations, including {{being one of the}} first video games to track initials and allow players to enter their initials for appearing in the top 10 high scores, and commented, [...] "the vector graphics fit the futuristic outer space theme very well." [...] In 1996, Next Generation listed it as number 39 on their [...] "Top 100 Games of All Time", particularly lauding the control dynamics which require [...] "the constant juggling of speed, positioning, and direction." [...] Asteroids was ranked fourth on Retro Gamers list of [...] "Top 25 Arcade Games"; the Retro Gamer staff cited its simplicity and the lack of a proper ending as allowances of revisiting the game. In 2012, Asteroids was listed on Time's All-TIME 100 greatest video games list. Entertainment Weekly named Asteroids one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013. It was added to the Museum of Modern Art's collection of video games.

2500|$|Israel's {{neighboring}} countries both helped and criticized Israel over {{the handling of}} the fire. Qatar-based Al-Jazeera pointed out that [...] "Israel failed to contain the fire", and that it was necessary for the state to plead for international help in order to bring the blaze under control. Various officials in European countries such as Greece, Italy and Germany reportedly also expressed their surprise at Israel's apparent helplessness. Many asked how it was possible that a country that went through several wars could have such a significant shortage of planes and firefighting materials. Officials in Jerusalem are reported to have said, [...] "The PR damage in the world is huge; Israel is perceived as fully incompetent."

2500|$|Direct readers' {{advisory}} {{is based}} on a non-judgmental assessment of the personal preferences of the reader through a series of questions, called a readers advisory conversation. [...] The assessment focuses <b>on</b> <b>reader</b> likes and dislikes with regard to a number of factors, including subject, reading level, genre, writing style, the level of characterization, plot elements, storyline, pace, tone, frame, and setting. [...] The hoped-for outcome of this interview is the identification of three or more appropriate suggestions (sometimes referred to as [...] "readalikes"—especially when the interview was initiated by patron interest in new authors/titles similar to one enjoyed in the past). [...] In identifying suitable suggestions, a readers' advisor combines personal knowledge of material with a variety of specialized print and online resources to come up with appropriate suggestions. The goal of direct readers advisory is to suggest titles based on a readers' individual interests and tastes. [...] Librarians who simply recommend their favorite books with little or no regard for the patron's own interests are not performing readers' advisory.|$|E
2500|$|Several reviews {{have also}} noted how well Gone Girl shows the tricky nature of media representation. Nick seems guilty due to media {{coverage}} before a trial occurs. Salon.com notes that [...] "Flynn, a former {{staff writer for}} Entertainment Weekly, is especially good on the infiltration of the media into {{every aspect of the}} missing-person investigation, from Nick's cop-show-based awareness that the husband is always the primary suspect to a raving tabloid-TV Fury, who is out to avenge all wronged women and obviously patterned on Nancy Grace." [...] Entertainment writer Jeff Giles notes that the novel also plays <b>on</b> <b>reader</b> expectations that the husband will be the murderer, expectations that have also been shaped by the media, writing, [...] "The first half of Gone Girl is a nimble, caustic riff on our Nancy Grace culture {{and the way in which}} 'The butler did it' has morphed into 'The husband did it.'" [...] A New York Daily News review also notes the novel's interest in how quickly a husband can be convicted in the media: [...] "In a media society informed by Nancy Grace, when a wife goes missing, the husband murdered her. There’s no need for a body to arrive at a verdict." [...] A San Francisco Chronicle review also notes the book's recurring commentary on media influence: [...] "Flynn pokes smart fun at cable news, our collective obsession with social media and reality TV." ...|$|E

60|$|This was a home-thrust, and for {{the moment}} threw the little casuist off the track. She {{carefully}} folded up the idea, and laid it away on the inner shelves of her mind till she could think more about it. Pliable as she was to all outward appearances, the child had her own still, interior world, where all her little notions and opinions stood up crisp and fresh, like flowers that grow in cool, shady places. If anybody too rudely assailed a thought or suggestion she put forth, she drew it back again into this quiet inner chamber, and went <b>on.</b> <b>Reader,</b> there are some women of this habit; {{and there is no}} independence and pertinacity of opinion like that of these seemingly soft, quiet creatures, whom it is so easy to silence, and so difficult to convince. Mara, little and unformed as she yet was, belonged to the race of those spirits to whom is deputed the office of the angel in the Apocalypse, to whom was given the golden rod which measured the New Jerusalem. Infant though she was, she had ever in her hands that invisible measuring-rod, which she was laying to the foundations of all actions and thoughts. There may, perhaps, come a time when the saucy boy, who now steps so superbly, and predominates so proudly in virtue of his physical strength and daring, will learn to tremble at the golden measuring-rod, held in the hand of a woman.|$|E
