5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies. Samples of each of these compositions were recovered in one <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> two major surface units of the Apollo 14 landing site within Fra Mauro: the immediate impact blanket of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.|$|E

5|$|In {{the evening}} of 9 July 1917, Vanguards {{magazines}} exploded and she sank almost instantly, with only three survivors, one of whom died soon afterwards; 842 men aboard were lost. Collingwoods crew recovered the bodies of three men killed in the explosion. The Board of Inquiry concluded that a fire of unknown origin began in a 4-inch magazine and spread to one <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the nearby 12-inch magazines, which detonated and sank the ship.|$|E
5|$|Infection with P.falciparum {{may result}} in {{cerebral}} malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy.

5|$|A {{drawback}} to {{the device was}} found on 7 March 1948, when the firebox crown sheet of Princess Alexandra, a Coronation Pacific of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, failed while hauling a passenger train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both water gauges were defective and on a journey earlier that day one <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the fusible plugs had melted, but this had gone unnoticed by the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.|$|E
5|$|As he {{attempted}} to withdraw with the wounded soldier, Bleak was confronted by two more Chinese. Putting down the wounded soldier, Bleak reportedly surprised the Chinese soldiers by charging them and smashing their heads together {{with such force that}} he may have fractured the skulls of one <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the assailants before pushing them out of his way. Eventually, all 20 men of the patrol returned to the UN lines, but a third of them were wounded. Bleak was credited with saving the patrol, both by promptly treating the wounded and by aggressively attacking and killing or neutralizing five Chinese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} bottom right corner, two Polish Jews are {{on the edge of}} the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E

5|$|Examples of glycerophospholipids {{found in}} {{biological}} membranes are phosphatidylcholine (also known as PC, GPCho or lecithin), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE or GPEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PS or GPSer). In addition to {{serving as a}} primary component of cellular membranes and binding sites for intra- and intercellular proteins, some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells, such as phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acids are either precursors of or, themselves, membrane-derived second messengers. Typically, one <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long-chain fatty acids, {{but there are also}} alkyl-linked and 1Z-alkenyl-linked (plasmalogen) glycerophospholipids, as well as dialkylether variants in archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|Handled {{the ball}} is Law 33 in the laws of cricket {{established}} by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). A batsman can be given out for handling the ball if, while playing a delivery, the batsman intentionally touches the ball with one <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> their hands not holding the bat. A decision of not out must be reached if the batsman handles the ball to avoid incurring an injury. A bowler does not receive credit for the wicket when a batsman is dismissed in this fashion.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{she became}} the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon, Paris. The curie (symbol Ci), a unit of radioactivity, is named in honour of her and Pierre (although the {{commission}} which agreed on the name never clearly stated whether the standard was named after Pierre, Marie <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them). The element with atomic number 96 was named curium. Three radioactive minerals are also named after the Curies: curite, sklodowskite, and cuprosklodowskite. She received numerous honorary degrees from universities across the world. The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions fellowship program of the European Union for young scientists wishing to work in a foreign country is named after her. In Poland, she had received honorary doctorates from the Lwów Polytechnic (1912),Poznań University (1922), Kraków's Jagiellonian University (1924), and the Warsaw Polytechnic (1926). In 1921, in the U.S., she was awarded membership in the Iota Sigma Pi women scientists' society.|$|E

5|$|In murtis (idols), Khandoba or Malhara is {{depicted}} as having four arms, carrying a damaru (drum), Trishula (trident), Bhandara-patra (turmeric powder-filled bowl) and khadga (sword). Khandoba's images are often dressed as a Maratha Sardar, or a Muslim pathan. Often, Khandoba {{is depicted}} as a warrior seated on horseback with one <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> his wives and accompanied {{with one or more}} dogs. He is also worshipped as the aniconic Lingam, the symbol of Shiva. Often in Khandoba temples, both representations of Khandoba— the aniconic lingam and the anthropomorphic horseback form.|$|E
5|$|Mary Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's older sister, {{had earlier}} been {{recalled}} from France in late 1519, ostensibly for her affairs with the French {{king and his}} courtiers. She married William Carey, a minor noble, in February 1520, at Greenwich, with Henry VIII in attendance; soon after, Mary Boleyn became the English King's mistress. Historians dispute King Henry VIII's paternity of one <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> Mary Boleyn's children born during this marriage. Henry VIII: The King and His Court, by Alison Weir, questions the paternity of Henry Carey; Dr. G.W. Bernard (The King's Reformation) and Joanna Denny (Anne Boleyn: A New Life of England's Tragic Queen) argue that Henry VIII was their father. Henry did not acknowledge either child, as he did his son Henry Fitzroy, his illegitimate son by Elizabeth Blount, Lady Talboys.|$|E
5|$|Officially ordered on 2 November 1911 {{and laid}} down {{less than a}} month later on 27 November, the first {{dreadnought}} became the largest ship that Armstrong had built. The second dreadnought was ordered on 29 July 1912 and laid down on 22 January 1913, delayed by Rio de Janeiro occupying the slipway in which it would be built. The New York Tribune (2 November 1913) and Proceedings (May and June 1914) reported that Greece had reached an accord to purchase the first battleship counterbalance the Ottoman Empire's acquisition of Rio de Janeiro from Brazil, but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell one <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the dreadnoughts, no deal was made.|$|E
