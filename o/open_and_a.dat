5|$|The UK Album Downloads Chart is {{a weekly}} music chart that ranks the most {{downloaded}} albums in the United Kingdom. During the 2000s, the chart was {{compiled by the}} Official Charts Company (OCC) on behalf on the British music industry, and was based solely on Sunday-to-Saturday sales of non-subscription music downloads from selected online stores. The most successful artist of the decade was the British band Snow Patrol, who spent eight weeks at number one with their albums Eyes <b>Open</b> <b>and</b> <b>A</b> Hundred Million Suns. The record label that spent the most weeks at number one was Island Records – with an artist roster that included Florence and the Machine, Amy Winehouse and Keane, Island spent 22 weeks at number one with nine different albums.|$|E
5|$|The western {{entrance}} to the Middle Ward is now <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> gateway leads north from the ward onto the North Terrace. The eastern exit from the ward is guarded by the Norman Gatehouse. This gatehouse, which, despite its name, dates from the 14th century, is heavily vaulted and decorated with carvings, including surviving medieval lion masks, traditional symbols of majesty, to form an impressive {{entrance to}} the Upper Ward. Wyatville redesigned {{the exterior of the}} gatehouse, and the interior was later heavily converted in the 19th century for residential use.|$|E
5|$|Born to an {{athletic}} family, Kuznetsova moved {{at the age}} of seven to Spain to attend the Sanchez-Casal Academy. In 2001, she first took part on a WTA tournament, the Madrid <b>Open,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> year later won her first WTA title at the Nordea Nordic Light Open in Helsinki, Finland. Her first appearance in a Grand Slam was at the 2002 Australian Open and her first Grand Slam title came at the 2004 US Open, making her the third Russian woman to win a Grand Slam title, after Anastasia Myskina and Maria Sharapova. Kuznetsova's second Grand Slam title was the 2009 French Open, defeating compatriot Dinara Safina in the final in straight sets. At the 2006 French Open and the 2007 US Open singles tournament she was the runner-up, both times to Belgian player Justine Henin. As a result, Kuznetsova obtained a career-high No. 2 WTA ranking, holding that position for 24 weeks in 2007 and 2008. Since the 2010 season, Kuznetsova lost her top 10 position and even dropped down to a year-end ranking of 72 in 2012, until recovering in 2016, when she progressed to the top 10 and reached the semifinals of the WTA Finals, her best result in that tournament to date.|$|E

In March 2007, Ding qualified for the televised stages of the 2007 World Championship for the first time after beating Mark Davis in the final qualifying round.

25|$|McEnroe {{struggled}} {{to regain his}} form after his 1986 sabbatical. He lost three times in Grand Slam tournaments to Ivan Lendl, losing straight-set quarterfinals at both the 1987 US Open and the 1989 Australian <b>Open</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> long four-set match, played over two days, in the fourth round of the 1988 French Open. Rumors of drug abuse had begun during his second sabbatical. McEnroe denied them at the time, but acknowledged that he had used cocaine during his career in a 2000 interview that implied that the use occurred during this period, although he denied that the drug affected his play.|$|E
25|$|Minichromosome {{maintenance}} proteins {{have been}} found to be required for DNA helicase activity and inactivation of any of the six Mcm proteins prevents further progression of the replication fork. This is consistent with the requirement of ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 function to assemble the Mcm proteins at the origin of replication. The complex containing all six Mcm proteins creates a hexameric, doughnut like structure with a central cavity. The helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex raises the question of how the ring-like complex is loaded onto the single-stranded DNA. One possibility is that the helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex can oscillate between an <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> closed ring formation to allow single-stranded DNA loading.|$|E

They threw down the palisades and began a {{vigorous}} attack on the fortifications. At the same time the portucllis was swung wide <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> furious onslaught was made by the garrison upon the Spaniards. In the confusion the two English prisoners were able to escape unhurt. There was a fierce struggle, the Spanish could not get out of the trap; some were killed under the walls and the rest were soon speedily driven back. As they did so the Spanish were assailed on their retreat by an ambush on the dyke and the rest were hunted into the waters. They were utterly routed; a great number were killed or wounded and several high-ranking officers were taken prisoner.|$|E
25|$|Sousa's game {{pattern has}} become more offensive-minded and consistent, and his game has evolved in recent years from playing on clay to {{becoming}} more proficient on other surfaces. He won his first Challenger title on hard courts in July 2013 in his hometown Guimarães. Later in September, Sousa went on a 8–1 run to cap his semifinal run at the 2013 St. Petersburg Open and win the title at the 2013 Proton Malaysian Open, both ATP tour hard-court indoor tournaments. He continued his form on faster courts in 2014, with deep runs on grass courts at the 2014 Gerry Weber Open and Topshelf <b>Open,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> final appearance in a hard court indoor tournament at the 2014 Moselle Open.
