The server keeps individual records of the players' progress, and they can resume their game on their next log <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> server. A persistent virtual galaxy is thus maintained for them.|$|E
5|$|In November 1884, Parker conspired with a {{group of}} Boston shippers, who filled Mary Celeste with a largely {{worthless}} cargo, misrepresented on the ship's manifest as valuable goods and insured for US$30,000 ($ today). On December 16, Parker set out for Port-au-Prince, the capital and chief port of Haiti. On January 3, 1885, Mary Celeste approached the port via the channel between Gonâve Island and the mainland, in which lay a large and well-charted coral reef, the Rochelois Bank. Parker deliberately ran the ship <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> reef, ripping out her bottom and wrecking her beyond repair. He and the crew then rowed themselves ashore, where Parker sold the salvageable cargo for $500 to the American consul, and instituted insurance claims for the alleged value.|$|E

25|$|Prince Maurice {{demonstrated}} this in {{the constitutional}} crisis of 1618, when the States of Holland under Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, asserting supreme provincial sovereignty, tried to hire provincial troops rather than federal troops under Maurice's command.

He also purged the Holland regents that supported the provincial-sovereignty pretensions of Oldenbarnevelt and so managed to acquire a political dominance {{in the government of}} the Republic that assumed almost monarchical proportions. His brother, and successor as stadtholder, Frederick Henry held <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> ascendancy, due to a deft policy of divide-and conquer, playing off the regent factions against each other.|$|E
