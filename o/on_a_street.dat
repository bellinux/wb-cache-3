25|$|In his seminal study (1982) on livable {{streets that}} was {{conducted}} in neighbourhoods with a grid, Donald Appleyard showed that social networking and street playing degraded as traffic increased <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>street.</b> His research provided the groundwork for traffic calming and for several initiatives such as living streets and Home Zones, {{all of which are}} aimed at improving a street's social milieu. The amount of traffic <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> depends on variables such as the population density of the neighbourhood, car ownership and its proximity to commercial, institutional or recreational edifices. Most importantly, however, it depends on whether a street is or could become a through road to a destination. As a through road, it could sustain unpredictable levels of traffic that may fluctuate during the day and increase over time.|$|E
