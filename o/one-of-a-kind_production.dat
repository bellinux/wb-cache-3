40|$|A transparent, {{reliable}} early {{estimation of}} work contents {{is crucial for}} capacity planning in shipyards. Yet most of the shipyards rely on practical experience of specialized production planners, for the early capacity estimation, which are prone to errors, as a bill of material is not available {{in the early stages}} of production planning in the <b>one-of-a-kind</b> <b>production.</b> This is due to a yet unfinished construction of the ship. This paper will discuss a method for creating a computer-supported, transparent, more reliable way for the estimation of work content, at an early planning stage of a <b>one-of-a-kind</b> <b>production,</b> using a generated bill of material. The bill of material is generated automatically using parametrized templates and contains steel and outfitting parts. Therefore a tool has been developed that generates steel and outfitting parts from parametrized templates. From the bill-of-material, the work content in hours is estimated by linking the parts in the bill-of-material to a process. The operation time can then be calculated by dividing the work content by the capacity of the work system. The operation time can then be used for scheduling the <b>one-of-a-kind</b> <b>production...</b>|$|E

The RoBlock project is an interdisciplinary research project within the area of intelligent manufacturing systems. The purpose of the project is to develop a platform usable for demonstration of how state-of-the-art technology and methods can be combined to make integrated and flexible manufacturing systems. In particular, we will show that intelligent manufacturing systems can be developed to a degree of flexibility where it becomes profitable to use in <b>one-of-a-kind</b> <b>productions</b> and small niche productions. In full operational mode the RoBlock system will be a manufacturing system in which 2 industrial robots suspended from a gantry will cooperate to continuously perform tasks specified by an external user. The system will be able to handle sudden changes in the design and planning phase, as well as changes in the production environment during the production cycle.

40|$|Due {{to global}} {{competition}} the modern European shipbuilding industry is {{under pressure to}} improve its manufacturing efficiency. The economical situation of the shipbuilding industry is influenced {{by an increase in}} demand to improve integrated information and control concepts. The efficiency of production/project management and coordinating activities within complex production environments is expected to increase by integrating operations on various levels of planning and control. These levels include both intra-organisational operations as found in autonomous, decentralised areas as well as operations to be coordinated between multi-site production facilities such as between manufacturer, supplier, and sub-supplier. For this reason this report sketches a two-level approach developed within the project ITiS-E specifically for <b>one-of-a-kind</b> <b>production.</b> Based on this <b>one-of-a-kind</b> <b>production,</b> a set of application modules to support the centralised coordination level are presented with regard to their functionalities as well as a tool to support the progress monitoring process.

50|$|Studio Furniture is a {{subfield}} of Studio Craft {{centered on}} <b>one-of-a-kind</b> or limited <b>production</b> furniture objects {{designed and built}} by craftspeople. The work is made in a craftsperson's studio setting {{as opposed to being}} made in a high volume factory. This conception of the site of production as being a studio links studio furniture to studio art and reflects its status as an individual creative process. Studio furniture objects often embody creative and/or communicative intent, a unique design, elements of functionality (either implicit or explicit), craftsmanship, and an intimate understanding of material in their creation. Studio furniture objects, perhaps because of their close association with sculpture and other fine art, are shown as often in art galleries as they are in furniture showrooms. As is the case in the Studio Crafts at large, this contested identity is the impetus for frequent intra-field dialogue and differing intellectual positions on the matter.|$|R

Vernon Chatman, co-creator of the TV series Wonder Showzen and Xavier: Renegade Angel, wrote a purposefully absurd and pretentious screenplay about thermo-nuclear doomsday, and then divided it into four acts. Each act was sent to a different independent adult video company, each of which specializes in enacting fetish scenarios submitted by amateurs for a price. Chatman then assembled the four completed segments (which feature nudity but no actual sexual content) into Final Flesh, with none of the actors, technicians or directors supposedly the wiser about the satiric nature of the project."http://www.allmovie.com/movie/final-flesh-v502984 Vice stated that Final Flesh [...] "could be Chatman's masterpiece."http://www.vice.com/read/a-chat-with-the-guy-behind-final-flesh The A.V.

5000|$|Art {{historian}} Liesbeth den Besten {{has identified}} six different terms to name art jewelry, including contemporary, studio, art, research, design, and author, {{with the three}} most common being contemporary, studio, and art. Curator Kelly L'Ecuyer has defined studio jewelry as {{an offshoot of the}} studio craft movement, adding that it does not refer to particular artistic styles but rather to the circumstances in which the object is produced. According to her definition, [...] "Studio jewelers are independent artists who handle their chosen materials directly to make <b>one-of-a-kind</b> or limited <b>production</b> jewelry..... The studio jeweler is both the designer and fabricator of each piece (although assistants or apprentices may help with technical tasks), and the work is created in a small, private studio, not a factory." [...] Art historian Monica Gaspar has explored the temporal meaning of the different names given to art jewelry over the past 40 years. She suggests that [...] "avant-garde" [...] jewelry positions itself as radically ahead of mainstream ideas; [...] "modern" [...] or [...] "modernist" [...] jewelry claims to reflect the spirit of the times in which it was made; [...] "studio" [...] jewelry emphasizes the artist studio over the craft workshop; [...] "new" [...] jewelry assumes an ironic stance towards the past; and [...] "contemporary" [...] jewelry claims the present and the [...] "here and now" [...] in contrast with traditional jewelry's eternal nature as an heirloom passing between generations.|$|R

Therefore, OKP requires analysis methods that deliver: 1) a generic working cycle to enable repetitive productivity improvements; 2) activities of personnel in production processes, which include the preparatory activities.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{construction}} industry’s norm {{of operation}} {{is that of}} <b>one-of-a-kind</b> <b>production</b> and delivery of products (e. g. a building). The results (products and/or services) are typically delivered through complementary competence sharing between different project participants. Such operational modes naturally have implications on the way that product related information is shared and exchanged between the participating organisations. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructures and applications while seemingly available are still far from meeting the real needs of inter-enterprise information exchange, and, service integration and management in one-of-a-kind settings. This paper presents the research findings of two recently concluded international projects (GLOBEMEN, and OSMOS) that have explored the operational norm of one-of-a-kind settings (in one case at a generic cross-sectoral level, {{and in the other}} in the construction sector). ICT architectures, components and various interaction scenarios are furthermore identified. The results are discussed from the perspective of two case studies. Key lessons learned and barriers to take-up of ICT solutions are presented...|$|E
40|$|Lean Thinking is {{currently}} often positioned as the underlying theory of lean production among practitioners and academics, although its originators, Womack and Jones, {{seem not to}} have presented it as a theory. This paper endeavors to analyze whether Lean Thinking {{can be viewed as}} a theory of lean production. For this purpose, a critical assessment of Lean Thinking is carried out. Lean Thinking is argued to lack an adequate conceptualization of production, which has led to imprecise concepts, such as the term “value”. The five principles of Lean Thinking do not orderly cover value generation, and they do not always encapsulate the core topics in their respective areas. The failure to trace the origin of lean concepts and principles reduces the opportunity to justify and explain them. Despite claims for generality, the application area of the five lean principles is limited to the transformation of mass production, with, for instance, <b>one-of-a-kind</b> <b>production</b> and construction being largely out of scope. It is concluded that it is opportune to move on beyond Lean Thinking, towards a generic theory of production, for acquiring a solid foundation for designing, operating and improving production systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{question}} of what conditions are required to make work organization in manufacturing more flexible. Therefore, we have derived hypotheses for the extent of flexibilization of manufacturing systems. In the foreground are various forms of working times and different skills of staff. The related hypotheses are tested using a personnel-centered simulation procedure as part of a feasibility study. This study is based on representative models of <b>one-of-a-kind</b> <b>production,</b> medium-scale and largescale series production. The simulation approach makes it possible to quantify the effects of flexible working times and staff assignments in addition to verifying the proposed hypotheses. 1 FORMS OF FLEXIBILIZATION IN MANUFACTURING The flexibilization of the work organization in manufacturing may include a number of different aspects: They range from job rotation between under-loaded and over-loaded workplaces, the higher qualification and the subsequent employment of multi-skilled staff to demand-oriented flexible working hours. These measures can lead to advantages for the operation department and for the staff, but also to disadvantages. Regarding job rotation and the employment of multi-skilled staff advantages may lie in the timely processing of orders, while on the part of employees occasionally the increase of wages comes into play...|$|E
40|$|With {{the trend}} for global collaboration, {{there is a}} need for {{collaborative}} design between geographically distributed teams and companies. In particular, this need is inevitable in the companies doing their business based on <b>one-of-a-kind</b> <b>production</b> (OKP). One important problem is the lack of interoperability and compatibility of data between different CAx systems. This problem is further highlighted in data exchange in cloud manufacturing. To the best of authors' knowledge, current studies have limitations in achieving the interoperability and compatibility of data. In this paper, a STEP-based data model is proposed to represent OKP product data/knowledge, which contains four categories of product knowledge (i. e., customer, product, manufacturing, and resource resp.). A STEP-based data modelling approach is proposed to describe each category of knowledge separately and then connect them to form the final integrated model. Compared with most current product models, this model includes the more complete product data/knowledge involved in OKP product development (OKPPD), and thus it can provide more adequate knowledge support for OKPPD activities. Based on the proposed STEP-based data model, a product data exchange and sharing (DES) framework is proposed and developed to enable DES in collaborative OKPPD in the cloud manufacturing environment. Case studies were carried out to validate the proposed data model and DES framework...|$|E

There is however a lack of enterprise systems that enable engineering contractors to control their engineering processes. Enterprise Systems, i. e.

This paper presents the results of two case studies at two different engineering contractors in the process industry and building and construction industry respectively. It presents the generic control and support processes atan engineering contractor that should be supported by an enterprise system. For each process the main functionality is discussed followed by the integration that is required between the different processes, resulting in a blueprint of an Enterprise Systems for engineering contractors.

40|$|Efficiency in the {{management}} of integrated product and processes development is a basic requisite to guarantee competitiveness and success for manufacturing companies. This means that operational management of activities and human and material resources is extremely important, especially in virtual OKP (<b>one-of-a-kind</b> <b>production)</b> systems, and must cover related aspects of their capabilities and social character as well as assignment criteria. In this context, and to facilitate collaborative resources management, an ontology focused on resources and capabilities is proposed in this work. This ontology supports the necessary knowledge for generic and collaborative process planning, providing a shared common semantic for {{all the members of the}} virtual company. This work differs from other proposed ontologies in the area of process planning where the resources considered are all those elements that participate in the execution of the different activity types involved in this wide and complex process. The ontology directly covers the shared, social nature of the resources, the agentive behaviour of many of them and a characterisation of their capabilities, thus providing specific solutions to the needs of the collaborative integrated development of products, processes and resources (CIDP 2 R) process.

40|$|The {{globalization}} {{of business and}} industry and the worldwide competitive economy are forcing <b>One-of-a-Kind</b> <b>Production</b> (OKP) enterprises to utilize fully the best available equipment and techniques. The objective is to have efficient control of the organizational structure {{in order to produce}} high quality products at lower prices within a shorter period of time. With the development of modern technologies and theories, a new generation of OKP systems is urgently required for Rapid Product Development (RPD) by OKP enterprises to meet today's increasingly global competition. RPD has been recognized as playing a key role in improving the competitiveness of OKP companies in the global market. With rapid development of information technology (especially Internet technology), network technology, modern management technology and other related advanced technologies to the manufacturing enterprises, tremendous efforts have been made in developing Internet based systems for the purpose of RPD through collaboration over the Internet, e. g. Internet-based systems for product design and manufacturing, Internet based design for X and Internet based integrated systems. These Internet based systems can be used to rapidly produce high quality products with low costs, and thus bring tremendous profit for manufacturing companies and thus stay competitive in the global market. Such kinds of systems are urgently required in industry. However, the research and development of Internet based RPD (IRPD) systems for producing OKP products are still in early stage. Further research and development in this area {{are becoming more and more}} urgent. This thesis systematically reviews the historical background of the innovative technologies for Internet based OKP product development. Through this systematical overview of the existing Internet based systems and recent approaches of Internet based design and manufacturing systems, the problems that emerged from recent approaches have been identified. They include, distributed system structure, cost optimization algorithm, product data modeling, production information flow modeling, DFX, CAD/CAPP/CAM integration technology and process modeling and distributed knowledge management. To overcome these problems and to develop a new generation of OKP systems, research and development of a product development platform has been carried out throughout this research work. The main findings are outlined in chapters, which include the definition of the proposed product development platform, an integrated information framework for rapid development of sheet metal parts, the global data structure for global manufacturing, a CAD/CAPP/CAM integration system, a WWW based information management system, cases studies of using the platform for rapid sheet metal and mould product development, the definition and application of an Internet based cost estimation and optimization framework. These research topics and findings constitute the main contents of the thesis. Finally, the future trend of RPD has been proposed in this thesis, which covers the topics of Internet based collaborative design, decision support, manufacturing support, supply chain management, Internet techniques for product design and manufacturing, system integration, product modeling, STEP based data environment, concurrent engineering (CE), etc., which might be used to guide coming research, or to be used as reference for a company to deploy or develop Internet based RPD systems for producing OKP products...|$|E
