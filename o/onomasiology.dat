50|$|The {{study of}} lexical changes forms the diachronic {{portion of the}} science of <b>onomasiology.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1931 the German {{linguist}} Jost Trier {{introduced a}} new method in his book Der deutsche Wortschatz im Sinnbezirk des Verstandes which {{is known as the}} lexical field theory. According to Trier, lexical changes must always be seen, apart from the traditional aspects, in connection with the changes within a given word-field. After World War II few studies on onomasiological theory have been carried out (e.g. by Cecil H. Brown, Stanley R. Witkowski, Brent Berlin). But <b>onomasiology</b> has recently seen new light with the works of Dirk Geeraerts, Andreas Blank, Peter Koch and the periodical <b>Onomasiology</b> Online, which is published at the Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt by Joachim Grzega, Alfred Bammesberger and Marion Schöner. A recent representative of synchronic <b>onomasiology</b> (with a focus on word-formation processes) is Pavol Stekauer.|$|E
50|$|His {{focus is}} on <b>onomasiology,</b> euro-linguistics, intercultural communication, {{teaching}} of English as a lingua franca, language teaching {{in general and the}} role of language and communication in the transfer of knowledge. He also developed the Basic Global English (BGE) system for English teaching. With <b>Onomasiology</b> Online (Onon), he created one of the first peer-reviewed free access German linguistics journals. His second journal is specially dedicated to the relatively young branch of eurolinguistics: Journal for EuroLinguistiX (Jelix). He is also involved in the field of university-level language teaching, particularly in the development and dissemination of the Learning by teaching model founded in the 1980s by Jean-Pol Martin.|$|E
50|$|In {{historical}} <b>onomasiology</b> or {{in historical}} linguistics, a metaphor {{is defined as}} a semantic change based on a similarity in form or function between the original concept named by a word and the target concept named by this word.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Onomasiology</b> (from ὀνομάζω (onomāzο)—to name, {{which in}} turn is from ὄνομα—name) is a branch of {{linguistics}} concerned with the question [...] "how do you express X?" [...] It is in fact most commonly understood as a branch of lexicology, the study of words (although some apply the term also to grammar and conversation).|$|E
50|$|Another branch that {{developed}} from <b>onomasiology</b> and, {{at the same}} time, enriched it in turn was linguistic geography (areal linguistics), since it provided onomasiologists with valuable linguistic atlases. The first ones are Sprachatlas des Deutschen Reiches of Georg Wenker and Ferdinand Wrede, published beginning in 1888, the ALF (Atlas Linguistique de la France) by Jules Gilliéron (1902-1920), the AIS (Sprach- und Sachatlas Italiens und der Südschweiz) by Karl Jaberg and Jakob Jud (1928-1940), the DSA (Deutscher Sprachatlas) by Ferdinand Wrede et al. (1927-1956). These atlases include maps that show the corresponding names for a concept in different regions as they were gathered in interviews with dialect speakers (mostly old rural males) {{by means of a}} questionnaire. Concerning English linguistics, <b>onomasiology</b> as well as linguistic geography has been playing only a minor role (the first linguistic atlas for the US was initiated by Hans Kurath, the first one for the UK by Eugen Dieth).|$|E
50|$|His {{earliest}} work concerned morphological {{problems in}} the Germanic languages, <b>Onomasiology</b> and Norse mythology. He published parts of Sveriges runinskrifter, editions of medieval texts and together with Åke Holmbäck, a translation of the Swedish medieval province laws (with commentaries). He published several reference works, such as Svensk språkhistoria in three tomes, and a grammar for modern Swedish Vårt svenska språk. In 1944, he initiatied Nämnden för svensk språkvård (nowadays Språkrådet, the Swedish Language Council).|$|E
5000|$|Semasiology (from links=no, , [...] "signification") is a {{discipline}} of linguistics {{concerned with the}} question [...] "what does the word X mean?". It studies the meaning of words regardless how they are pronounced. It {{is the opposite of}} <b>onomasiology,</b> a branch of lexicology that starts with a concept or object and asks for its name, i.e., [...] "how do you express X?" [...] Whereas semasiology starts with a word and asks for its meanings.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the past}} many {{writers such as}} Bigourdan (France, 1903) and McGreevy (United Kingdom, 1995) {{credited}} Mouton as the [...] "founding father" [...] of the metric system. In 2007 the late Australian metric campaigner Pat Naughtin investigated Wilkins' proposal for a universal system of measurement in Wilkins' essay, a work that pre-dated Mouton's proposal by two years. Wilkins' proposal, unlike Mouton's, discussed an integrated measurement system that encompassed length, volume and mass rather than just length. Wilkins' Essay was widely circulated at the time, but the main interest in the Essay was his proposal for a philosophical language in general rather than just a universal standard for units of measure. [...] Subsequent interest in Wilkins' Essay was confined mainly to those interested {{in the field of}} <b>onomasiology</b> rather than metrology: for example, Roget in the introduction of his Thesaurus (1852), noted Wilkins' Essay as being one of the leading seventeenth-century works in <b>onomasiology.</b> [...] British commentators of the Essay devoted little space to Wilkins' proposals of measurement; Vernon et al. (1802) made a passing comment on the section on measurements in an eight-page study of the Essay while Wright-Henderson (1910), in a four-page study of the Essay, made no comments about measurements at all.|$|E
50|$|Semantic change (also {{semantic}} shift, semantic progression, semantic development, or semantic drift) is {{the evolution}} of word usage—usually {{to the point that}} the modern meaning is radically different from the original usage. In diachronic (or historical) linguistics, semantic change is a change in one of the meanings of a word. Every word has a variety of senses and connotations, which can be added, removed, or altered over time, often to the extent that cognates across space and time have very different meanings. The study of semantic change can be seen as part of etymology, <b>onomasiology,</b> semasiology, and semantics.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Onomasiology,</b> {{as a part}} of lexicology, {{starts from}} a concept which is taken to be prior(i.e. an idea, an object, a quality, an {{activity}} etc.) and asks for its names. The opposite approach is known as semasiology: here one starts with a word and asks what it means, or what concepts the word refers to. Thus, an onomasiological question is, e.g., [...] "what are the names for long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried?" [...] (answers: french fries in the US, chips in the UK, etc.), while a semasiological question is, e.g., [...] "what is the meaning of the term chips?" [...] (answers: 'long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried' in the UK, 'slim slices of potatoes deep fried or baked until crisp' in the US).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Onomasiology</b> was {{initiated}} {{in the late}} 19th century, but it didn't receive its name until 1902, when the Austrian linguist Adolf Zauner published his study on the body-part terminology in Romance languages. And it was in Romance linguistics {{that the most important}} onomasiological works were written. Early linguists were basically interested in the etymology (i.e. the word-history) of the various expressions for a concept which was mostly a clearly defined, unchangeable concrete object or action. Later the Austrian linguists Rudolf Meringer and Hugo Schuchardt started the [...] "Wörter und Sachen" [...] movement, which emphasized that every study of a word needed to include the study of the object it denotes. It was also Schuchardt who underlined that the etymologist/onomasiologist, when tracing back the history of a word, needs to respect both the [...] "dame phonétique" [...] (prove the regularity of sound changes or explain irregularities) and the [...] "dame sémantique" [...] (justify semantic changes).|$|E
40|$|What {{could be}} a more fitting tribute to Oskar Reichmann than a {{contribution}} to diachronic <b>onomasiology?</b> The {{purpose of the present}} paper – brief though it is – is threefold: first, to chart the domain of <b>onomasiology,</b> determining its various subfields and their mutual relationships; second, to define the specific position of diachronic <b>onomasiology</b> {{in the context of this}} classification, and third, to situate my own recent contributions to onomasiological research against the backdrop of this overview of the state of the art. The first aspect expands and revises the suggestions about the internal constitution of the field of <b>onomasiology</b> that I made elsewhere (Geeraerts 1999 a). Although I suspect that the classification that I will present here is still amenable to substantial improvement, I do feel that it is more balanced and comprehensive than my earlier attempt. I would also like to point out that the references to the literature that I will be giving are obviously not intended to be exhaustive. I hope, though, that they are representative of what is going on in contemporary <b>onomasiology.</b> Also, I will restrict my remarks to onomasiological research of a theoretical nature.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the contribution of}} cognitive linguistics to diachronic lexicology and describes how lexical studies within cognitive linguistics are gradually and naturally evolving toward a sociolexicological approach that links up with sociolinguistics. It takes the distinction between semasiology and <b>onomasiology</b> as its basic organizing principle. Based on this distinction, the article charts the field of <b>onomasiology</b> (probably the lesser known of the two subfields of lexicology) and examines the contribution of cognitive linguistics to that field. It also illustrates the importance of sociolexicology {{for the study of}} onomasiological variation and change, with references to sociolinguistic studies at large within cognitive linguistics. There are two ways in which cognitive linguistics contributes to diachronic semasiology: by employing such mechanisms of semantic change as metaphor and metonymy, which cognitive linguistics has shed new light on, and by exploiting the prototype-based structure of polysemy. This article also considers prototype theory, modulations on the core cases, the development of radial sets, semantic polygenesis, semantic change from subsets, and referential and nonreferential types of meaning.

40|$|The current {{research}} {{is the first in}} a series of articles devoted to the study of money names in different periods of the English language history and is an attempt to reconstruct cognitive foundations for designating the concept of money in the Anglo-Saxon period (AD 410 – 1066) and look at how specific historical processes and human practices might have affected the naming. Money as an object of cognition has been the prerogative of economics, and as artifacts of numismatics. Linguistics has yet to contribute to the study of the phenomenon in question as its methods of semantic, etymological, and comparative analyses can help expose sociolinguistic forces at work in setting consistent patterns of denotation. In the history of concept formation figurative transfers played an important role in creating grounds for naming an object by the cognizing subject.

40|$|Cognitive <b>onomasiology</b> {{opens up}} new avenues for {{studying}} the processes of linguistic denomination of concepts. economics as science and business {{as we know it}} today are more recent developments of human thought and activity than philosophy, or mathematics, or various trades, that is why they have to draw on general literary language or other sciences for their terms, hence the abundance of metaphorical designations in their terminological systems. Traditional studies within the framework of the Conceptual Metaphor Theory proceed from the target concept and aim to expose the systema-ticity of meaningful mappings with various source domains. The current research differs from them in that it proceeds from the source domain: the point of departure is the concept of WATeR as an entity separate from the word ‘water’. The concept is treated as a unit of cognition constructed in the course of cognizance of a multitude of characteristics (components) which constitute the intension of the concept. The main aim of this research is to expose cognitively salient conceptual components of WATeR which are operative in metaphorical designations and in the formation of conceptual content of newly formed economics and business terms (e. g. liquidity, flow, etc.).

40|$|The article {{contains}} the accurate {{research of the}} semantic structure of scientific technical analytic terms – special nomination units. The technical term semantic structure is qualified as the complex of semes, combining certain special term substantial characteristics. It was proved every terminological word-combination presents semantically complete structure. According to this position, several degrees of semantic unity were differentiated in succession. The semantic unity of the terminological unit depends on the presence or deficiency of the words, which are not scientific technical terms, in its structure. It is ascertained that terminological units constituents are endued with the highest functional potential in the terminology when firstly, realized by scientific technical term, and secondly, explicated by other lexical subsystems representative. Those analytic terms, the <b>onomasiology</b> base of which {{as well as their}} <b>onomasiology</b> characteristic feature has the terminological meaning, are fulfilled with the less number of units. The semantic structure of scientific technical terminology multicomponent terms can be characterized as more complicated; the degree of their semantic unity is lower to compare with two-component ones. The accomplished research of semantic modifications testifies the specific activity of the meanings metaphor and metonymy processes. The semantic transformation process, as a rule, is set in nouns, less – in adjectives.

40|$|International audienceThe semasiological-onomasiological {{distinction}} is arguably {{one of the}} most fundamental axioms of langauge science (Geeraerts 2010). Although the theoretical basis of the {{distinction is}} not questioned, this study shows that, analytically, it cannot not be strictly maintained within the framework of Cognitive Linguistics. The aim is to show that instead of discrete items in context, lexemes actually consist in onomasiological bundles of fine-grained morpho-syntactically varied constructions. The analysis examines the semasiological variation of the English preposition over. Applying multifactorial usage-feature analysis (Geeraerts et al. 1994) to 471 contextualised occurrences of the lexeme, the study demonstrates that fine-grained morpho-syntactic variation correlates with semasiological structure. The results reveal that specific lexical senses are significantly associated with specific morpho-syntactic patterns. Moreover, it is shown that semasiological structure more generally can be mapped using these fine-grained formal variations. The results are interpreted as evidence for the need to treat linguistic forms, not as discrete contextualized units, but as composite onomasiological bundles. This non-reified understanding of form parallels Greeraerts’ (1993) claim that we need to treat meaning as a non-reified phenomenon, but blurs the analytical line between <b>onomasiology</b> and semasiology sensu stricto...|$|E
40|$|Even if {{at a small}} extent, the {{speakers}} of a language concur to change their lexicon, which they have inherited as a whole. They are driven to do that by the necessity of naming something new or optimizing the onomasiological salience of already existing words, with a continuous changing {{in the way they}} express concepts. Needless to say, in order to avoid an overloading of the memory system, they are encouraged to recycle what is already existent. Through a small set of associative strategies, people relate a concept which has already been verbalized, with another one which has to be verbalized, producing lexical changes. Over time, however, the conceptual motivation which originated a particular designation becomes obscure to speakers. Large scale lexical surveys aid us in discovering recurrent (both universal and culturally bounded) schemas of designating a concept and recovering the relevant motivation for each designation, the ‘iconym’, as we might say, according to Mario Alinei’s terminology. In the general framework of cognitive <b>onomasiology,</b> I have outlined a project aimed at singling out the different ‘pathways’ through which natural physical concepts have been designated in the Ir. languages in order to get insight into the way Iranian speaking people have perceived and conceptualized the physical environment where they had to get their bearings and which they concurred to change with their constant activities. To accomplish this work, I have started a few years ago gathering the relevant lexicon in the Ir. languages, using as sources mostly dictionaries and glossaries and also, for a few languages (mainly Persian and Baloči), information provided by native speakers. The corpus produced so far contains several thousands of words which appear to be of a remarkable interest...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to commemorate, on {{the seven}} {{hundredth}} {{anniversary of the}} birth of Emperor Charles IV, significant milestones in the history of Czech language, to point toward the usage of Czech in the present day and to recognize the yet underutilized possibilities of onomasiological description of the spoken system of Czech as it relates to non-native speakers. This work would contribute to more effective teaching of Czech as a foreign language, especially for non-Slavic speakers. This paper is focused on (a) the presentation of significant language rules related to Czech and the role of Czech in communication (reminiscent of the Golden Bull of Charles IV, which established Czech as one of the official languages in the Holy Roman Empire). Next the paper examines (b) types of grammatical description (the synchronic and diachronic approach, as well as comparative, descriptive, prescriptive, or semasiological grammar) with emphasis on both general and specific qualities of pedagogical grammar (reduction and simplification of curriculum, the cyclical nature of grammatical interpretation, efforts toward understandability and learnability, application of curriculum, and pragmatism). Attention is then dedicated to (c) problematic explanations of Czech grammar in textbooks of Czech for foreigners (formalism, disproportionate attention to morphology and syntax, and similar issues). The paper concludes by considering (d) the advantages and possibilities of onomasiological description of the grammatical system of Czech, beginning with what languages have in common (the semantic dimension) and ending with how they differ (formal representation of meaning and the functions of communication). <b>Onomasiology</b> allows for the introduction of competing ways to express grammatical categories (varied frequency, stylistic connotation, among others). This method contributes to the effective interpretation of grammatical categories that do not have a parallel between the source and target languages.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with semantic change in English along two dimensions: time and place. The second dimension considers controversies that have arisen after the global spread of English and the subsequent emergence of 'deviant' semantic norms as perceived by native speakers. This {{is linked to the}} puristic role that English pedagogy has been playing since the heyday of 'etymology'. The thesis argues as follows. Although the prevalence of the Saussurean (1915) principle of 'arbitrariness' has contributed to the sanctioning of semantic change, it has not freed modern linguistics from the shackles of linguistic purism. This purism, however, has acquired a nationalistic face now that English derives its high status from belonging to English-speaking nations. The 'true' meanings of English words are now commonly seen as those that have developed with the rise and development of the Anglo-Saxons' language. These are evolutionary processes and must be accounted for validity in historical semantics. The thesis contributes to the field by offering a corpus-based study of semantic change using the case of the lexical category to show in a diachronic version of Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) work on metaphor. The aim is to stress the role of metaphor in semantic change on both levels of semasiology and <b>onomasiology.</b> A second contribution highlights {{the extent to which the}} study of meaning in time in western linguistics is thought to be worthwhile as compared to that of meaning in place. Meaning in place is a synchronic, controversial issue commonly examined along sociolinguistic parameters in which the role of conceptual metaphor in generating local innovations is neglected. A third contribution shows how the focus on spreading the 'core' and 'fixed' norms of the English vocabulary through ELT has shifted attention from the centrality of metaphor to language use. An empirical study is also offered to demonstrate the influence of nationalism on the design of the EFL/EIL lexical syllabus...|$|E
40|$|The review gives a {{critical}} {{assessment of the}} content {{and structure of the}} five-volume dictionary of Slavic animal names (zoonyms), compiled by Stefan Warchol, a professor at the University of Lublin. The author is given high credits for systematizing the extensive lexical material (over 120, 000 items) collected on the indigenous Slavic territories in Poland, Bulgaria, Serbia, Macedonia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Upper and Lower Lusatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. It is highly appreciated that the research material was recorded directly from informants (1, 500 people) and is supplemented by commentary elaborating on each name’s motivation. The dictionary articles are noted for particular thoroughness of the lexicographical description to include information about the original form of the animal’s name, the place where it was registered (the name of the village, region, country), the nomination background and the frequency of use. The breadth of coverage of zoonymic data, which includes the names of 44 species of domestic and domesticated wild animals, is emphasized. The first volume contains the names of buffaloes, bulls, oxen and horses; the second — the names of cows; the third is devoted to cats and dogs names; the fourth collects the names of different kinds of pet animals (hedgehogs, foxes, hares, canaries, parrots, etc.). The dictionary articles of the fifth volume present the names of animals of different species categorized on the common root basis, which allows one to trace the level of its productivity and the breadth of its distribution throughout the Slavic territory. Particular attention in the review is given to the conceptual side of the research which builds on the author’s study of the archaic layer of zoonymic vocabulary and develops into the original hypotheses on Slavic ethnogeny problem and delineating the boundaries of the ancestral home of the Slavs. The peer-reviewed dictionary provides rich and well-systemized information relevant for research in the fields of Slavic zoonyms, onomastics, semasiology, <b>onomasiology,</b> etymology, dialectology, ethnolinguistics, and the cultural history of the Slavic peoples...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} is a {{diachronic study}} of verbs of {{motion in the}} Romance languages. The work on these verbs that {{has been carried out}} so far is often scattered in dictionaries, historical grammars, books on Romance verbal system and isolated articles, and the few articles and book-length monographs that make verbs of motion their prime concern tend to limit themselves to only one level of analysis and to one of the widely-studied languages, such as French, Italian, Portuguese, or Spanish. This dissertation amplifies this traditional scope. It analyzes the historical development of the verbs of motion on the levels of lexicology, semantics, morphology and syntax in nine national and non-national languages, such as Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Rumanian, Catalan, Occitan, Sardinian, and Rhaeto-Romance. ^ In addition, the dissertation expands the kind of theoretical framework that {{can be applied to the}} Romance verbs that express movement by drawing upon several theories situated within the framework of cognitive linguistics. Chapter 1 relates the principles of cognitive <b>onomasiology</b> (semantic field theory) proposed by Andreas Blank and Peter Kock to the cognitive typology of languages formulated by Leonard Talmy. Chapter 2 is structured around the conceptual theory of metaphor developed by George Lakoff and his collaborators. Chapter 3 incorporates the cognitive account of perfect auxiliary variation conceived by Thomas Shannon for the Germanic languages. Chapter 4 draws upon the grammaticalization theory developed by American and European linguists in the last two decades. ^ The application of these theories reveals that at each one of the four levels of lexicology, semantics, morphology and syntax the Romance verbs of motion exhibit a combination of conservative and innovative tendencies. It also highlights the parallels that exist between the main attributes of the cognitive approach—namely its polyvalent nature, functional focus and emphasis on the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s interaction with the world—and the most salient features of verbs that express movement. Thus the dissertation argues that while the cognitive paradigm is by no means the only possible way to study the Romance verbs of motion, it is particularly well suited to serve as a unifying perspective on the subject. ...|$|E
40|$|Corpus-based {{approaches}} to constructional semantics are a rapidly developing area of contemporary linguistics. This dissertation, which presents a multivariate quantitative {{analysis of the}} Dutch causative constructions with 'doen' and 'laten', contributes to this research area by introducing several theoretical and methodological innovations. First, this study integrates the inter- and intraconstructional perspectives on semantics (cf. <b>onomasiology</b> and semasiology). To describe the internal structure of each constructional category, different exemplars of the constructions and their features are evaluated {{with regard to their}} intracategorial family resemblance. Several quantitative techniques, such as multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, are used to establish the relevant dimensions of semantic variation and the senses, which are operationalized as groups of similar exemplars. The similarity is based on thirty-five manually coded semantic and formal variables. The analyses show that the main conceptual dimensions along which the exemplars are distributed correspond to the distinction between mental and non-mental caused events, and the one between more or less autonomous Causees, or direct vs. indirect causation. The exemplars form a continuum along these dimensions, rather than a set of discrete senses, although there are several densely populated clusters, mostly associated with highly frequent low-level schemata, such as doen denken aan remind of and laten weten let know, inform. From the interconstructional perspective, the study explores the most distinctive exemplars and features, which are associated with the two constructions. These features and exemplars are related to the dimension direct vs. indirect causation, in accordance with the previous studies. This conclusion is {{made on the basis of}} a series of quantitative analyses, which involve cutting-edge statistical techniques: logistic regression with mixed effects, conditional inference trees and random forests. The analyses reveal that the intracategorial prototypicality and intercategorial distinctiveness of the exemplars and their semantic features do not correlate in the case of laten, which is more semantically heterogeneous than doen. This has important implications for Empirical Cognitive Semantics and especially for the ongoing debate about the nature of salience phenomena and their corpus-based operationalization. The study also explores variation in the use of the constructions in different registers and national varieties of Dutch, and proposes an innovative account of language variation and change. The analyses demonstrate that the difference between the lectal variants of the constructions is due to the different prominence of specific low-level schemata and referential situations. The results also suggest that the causative doen may be an obsolescent form. The main methodological novelty of this study is that constructional semantics is modelled in a fully bottom-up fashion, with the individual constructional exemplars as a starting point, and the generalizations (the senses and semantic dimensions), which emerge as a result of a fully automatic procedure. The approach thus integrates objectivity and measurability with intuitive interpretability of the results, which can be seen as one of the main challenges for contemporary corpus-based models of semantics. status: publishe...|$|E
