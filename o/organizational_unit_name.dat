The specific duties and areas of responsibility of state architects vary, but they generally involve responsibility for the design and/or construction of public buildings in the state.

This would commonly be abbreviated as [...] "A/1-15 INF" [...] in writing, but not in speaking. The dash in [...] "1-15" [...] indicates that the 15th Infantry Regiment is a historical designation only, there is no <b>organizational</b> <b>unit</b> with that <b>name.</b> Companies normally do not have their own overhead, but share the overhead of the parent organization. When the regimental headquarters exists as a separate echelon of command (e.g., the 75th Ranger Regiment, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, and the 1st Marine Regiment), as virtually all U.S. Army regiments did until after the Korean War, a slash separates the battalion/squadron number from the regimental number (i.e., B/2/75 Ranger, C/3/11 ACR, E/2/1 Marines).|$|R

40|$|Odgovor na vprašanje, kako izboljšati proces delovanja storitvenega podjetja, smo razdelali v naslednjih korakih. V začetku diplomskega seminarja smo v literaturi poiskali opredelitve poslovnih procesov različnih avtorjev (npr. Harrington-ovo, Davenport-ovo, Burltonovo, Mejabi in Black-ovo) Nato smo opredelili vrste procesov ter razložili ključne in podporne procese. Naslednje poglavje govori o prenovi poslovnih procesov, in sicer kaj je prenova in zakaj sploh prenavljati procese? Ker je projektni {{management}} vključen v prenovo procesov izbranega podjetja, sledi poglavje implementacije projektnega managementa v podjetje. Najprej smo opredelili pojem projektni management, kaj so projektne organizacije, katere vrste projektnih organizacij poznamo, opredelitev projektne pisarne ter vključevanje projektnega managementa v celovito organizacijo. Za povezavo poslovnih procesov in vpeljavo projektnega managementa v organizacijo, smo še opisali projektiranje organizacije ter faze po katerih poteka. Na koncu je predstavljen glavni del diplomskega seminarja, ki je prenova poslovnih procesov v izbrani organizaciji. Najprej smo analizirali sedanje stanje podjetja, njegove procese, organizacijsko shemo, identificirali procese po ISO 9001 : 2008 ter predstavili rešitev. Z uvedbo projektnega managementa v podjetje, smo iz dveh organizacijskih enot v podjetju, planiranje in organiziranje dogodkov, naredili eno, ki smo jo poimenovali projektni management. Uspešnost izvedbe prenove smo preverili s KPI-ji, ki so pokazali, da je s prenovo možno zvišati povprečno učinkovitost podjetja za 13 %. To {{answer the}} question “How to improve working of service enterprise?”, we have used the following schema. At {{the beginning of this}} bachelor thesis we looked up for definitions of business processes, which were done by several renowned authors like Harrington, Davenport, Burlton, Mejabi and Black. Afterwards, we have identified and highlighted a series of processes and explain their key and support components. Later on we tried to describe business process of reengineering, with the sole idea to {{answer the question}} “What is the renovation and why you renovate the processes”. Because {{of the fact that the}} main topic of this thesis is Project Management as a Processes and its involvement in the renovation of the selected company, we continue our research with a short section of project management and implementation techniques in the company. Firstly, we defined the basic concept of Project Management e. g. what are the project organizations, what kind of project organizations we know, the basic definition of the project offices and integration of project management process in the organization as a whole entity. Additionally, we have described the design of the organization and different stages of development. Secondly, we have presented the main part of the research thesis, which is based on the idea of business process reengineering in the selected organization. We started our presentation with the analysis of company`s current situation, its processes, organizational schema, identified the processes according to ISO 9001 : 2008 standards and present plausible solutions. At the end we introduced the basic project management process in the selected company with the optimization of two <b>organizational</b> <b>units</b> <b>named</b> as “Planning” and “Event Planning” to one, called “Project management”. To measure the effectiveness of proposed reforms and its implementation we used KPI indicators. In the conclusion KPI indicators showed that implemented redesign could increase the average efficiency of the company by approximately 13 %...|$|R

How {{does the}} {{rewarding}} of useful employee suggestions encourage creativity and effectiveness? Purpose: On {{the basis of}} group conversations through focus groups, to determine whether rewarding effects the creativity and performance of employees. Method: Quantitative method using focus groups. Results: The results of the research study showed that the <b>organizational</b> <b>unit</b> appropriately rewards useful suggestions and that this {{has an impact on}} employee creativity and efficiency. In addition, the massive inventive activity is a system that effectively influences the success of business. Organization: Massive inventive activity has become a system in which increasingly more employees from different <b>organizational</b> <b>units</b> are becoming a part of. An important role is by managers, who are responsible for creating a positive atmosphere and encourage employees into innovative thinking, performance, and rewarding of useful suggestions.
