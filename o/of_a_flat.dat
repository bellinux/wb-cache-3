5|$|A {{tessellation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> {{surface is}} the tiling {{of a plane}} using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In mathematics, tessellations can be generalized to higher dimensions {{and a variety of}} geometries.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5S was {{the first}} Apple device to ship with iOS 7, which {{introduced}} a revamped visual appearance and other new features. Designed by Jonathan Ive, iOS 7 departed from skeuomorphic elements used by previous versions of iOS in favor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat,</b> colorful design. Among new software features introduced to the iPhone 5S were AirDrop, an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform; Control Center, a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions; and iTunes Radio, an internet radio service. Earphones known as EarPods were included with the 5S, and Apple released accessories including a case and a dock.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Kestin and Persen {{published}} a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions. For the problem <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> {{plate with a}} temperature jump at , they propose a substitution that reduces the parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this equation, the temperature {{at any point in}} the fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function. Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.|$|E
50|$|An 'alternative festival' {{was staged}} in an {{adjoining}} field where the Pink Fairies, Yes, Genesis, and Hawkwind {{played on the}} back <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flatbed</b> truck. This was a precursor to the many free festivals of the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Set {{up in the}} Pecan Grove campground, the {{informal}} stage began in 1987 when camper Russell Brace and friends built {{it on the back}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flatbed</b> truck. The stage is so-named because the festival proper has four main stages.|$|R
40|$|Every link {{is shown}} to be presentable as <b>a</b> {{boundary}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unknotted <b>flat</b> banded surface. <b>A</b> (<b>flat)</b> banded link is defined as <b>a</b> boundary <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unknotted (<b>flat)</b> banded surface. <b>A</b> link's (<b>flat)</b> band index {{is defined as the}} minimum number of bands required to present the link as boundaries <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unknotted (<b>flat)</b> banded surface. Banded links of small (flat, respectively) band index are considered here. Some upper bounds are provided for these band indices <b>of</b> <b>a</b> link using braid representatives and canonical Seifert surfaces of the link. The relation between the band indices and genera of links is studied and the band indices of pretzel knots are calculated. Comment: 17 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
5|$|The sky-cycle airship {{continued}} {{to climb to}} about two thousand feet and then traveled north using the East River as a landmark and went to East Sixtieth Street. The reporter then steered the sky-cycle to One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street. There he crossed the East River again and then hovered over Greenpoint. The reporter flew the sky-cycle until almost dark and landed safely at the property of P. B. Gupther in Yonkers. Gupther helped the reporter deflate the balloon and pack the airship down to the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> carpet bag. He then drove the reporter with his sky-cycle airship to the railroad station {{so he could get}} back to his place of origin.|$|E

50|$|Curtain siders {{are similar}} to box {{trailers}} except the sides are movable curtains made of reinforced fabric coated with a waterproof coating.

50|$|Scanners differ {{significantly}} from digital camera in many areas. First, the optical resolution <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flatbed</b> scanner can exceed 5000 pixels per inch (200 pixels per mm). Even at a relatively low resolution of 1200 pixels per inch (47 p/mm) a letter sized image would be 134 megapixels in size.|$|R

25|$|An {{oyster reef}} can {{increase}} the surface area <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> bottom 50-fold.

One valve is cupped and the other is flat.|$|E

25|$|In a satirical piece {{published}} 1996, Albert A. Bartlett uses arithmetic to {{show that}} sustainable growth on Earth is impossible in a spherical Earth since its resources are necessarily finite. He explains that only a model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> Earth, stretching infinitely in the two horizontal dimensions {{and also in the}} vertical downward direction, would be able to accommodate the needs of a permanently growing population.|$|E

25|$|During a May 15 {{speech in}} Columbus, Ohio, McCain {{laid out his}} vision for January 2013, {{which would be the}} end of his first term granted he won the presidency.

25|$|The Russian Federation is {{considered}} a prime case of the success <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> tax; the real revenues from its Personal Income Tax rose by 25.2% {{in the first year}} after the Federation introduced a flat tax, followed by a 24.6% increase in the second year, and a 15.2% increase in the third year. The Laffer curve predicts such an outcome, attributing the primary reason for the greater revenue to higher levels of economic growth stemming from the introduction of the flat tax.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, The Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that Hewitt claimed £920 {{in legal fees}} when she moved out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> in her constituency, stayed in hotels and then rented another flat in Leicester. Claims for furniture included £194 for blinds delivered to her London home. In June 2009 Hewitt announced {{that she would be}} stepping down from the House of Commons. She said she was leaving the Commons for personal reasons as she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family.|$|E

25|$|All three plays are single-scene plays, {{written to}} use the same set <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> in the London Docklands, {{although}} each play is set in a different flat. The set includes a living area, kitchen and balcony over the river, all of which have different functions in different plays. The plays were performed in the round for their original productions at the Stephen Joseph Theatre. However, in subsequent productions elsewhere they were re-staged for the proscenium.|$|E
25|$|Green's Theorem, {{which gives}} the {{relationship}} between a line integral around a simple closed curve C and a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C, is applied in an instrument known as a planimeter, which is used to calculate the area <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> surface on a drawing. For example, {{it can be used to}} calculate the amount of area taken up by an irregularly shaped flower bed or swimming pool when designing the layout of a piece of property.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{arbitrary}} direct sums {{and direct}} limits of flat modules are flat, {{a consequence of}} the fact that the tensor product commutes with direct sums and direct limits (in fact with all colimits), and that both direct sums and direct limits are exact functors. Submodules and factor modules of flat modules need not be flat in general (e.g. Z/nZ is not a flat Z-module for n>1). However we have the following result: the homomorphic image <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> module M is flat if and only if the kernel is a pure submodule of M.|$|E
