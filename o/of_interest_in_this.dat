2500|$|This is {{one reason}} offered in support of free banking, a gold or silver standard, or at a minimum the {{reduction}} of political control over central banks. The latter could then take as their primary objective ensuring a stable value of currency by controlling monetary expansion and thus limiting inflation. Independence from government is required to reach this aim – indeed, {{it is well known}} in economic literature that governments face a conflict <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> regard. [...] In fact, [...] "hard money" [...] advocates argue that central banks have utterly failed to obtain the objective of a stable currency. [...] Under the gold standard, for example, the price level in both England and the US remained relatively stable over hundreds of years, though with some protracted periods of deflation. [...] Since the US Federal Reserve was formed in 1913, however, the US dollar has fallen to barely a twentieth of its former value through the consistently inflationary policies of the bank. [...] Economists counter that deflation is hard to control once it sets in and its effects are much more damaging than modest, consistent inflation.|$|E
