5|$|It {{is thought}} that this type <b>of</b> <b>atmosphere</b> loss may be common to all planets {{orbiting}} Sun-like stars closer than around 0.1 AU. HD 209458 b will not evaporate entirely, although it may have lost up to about 7% of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5 billion years. It may be possible that the planet's magnetic field may prevent this loss, because the exosphere would become ionized by the star, and the magnetic field would contain the ions from loss.|$|E

40|$|In this contribution, I suggest {{activating}} {{the notion}} <b>of</b> <b>atmospheres</b> as a heuristic device to empirically research affects. I {{will argue that}} analysing the composition <b>of</b> <b>atmospheres</b> allows one {{to take into account}} three key dimensions of affects: their spatio-materiality, their sensuality and their (in) stability. Building on a process understanding <b>of</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> I reflect on how each of the three dimensions can be empirically researched and how they interplay in the emergence <b>of</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> I will illustrate these reflections with examples from a current research project on an artistic intervention into public spaces in Berlin...|$|R

25|$|Within {{the region}} where {{radiative}} effects are important, the description given by the idealized greenhouse model becomes realistic. Earth's surface, warmed to a temperature around 255K, radiates long-wavelength, infrared heat {{in the range of}} 4–100μm. At these wavelengths, greenhouse gases that were largely transparent to incoming solar radiation are more absorbent. Each layer <b>of</b> <b>atmosphere</b> with greenhouses gases absorbs some of the heat being radiated upwards from lower layers. It reradiates in all directions, both upwards and downwards; in equilibrium (by definition) the same amount as it has absorbed. This results in more warmth below. Increasing the concentration of the gases increases the amount of absorption and reradiation, and thereby further warms the layers and ultimately the surface below.|$|E
25|$|The first {{observed}} extrasolar {{planetary atmosphere}} {{was made in}} 2001. Sodium in {{the atmosphere of the}} planet HD 209458 b was detected during a set of four transits of the planet across its star. Later observations with the Hubble Space Telescope showed an enormous ellipsoidal envelope of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen around the planet. This envelope reaches temperatures of 10,000 K. The planet is estimated to be losing (1-5)108 kg of hydrogen per second. This type <b>of</b> <b>atmosphere</b> loss may be common to all planets orbiting Sun-like stars closer than around 0.1 AU. In addition to hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, HD 209458 b is thought to have water vapor in its atmosphere. Sodium and water vapour has also been observed in the atmosphere of HD 189733 b, another hot gas giant planet.|$|E

25|$|The {{parabolic}} arch {{has been associated}} with church architecture since at least the 1880s. German architect Dominikus Bohm (1880-1955) exploited the possibilities of the {{parabolic arch}} in several 1920s church designs, demonstrating that the kind <b>of</b> <b>atmosphere</b> commonly associated with Gothic architecture could be obtained with a minimum of historical allusion. Though it remained an uncommon architectural form in the early 20th century, it featured in several Modernist churches, most notably the Church of St Francis of Assisi (completed 1943) in Pampulha, Brazil, designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012). Constructed from cast in-situ concrete, the nave of the church was a free-standing parabolic vault. Highly controversial at the time, Niemeyer's bold design was extremely influential among architects around the world (including Australia), with photographs and plans of the church published in architectural journals.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{with light}} skin {{pigmentation}} living in low sunlight environments experience increased vitamin D synthesis compared to humans with dark skin pigmentation {{due to the}} ability to absorb more sunlight. Almost every part of the human body, including the skeleton, the immune system, and brain requires vitamin D. Sunlight is necessary for the production of vitamin D. Vitamin D production in the skin begins when UV radiation penetrates the skin and interacts with a cholesterol-like molecule produce pre-vitamin D3. This reaction only occurs in the presence of medium length UVR, UVB. Most of the UVB and UVC rays are destroyed or reflected by ozone, oxygen, and dust in the atmosphere. UVB reaches the Earth’s surface in the highest amounts when its path is straight and goes through a little layer <b>of</b> <b>atmosphere.</b>|$|E

25|$|International catastrophes such as {{the wreck}} of the Amoco Cadiz oil tanker off the coast of Brittany in 1978 and the Bhopal {{disaster}} in 1984 have demonstrated the universality of such events and the scale on which efforts to address them needed to engage. The borderless nature <b>of</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of global warming. Most recently the term persistent organic pollutant (POP) has come to describe a group of chemicals such as PBDEs and PFCs among others. Though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data, they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity {{such as the}} Arctic, demonstrating diffusion and bioaccumulation after only a relatively brief period of widespread use.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Harriot, {{as well as}} Galilei, {{drew the}} first {{telescopic}} representation of the Moon and observed it for several years. His drawings, however, remained unpublished. The first map of the Moon {{was made by the}} Belgian cosmographer and astronomer Michael Florent van Langren in 1645. Two years later a much more influential effort was published by Johannes Hevelius. In 1647 Hevelius published Selenographia, the first treatise entirely devoted to the Moon. Hevelius's nomenclature, although used in Protestant countries until the eighteenth century, was replaced by the system published in 1651 by the Jesuit astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli, who gave the large naked-eye spots the names of seas and the telescopic spots (now called craters) the name of philosophers and astronomers. In 1753 the Croatian Jesuit and astronomer Roger Joseph Boscovich discovered the absence <b>of</b> <b>atmosphere</b> on the Moon. In 1824 Franz von Gruithuisen explained the formation of craters as a result of meteorite strikes.|$|E
25|$|Geologists {{conclude}} that {{no evidence for}} such a flood is observed in the preserved rock layers and moreover that such a flood is physically impossible, given the current layout of land masses. For instance, since Mount Everest currently is approximately 8.8 kilometres in elevation and the Earth's surface area is 510,065,600km2, the volume of water required to cover Mount Everest {{to a depth of}} 15 cubits (6.8 m), as indicated by Genesis 7:20, would be 4.6 billion cubic kilometres. Measurements of the amount of precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere have yielded results indicating that condensing all water vapor in a column <b>of</b> <b>atmosphere</b> would produce liquid water with a depth ranging between zero and approximately 70mm, depending on the date and the location of the column. Nevertheless, there continue to be many adherents to flood geology, and in recent years new theories have been introduced such as catastrophic plate tectonics and catastrophic orogeny.|$|E
