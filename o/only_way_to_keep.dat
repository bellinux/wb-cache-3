Hebbel, however, evokes an [...] "eternal rest" [...] that is distinctly non-religious: the poem offers no metaphysical reference, Christian or otherwise, but calls for remembrance as the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the dead alive.

The first of these sections describes how the dead, nurtured by love, enjoy a final glow of life. In contrast, the latter section portrays a different fate for souls that have been forsaken: who are relegated to an unending, desolate struggle for renewed existence. The musicologist Katherine FitzGibbon notes that the speaker of this narrative is not identified, but may be [...] "a poetic narrator, divine voice, or even the dead".|$|E

Though it would seem attractive to deploy software applications which provide automation to the development of such models, the results of automatic ontology tools in the real practice of knowledge management are definitely disappointing.
