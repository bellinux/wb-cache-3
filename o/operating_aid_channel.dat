40|$|Abstract This paper {{analyses}} whether <b>aid</b> <b>channelled</b> through {{non-governmental organisations}} (NGOs) is less affected by selfish donor motivations and better targeted to needy recipient countries than aid distributed by state agencies. We employ Tobit (and Probit) models and {{make use of}} an exceptionally detailed database that allows {{an assessment of the}} allocation of Swedish <b>aid</b> <b>channelled</b> through NGOs in comparison to the allocation of Swedish official aid. Our analysis provides mixed results. On the one hand, NGOs appear to be altruistic as far as available indicators on political and commercial motivations of aid can tell. On the other hand, needs-based targeting of aid by NGOs turns out to be surprisingly weak. GDP per capita of recipient countries shapes the allocation of official aid, but not that of <b>aid</b> <b>channelled</b> through NGOs. The headcount of absolute poverty has a significantly positive effect on aid allocation, but its impact is not particularly strong when NGOs are involved. Overall, the Swedish case supports the sceptical view that NGOs are not necessarily superior donors compared to state aid agencies. Copyright 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper introduces a new dataset on earmarked aid, which alternatively has been referred to as multi-bi, restricted, non-core or trust fund aid. The data makes it possible to track the rise of the new <b>aid</b> <b>channel</b> over an extended period of time and in greater detail regarding, e. g., the implementing multilateral organizations. The data include more than 100, 000 earmarked projects of 23 OECD donors to 290 multilateral institutions from 1990 to 2012. We graphically illustrate the distribution and patterns of this new <b>aid</b> <b>channel</b> for all actors involved, namely donor governments and their aid-providing agencies, multilateral organizations, and recipient countries, and highlight promising avenues for further research. In a first empirical application of the data, we analyze donors’ heterogeneous use of earmarked aid, and test three lines of argument for the provision of earmarked aid: official donor motives regarding specific recipient needs, public opinion in donor countries, and ‘market-oriented’ donor economies’ use of earmarked aid to ‘bypass’ recipient countries with weak governance. We show that earmarked aid is associated with different donor- and recipient-level factors than traditional or ‘pure’ bilateral aid...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of {{development}} <b>aid</b> <b>channeled</b> through local women groups in Mwingi district, Eastern Kenya. My main objective is to investigate whether the poorest households participate in these local women groups and to estimate the effect of participation on household income. The study uses household survey data collected from Mwingi district in June and July 2009. I used matching method based on kernel density estimation and the two step estimation on Heckman treatment effects model, treatreg. The {{results show that the}} poorest households do not participate in the local women groups and that participation in local women groups lead to a higher household income. I therefore conclude that like other empirical studies have shown, social capital has a positive effect to economic well being of the people. I also conclude that development <b>aid</b> <b>channeled</b> through local women groups do not benefit every household in the district but benefits only those households who have managed to acquire at least physical assets of 10, 000 Kenyan Shillings. In my view this development aid is working to increase inequality in the society by widening the gap between the poorest and the poor. I suggest that the donors implement other policies that could also benefit the poorest households so that every household could partake of the blessings of this development aid...|$|R
