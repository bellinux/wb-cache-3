Data Sources: Review of the published medical literature, World Health Organization and government documents, and expert opinion.

Ebola virus may affect immune regulation and endothelial function differently in children than adults. Considerations for care of children with Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> are presented. Conclusions: Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> is a severe multisystem disease with high mortality in children and adults. Hospitals and clinicians must prepare to provide care for patients with Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> before such patients present for care, with particular attention to rigorous infection control to limit secondary cases.

40|$|Groundnuts are an {{important}} oilseeds crop in many African countries. And groundnut rosette {{is the most important}} <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> of groundnut in Africa. An International Working Group was established in 1983 to formulate cooperative research programs to characterize the causal viruses of groundnut rosette disease and develop methods for their detection. The group met in 1985 in Cambridge, England, and in 1987 in Lilongwe, Malawi. Since the efforts by this Group have resulted in considerable progress on the characterization of causal viruses of groundnut rosette disease and at the meeting held at Lilongwe, it was suggested that the Group activities should be expanded to include research on all groundnut viruses in Africa. In this publication summaries of the papers delivered at the Group's fourth meeting are presented.

We describe knowledge and attitude towards Ebola and Marburg virus outbreaks in two affected communities in Uganda to inform future outbreak responses and help {{in the design of}} health education and communication messages. The study was a community survey done in Luweero, Ibanda and Kamwenge districts that have experienced outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg <b>virus</b> <b>diseases.</b> Quantitative data were collected using a structured questionnaire and triangulated with qualitative participatory epidemiology techniques to gain a communities' knowledge and attitude towards Ebola and Marburg <b>virus</b> <b>disease.</b> Out of 740 respondents, 48. 5 % (359 / 740) were categorized as being knowledgeable about Ebola and Marburg <b>virus</b> <b>diseases,</b> whereas 60. 5 % (448 / 740) were having a positive attitude towards control and prevention of Ebola and Marburg <b>virus</b> <b>diseases.</b> The mean knowledge and attitude percentage scores were 54. 3 (SD = 23. 5, 95 %CI = 52. 6 - 56. 0) and 69. 9 (SD = 16. 9, 95 %CI = 68. 9 - 71. 1) respectively.

Respondents reported fear and stigma suffered by survivors, their families and the broader community due to these diseases. Communities in Uganda affected by filovirus outbreaks have moderate knowledge about these diseases and have a positive attitude towards practices to prevent and control Ebola and Marburg viral diseases.
