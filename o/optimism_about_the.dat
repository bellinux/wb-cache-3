40|$|In recent years, the United States {{news media}} has grown more {{partisan}} {{and thus more}} biased. This has led some people not to trust the United States news media.

However, by embracing a United States news media that is more partisan {{and in a way}} commercial has this led the American public to be exposed to more negative stories <b>about</b> <b>the</b> United States and thus to become more pessimistic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> United States? The United States media’s impact as a source of information has an important affect on how United States citizens view their government and how well they understand the political process. It is important that it be determined that the United States’ news media doesn’t always lead Americans to be pessimistic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> United States, since this can led to a decline in voter turnout, political activism, and other behaviors. By examining how much trust the United States public places in the media, how well they understand politics, the employment status of Americans, the household income of Americans, and how much personal optimism the United States public has, we can better understand what impact the United States media has on <b>optimism</b> or pessimism <b>about</b> <b>the</b> United States.

Applied positive psychology's main focus, therefore, is to increase one's positive experience of life and ability to flourish by promoting such things as <b>optimism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future, a sense of flow in the present, and personal traits like courage, perseverance, and altruism. There is now preliminary empirical evidence to show that by promoting Seligman's three components of happiness—positive emotion (the pleasant life), engagement (the engaged life), and meaning (the meaningful life)—positive therapy can decrease clinical depression.|$|E

The Economist contrasted the [...] "Great Stagnation" [...] thesis with the [...] "Great Divergence" [...] which traces the pay gap to an increasing demand for skilled workers. Timothy Noah, writing in Slate, did not share Cowen's <b>optimism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future of American educational attainment {{on the basis that}} President Obama [...] "is getting tough" [...] on teachers' unions. There have been many reforms implemented in the last thirty years that the unions initially opposed, and the United States has poorer outcomes than many OECD countries with stronger unions. Noah reminds us that the earlier authors were optimistic about increased third level enrollment and that has since fallen as have graduation rates. The United States remains significantly behind other advanced countries in educational outcomes offering a perverse hope for improvement.|$|E
500|$|With the Storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, the French Revolution erupted.

Shortly after the Bastille fell, the main prison key {{was turned over}} to the Marquis de Lafayette, a Frenchman who had served under Washington in the American Revolutionary War. In an expression of <b>optimism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> revolution's chances for success, Lafayette sent the key to Washington, who displayed it prominently in the executive mansion. In the Caribbean, the revolution destabilized the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti), as it split the government into royalist and revolutionary factions, and aroused the people to demand civil rights for themselves. Sensing an opportunity, the slaves of northern St. Domingue organized and planned a massive rebellion which began on August 22, 1791. Their successful revolution resulted in the establishment of the second independent country in the Americas (after the United States). Soon after the revolt began, the Washington administration, at French request, agreed to send money, arms, and provisions to Saint-Domingue to assist distressed slave-owning colonists. Reacting to reports Haitian slaves slaughtering, many Southerners believed that a successful slave revolt in Haiti would lead to a massive race war in America. [...] American aid to Saint-Domingue formed part of the US repayment of Revolutionary War loans, and eventually amounted to about $400,000 and 1,000 military weapons.|$|E

500|$|At {{a meeting}} with Mackay on Christmas Eve, 1940, O'Connor visited Mackay at 6th Division {{headquarters}} and directed him to prepare an attack on Bardia. O'Connor recommended that this be built around the 23 Matilda tanks of Lieutenant Colonel R. M. Jerrram's 7th Royal Tank Regiment that remained in working order. The attack was to be made with only two brigades, leaving the third for a subsequent advance on Tobruk. Mackay did not share O'Connor's <b>optimism</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> prospect of an easy victory and proceeded {{on the assumption that}} Bardia would be resolutely held, requiring a well-planned attack similar to that required to breach the Hindenburg Line in 1918. The plan developed by Mackay and his chief of staff, Colonel Frank Berryman, involved an attack on the western side of the Bardia defences by Brigadier Arthur [...] "Tubby" [...] Allen's 16th Infantry Brigade at the junction of the Gerfah and Ponticelli sectors. Attacking at the junction of two sectors would confuse the defence. The defences here were weaker than in the Mereiga sector, the ground was favourable for employment of the Matilda tanks, and good observation for the artillery was possible. There was also the prospect that an attack here could split the fortress in two. Brigadier Stanley Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade would then exploit the breach in the fortress defences in the second phase. Most of the artillery, grouped as the [...] "Frew Group" [...] under British Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Frowen, would support the 16th Infantry Brigade; the 17th would be supported by the 2/2nd Field Regiment. In the event, the artillery density—96 guns for an attack on an [...] front—was comparable to the Battle of St. Quentin Canal in September 1918, when 360 guns supported an attack on a [...] front. Mackay insisted that the attack required 125 rounds per gun. It had to be postponed to 3 January in order for this ammunition to be brought forward.|$|E

Kim Newman of Empire scored the film three out of five stars, saying: [...] "A few too-broad gags aside — and even these are in the funky spirit of '60s Marvel — this is a satisfying second issue with thrills, heartbreak, gasps, and a perfectly judged slingshot ending."

The plot gets itself tangled up in multiple villain strands, but in the main, this installment is emotionally weightier and more satisfying than its predecessor." [...] Guy Lodge of Variety said, [...] "Redundancy remains a problem, but this overlong superhero sequel gets by on sound, fury and star chemistry."

Am I the only one who hates the word Amazing to describe a movie that isn't? Just asking." [...] IGN reviewer Daniel Krupa gave 6.9/10 and wrote, [...] "Amazing Spider-Man 2 gets a lot right, yet there’s a constant awkwardness to the machinery of its plot; you can almost hear the cogs turning. However, what’s worse is that at times it becomes overtly patronising: there are flashing screens and computer voice-overs constantly telling you what something is or what something is doing, just in case the people in the back rows aren’t paying attention, which feels at odds with the film’s emotional intelligence.|$|E
