5|$|The {{resulting}} Chicago school produced large, solid-looking skyscrapers, {{built with}} a common appearance and to a common height. The result was usually a box-like palazzo, illuminated with a large light court, ideally, if space allowed, in the center. The outside of the building was commonly divided into three parts: a base, middle section and the roof line. This tripartite design was intended both to emulate classical columns, and reflect {{the functions of the}} different parts of the skyscraper. The central court could form a simple courtyard, but many companies preferred to roof over the courtyard with glass to produce an atrium for shops and restaurants. Rents for these shops were up to five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> that for office space, and made an important difference to the income from a property. Chicago skyscraper windows were also a feature of the style; these were large, fixed windows flanked by smaller sash windows on either side, which provided access to sunlight and adequate ventilation. Sometimes these protruded from the building to form a slight bay.|$|E

During rehearsals for his scene, McGee {{purposely}} kept his voice down to prevent a severe headache. He recalled, [...] "I remember the director , {{he wanted me to}} scream during rehearsal, and I was, like, 'Look, you don’t understand: If I do this, I’m gonna have a headache in 30 fucking seconds.'" [...] The scenes were rehearsed about five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> before the actual scene was filmed.|$|E

500|$|At age 11, Colt was indentured to {{a farmer}} in Glastonbury, {{where he did}} chores and {{attended}} school. Here he {{was introduced to the}} Compendium of Knowledge, a scientific encyclopedia that he preferred to read rather than his Bible studies. Its articles on Robert Fulton and gunpowder motivated Colt throughout his life. He discovered that other inventors in the Compendium had accomplished things that were once deemed impossible, and he wanted to do the same. Later, after hearing soldiers talk about the success of the double-barreled rifle and the impossibility of a gun that could shoot five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> without reloading, Colt decided that he would create the [...] "impossible gun".|$|E
500|$|In March {{he wrote}} to several people {{regarding}} the new [...] "air" [...] that he had discovered in August. One of these letters was read aloud to the Royal Society, and a paper outlining the discovery, titled [...] "An Account of further Discoveries in Air", {{was published in the}} Society's journal Philosophical Transactions. Priestley called the new substance [...] "dephlogisticated air", which he made in the famous experiment by focusing the sun’s rays on a sample of mercuric oxide. He first tested it on mice, who surprised him by surviving quite a while entrapped with the air, and then on himself, writing that it was [...] "five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> better than common air for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and, I believe, every other use of common atmospherical air". He had discovered oxygen gas (O2).|$|E
500|$|... "You Must Love Me" [...] {{starts with}} the sound of {{orchestra}} and piano, as Madonna sings the opening verses. She continues singing the lyrics, which talk about Perón's discovery that her husband Juan had actually loved her all along and not merely seen her as a political prop. Madonna disliked the lyrics since she wanted to portray Perón as a sympathetic figure, rather than the [...] "shrewd manipulator" [...] that Parker had in mind. She was also concerned about her own image, and was successful in getting many portions of the script altered. However, Rice declined to change the song's lyrics, but rewrote its instrumentation five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>times.</b> He recalled, [...] "I remember taking the lyrics to Madonna and she was trying to change them... The scene can be interpreted in different ways, but my lyrics were kept, thank God!" ...|$|E

[...] We would have played maybe twenty songs and Van would go back and cut out the songs he didn't want. The only time we'd go back would be to overdub backing vocals or horns." [...] Ted Templeman remarked {{that he had to}} go through three engineers during the recording of the album, due to Morrison's [...] "ability as a musician, arranger and producer": [...] "When he's got something together, he wants to put it down right away with no overdubbing ...

500|$|In 1934, the twenty-two {{separate}} parks merged {{under the}} Park Consolidation Act, {{in order to}} gain New Deal federal funding. [...] Mayor Edward Kelley named Chicago Federation of Musicians President Petrillo to the board of the Chicago Park District. Petrillo suggested a free symphonic concert series in Grant Park. [...] Under the agreement, Petrillo would raise money for the first season and if it was well-attended, the Park District would continue the program. [...] The first season of the Grant Park Music Festival began on July 1, 1935 and ran until Labor Day with a total of sixty-five concerts. [...] The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Women's Symphony Orchestra and the Civic Opera Orchestra each performed five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>times.</b> [...] Large concert bands led by Bohumir Kryl, Armin Hand, Max Bendix, George Dasch, Glenn Bainum, and Victor Grabel also performed. By {{the end of the summer}} crowds of up to 35,000 were attending nightly free concerts. [...] The summer's total attendance was estimated at 1.9 million. [...] This was viewed as a sufficient success that the Park District committed to assuming financial responsibility for the entire ongoing annual outdoor concert series. [...] The concerts for the first season were also broadcast on nationwide radio broadcasts.|$|E
500|$|Morgan {{and his men}} {{remained}} in Porto Bello for a month. He wrote to Don Agustín, the acting president of Panama, to demand a ransom {{for the city of}} 350,000 pesos. As they stripped the city of its wealth it is probable that torture was used on the residents to uncover hidden caches of money and jewels. Zahedieh records that there were no first-hand reports from witnesses that confirmed Exquemelin's claim of widespread rape and debauchery. After an attempt by Don Agustín to recapture the city by force – his army of 800 soldiers was repelled by the privateers – he negotiated a ransom of 100,000 pesos. Following the ransom and the plunder of the city, Morgan returned to Port Royal, with between £70,000 and £100,000 of money and valuables; Zahedieh reports that the figures were more than the agricultural output of Jamaica, and nearly half Barbados's sugar exports. Each privateer received £120 – equivalent to five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> the average annual earnings of a sailor of the time. Morgan received a five per cent share for his work; Modyford received a ten per cent share, which was the price of Morgan's letter of marque. As Morgan had overstepped the limits of his commission, Modyford reported back to London that he had [...] "reproved" [...] him for his actions although, Zahedieh observes, in Britain [...] "Morgan was widely viewed as a national hero and neither he nor Modyford were rebuked for their actions".|$|E

500|$|Born in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, Bridges {{began his}} career with local side Cambridge United, whom he joined {{at the age of}} 8, he progressed through the club's youth system before signing his first {{professional}} contract in February 2002. He broke into the first-team {{towards the end of the}} 2001–02 season, making his debut as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Huddersfield Town at the Abbey Stadium. He played six further games in the same season, scoring his first goal for Cambridge in a 2–1 home win against Tranmere Rovers. Bridges featured regularly in the opening half of the 2002–03 season, playing a total of 25 times and scoring once in a 3–0 victory against York City. However, a [...] "persistent" [...] ankle injury cut his run in the first-team short, and he did not feature from February onwards. He returned to first-team action in a 1–0 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers in October 2003, and played a further 22 times for the club throughout the 2003–04 campaign. However, Bridges left Cambridge at the end of the season after failing to agree a contract extension. On leaving Cambridge, Bridges said [...] "I was offered a contract that was almost a kick in the teeth after the time I had been at the club when players were coming in from all over the place who did not care about the club. They were getting paid five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> what I was offered, and I thought it was probably time to move on". During his three seasons with the club, Bridges made a total of 55 appearances in all competitions,scoring four times.|$|E
500|$|The royalist radio {{tried to}} widen the split in republican ranks by {{promising}} amnesty to all non-royalists once the Egyptians were withdrawn. Al-Badr also promised {{a new form of}} government: [...] "a constitutionally democratic system" [...] ruled by a [...] "national assembly elected by the people of Yemen". At Sallal's request, Nasser provided him with ammunition and troop reinforcements by transport plane from Cairo. By August, the royalists had seven [...] "armies", each varying in strength between 3,000 and 10,000 men, with a total somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000. There were also five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> as many armed royal tribesmen, and the regular force under Prince Mohamed. In early June they moved into Sirwah in eastern Yemen. On June 14 they entered Qaflan and on July 16 they occupied Marib. According to official Egyptian army figures, they had 15,194 killed. The war was costing Egypt $500,000 a day. The royalists had lost an estimated 40,000 dead. In late August, Nasser decided to get the Soviets more involved in the conflict. He convinced them to cancel a $500 million debt he had incurred and provide military aid to the republicans. In early May, Sallal fired his Premier, General Hassan Amri, and appointed Ahmed Noman in his place. Noman was considered a moderate who believed in compromise. He had resigned as president of the republican Consultative Council in December in protest against Sallal's [...] "failure to fulfill the people's aspirations". Noman's first act was to name a new 15-man Cabinet, maintaining an even balance between Yemen's two main tribal groupings, the mountain Zaidi Shias, who were mostly royalist, and the Shafi'i Sunnis, who were mostly republican.|$|E
