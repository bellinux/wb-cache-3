5|$|A {{point of}} {{contention}} among scholars is {{the role played by}} Armenian clerics in that process. According to a number of scholars and medieval Armenian sources, Mesrop Mashtots, generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet, also created the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets. This tradition <b>originates</b> <b>in</b> the works of Koryun, a fifth century historian and biographer of Mashtots, and has been quoted by Donald Rayfield and James R. Russell, but has been criticized by scholars, both Georgian and Western, who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation. Other scholars quote Koryun's claims without taking a stance on its validity. Many agree, however, that Armenian clerics, if not Mashtots himself, must {{have played a role in}} the creation of the Georgian script.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{influenced}} by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, {{since the late}} 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on {{a draft of the}} German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications. Statutory law <b>originates</b> <b>in</b> Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Comparing the {{epidemiology}} of fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical and apical regions {{may help}} to understand the causes and risk of a vertical root fracture. We aimed to determine the frequency of vertical root fractures in different fracture sites and how the fracture site relates to fracture direction and post length. Methods: Teeth diagnosed with a vertical root fracture were retrospectively surveyed for age and sex of the patient, type of tooth, a fracture region in the longitudinal axial direction, site of the fracture, and presence of a post The fracture region in the longitudinal axial direction was classified as an incomplete fracture, complete fracture, and uncertain. Incomplete fractures were further classified into a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical region, a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the midregion, and a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the apical region. Posts were evaluated by loss of post and length of post. Results: Fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical and apical region occurred around the same frequency, whereas fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the midregion were extremely scarce. Of the fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical region, 36. 2 % were in a mesial and/or distal site and 57. 4 % in a buccal and/or lingual site. Of the fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the apical region, 90. 8 % were in the buccal and/ or lingual site. The {{number of cases of}} fractures <b>Originating</b> <b>in</b> the apical region decreased with increased post length. Conclusions: Sites of fracture and post length differed greatly between fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical region and the apical region, suggesting that risk factors for fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the cervical and apical regions are different...|$|R

5|$|The Gulf Stream, {{together}} with its northern extension the North Atlantic Drift, is {{a warm and}} swift Atlantic ocean current that <b>originates</b> <b>in</b> the Gulf of Mexico and stretches {{to the tip of}} Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of western intensification causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off the east coast of North America. At about , it splits in two, with the northern stream, the North Atlantic Drift, crossing to Northern Europe and the southern stream, the Canary Current, recirculating off West Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{current flowing}} from the {{ionosphere}} to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk <b>originates</b> <b>in</b> a very limited latitudinal range of about ° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main auroral ovals. (See below.) The return current {{flowing from the}} outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million amperes.|$|E

40|$|Coliphage T 4 {{was used}} as a model system to study the {{mechanism}} of biological inactivation produced by tritium decay. Experimentally, tritiated precursors were incorporated into phage DNA (thymidine- 3 H) or into phage protein (3 H-amino acids). The ratio of killing efficiencies for decays <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> phage DNA to those <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> phage protein was 2. 6. Inactivation by decays from labeled amino acids was assumed to occur exclusively from β-particle irradiation of phage DNA. If decays <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> DNA are due solely to irradiation of DNA, then the killing efficiencies reflect the energy transfer paths in phage DNA for decays <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> phage DNA and in the protein coat. The energy transfer paths were determined for the two cases {{with the help of a}} computer and found to be very nearly equal to the experimentally determined ratio (2. 6).

5|$|The {{direction}} of Oregon stream flow {{is influenced by}} four major drainage divides: the Oregon Coast Range on the west, the Cascade Range further inland, the Klamath–Siskiyou Mountains in the southwest, and the Blue Mountains in the northeast. One set of streams, including the Nehalem River, flows directly into the Pacific Ocean or into larger streams flowing directly to the Pacific; other streams, such as the Deschutes River, flow into the Columbia River or its tributaries. A third set, including the Klamath River and its tributaries, <b>originates</b> <b>in</b> Oregon, but its waters eventually flow into northern California before reaching the ocean. Other streams like the Donner und Blitzen River flow into closed basins, such as Malheur Lake, that have no outlet to the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{dust in the}} gossamer rings <b>originates</b> <b>in</b> {{essentially}} {{the same way as}} that in the main ring and halo. Its sources are the inner Jovian moons Amalthea and Thebe respectively. High velocity impacts by projectiles coming from outside the Jovian system eject dust particles from their surfaces. These particles initially retain the same orbits as their moons but then gradually spiral inward by Poynting–Robertson drag. The thickness of the gossamer rings is determined by vertical excursions of the moons due to their nonzero orbital inclinations. This hypothesis naturally explains almost all observable properties of the rings: rectangular cross-section, decrease of thickness in the direction of Jupiter and brightening of the top and bottom edges of the rings.|$|E
