A number of epidemiological surveys, case-series reports, large sized cross sectional surveys, case-control studies, cohort and intervention studies have provided an over whelming evidence that Areca nut+tobacco are the main etiological factor for PMOFC. Experimental evidence to establish the above proof of concept still lies on analytical challenges and limitations. The objective {{of the present study was}} to implement an in vivo model that has shown characteristic features of collagen for PMOFC in relation to fibrosis promoting activity of areca nut+tobacco combination in Lagomorphs (eg. Oryctologous sp.). The method used for study includes Areca nut+tobacco (experimental extract), <b>o-phenyl</b> <b>phenol</b> (positive control) and normal saline (negative control) were administered in the lower jaw of Lagomorphs (three groups) with 6 days of interval for nine months. Protein modification and DNA damage caused by Areca nut+tobacco in oral tissue and blood were analyzed by MALDI-TOF and comet assay respectively. It was found that the oral epithelium, treated with Areca nut+tobacco has show...|$|E
