40|$|Seventeen {{patients}} {{thought to}} have lethal <b>osteochondrodysplasias</b> were evaluated. Diagnosis was established through clinical evaluation, radiological studies and necropsy. Genetic counseling was provided to the affected patient's families. Specific diagnosis was confirmed in 16 cases. Nosologic diagnosis was done through clinical evaluation. However, the most efficient method for verifying the diagnosis was a skeletal radiological study. This fact corroborates {{the orientation of the}} International Classification of <b>Osteochondrodysplasias</b> (International Working Group on Constitutional Disease of Bone, 1992) in which a radiological criterion was adopted as the most relevant for classification of <b>osteochondrodysplasias.</b> An anatomopathological study was also done to detect internal anomalies, and was effective in identifying abnormalities in epiphyseal growth plate in a bone fragment study. This method had low specificity, but in two cases it was especially decisive for diagnostic differentiation.

40|$|To {{begin to}} define the gene {{expression}} pattern in fetal cartilage and to identify uncharacterized candidate genes for the <b>osteochondrodysplasias,</b> we analyzed clones from a fetal cartilage cDNA library. Sequence analysis of 420 cDNA clones identified 210 clones derived from established genes but, for many of them, expression in cartilage had not been previously reported. Among the established genes were 14 genes known to produce skeletal abnormalities in either humans or mice when mutated. Thirty-two uncharacterized genes and their respective chromosomal positions were also identified. To further understand the expression profile of these genes in fetal cartilage, we constructed a cDNA microarray utilizing the clones. The microarray {{was used to determine}} which genes had higher expression in cartilage as compared with dedifferentiated, cultured chondrocytes. Many of the established genes, as well as five of the uncharacterized genes, had increased expression in cartilage, suggesting an important role for these genes in the differentiated state of chondrocytes. These data provide new candidate genes for the <b>osteochondrodysplasias</b> and demonstrate the usefulness of cartilage cDNA microarrays in expanding our understanding of the complexity of fetal cartilage gene expression...|$|R

40|$|Cartilage plays {{a central}} role in the {{patterning}} and growth of the skeletal elements, and mutations in genes expressed in cartilage are responsible for at least 250 distinct clinical conditions, the <b>osteochondrodysplasias.</b> While recent progress has been made in characterizing the genes that define cartilage biology, there are only limited data describing the gene expression profile of human cartilage. Here we describe the sequences and identities of 6266 clones from an 18 – 20 -week human fetal cartilage cDNA library. Among the sequences, BLAST analysis identified 2404 individual transcripts. Of these, 1775 were defined as derived from characterized genes and the remaining 629 were classified as representing the products of uncharacterized genes. Analysis of the relative representation of each individual transcript showed that the 186 most abundant cDNAs in the library accounted for almost half (47. 7 %) of the clones. The most highly expressed gene was COL 2 A 1, accounting for 4. 15 % of all cDNA clones. The cDNAs identified included clones derived from 27 genes which, when mutated, result in disorders of skeletal patterning, development and growth. There were cDNAs representing 22 genes encoding collagen subunits. The genes encoding the identified cDNAs represent candidates for the approximately 100 <b>osteochondrodysplasias</b> for which the causative gene has not yet been identified. Moreover, these data provide an extensive profile of human fetal cartilage gene expression at this developmental stage...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{epiphyseal}} dysplasia (MED) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common <b>osteochondrodysplasias</b> [Wynne-Davies and Gormley 1985]. During childhood and adolescence it affects the epiphyses of the tubular bones, resulting in axial deformities and shorter limbs. ·Later in life MED can lead to osteoarthritis. The disease has been given its name by Sir Thomas Fairbank in 1947 [Fairbank 1947]. The diagnosis is based on physical examination and radiological survey. Radiographic abnonnalities appear after the third year of life. The most important finding is the delay and irregularity of ossification of the involved epiphyses. The epiphyses of all long bones can be affected. Radiographic anthropometric studies have been performed, being of value in early diagnosis of lvfED in case of doubt [Poznanski et al. 1972, lngram 1992]. The disease is inherited and affects both sexes. The type of inheritance is autosomal dominant. Histology of cartilage of patients with MED reveals paucity of chondrocytes in all zones of the growth plate as well as loss of orientation of the chondrocytes [Anderson et a 1. 1962]. These changes, however, are similar to those seen in other <b>osteochondrodysplasias.</b> Electron microscopical studies have shown dilations of rough endoplasmic reticulum containing a material with alternately wide electron dense and electron lucent layers [Stanescu et al. 1993]. Treatment is symptomatic. Tn case of limited range of motion physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be prescribed; in case of axial deformities osteotomies can be performed (Chapler 1...|$|R
30|$|Patients with {{congenital}} shortenings are {{at higher}} risk of deficient bone formation, reflected in {{a higher risk of}} fracture after fixator removal. The fracture risk was higher in these patients when lengthening was > 15 % of initial segment length (except for patients with achondroplasia), and when the latency period was less than 7  days [25]. Bone fragility is present in more than 100 different genetic disorders including skeletal dysplasias [26]. Among these, achondroplasia patients are by far the most common candidates for limb lengthening procedures, and they are known to tolerate these procedures relatively well. Another, much more difficult patient group is neurofibromatosis (and congenital pseudarthrosis not related to this disorder). Other <b>osteochondrodysplasias</b> are relatively rare candidates for limb lengthening procedures, and clinical experience accordingly limited.|$|R

In light of the recent advances in molecular genetics, however, many phenotypically similar skeletal diseases comprising the classical categories turned out not to be based on defects in common genes or physiological pathways.

40|$|Acromesomelic dysplasias are {{autosomal}} recessive <b>osteochondrodysplasias.</b> Acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux-type (AMDM), {{also known as}} St Helena dysplasia, is of two types: The classical and the mild variety. About 50 cases of AMDM have been reported till date, most of them being the classical variety. There is scarcity of literature on anesthesia for such patients. We are reporting a case of general anesthetic management of AMDM, associated with hydrocephalus, Arnold Chiari malformation type- 1 and syringomyelia. The patient was a 10 -year-old short-statured boy who presented with symptomatic thoracic kyphoscoliosis, gibbus deformity and back pain. On examination, there was no neurological deficit. Radiology revealed thoracic kyphoscoliosis, mild ventriculomegaly and upper cervical syringomyelia. The patient underwent posterior fossa decompression in the prone position under general anesthesia.

40|$|Identifying {{mutations}} {{that cause}} specific <b>osteochondrodysplasias</b> will provide novel {{insights into the}} function of genes that are essential for skeletal morphogenesis.

We also show that an autosomal recessive disorder with similar, but more severe, characteristics is linked to the COL 11 A 2 locus and is caused by a glycine to arginine substitution in alpha 2 (XI) collagen. The results suggest that mutations in collagen XI genes are associated with a spectrum of abnormalities in human skeletal development and support the conclusion of others, based on studies of murine chondrodysplasia, that collagen XI is essential for skeletal morphogenesis...|$|R
