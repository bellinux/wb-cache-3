As proposed by Luca Turin, the <b>odorant</b> <b>molecule</b> must first fit in the receptor's binding site. Then it must have a vibrational energy mode compatible with the difference in energies between two energy levels on the receptor, so electrons can travel through the molecule via inelastic electron tunneling, triggering the signal transduction pathway.

50|$|Olfaction {{begins with}} an {{interaction}} between an <b>odorant</b> <b>molecule</b> and an olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) located within the epithelium of the Glomerulus bulb. Odorants bind to receptor proteins that are held within individual OSNs. It {{is important to note}} that not all fish have the same types or number of receptor proteins making olfactory toxicity and the subsequent effects species specific. There are three types of OSN cells: (1) ciliated cells, microvillus cells, and crypt cells. These cells are distributed across the olfactory epithelium (OE), OSNs that express common binding receptor proteins are connected to the olfactory bulb (OB) by axons.|$|E
50|$|Specifically {{the process}} is as follows: first the odorant wafts towards an insects antenna or maxillary palp which is covered with hair like {{projections}} called sensilla. The odorant then enters through tiny pours in the exoskeleton (or cuticle) of that sensillum and diffuses into the fluid between the cells called extracellular fluids. There the <b>odorant</b> <b>molecule</b> binds to an odorant binding protein which transports it to a receptor and co-receptor (Orco) team {{on the surface of}} the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN). This leads to the neuron firing an action potential down the axon. This signal is sent to the antennal lobe of the insects brain where it can then integrate the information with other signals from other sensilla.|$|E

5000|$|It {{should be}} noted, however, that {{deuteration}} changes the heats of adsorption and the boiling and freezing points of molecules (boiling points: 100.0 °C for H2O vs. 101.42 °C for D2O; melting points: 0.0 °C for H2O, 3.82 °C for D2O), pKa (i.e., dissociation constant: 9.71×10−15 for H2O vs. 1.95×10−15 for D2O, cf. Heavy water) {{and the strength}} of hydrogen bonding. Such isotope effects are exceedingly common, and so {{it is well known that}} deuterium substitution will indeed change the binding constants of molecules to protein receptors. [...] Any binding interaction of an <b>odorant</b> <b>molecule</b> with an olfactory receptor will therefore be likely to show some isotope effect upon deuteration, and the observation of an isotope effect in no way argues exclusively for a vibrational theory of olfaction.|$|E
5000|$|Rather than binding {{specific}} ligands, olfactory receptors display {{affinity for}} a range of odor molecules, and conversely a single <b>odorant</b> <b>molecule</b> may bind to a number of olfactory receptors with varying affinities, which depend on physio-chemical properties of molecules like their molecular volumes. [...] Once the odorant has bound to the odor receptor, the receptor undergoes structural changes and it binds and activates the olfactory-type G protein {{on the inside of the}} olfactory receptor neuron. The G protein (Golf and/or Gs) in turn activates the lyase - adenylate cyclase - which converts ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). The cAMP opens cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels which allow calcium and sodium ions to enter into the cell, depolarizing the olfactory receptor neuron and beginning an action potential which carries the information to the brain.|$|E

This study aimed to identify the molecular properties (molecular descriptors) that govern this phenomenon assuming that modifying the structure leads automatically to a change in the retention/release property of <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules.</b> ACD/ChemSketch, MarvinSketch, and ChemOffice programs were used to calculate several molecular descriptors of 51 <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> (15 alcohols, 11 aldehydes, 9 ketones and 16 esters). A total of 37 molecules (2 / 3 of the data set) were placed in the training set to build the QSPR models, whereas the remaining, 14 molecules (1 / 3 of the data set) constitute the test set. The best descriptors were selected to establish the quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) of the retention/release property of <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> in water using multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple non-linear regression (MNLR) and an artificial neural network (ANN) methods.

40|$|Odorant {{sampling}} {{behaviors such}} as sniffing bring <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> into contact with olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to initiate the sensory mechanisms of olfaction. In rodents, inspiratory airflow through the nose is structured and laminar; consequently, the spatial distribution of adsorbed <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> during inspiration is predictable. Physicochemical properties such as water solubility and volatility, collectively called sorptiveness, interact with behaviorally regulable variables such as inspiratory flow rate to determine the pattern of odorant deposition along the inspiratory path. Populations of ORNs expressing the same odorant receptor are distributed in strictly delimited regions along this inspiratory path, enabling different deposition patterns of the same odorant to evoke different patterns of neuronal activation across the olfactory epithelium and in the olfactory bulb.

40|$|We are {{surrounded}} by smells. Pleasant ones and not so pleasant ones, hard to distinguish ones, mild ones and strong ones. Smells {{are not part of}} our everyday life for the simple sake of pleasure. They are there for a purpose. The perfume of a flower can be used as an attractant for a potential pollinator, for instance. The scent given off by a poisonous mushroom is a way of warding off a predator and, by the same token, can be instantly recognised as toxic by an animal, thereby saving both species. Special scents are also given off by males and females when mating is in the air, and no wine grower will ever argue that a wine’s fragrance is not {{for the sole purpose of}} seduction. But what is a smell? More often than not, a scent is made up of a mixture of odorant molecules which, together, will trigger off a complex olfactory system that will ultimately let us perceive it and, if we wish to, put words to it. The very first step in such a system involves an odorant receptor to which an <b>odorant</b> <b>molecule</b> binds. Recently, a new human odorant receptor – OR 7 D 4 – was discovered.

Using an information-theoretic model, we show that a receptor array is optimal for this task if it achieves two possibly conflicting goals: (i) each receptor should respond to half of all odors and (ii) the response of different receptors should be uncorrelated when averaged over odors presented with natural statistics. We use these design principles to predict statistics of the affinities between receptors and <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> for a broad class of odor statistics. We also show that optimal receptor arrays can be tuned to either resolve concentrations well or distinguish mixtures reliably.

40|$|A large set of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs), {{such as the}} {{cytochrome}} P 450 monooxygenases (CYPs), esterases and transferases, {{are highly}} expressed in mammalian olfactory mucosa (OM). These enzymes are known to catalyze the biotransformation of exogenous compounds to facilitate elimination. However, the functions of these enzymes in the olfactory epithelium are not clearly understood. In addition to protecting against inhaled toxic compounds, these enzymes could also metabolize <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules,</b> and thus modify their stimulating properties or inactivate them. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro biotransformation of <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> in the rat OM and assessed {{the impact of this}} metabolism on peripheral olfactory responses. Rat OM was found to efficiently metabolize quinoline, coumarin and isoamyl acetate. Quinoline and coumarin are metabolized by CYPs whereas isoamyl acetate is hydrolyzed by carboxylesterases. Electro-olfactogram (EOG) recordings revealed that the hydroxylated metabolites derived from these odorants elicited lower olfactory response amplitudes than the parent molecules. We also observed that glucurono-conjugated derivatives induced no olfactory signal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the local application of a CYP inhibitor on rat olfactory epithelium increased EOG responses elicited by quinoline and coumarin. Similarly, the application of a carboxylesterase inhibitor increased the EOG response elicited by isoamyl acetate. This increase in EOG amplitude provoked by XME inhibitors is likely due to enhanced olfactory sensory neuron activation in response to odorant accumulation. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that biotransformation of <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> by enzymes localized to the olfactory mucosa may change the odorant's stimulating properties and may facilitate the clearance of odorants to avoid receptor saturation...|$|R

40|$|A common {{explanation}} of molecular recognition by the olfactory system posits that receptors recognize the structure or {{shape of the}} <b>odorant</b> <b>molecule.</b> We performed a rigorous test of shape recognition by replacing hydrogen with deuterium in odorants and asking whether Drosophila melanogaster can distinguish these identically shaped isotopes. We report that flies not only differentiate between isotopic odorants, but can be conditioned to selectively avoid the common or the deuterated isotope. Furthermore, flies trained to discriminate against the normal or deuterated isotopes of a compound, selectively avoid the corresponding isotope of a different odorant. Finally, flies trained to avoid a deuterated compound exhibit selective aversion to an unrelated molecule with a vibrational mode in the energy range of the carbon–deuterium stretch.

Maintaining an adequate level of acceptability of these reformulated products for consumers requires {{a better understanding}} of the mechanisms that control the retention/release balance of <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> in food matrices. [1]. Although pectins are commonly employed as thickeners [2], their effect on the retention of <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> in nonhomogeneous products [3, 4] has been examined more frequently than their effect on the retention of <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> in simple model gels [5]. The purpose of this study was to explore and compare the effects of pectin in different simple model gels. The release of 51 <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> was analysed using a headspace analysis at equilibrium in pure water, in pectin gels and in fat-free dairy gels with and without the addition of pectin. The set of <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> was composed of four chemical families (alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and esters), and the molecules were selected from the structure of their carbon chain (linear or branched, with or without double bonds). The results of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the Family factor is more significant than the Matrix factor and the Structure factor, either independently (R²= 0. 595, F= 497. 87, p< 0. 0001) or associated with the Matrix factor (R²= 0. 610, F= 82. 24, p< 0. 0001). The Molecule factor provided the best models either independently (R²= 0. 890, F= 151. 34, p< 0. 0001) or associated with the Matrix factor (R²= 0. 983, F= 181. 23, p< 0. 0001). The results of pairwise comparisons led to identify at least two main retention/release behaviour profiles. The first one concerns 6 unsaturated branched primary alcohols and 1 aldehyde; it is characterised by a stronger retention in aqueous media than in dairy gels, and also by significant differences of retention due to the addition of pectin. At the opposite, the second behaviour subset brought together 11 molecules representing all chemical family, which are retained in dairy gels to a greater extent than in aqueous media. Focusing on unsaturated and branched alcohols, we observed that the matrix composition strongly affects the retention of nerol (primary alcohol), but not that of its isomer linalool (tertiary alcohol). These results underline the need to consider an ensemble of detailed molecular features to better understand the intricacy of the physico-chemical interactions between aromas and matrices.

40|$|In mammals, <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> {{are thought}} to {{activate}} only a few glomeruli, leading to the hypothesis that odor representation in the olfactory bulb is sparse. However, the studies supporting this model used anesthetized animals or monomolecular odorants at limited concentration ranges. Using optical imaging and two-photon microscopy, we found that natural odorants at their native concentrations could elicit dense representations in the olfactory bulb. Both anesthesia and odorant concentration were found to modulate the representation density of natural odorants...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} a dose-dependent {{detection}} of <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> in solution by rat olfactory receptor 17 (OR 17) in its membrane fraction. The OR 17 is immobilized on a gold electrode by multilayer bioengineering {{based on a}} mixed self-assembled monolayer and biotin/avidin system, which allows for a well-controlled immobilization of the bioreceptor within its lipid environment. The odorant detection is electronically performed in a quantitative manner by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements on samples and controls...|$|R
40|$|Male mouse urine {{delivers}} {{a wide range}} of molecules which may be involved in intraspecific chemical communication. These include the Major Urinary Proteins (MUP) which bind volatile <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> and slowly release them from urine marks. The aim of this work is to evaluate the role of volatile molecules in eliciting exploratory behavior, in comparison to MUP. Female mice were exposed to male mouse urine, either diluted or not, or to MUP stripped of ligands. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of the stimuli were performed to verify the presence and identify the <b>odorant</b> <b>molecules</b> in urine and to assess the absence of MUP ligands. The exploratory behavior of adult female mice was analyzed in a cage, in the presence of two stimuli on opposite sides, but preventing direct contact with them. Four stimuli were presented in pairs: adult male mouse urine, MUP stripped of ligands, urine diluted 100 times and water as control. The results show that adult female mice explore urine, as little as 150 nl, but do not explore MUP stripped of ligands. These data show that male urine airborne molecules, effective at very low doses, mediate initial stimulus exploration by female mice...|$|R
