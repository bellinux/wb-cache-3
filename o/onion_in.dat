25|$|Garlic, onions, ginger, tomatoes, mild curry, {{and salt}} {{are the most}} common {{ingredients}} used to flavor dishes, and in coastal areas other ingredients such as coconut milk, vanilla, cloves or turmeric may also be used. A variety of condiments are served on the side and mixed into the rice or laoka according to each individual's taste rather than mixing them in as the food is being cooked.

500|$|As a young adult, Angelou, who {{preferred}} {{to be called}} Maya because her brother had called her {{that when she was}} a child, had a series of jobs and occupations, achieving modest success as a singer, dancer, and performer. She was a cast member of a European tour of Porgy and Bess in 1954 and 1955 and was a cabaret singer in nightclubs in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas throughout the 1950s. While performing at the Purple <b>Onion</b> <b>in</b> San Francisco, due to the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters, she changed her name from Rita Johnson to Maya Angelou, a [...] "distinctive name" [...] that set her apart and captured the feel of her calypso dance performances. In 1957, Angelou recorded her first album, Miss Calypso, which captured her focus on calypso music, popular at the time, and her years as a nightclub performer. As she described in her fourth autobiography, The Heart of a Woman (1981), Angelou eventually gave up performing for a writing career, although music remained an important aspect of her poetry. [...] In the late 1980s, she returned to music. [...] In 1988, she co-wrote a song with Roberta Flack, [...] "And So It Goes", which appeared on Flack's album Oasis. [...] Angelou collaborated with R artists Ashford & Simpson on seven of the eleven tracks of their 1996 album Been Found. [...] The album was responsible for three of Angelou's only Billboard chart appearances. [...] In 2007, she and jazz musician Wynton Marsalis wrote [...] "Music, Deep Rivers in My Soul", which traces the history of African-American music. [...] Angelou was also a fan of country music, and had written several songs.|$|E

2500|$|On June 10, 1993, {{shortly after}} the special {{election}} victory, Travis County authorities, led by Democratic district attorney Ronnie Earle, raided Hutchison's offices at the State Treasury. The search was conducted without a warrant, as incident to service of the indictments in the case. Subsequently, after two other grand jury indictments were thrown out, Hutchison was indicted a third time by a Texas grand jury in September 1993 for official misconduct and records tampering. Hutchison stated {{that she was the}} innocent victim of a politically motivated prosecutor. Earle acknowledged that he had sought appointment by Democratic Governor Ann Richards, to the same U.S. Senate seat to which Hutchison was ultimately elected, but he denied that his legal actions against Hutchison were politically motivated. The case against Hutchison was heard before State District Judge John <b>Onion</b> <b>in</b> February 1994. Pre-trial motions included a Motion to Quash evidence Earle obtained without a warrant when raiding the Treasurer's office. During pre-trial proceedings, the judge did not rule on admissibility. [...] Following the lack of a ruling, Earle declined to proceed with his case. Onion swore in a jury and directed the jury to acquit Hutchison, since Earle chose not to present evidence. The acquittal barred any future prosecution of Hutchison.|$|E

60|$|The soul of any {{religion}} realizes in {{one respect}} the Brahman idea of the individual soul of man, namely, that it exists much after the manner of an <b>onion,</b> <b>in</b> many concentric envelopes. Man, they tell us, is composed not of a single body simply, but of several layers of body, each shell as it were respectively inclosing another. The outermost is the merely material body, {{of which we are}} so directly cognizant. This encases a second, more spiritual, but yet not wholly free from earthly affinities. This contains another, still more refined; till finally, inside of all is that immaterial something which they conceive to constitute the soul. This eventual residuum exemplifies the Franciscan notion of pure substance, for it is a thing delightfully devoid of any attributes whatever.|$|E
