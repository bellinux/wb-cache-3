5|$|In March 1996, the US General Accounting Office (GAO) {{stated that}} it was cheaper to buy HarrierIIPlus {{aircraft}} outright than to remanufacture existing AV-8Bs.

Nevertheless, the program continued and, in 2003, the 72nd and last AV-8B to be remanufactured for the USMC was delivered. Spain also participated in the program, the delivery <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>last</b> refurbished aircraft occurring in December 2003, which {{marked the end of}} the AV-8B's production; the final new AV-8B had been delivered in 1997.|$|E
