The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing {{a modified version of}} the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.|$|E
5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E
25|$|Under Chinese rules, {{and more}} {{generally}} under any using the area scoring system, {{a player who}} played the game <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Rule 9 were in effect would not be committing any strategic errors by doing so. They would, however, likely be viewed as unsportsmanlike for prolonging the game unnecessarily. On the other hand, under a territory scoring system {{like that of the}} Japanese rules, playing the game out in this way would in most cases be a strategic mistake.|$|E

25|$|In the Renaissance {{period the}} Italian doors are quite simple, their architects trusting {{more to the}} doorways for effect; but in France and Germany the {{contrary}} is the case, the doors being elaborately carved, especially in the Louis XIV and Louis XV periods, and sometimes with architectural features such as columns and entablatures with pediment and niches, the doorway being in plain masonry. While in Italy the tendency was to give scale by {{increasing the number of}} panels, in France the contrary seems to have been the rule; and one of the great doors at Fontainebleau, which is in two leaves, is entirely carried <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> consisting of one great panel only.|$|E
25|$|First, there's {{the idea}} of the {{movement}} of the train, and then that of the sad young man who is in a corridor and who is moving about; thus there are two parallel movements corresponding to each other. Then, there is the distortion of the young man—I had called this elementary parallelism. It was a formal decomposition; that is, linear elements following each other like parallels and distorting the object. The object is completely stretched <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> elastic. The lines follow each other in parallels, while changing subtly to form the movement, or the form of the young man in question. I also used this procedure in the Nude Descending a Staircase.|$|E
25|$|That night Walt goes to {{the gang}} members' house, where they draw their weapons on him. He loudly berates them and enumerates their crimes, drawing the {{attention}} of the neighbors. Putting a cigarette in his mouth, he asks for a light, then puts his hand in his jacket and provocatively pulls it <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were holding a gun, causing the gang members to shoot and kill him. As he falls to the ground, his hand opens to reveal the Zippo cigarette lighter with the 1st Cavalry insignia; he was unarmed. His plan had in fact been to provoke them into killing him in public. Sue, following Walt's directions, frees Thao, and they drive to the scene in Walt's Gran Torino. One of the police officers tells them that all gang members have been placed under arrest for the murder, and due to the number of witnesses, they all face a lengthy stay in prison.|$|E

25|$|Prior {{received}} the NBC Denis Compton Award for young cricketers {{three times in}} his career. He has hit more than 1,000 first class runs {{over the course of}} two seasons, in 2003 when he won the County Championship with Sussex, and 2004, when his 1,158 runs, including 201 not out against Loughborough UCCE, was enough to be top-scorer for Sussex that season. In 2005 he made fewer runs, with 874, but also became Sussex's first choice wicket-keeper again after having shared duties with Tim Ambrose in the two previous seasons. He has won the County Championship three times (2003, 2006 and 2007) although in 2007 he did not take part as much as before due to his England duties. It was while playing against Shane Warne that Prior acquired the nickname of 'watermelons', after Warne mimicked Prior's walk to the crease, with 'his arms <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were carrying a watermelon under each arm'.|$|E

The script included {{a conversation between}} Carter and Colonel Caldwell (Mitch Pileggi), where he talks to her as an [...] "equal", but the filmed scene was cut when the episode was longer than anticipated. The production crew felt the scene was not important enough, but Gero also noticed with surprise that Mitch Pileggi acted it <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were a [...] "romance scene".|$|E

500|$|Following the game, however, {{controversy}} emerged about a silhouetted {{camera shot}} of Prince, projected against a large sheet by {{a bright light}} {{on the other side}} of the performer. The controversy centered around his guitar, which detractors claimed seemed phallic, and critics stating that it [...] "looked embarrassingly rude, crude and unfortunately placed." [...] Though the guitar has been considered by some an extension of a male player's sexuality (especially highlighted by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and even Prince himself), supporters of Prince say that the show did not, in fact, become any more sexually charged than usual, noting that [...] "a guitar at waist level does look like an enormous phallus." [...] ABC late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! responded to this mild controversy by including two satirically pixelized Super Bowl clips on its weekly segment [...] "This Week in Unnecessary Censorship" [...] for the February 9, 2007 episode. The first [...] "censored" [...] clip was the kickoff show introduction for CBS' coverage of the Super Bowl, with the first two letters of [...] "kickoff" [...] blurred <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> [...] "jackoff" [...] were censored, then with a clip of the shadow of Prince playing guitar with the guitar neck blurred <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> an actual penis were being blurred.|$|E
500|$|Byron {{requested}} {{that her name}} be changed from Alba, which also related to [...] "Albé," [...] Clairmont's nickname for Byron, to Allegra, an Italian name meaning [...] "cheerful, brisk" [...] and relating to the musical term [...] "allegro." [...] During the journey to turn the child over to Byron, Clairmont wrote in her journal that she had bathed her daughter in Dover, but then crossed the passage <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> afraid to mention the baby's name. The child was baptised with the name Clara Allegra before her mother relinquished her to Byron. Byron discussed spelling Allegra's surname as [...] "Biron" [...] instead of as [...] "Byron" [...] to further distinguish her from his legitimate daughter, Augusta Ada Byron. Byron offered to pay Shelley for the expense of Allegra's upkeep during her first months of life, but Shelley indignantly refused and said the cost was a trifle.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule {{disliked the}} double eagle and other Longacre coins showing Liberty, calling them routine. [...] He did {{find that the}} reverse [...] "has some commendable points of heraldic imagery" [...] and likened {{that side of the}} coin to [...] "the frontispiece for a patriotic brochure". The Daily Alta California in May 1850 reprinted a piece from an unnamed Eastern newspaper, which said of the new piece, [...] "we cannot say that we admire it... imperfectly formed, and marred by some adjacent flummery intended for radiance we suppose, by which the whole thing is rendered confused". The Journal of Commerce, a New York periodical, suggested that the piece be replaced with one showing George Washington on one side and on the other [...] "a handsome eagle standing <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were not ashamed of itself". The Boston Evening Transcript suggested that Mint authorities should be [...] "stopping the issuance of this very shabby coin. [...] The manager of the mint would seem to be utterly destitute of taste to allow such a specimen to go forth." [...] Bowers, writing in 2004, stated that despite the negative contemporary reaction, the design of the double eagle is now very popular among collectors.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{have stated}} that Man of Steel is a {{religious}} allegory, especially since Warner Bros. set up a website www.manofsteelresources.com that contains [...] "a nine-page pamphlet entitled Jesus – The Original Superhero". Justin Craig compares Kal-El's struggle to the passion of Christ, stating that [...] "Kal-El is {{more than willing to}} sacrifice himself to save the people of Earth. Originally reluctant to reveal his identity and powers to the world, Supes decides to turn himself over to Zod to save humanity from annihilation." [...] Craig also states that there is an allegory to the Trinity within Man of Steel: [...] "Jor-El returns to Kal-El on Earth as a ghost, guiding his budding superhero son on his journey to salvation. Before Jor-El sends his son off to Earth baby Moses-style, he tells his wife that, like Jesus, 'He’ll be a god to them.'" [...] Paul Asay of The Washington Post writes that [...] "Superman floats in space with his arms splayed <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> nailed to an invisible cross," [...] a fact that Craig also mentioned in his assessment of the film. The protagonist of the film is also 33 years old and seeks [...] "counsel at a church." [...] Writing for The Huffington Post, Colin Liotta compared Zod to Adolf Hitler, citing, [...] "He feels his vision for a pure Krypton (i.e. a society like the one Hitler envisioned with his eugenics program) is the only answer for survival." ...|$|E
500|$|The four-piece band {{struggled}} {{to come up}} with new material for an album, but in February 1968 recorded Wright's [...] "It Would Be So Nice" [...] and Waters' [...] "Julia Dream". In early February it was announced that the Waters-penned track, [...] "Corporal Clegg" [...] would be the band's next single, however, due to pressure from the label, the song was earmarked for the album, and [...] "It Would Be So Nice" [...] was released in April as a single, with [...] "Julia Dream" [...] on the B-side. Throughout April, the band was taking stock of the songs recorded up to that point. Waters blocked the release of the two tracks, [...] "Vegetable Man" [...] and [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream", on the album, though the band retained [...] "Jugband Blues", and the Waters-written [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" [...] on which Barrett played. With not enough material to fill the album's last 12 minutes, the band started piecing together several pieces of material that was to become the title track of the album, [...] "A Saucerful of Secrets". Mason and Waters planned the track <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were an architectural design, including peaks and troughs. Producer Smith didn't like the song, stating to them that they [...] "just can't do this, it's too long. You have to write three-minute songs." [...] On 25 June, the band recorded another session for BBC Radio's Top Gear; the session featured two tracks from Saucerful: [...] "Let There Be More Light" [...] and a shortened retitled version of the title track, titled here as [...] "The Massed Gadgets of Hercules".|$|E
500|$|Television critics {{reacted with}} mixed {{reaction}} toward the episode, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "pretty dull." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of American Dad!, The Simpsons and Bob's Burgers that preceded the show, and the episode of The Cleveland Show that followed it, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I don't {{have much to say}} about tonight's Family Guy. Last week, we had some comments about how Family Guy seems to be willing to play with its format this season. That didn't happen this week at all." [...] Kaiser went on to criticize the flashback involving Lois and Joyce in high school, stating, [...] "Having a previously unknown flashback as the big reveal feels like cheating, if you're inclined to view Family Guy as consistent." [...] He concluded his review by praising [...] "the burning bush" [...] joke, and ultimately gave the episode a C- rating, the worst rating of the night. It was beaten by the American Dad! episode [...] "Fart-Break Hotel", The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Roberta?", The Simpsons episode [...] "Flaming Moe", and the Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Crawl Space". In a slightly more positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode for some of its [...] "silly side jokes," [...] but felt disappointed by the ending to the show, commenting, [...] "it didn't follow any real logic [...] It was an easy way <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they'd written themselves into a corner." [...] Hughes also criticized the episode for its dependence on cutaway gags, writing, [...] "at least there were some funnier moments in this one. Unfortunately, a lot of those came in the cutaways. And I thought we were starting to move away from a dependence on them." [...] Hughes went on to comment that he felt confused by Stewie possibly being fathered by a porn star, adding that [...] "it would be far more likely that Chris or Meg was fathered by the porn star." ...|$|E
