40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the debate}} on the relationship between trade liberalization and the harmonization <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> in the context of European integration. It is divided into two parts. The first shows that harmonization <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> was not imposed in the 1960 s and 1970 s as a pre-condition for trade liberalization inside the Community mainly due to favourable economic conditions. The second part examines the demand for and the actual measures in favour <b>of</b> harmonizing <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> which have increasingly occurred in the Community since the mid- 1970 s. It is contended that this new regime corresponds to greater heterogeneity and slower growth inside the Community.

40|$|Tracing the Fragments <b>of</b> Global <b>Social</b> <b>Policy.</b> Whereas {{some authors}} argue that global <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> – defined as global redistributive <b>policies,</b> global <b>social</b> {{regulatory}} <b>policies</b> and elements of global provision and empowerment – does exist, other observers challenge this claim. These contradictory positions are {{the starting point}} of our article. In the first part, we investigate to what extent elements <b>of</b> global <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> can be found; we demonstrate that only fragments <b>of</b> global <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> exist, namely some norms <b>of</b> <b>social</b> justice and some weak global regulatory mechanisms. In the second part of our article, we identify reasons for the limited articulation <b>of</b> global <b>social</b> <b>policy.</b> We sketch <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> theories which have been developed for the national level and discuss their relevance for global <b>social</b> <b>policy.</b> In doing so, we highlight limited industrialization at the global level, the weakness of global trade unions and churches, the dominance of liberal international organizations, the veto power of powerful national governments and the weakness of (Scandinavian) welfare states in global politics as possible reasons for the rather fragmentary existence <b>of</b> global <b>social</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|R

25|$|In terms <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>policy,</b> the Curtin Government {{enacted a}} wide range of {{progressive}} social reforms during its time in office.

Aboriginal Australians were provided with significantly increased entitlement to welfare benefits, while maternity allowances were extended. In addition, pensions for the elderly and infirm were increased, while reciprocal arrangements with New Zealand were introduced regarding old age and invalid pensions. In 1942, temporary public employees became eligible to apply to join the Commonwealth superannuation scheme if they had been employed for no less than five years and were certified as having indefinite future employment, while the Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act of 1943 provided long service leave for all temporary Commonwealth employees. In 1943, the Universities Commission was established to exempt students from war service to undertake or continue university studies and to assist those students by exempting them from fees and, subject to a means test, by providing them with living allowances.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{decreasing}} {{rates in}} fertility and increasing life expectancy could have damaging consequences for almost every European nation. One consequence of ageing might be lower inflation rates as elderly {{people are more}} inflation averse and have sufficient political power for governments to care about their preferences. These demographic trends provoked debate over the best policies that can reverse these trends and lessen their consequences. RAND Europe, an independent not-for-profit research institute, was able to collect these policies through research and analysis. There were three broad policy approaches that were generated from the debate. The first policy is to encourage childbearing among younger couples that involves marriage and cohabitation. The second policy states {{that there should be}} an increase in the immigration of working-age people. Thirdly, there should be an improvement <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> in general, to mitigate negative consequences of these trends. The research intends {{to examine the relationship between}} demographic trends and European government policies and determine which policies can reduce the consequences of low fertility and population ageing.|$|E

25|$|Cholesbury {{can claim}} one modest {{contribution}} to the reform <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> in England. From the time of Elizabeth I a levy was imposed on property owners to fund poor relief in their parish. The amount collected increased significantly during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The increasingly desperate living available off the land {{in this part of}} the Chilterns from 1812 onwards meant the parish vestry was unable to raise sufficient funds to support the poor and in 1832 declared itself bankrupt. An account of the plight of the parish was recorded in the report to Parliament by the Poor Law Commission provided by the Rev. Henry Jeston. He had arrived as vicar in 1830, chaired vestry meetings and between 1832 and 1835 and eventually raised sufficient loans from neighbouring parishes and advances from landowners, including himself, to rescue the parish from its plight and put into effect measures to ensure the future financial security of the parish. He was mentioned in the subsequent debate which led to reform of the Poor Laws for which Herbert Spencer provided an account in his most famous book The Man Versus the State. The village recognised Jeston's achievements through raising a subscription for a stained-glassed window in his honour.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the court {{acknowledged}} that using a 15-gram differentia {{might not be}} the best method of furthering the social object of the MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better differentia was one which reasonable people may not necessarily agree on, and so this was a question <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> best left to the legislature, not the judiciary. Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited deterrent effect on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within the its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue was a question of policy and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged {{it could be argued that}} there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's deterrent effect on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a deterrent effect.|$|E
