The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
25|$|Claims {{that some}} of the {{provisions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>code</b> are unconstitutional are submissions of a different order. They do not arise from innocent mistakes caused by the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code. Rather, they reveal full knowledge of the provisions at issue and a studied conclusion, however wrong, that those provisions are invalid and unenforceable. Thus, in this case, Cheek paid his taxes for years, but after attending various seminars and based on his own study, he concluded that the income tax laws could not constitutionally require him to pay a tax.|$|E

25|$|Complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>code</b> in {{developed}} economies offer perverse tax incentives. The more details of tax policy there are, the {{more opportunities for}} legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion. These not only result in lost revenue, but involve additional costs: for instance, payments made for tax advice are essentially deadweight costs because they add no wealth to the economy. Perverse incentives also occur because of non-taxable 'hidden' transactions; for instance, a sale from one company to another might be liable for sales tax, but if the same goods were shipped from one branch of a corporation to another, no tax would be payable.|$|E

As <b>the</b> attentions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service shift away from raising revenue and toward these other matters, the revenue-based justification for tax exceptionalism from general administrative law norms fades.
