The experiment was designed using completely randomized block design with three treatments of packaging (Le. unpacking as control, PE <b>plastic</b> <b>packing</b> and PP <b>plastic</b> <b>packing)</b> and three blocks of sampling day. The result showed that the packaging using PE and PP plastics decreased bacteria contamination, moisture, pH, cooking loss and maintained of crude protein of the fresh meat.
