25|$|The Journal {{claims to}} have sent the first news report, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dow</b> Jones wire, of a plane {{crashing}} into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged {{by the collapse of}} the World Trade Center just across the street. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue {{for the first time in}} the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to his concerns, Morgan sent Gary on an urgent mission to Washington that Sunday so that the deal might be vetted by President Theodore Roosevelt himself before the stock exchange opened the next day. Convinced by Gary that U. S. Steel only wished to purchase Moore and Schley's stock in order to inject liquidity into the firm and thereby shore up investor confidence in the wider economy, Roosevelt granted the transaction antitrust immunity in November 1907, a decision {{for which he was}} later derided by critics as a hypocrite. Indeed, in 1911 the federal government sought to undo what it perceived to be Roosevelt's mistake and (without success) sued U. S. Steel. In the meantime, Moore and Schley was saved from collapse, the panic soon subsided and U. S. Steel was rewarded with a valuable prize [...] a controlling stake in TCI. U. S. Steel immediately replaced the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dow</b> Jones Index, where it remained until 1991.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the behavior of}} moving average technical trading rules applied to over 100 years of <b>the</b> <b>Dow</b> Jones Industrial Index. It is found that the differences between conditional means during buy and sell periods has changed dramatically over the previous 10 years relative to the previous 90 years of data, but differences in conditional variances have not changed much over the entire sample. Further robustness checks indicate that similar results could be obtained with simple momentum based strategies. The analysis is performed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>Dow</b> series, but these techniques could be useful in derivative markets where better estimates of conditional means and variances would be useful information...|$|R
