5|$|A {{report of}} her autopsy was {{released}} in December 2016. Laurer died on April 20 of an overdose of alcohol, combined with the anxiety drugs diazepam and nordazepam, painkillers oxycodone and <b>oxymorphone,</b> and sleeping aid temazepam.|$|E
25|$|The first pathway of {{the above}} three {{accounts}} for 40% of the metabolism of <b>oxymorphone,</b> making oxymorphone-3-glucuronide the main metabolite of <b>oxymorphone,</b> while the latter two pathways account for less than 10% of the metabolism of <b>oxymorphone.</b> After N-demethylation of <b>oxymorphone,</b> noroxymorphone is further glucuronidated to noroxymorphone-3-glucuronide.|$|E
25|$|However, {{despite the}} greater in vitro {{activity}} {{of some of}} its metabolites, it has been determined that oxycodone itself is responsible for 83.0% and 94.8% of its analgesic effect following oral and intravenous administration, respectively. <b>Oxymorphone</b> plays only a minor role, being responsible for 15.8% and 4.5% of the analgesic effect of oxycodone after oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Although the CYP2D6 genotype and the route of administration result in differential rates of <b>oxymorphone</b> formation, the unchanged parent compound remains the major contributor to the overall analgesic effect of oxycodone. In contrast to oxycodone and <b>oxymorphone,</b> noroxycodone and noroxymorphone, while also potent MOR agonists, poorly cross the blood-brain-barrier into the central nervous system, and for this reason, are only minimally analgesic in comparison. In accordance, while higher CYP2D6 activity increases the effects of oxycodone (owing to increased conversion into <b>oxymorphone),</b> higher CYP3A4 activity has the opposite effect, and decreases the effects of oxycodone (owing to increased metabolism into noroxycodone and noroxymorphone).|$|E
25|$|Among the narcotics, it is opiates such as {{morphine}} and codeine, and opioids such as diacetylmorphine (Heroin), hydrocodone (Vicodin; Hycodan), oxycodone (Percocet; Oxycontin), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and <b>oxymorphone</b> (Opana).|$|E
25|$|A {{few of the}} {{metabolites}} of oxycodone {{have also}} {{been found to be}} active as MOR agonists, some of which notably have much higher affinity for (as well as higher efficacy at) the MOR in comparison. <b>Oxymorphone</b> possesses 3- to 5-fold higher affinity for the MOR than does oxycodone, while noroxycodone and noroxymorphone possess one-third of and 3-fold higher affinity for the MOR, respectively, and MOR activation is 5- to 10-fold less with noroxycodone but 2-fold higher with noroxymorphone relative to oxycodone. Noroxycodone, noroxymorphone, and <b>oxymorphone</b> also have longer half-lives than oxycodone.|$|E
25|$|In humans, N-demethylation of {{oxycodone}} to noroxycodone by CYP3A4 is {{the major}} metabolic pathway, accounting for 45% ± 21% of a dose of oxycodone, while O-demethylation of oxycodone into <b>oxymorphone</b> by CYP2D6 and 6-ketoreduction of oxycodone into 6-oxycodols represent relatively minor metabolic pathways, accounting for 11% ± 6% and 8% ± 6% of a dose of oxycodone, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Almost all benzodiazepines are metabolised by the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 pathway, and {{inhibition}} of these enzymes {{results in a}} higher AUC (i.e. the total effect over time of a given dose). Other examples of drugs dependent on CYP3A4 for their metabolism are escitalopram, warfarin, oxycodone, tramadol, and <b>oxymorphone.</b> The concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used concomitantly with omeprazole.|$|E
25|$|The methyl {{group that}} makes {{morphine}} into codeine {{can be removed}} or added back, or replaced with another functional group like ethyl and others to make codeine analogues of morphine-derived drugs and vice versa. Codeine analogues of morphine-based drugs often serve as prodrugs of the stronger drug, as in codeine and morphine, hydrocodone and hydromorphone, oxycodone and <b>oxymorphone,</b> nicocodeine and nicomorphine, dihydrocodeine and dihydromorphine, etc.|$|E
25|$|Nalbuphine is a semi-synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist {{analgesic}} of the phenanthrene series. It is chemically {{related to the}} widely used opioid antagonists, naloxone and naltrexone, and the potent opioid analgesic, <b>oxymorphone.</b> It is available in two concentrations, 10mg and 20mg of nalbuphine hydrochloride per mL. Both strengths contain 0.94% sodium citrate hydrous, 1.26% citric acid anhydrous, 0.1% sodium metabisulfite, and 0.2% of a 9:1 mixture of methylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives; pH is adjusted, if necessary, with hydrochloric acid. The 10mg/mL strength contains 0.1% sodium chloride.|$|E
25|$|Most of the licit {{morphine}} produced {{is used to}} make codeine by methylation. It is also {{a precursor}} for many drugs including heroin (3,6-diacetylmorphine), hydromorphone (dihydromorphinone), and <b>oxymorphone</b> (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone); many morphine derivatives can also be manufactured using thebaine or codeine as a starting material. Replacement of the N-methyl group of morphine with an N-phenylethyl group results in a product that is 18 times more powerful than morphine in its opiate agonist potency. Combining this modification with {{the replacement of the}} 6-hydroxyl with a 6-methylene group produces a compound some 1,443 times more potent than morphine, stronger than the Bentley compounds such as etorphine (M99, the Immobilon tranquilliser dart) by some measures.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary source}} of {{morphine}} is isolation from poppy straw of the opium poppy. In 2013, an estimated 523000kg of morphine were produced. About 45000kg were used directly for pain, a four-time increase over the last twenty years. Most use for this purpose was in the developed world. About 70% of morphine is used to make other opioids such as hydromorphone, <b>oxymorphone,</b> and heroin. It is a Schedule II drug in the United States, Class A in the United Kingdom, and Schedule I in Canada. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Morphine is sold under many trade names.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{and human}} studies and {{clinical}} experience {{back up the}} contention that morphine {{is one of the}} most euphoric drugs known, and via all but the IV route heroin and morphine cannot be distinguished according to studies because heroin is a prodrug for the delivery of systemic morphine. Chemical changes to the morphine molecule yield other euphorigenics such as dihydromorphine, hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Hydal), and <b>oxymorphone</b> (Numorphan, Opana), as well as the latter three's methylated equivalents dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone, respectively; in addition to heroin, there are dipropanoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, and other members of the 3,6 morphine diester category like nicomorphine and other similar semi-synthetic opiates like desomorphine, hydromorphinol, etc. used clinically in many countries of the world but in many cases also produced illicitly in rare instances.|$|E
25|$|Morphine was {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, <b>oxymorphone,</b> high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of dihydrocodeine, poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, a major HIV outbreak, Indiana's largest-ever, {{occurred}} in two largely rural, economically depressed and poor {{counties in the}} southern portion of the state, due to the injection of a relatively new opioid-type drug called Opana (<b>oxymorphone),</b> which is designed be taken in pill form but is ground up and injected intravenously using needles. Because {{of the lack of}} HIV cases in that area beforehand and the youth of many but not all of those affected, the relative unavailability in the local area of safe needle exchange programs and of treatment centers capable of dealing with long-term health needs, HIV care, and drug addiction during the initial phases of the outbreak, it was not initially adequately contained and dealt with until those were set up by the government, and acute awareness of the issue spread. Such centers have now been opened, and short-term care is beginning to be provided; once the scope of the outbreak became clear, Governor Mike Pence, despite some initial reservations, approved a legislative measure to allow safe, clean needle exchange programs and treatment for those affected, which could end up being instituted statewide.|$|E

2500|$|Toward {{the middle}} 20th century, {{the use of}} opiates was {{generally}} limited {{to the treatment of}} pain, and opium was no longer a medically accepted [...] "cure-all". [...] Further, the pharmaceutical industry began synthesizing various opioids, such as propoxyphene, <b>oxymorphone</b> and oxycodone. [...] These synthetic opioids, along with codeine and morphine were preferable to laudanum since a single opioid could be prescribed for different types of pain rather than the [...] "cocktail" [...] of laudanum, which contains nearly all of the opium alkaloids. [...] Consequently, laudanum became mostly obsolete as an analgesic, since its principal ingredient is morphine, which can be prescribed by itself to treat pain. [...] Until now, there has been no medical consensus on which of the two (laudanum or morphine alone) is the better choice for treating pain.|$|E
