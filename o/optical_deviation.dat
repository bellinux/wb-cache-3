40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the minimal <b>optical</b> <b>deviation</b> responsible for cognitive after-effects in healthy individuals and to explore whether there was a relationship between the degree of <b>optical</b> <b>deviation</b> and cognitive after-effects. Therefore different leftward optical deviations (8 degrees, 10 degrees and 15 degrees) were used in three different groups of healthy participants. Sensorimotor after-effects (evaluating the visuo-manual realignment) were assessed using an open-loop pointing task and cognitive after-effects (evaluating changes in spatial representation) were assessed using manual and perceptual (landmark) line bisection tasks. Results revealed that exposure to 8 degrees, 10 degrees and 15 degrees optical shifts produced sensorimotor after-effects. In contrast, the occurrence of cognitive after-effects depended on the <b>optical</b> <b>deviation.</b> Adaptation to an 8 degrees leftward <b>optical</b> <b>deviation</b> did not produce cognitive after-effects. Adaptation to a 10 degrees leftward <b>optical</b> <b>deviation</b> was responsible for after-effects in the manual line bisection task only. Adaptation to a 15 degrees leftward <b>optical</b> <b>deviation</b> produced after-effects in both the manual and perceptual line bisection tasks. All cognitive after-effects were rightward and were similar to mild, neglect-like manifestations. Both sensorimotor and cognitive after-effects were correlated with the degree of <b>optical</b> <b>deviation.</b> Our results are of methodological and theoretical interest to those interested in sensorimotor plasticity and spatial cognition...|$|E
40|$|In healthy subjects, {{sensorimotor}} after-effects of prism adaptation {{are known}} to be symmetric (they appear after using leftward and rightward optical deviations), whereas cognitive after-effects are asymmetric (they appear after using a leftward <b>optical</b> <b>deviation)</b> and rightward oriented. Sensorimotor and cognitive after-effects have been classically studied using different specific tasks. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether both after-effects may be involved in a same visuo-spatial task. Therefore we compared the amplitude of after-effects following adaptation to a rightward or leftward <b>optical</b> <b>deviation.</b> After-effects were assessed by manual pointing or goal oriented locomotor task. The main result showed a greater amplitude for rightward locomotor after-effects (after adaptation to a leftward deviation) than for leftward locomotor after-effects (after adaptation to a rightward deviation). This means that cognitive after-effects may add to sensorimotor after-effects following adaptation to a leftward <b>optical</b> <b>deviation.</b> This asymmetry challenges the classical distinction between sensorimotor and cognitive after-effects of prism adaptation. Implications for the functional mechanisms and the neuroanatomical substrate of prism adaptation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Microlens arrays (MLAs) are key optical {{components}} in laser beam homogenization. However, due to imperfect surface profiles resulting from microfabrication, the functionalities of MLAs in beam modulation could be compromised to some extent. In {{order to address}} this issue, the effects of surface profile mismatches between ideal and fabricated MLAs on beam homogenization were analyzed. Four types of surface profile errors of MLAs were modeled theoretically and numerical simulations were conducted to quantitatively estimate {{the effects of these}} profile errors on beam homogenization. In addition, experiments were conducted to validate the simulation results, revealing that profile errors leading to <b>optical</b> <b>deviations</b> located on the apex of microlenses affected beam homogenization less than deviations located further away from it. This study can provide references for the further applications of MLAs in beam homogenization...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAccording to {{the present}} standards, the optical {{characterization}} of line-focusing concentrators follows the quasi-dynamic test method, thus resulting from thermally based experimental measurements. The impact of <b>optical</b> <b>deviations</b> from design conditions on a concentrator optical performance increases with concentration ratio. Adding to this, the geometrical specificities which might be found in line-focus concentrators render important a more thorough optical characterization of such systems. The present article studies the interest and possibility of using optical simulation data as a complement to the experimental procedures followed in the optical characterization of line-focusing concentrators. Taking into account the isolated and combined impact {{of the most prominent}} optical effects in presence, the validation and accuracy of optical models is compared to that of experimental measurements. Additional optical characterization results to be obtained from such models are suggested, complementing the optical parameters previewed in the standards and enabling a higher accuracy in yield calculations...|$|R

Accordingly, to ensure safe driving, {{it is imperative to}} detect potholes and estimate their depths in either condition. In this paper, we develop a physics-based geometric framework, where such detection and depth-estimation can be accomplished using suitable laser. Specifically, we relate dry pothole depth to measured <b>optical</b> <b>deviation</b> using simple ray optics. Further, we use Snell's law of refraction to obtain a quartic equation, and its appropriate real root to relate water-filled pothole depth to the corresponding <b>optical</b> <b>deviation.</b> Here we take into account diminishing resolu- tion with increasing distance from the camera.

40|$|International audienceSpatial neglect (SN) is {{commonly}} associated with poor functional outcome. Adaptation to a rightward <b>optical</b> <b>deviation</b> of vision {{has been shown to}} benefit to SN rehabilitation. The neurophysiological foundations and the optimal modalities of prism adaptation (PA) therapy however remain to be validated. This study is aimed at exploring the long-term sensory-motor, cognitive and functional effects produced by weekly PA sessions over a period of four weeks. A double-blind, monocentric randomized and controlled trial (RCT) was carried out. Twenty patients with left SN secondary to stroke were included, 10 in the “prism” group and 10 in the “control” group. The sensory-motor effects of PA were evaluated by measurement of manual and visual straight-ahead, and also by precision of pointing without visual feedback before and after each PA session. The functional independence measure (FIM) was evaluated before and at 1, 3 and 6 months after PA, while SN severity was assessed using the Behavioural Inattention Test (BIT) before and 6 months after PA. Before the intervention, only manual straight-ahead pointing constituted a reproducible sensory-motor measurement. During prism exposure, a questionnaire showed that not a single patient were aware of the direct effects of <b>optical</b> <b>deviation</b> on pointing movement performance. The sensory-motor after-effects produced by the PA produced a more rapid reduction of the rightward manual straight-ahead, which was secondarily followed by visual straight-ahead. These sensory-motor effects helped to clarify the action mechanisms of PA on SN. At the conclusion of the 6 -month follow-up, the two groups showed similar improvement, indicating that a weekly PA session over 4 weeks was not sufficient to produce long-term functional benefit. This improvement was correlated with the evolution of visual straight-ahead, which can be proposed as a marker for patients outcome...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose—To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} prism adaptation (PA) on spatial neglect signs. Methods—Ten patients (hemianopia in 6) and 8 control subjects were included. Tasks were reading single words, nonwords, and a text, bell cancellation, line bisection, and scene drawing, before and after adaptation, with either deviating or neutral prisms. Results—Errors were more frequent in patients but without any specific effect of PA. We found partial improvement at the late sessions, independent of prisms. Conclusions—We did not confirm the efficacy of PA on spatial neglect. (Stroke. 2006; 37 : 542 - 543.)

40|$|During the {{procedure}} of prism adaptation, subjects execute pointing movements to visual targets under a lateral optical displacement: As {{consequence of the}} discrepancy between visual and proprioceptive inputs, their visuo-motor activity is characterized by pointing errors. The perception of such final errors triggers error-correction processes that eventually result into sensori-motor compensation, opposite to the prismatic displacement (i. e., after-effects). Here we tested whether the mere observation of erroneous pointing movements, similar to those executed during prism adaptation, is sufficient to produce adaptation-like after-effects. Neurotypical participants observed, from a first-person perspective, the examiner’s arm making incorrect pointing movements that systematically overshot visual targets location to the right, thus simulating a rightward <b>optical</b> <b>deviation.</b> Three classical after-effect measures (proprioceptive, visual and visual-proprioceptive shift) were recorded before and after first-person’s perspective observation of pointing errors. Results showed that mere visual exposure to an arm that systematically points on the right-side of a target (i. e., without error correction) produces a leftward after-effect, which mostly affects the observer’s proprioceptive estimation of her body midline. In addition, being exposed to such a constant visual error induced in the observer the illusion ‘‘to feel’ ’ the seen movement. These findings indicate tha...|$|E
40|$|Abstract To {{date the}} {{anatomical}} substrate(s) of prism adaptation remain(s) particularly debated, with two main candidates {{emerging from the}} literature: the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the cerebellum. The functional processes involved in the acquisition of the adaptive aftereffects also remain largely unknown. The main result shown here is that a patient with a bilateral optic ataxia can adapt to an <b>optical</b> <b>deviation,</b> which allows us to make a step forward on these two issues. First, it demonstrates that the corresponding part of the PPC is not a necessary substrate for prism adaptation. Second, since this patient exhibits deficit for fast visuo-motor guidance, it provides direct evidence for a dissociation between on-line visuo-motor control and visuo-motor plasticity. Since the intermanual transfer rate of adaptation is larger in this patient than in control subjects, the PPC may still have an influence on adaptation under normal conditions. We propose {{a model of the}} relative contribution of the PPC and the cerebellum during prism exposure, associating these two structures with the two interacting behavioural components of prism adaptation described by previous psychophysical experiments: the strategic component would be linked to the PPC and the adaptive component to the cerebellum. In this model, the strategic component enters in conflict with the development and the general-isation of the adaptive aftereffects. This idea is compatible with the fact that a lesion of the PPC increases the transfer rate and the generalisation of the adaptation, as is also observed in unilateral neglect...|$|E

For single surfaces, light-scattering techniques {{have become a}} powerful tool for the characterization of surface roughness. For thin-film coatings, however, solving the inverse scattering problem seemed to be impossible because of the large number of parameters involved. A simplified model is presented that introduces two parameters: Parameter delta describes <b>optical</b> thickness <b>deviations</b> from the perfect design, and parameter beta describes the roughness evolution inside the coating according to a power law.

40|$|The {{processes}} underlying short-term plasticity {{induced by}} visuomotor adaptation to a shifted visual field are still debated. Two {{main sources of}} error can induce motor adaptation: reaching feedback errors, which correspond to visually perceived discrepancies between hand and target positions, and errors between predicted and actual visual reafferences of the moving hand. These two sources of error are closely intertwined and difficult to disentangle, as both the target and the reaching limb are simultaneously visible. Accordingly, {{the goal of the}} present study was to clarify the relative contributions of these two types of errors during a pointing task under prism-displaced vision. In ‘terminal feedback error’ condition, viewing of their hand by subjects was allowed only at movement end, simultaneously with viewing of the target. In ‘movement prediction error’ condition, viewing of the hand was limited to movement duration, in the absence of any visual target, and error signals arose solely from comparisons between predicted and actual reafferences of the hand. In order to prevent intentional corrections of errors, a subthreshold, progressive stepwise increase in prism deviation was used, so that subjects remained unaware of the visual deviation applied in both conditions. An adaptive aftereffect was observed in the ‘terminal feedback error’ condition only. As far as subjects remained unaware of the <b>optical</b> <b>deviation</b> and self-assigned pointing errors, prediction error alone was insufficient to induce adaptation. These results indicate a critical role of hand-to-target feedback error signals in visuomotor adaptation; consistent with recent neurophysiological findings, they suggest that a combination of feedback and prediction error signals is necessary for eliciting aftereffects. They also suggest that feedback error updates the prediction of reafferences when a visual perturbation is introduced gradually and cognitive factors are eliminated or strongly attenuated...|$|E

40|$|Light {{scattering}} from interface imperfections or defects is a {{topic of}} persistent interest. On the one hand, light scattering can be a critical issue that limits throughput and imaging quality of optical components even if high-end polishing and coating techniques are employed. This in particular holds for multilayer coatings and for short wavelengths of application. On the other hand, scattered light also carries valuable information about its origins, such as the structural properties of multilayer coatings. A large variety of instruments for scatter measurements in the visible, ultraviolet, infrared spectral ranges has been developed at the Fraunhofer IOF in Jena during the past years. In addition, software tools have been developed based on existing scattering theories which enable an advanced analysis of the observed scattering properties. For the rather complicated scattering of thin film coatings, a simplified model was developed recently which introduces two simple parameters to describe the roughness evolution from interface to interface and <b>optical</b> thickness <b>deviations.</b> An iterative solution of the inverse scattering problem yields information about alterations of the structural and optical properties inside multilayer coatings based on angle resolved scatter measurements.

40|$|Abstract: A Radio-over-Fibre {{system to}} {{distribute}} wireless LAN signals over multimode fibre {{has been designed}} and analysed. The system employs a novel frequency multiplication technique, to surmount modal-dispersion-induced bandwidth limitation in multimode fibre in general and in Graded Index Polymer Optical Fibre (GIPOF) in particular. This is achieved by frequency modulating the optical signal at the source, and then periodically filtering the received signal at the remote station prior to direct detection by the photodiode. Data modulation is added by intensity modulating the frequency modulated optical signal. While {{the frequency of the}} modulating signal at the source is limited by the fibre’s modal bandwidth, the frequency of the generated electrical microwave signal is not. The frequency of the generated electrical signal is determined by optical parameters such as the <b>optical</b> frequency <b>deviation</b> impressed at the source, and the free spectral range of the periodic filter at the remote station. Simulation results show that the system is capable of generating high purity electrical carriers at 5. 4 GHz, and higher microwave and millimetre wave frequencies, which are several orders of magnitude beyond the bandwidth of multimode fibre for link lengths of up to 500 m. In addition, the system can handle both linear and constant envelop modulated data such as ASK, PSK and QAM at capacities beyond 56 Mbps per carrier. The use of multimode fibre and especially GIPOF in the wireless LAN feeder network instead of standard single-mode fibre greatly reduces installation and maintenance costs while offering more capacity than the present copper-based infrastructure. Therefore, the proposed system has the potential to make high-density broadband wireless LANs of the future, economically and technically feasible...|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} {{for the first}} time that in spite of well known big similarities between atomic ionization by photons and fast electrons, a qualitative difference exists in angular anisotropy parameters of electrons knocked out in these processes. The difference is disclosed here and attributed to distinction between normal (transverse) and virtual (longitudinal) photons. Formulas are derived for dipole and non-dipole angular anisotropy parameters in fast electronatom scattering. The ratio of quadrupole-to-dipole matrix elements is determined by the parameter ω R/v << 1 where ω is the transferred in collision energy, R is the ionized shell radius and v is the speed of projectile. This factor can be much bigger than in the case of photoionization, where one has the speed of light c that is much bigger than v. We illustrate general formulas by concrete results for outer s-subshells of noble gas atoms Ar and Xe.

Realistic 3 -D cirri are generated by a cloud generator based on simplified thermodynamic and dynamic equations and on the control of invariant scale properties. The 3 -D thermal infrared radiative transfer is simulated with a Monte Carlo model for three typical spectral bands in the infrared atmospheric window. Comparisons of TOA brightness temperatures resulting from 1 -D and 3 -D radiative transfer show significant differences for optically thick cirrus (τ > 0. 3 at 532 nm) and are mainly due to the plane-parallel approximation (PPA). At the spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km, two principal parameters control the heterogeneity effects on brightness temperatures: i) the <b>optical</b> thickness standard <b>deviation</b> inside the observation pixel, ii) the brightness temperature contrast between the top of the cirrus~and the clear-sky atmosphere.

30|$|Although Si {{fabrication}} {{technology has}} significantly {{developed over the}} last 20 [*]years, {{one of the main}} problems for optical, nano-scale periodic structures, such as Fabry-Perot interferometers and multi-channel photonic crystal (PhC) filters, remains in defining of the critical dimensions precisely in the system [1 – 3]. In general, structural deviations and non-uniformities present in the patterned features on the wafer occur for three principal reasons. First of all, there is the fundamental diffraction limit of the projection optics. Secondly, the mask pattern differs from the original design due to limitations in the mask fabrication process. Finally, random and systematic variations inevitably occur in a multitude of lithographic process parameters, such as focus and exposure [4]. Fabrication tolerances for modern e-beam lithography are usually assumed to be a minimum of about 5 % to 10 % of the nominal target dimensions. This crucially affects the optical characteristics of multi-channel filter devices [5 – 7]. It changes the precise wavelength position of individual channels; it increases the out-of-band reflection and causes an attenuation of the maximum intensity, resulting in a lowering of the quality factor, Q. One of the most promising solutions to these problems may be a filter device with low-power and low-loss capability to compensate for the <b>optical</b> filter <b>deviations.</b> This would allow fine tuning of individual channels in the filter system by varying the temperature or by applying an electric field. However, one of the main challenges in the realisation of tunable multi-channel devices remains the fixed channel spacing or free spectral range which cannot be easily tuned due to the strong coupling between channels. One of the more successful attempts to tackle this problem was presented in [8], where the authors demonstrated a solution for an integrated platform. This approach requires the incorporation of metallic micro-heaters into large 245 [*]μm resonators, demanding precise temperature control of the device during operation.|$|R
40|$|Caiiλλ 3934, 3969 {{absorbers}}, {{which are}} likely to be a subset of damped Lymanαsystems, are the most dusty quasar absorbers known, with an order of magnitude more extinction in E(B−V) than other absorption systems. There is also evidence that Caii absorbers trace galaxies with more ongoing star-formation than the average quasar absorber. Despite this, relatively little is known in detail about these unusual absorption systems. Here we present the first high resolution spectroscopic study of 19 Caii quasar absorbers, in the range 0. 6 � zabs � 1. 2, with Caiiλ 3934 equivalent widths, W 3934 0 � 0. 2 Å. Their general elemental depletion patterns are found to be similar to measurements in the warm halo phase of the Milky Way (MW) and Magellanic Clouds interstellar medium. Dust depletions andα-enrichments profiles of subsamples of 7 and 3 absorbers, respectively, are measured using a combination of Voigt profile fitting and apparent <b>optical</b> depth techniques. <b>Deviations</b> in [Cr/Zn]∼ 0. 3 ± 0. 1 dex and in [Si/Fe] � 0. 8 ± 0. 1 dex are detected across the profile of one absorber, which we attribute to differential dust depletion. The remaining absorbers have< 0. 3 dex (3 σ limit) variation in [Cr/Zn], much like the general DLA population, though the dustiest Caii absorbers, those wit...|$|R
