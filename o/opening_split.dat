The impact of sodium chloride and sodium silicate (sodium metasilicate salt) -cured hides along with green hides were investigated in terms of removal of hyaluronic acid. Throughout beamhouse operations, the opening up of fibre structure was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The residual hyaluronic acid in hide and pelt samples taken after each beamhouse operation was analysed through bio-chemical analysis assisted by UV-visible spectrophotometry. The interaction of residual hyaluronic acid with chromium (III) was investigated in terms of deposition of chromium(III) in cross-sectional layers of chrome-tanned leather through scanning electon microscope – energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). The hydrothermal stability of chrome tanned leather was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was found that sodium chloride can remove hyaluronic acid completely in the soaking operation and facilitate good <b>opening</b> and <b>splitting</b> up of fibre structure, which enables good penetration and fixation of chromium(III) species with the purified collagen. In contrast, in the absence of a neutral salt, residual hyaluronic acid existed throughout the beamhouse operations which resulted in poor <b>opening</b> and <b>splitting</b> up of fibre bundles and later inhibited the penetration of chromium(III) species in cross-sectional layers. As a result, comparatively lower hydrothermal stability was observed. Sodium silicate-cured hides did not provide satisfactory results in terms of removing the hyaluronic acid present in the hide, poor <b>opening</b> and <b>splitting</b> up of fibre structure were observed and residual hyaluronic acid was identified even at pickle stage.

40|$|The human ATP-binding {{cassette}} (ABC) protein CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a chloride channel, whose dysfunction causes cystic fibrosis. To gain structural {{insight into}} the dynamic interaction between CFTR's nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) proposed to underlie channel gating, we introduced target cysteines into the NBDs, expressed the channels in Xenopus oocytes, and used in vivo sulfhydryl-specific crosslinking to directly examine the cysteines' proximity. We tested five cysteine pairs, each comprising one introduced cysteine in the NH 2 -terminal NBD 1 and another in the COOH-terminal NBD 2. Identification of crosslinked product was facilitated by co-expression of NH 2 -terminal and COOH-terminal CFTR half channels each containing one NBD. The COOH-terminal half channel lacked all native cysteines. None of CFTR's 18 native cysteines was found essential for wild type-like, phosphorylation- and ATP-dependent, channel gating. The observed crosslinks demonstrate that NBD 1 and NBD 2 interact in a head-to-tail configuration analogous to that in homodimeric crystal structures of nucleotide-bound prokaryotic NBDs.

40|$|The present thesis {{examines}} {{questions related}} to the temporal origin of the Flavivirus genus and the ecology of tick-borne pathogens. In the first study, we date the origin and divergence time of the Flavivirus genus. It {{has been argued that}} the first flaviviruses originated after the last glacial maximum. This has been contradicted by recent analyses estimating that the tick-borne flaviviruses emerged at least before 16, 000 years ago. It has also been argued that the Powassan virus was introduced into North America at the time between the <b>opening</b> and <b>splitting</b> of the Beringian land bridge. Supported by tip date and biogeographical calibration, our results suggest that this genus originated circa 120, 000 (156, 100 – 322, 700) years ago if the Tamana bat virus is included in the genus, or circa 85, 000 (63, 700 – 109, 600) years ago excluding the Tamana bat virus. In the second study we estimate the prevalence of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in host-seeking Ixodes ricinus from 29 localities in Sweden and compare our data with those of neighbouring countries. Nymphs and adult ticks were screened for TBEV using a real-time PCR assay. The mean TBEV prevalence for all tick stages combined was 0. 26 % for Sweden and 0. 28 % for all Scandinavian countries, excluding Iceland. The low prevalence of TBEV in nature may partly be {{explained by the fact that}} TBEV occurs in spatially small foci and that the inclusion of ticks from non-infected foci will reduce the prevalence estimate. In the third and fourth study, we conducted the first large-scale investigations to estimate the prevalence and geographical distribution of Anaplasma spp. and Rickettsia spp. in host-seeking larvae, nymphs and adults of I. ricinus ticks in Sweden. Ticks were collected from several localities in central and southern Sweden and were subsequently screened for the presence of Anaplasma spp. and Rickettsia spp. using a real-time PCR assay. For all active tick stages combined, the mean prevalence of Anaplasma spp. and Rickettsia spp. in I. ricinus in Sweden was estimated to 1. 1 % and 4. 8 %, respectively.

40|$|Polymer nanocomposites {{based on}} a {{synthetic}} layered silicate and polyamide- 12 (PA- 12) are prepared by injection molding to study their morphology, {{and the influence of}} nanofiller particles on local deformation processes. One of the most striking results from morphological studies by transmission electron microscopy is that although the layered silicates, locally stacked in the PA- 12 matrix, are arranged on planes parallel to the injection molding direction, the fine lamellae are oriented with their planes perpendicular to the injection molding direction owing to nucleation at the interface between layered silicate and polymer matrix. The dispersion of layered silicates and the orientation of lamellae are reflected in the complexity of the deformation mechanisms, which in turn determine the ultimate macroscopic properties. From studies of in situ deformation under the high voltage electron microscope, it is concluded that the main deformation mechanism is microvoid formation inside the stacks of layered silicates. According to the orientation of these stacks the applied energy is dissipated by <b>splitting,</b> <b>opening</b> or sliding of separate bundles in the stacks during deformation. The nanofiller particles are load-bearing because surfaces in the microvoids are connected and hinder further growth of the microvoids, thus preventing catastrophic failure. As a consequence, the stiffness/strength/toughness balance has been synergistically improved. Finally, based on the present experimental results, a molecular network in polymer nanocomposites is proposed, that leads to the desired superfunctional characteristics.

All large waka had names and were objects of pride and admiration. The image above shows a waka taua with unusually high freeboard. A noticeable feature of a loaded waka taua was its very low freeboard of 400-500 mm which made the vessel unseaworthy in all but good weather, despite the presence of one or two young men on board dedicated to bailing.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the MSE effects on the midpalatal and pterygopalatine sutures in late adolescents, using high-resolution CBCT. Specific aims are to define the magnitude and sagittal parallelism of midpalatal suture opening, to measure the extent of transverse asymmetry of split, and to illustrate the possibility of splitting the pterygopalatine suture. Methods Fifteen subjects (mean age of 17. 2  years; range, 13. 9 – 26. 2  years) were treated with MSE. Pre- and post-treatment CBCT exams were taken and superimposed. A novel methodology based on three new reference planes was utilized to analyze the sutural changes. Parameters were compared from pre- to post-treatment and between genders non-parametrically using the Wilcoxon sign rank test. For the frequency of openings in {{the lower part of the}} pterygopalatine suture, the Fisher’s exact test was used. Results Regarding the magnitude of midpalatal suture <b>opening,</b> the <b>split</b> at anterior nasal spine (ANS) and at posterior nasal spine (PNS) was 4. 8 and 4. 3  mm, respectively. The amount of split at PNS was 90 % of that at ANS, showing that the opening of the midpalatal suture was almost perfectly parallel antero-posteriorly. On average, one half of the anterior nasal spine (ANS) moved more than the contralateral one by 1. 1  mm. Openings between the lateral and medial plates of the pterygoid process were detectable in 53 % of the sutures (P <  0. 05). No significant differences were found in the magnitude and frequency of suture opening between males and females. Correlation between age and suture opening was negligible (R 2 range, 0. 3 – 4. 2 %). Conclusions Midpalatal suture was successfully split by MSE in late adolescents, and the opening was almost perfectly parallel in a sagittal direction. Regarding the extent of transverse asymmetry of the split, on average one half of ANS moved more than the contralateral one by 1. 1  mm. Pterygopalatine suture was split in its lower region by MSE, as the pyramidal process was pulled out from the pterygoid process. Patient gender and age had a negligible influence on suture opening for the age group considered in the study...|$|R
