25|$|Although {{the term}} was not coined until the early 1980s, some couples prior to that point have been {{retrospectively}} termed supercouples; for example, Jeff Baker and Penny Hughes and Bob and Lisa Hughes, from As the World Turns. Doug Williams and Julie Olson from Days of <b>Our</b> <b>Lives</b> <b>are</b> sometimes considered the first supercouple. From 1970 until 1976, Doug and Julie's relationship wavers between love and hate. The chemistry the portrayers exhibited became evident offscreen; the real-life couple, Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth, were married in 1974. This set off a commotion among thousands of fans, who wrote letters to the show asking that the couple also be allowed to marry in the story. Since the actors were already married, they felt this was a valid request. NBC worked the tension and lengthened the anticipation of the wedding but eventually caved into the audience's pressure. Doug and Julie are married in October 1976 within the series. They are the first soap opera characters {{to appear on the}} cover of Time.|$|E

500|$|The Fountains {{theme of}} fear of death is [...] "a {{movement}} from darkness into light, from black to white" [...] that traces the journey of a man scared of death and moving toward it. The film begins with a paraphrase of Genesis 3:24, the Biblical passage that reflects The Fall of Man. Hugh Jackman {{emphasized the importance of}} the Fall in the film: [...] "The moment Adam and Eve ate of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, humans started to experience life as we all experience it now, which is life and death, poor and wealthy, pain and pleasure, good and evil. We {{live in a world of}} duality. Husband, wife, we relate everything. And much of <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> <b>are</b> spent not wanting to die, be poor, experience pain. It's what the movie's about." [...] Aronofsky also interpreted the story of Genesis as the definition of mortality for humanity. He inquired of the Fall, [...] "If they had drank from the Tree of Life [...] what would have separated them from their maker? So what makes us human is actually death. It's what makes us special." ...|$|E

Letters to Irvine in June 2001 had complained about the Human Rights Act and were critical of the [...] "degree to which <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> <b>are</b> becoming ruled by a truly absurd degree of politically correct interference". Charles also complained to Irvine that the United Kingdom was [...] "sliding inexorably down the slope of ever increasing, petty-minded litigiousness" [...] and wrote in 2002 about [...] "ever-more prescriptive laws - for example, health and safety at work legislation, the blame culture...and the bureaucratic red tape which accompanies new rules".|$|E

2500|$|On {{the subject}} of suicide, Hauerwas {{challenges}} the claim that autonomous suicide is morally acceptable, but also wants to distinguish himself from the position that denies rational suicide. He believes that suicide can be and often is a rational decision of an “autonomous” agent, but does {{not agree with the}} notion that it is justified. He contends that suicide as an institution must be considered morally doubtful, as the life that we are given should be considered a gift bestowed upon us by God. To many, the term [...] "rational suicide" [...] {{is based on the assumption}} that the decision to live or die depends on whether life has a meaning or purpose. Hauerwas, however, contends that the reason we should live on, is because <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> <b>are</b> not ours, and as such, reminds us that there is a commitment to keep on living. Yet, while there may be times in our lives where suicide may seem rational, mere existence allows us to enjoy certain joys, such as helping another, or healing the sick, that should be enough to sustain our commitment to living.|$|E
