While initially only FIM 280 million was reserved for the new icebreaker, this was later increased by FIM 23 million as the planned vessel proved to be more expensive than expected. While an <b>open</b> <b>call</b> for bids was arranged by the Board of Navigation as dictated by the European Union rules, only Finnyards and Kværner Masa-Yards, another Finnish shipyard, sent in their tenders, and Finnyards won the contract because of shorter delivery time. The new multipurpose icebreaker was to be delivered in March–April 1998. Also designed by ILS, the new vessel resembles the older Finnish multipurpose icebreakers, but is slightly smaller, less powerful and has open-propeller Azipod units instead of Aquamasters with ducted propellers as the latter had proved to be problematic in ice.|$|E

A political rally was held in Borovo Selo on 14 April, {{and by the end of}} the month the situation had become more volatile. Speakers at the rally—Serbian Radical Party (Srpska radikalna stranka – SRS) leader Vojislav Šešelj, Serbian National Assembly member Milan Paroški and Serbian Minister of Diaspora Stanko Cvijan—promoted the creation of Greater Serbia, a state which would unite all Serbs within a single country.

Similar to the [...] "National Song Contest" [...] that Ireland adopted until 2001, the contest not only took song quality into account, but also visual presentation and proposed performance details. Three judges were present at the contest, giving their views on the songs, as well as their personal opinions.

500|$|Lovato was {{discovered}} by Disney Channel during an <b>open</b> <b>call</b> audition {{in her hometown of}} Dallas, Texas and made her debut on the short series As the Bell Rings in 2007. She subsequently auditioned for a role on the television series Jonas, but did not get the part. Instead, she received the main role in the musical film Camp Rock after singing for the network executives. Later, she auditioned for a role on the series Sonny with a Chance, which she also received. Lovato enlisted the Jonas Brothers, her Camp Rock co-stars, to work with her on her debut studio album, Don't Forget (2008). The writing began during the filming of Camp Rock in 2007 and continued on the band's Look Me in the Eyes Tour in 2008.

500|$|To {{create the}} {{impression}} that the events of Project X had actually happened, the producers decided against casting known faces, but to find completely new actors. [...] Phillips stated that the goal of the <b>open</b> <b>call</b> was to cast [...] "unknown actors" [...] and [...] "real people of all ethnicities," [...] who would not normally be given a chance to star in a film. Phillips and producer Joel Silver decided to create a nationwide open casting call, allowing any United States resident over the age of 18 to audition for Project X through a specially created website. Actors were required to provide videos of themselves telling embarrassing or funny stories, or dancing. However, traditional casting was still employed to allow actors with little professional acting credits to audition. The process allowed traits of the selected actors to be incorporated into their characters, including in several cases, their respective characters taking the actors' names. In casting the three leads, the production avoided solo casting and instead had a group of three actors auditioning together, switching out and adding different actors to see which group worked best together.|$|E
500|$|Lansbury was {{offended}} by [...] his party's lukewarm support for women's rights.

He was further disillusioned by [...] his party's failure to endorse the eight-hour maximum working day. Lansbury had formed the [...] view, expressed some years later, [...] that [...] "Liberalism would progress just {{as far as the}} great money bags of capitalism would allow it to progress". By 1892 the Liberals no longer felt like Lansbury's political home; most of his current associates were avowed socialists: William Morris, Eleanor Marx, John Burns and Henry Mayers Hyndman, founder of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). Nevertheless, Lansbury did not resign from the Liberals until he had fulfilled a commitment to act as election [...] agent for John Murray MacDonald, the prospective Liberal candidate for Bow and Bromley. He [...] saw his candidate victorious in the July 1892 General Election; as soon as the result was declared, Lansbury resigned from the Liberal Party and joined the SDF.|$|E
