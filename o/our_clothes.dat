The cross had been erected during the Orange Revolution of 2004–2005, to commemorate victims of Stalin's repression. The desecration of the cross was repudiated by Maria Alyokhina of Pussy Riot, who said [...] "Their surprise displays and protests against authoritarianism are similar to us, but we look at feminism differently, especially the form of speech.

The instrumentation is provided by a keyboard, synthesizers, percussion and a drum machine. According to Nadeska Alexis of MTVs Rapfix, Brown sings in a falsetto tone, which she found to be reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush described the ballad as [...] "very Michael Jackson and neo-Bieber". JusMusic of Singersroom noted that [...] "Sweet Love" [...] is inspired by Silk's [...] "Freak Me" [...] (1993).

The theme of [...] "Sweet Love" [...] revolves around sex. It contains lyrics about Brown asking his lover to take off her clothes {{so that they can}} have sex. During the chorus, he harmonizes: [...] "Oooh baby let's get naked / Just so we can make sweet love / All these sensations got me going crazy for you / Inside on top of you / Grinding inside and out of you / Baby I know what to do / Let's just take <b>our</b> <b>clothes</b> off".|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers {{considered}} Middlesex to {{be overly}} verbose. The Economist described the novel as [...] "ponderous" [...] {{and said that the}} main story (that of Cal) does not [...] "get off the ground until halfway through" [...] the book. Times Richard Lacayo concurred; he considered the hundreds of pages about Cal's grandparents and several historical events to be trite, making Middlesexs focus [...] "footloose" [...] in some spots. Several passages in the novel exhibit Eugenides' obsession with [...] "verbose voluptuousness". An example noted by Thea Hillman in her review is an incident in which Cal says, [...] "I sat in my seat, in a state of voluptuous agitation, of agitated voluptuousness, until my stop. Then I staggered out." [...] A contrary opinion is given by Daniel Soar in his article for the London Review of Books. According to Soar, Eugenides did [...] "both background and foreground in all the necessary detail", seamlessly shifting from past to present. Despite the implausible tone of the novel's events, the author successfully makes them [...] "elaborately justified and motivated". The quality of Middlesexs writing was uneven in the opinions of Hillman and another reviewer, Sebastian Smee. The latter pointed out that Eugenides occasionally moves from the heartfelt ("I remember the first time we took off <b>our</b> <b>clothes</b> in front of each other. It was like unwinding bandages") to the [...] "trashily journalistic" [...] ("You've heard of installation artists? Well, the Object [...] was an exhalation artist") on several occasions.|$|E

She is very exacting and a professional who seeks perfection in everything she does, and this was no exception.

He didn't come from a wealthy family, but from a stable middle-class background, probably a lot like mine. He had a great mother {{and there was always}} a warm feeling of family loyalty.

He informed that they were guarded, by soldiers from the Baltic provinces. [...] “They treat us like comrades, and have not locked our cells after the second day, while they allow us to walk in the small garden in the courtyard. Our food is brought from outside. ” [...] While imprisoned, rumors of the tsar's assassination reached them; this seemed to indicate the worst and Grand Duke George was, of the three Grand Dukes, the more pessimistic. On 21 July, all of the exiled Grand Dukes in Vologda were again transferred back to Petrograd. In the former Imperial capital, the men were quickly imprisoned with six other detainees in a cell at Cheka Headquarters.|$|E

Transgressing social codes Gaultier frequently introduces the skirt into his men′s wear collections {{as a means}} of injecting novelty into male attire, most famously the sarong seen on David Beckham. Other famous designers such as Vivienne Westwood, \Giorgio Armani, John Galliano, Kenzo, Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto also created men's skirts. In the US Marc Jacobs became the most prominent supporter of the skirt for men. The Milan men′s fashion shows and the New York fashion shows frequently show skirts for men. Jonathan Davis, the lead singer of Korn, has been known to wear kilts at live shows and in music videos throughout his 18-year career with that band. Mick Jagger from the Rolling Stones and Anthony Kiedis from the Red Hot Chili Peppers were photographed wearing dresses by Anton Corbijn. For an FCKH8 antidicrimmination campaign Iggy Pop was seen wearing a black dress and handbag. Guns N' Roses' singer, Axl Rose, was known to wear men's skirts during the Use Your Illusion period. Robbie Williams and Martin Gore from Depeche Mode also performed on stage in skirts. During his Berlin time (1984–1985) Martin Gore was often seen in public wearing skirts. In an interview with the Pop Special Magazin (7/1985) he said: „Sexual barriers and gender roles are old fashioned and out. [...] I and my girlfriend often share <b>our</b> <b>clothes</b> and Make-up“. Brand Nubian Lord Jamar criticized Kanye West wearing skirts, saying that his style has no place in hip-hop.|$|E

All this time the schooner was hanging by the anchor, with her stern just clear of the rocks, and the surf was beginning to break in heavily.
