25|$|It is {{not from}} the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect <b>our</b> <b>dinner,</b> but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their {{humanity}} but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.|$|E

2500|$|Ullman, who {{had been}} living an upper-middle class life, was uprooted to Hackbridge, {{southwest}} London, along with her older sister Patti and her mother, who could now barely make ends meet without their father's income. [...] "After [...] died, our fortunes came and went because Mum couldn’t speak Polish and {{had to give up}} the business." [...] Mother Dorin would go on to take a host of odd jobs. [...] "My mother was always doing strange things like driving parts around for a garage, all covered in oil and paid 10 pounds a week. But she was very funny, and our defence against hardship was having a great sense of humour." [...] On a separate occasion, on the subject of her mother's jobs, Ullman recalled: [...] " [...] worked in a laboratory, testing food, and would bring home samples for <b>our</b> <b>dinner.</b> Sometimes she'd have to report that formula X had been found unfit for human consumption." [...] Despite reality, their mother maintained that they were middle-class. [...] "My mother always insisted on middle-class because we had money at one time. We're really lower-middle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All the same," [...] said Dorothy, [...] "I'm mighty {{glad you}} could make this tent appear, with <b>our</b> <b>dinners</b> and beds all ready for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Even blundering DOODLE-DUM-DEY Was insensible quite {{to their}} leers, And said good little TOOTLE-TUM-TEH, [...] "It's your blood we desire, pretty dears-- We have come for <b>our</b> <b>dinners,</b> my dears!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They were quitting {{work all}} round the settlement; {{one or two}} outfits would get off soon after us. We made pretty good time over the Allinson trail. But I guess <b>our</b> <b>dinner's</b> ready." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>dinner</b> was over. Both Mabane {{and myself}} had {{declined}} dessert. Our host rose.|$|E
60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>dinner</b> was {{a curious}} one, some potted beef and cold green corn, washed {{down with a}} cup of cold water.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, if {{you will}} please make {{yourself}} comfortable," [...] continued the pussy, in a soft, purring voice, [...] "I will get <b>our</b> <b>dinner</b> ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} his watch, lifting it close to his face to see the time. His voice changed. [...] "Well--if you provoke a man enough, you see he makes speeches. Let it be a lesson to you, Amanda. Here we are talking {{instead of going to}} <b>our</b> <b>dinners.</b> The car has been waiting ten minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nowt," [...] Bill Haden said. [...] "We {{have got}} <b>our</b> <b>dinners</b> wi' us, and might make 'em last, a mouthful at a time, to keep life in {{us for a}} week or more. But what 'ud be th' use of it? It may be weeks--ay, or months--before they can stifle the fire and make their way here." ...|$|R
40|$|Salads {{have become}} an almost {{indispensable}} part of our luncheons as well as <b>our</b> <b>dinners,</b> {{not only as a}} salad course, but as a dessert and a main dish as well. The more elaborate salads are ideal main dishes for luncheons or buffet suppers. Many people also favor salads because they are easily prepared, and because of their nutritive value and wholesome palatability...|$|R
6000|$|One day the princesses {{said to the}} king, 'Dear father, we want so much to have a picnic, and eat <b>our</b> <b>dinner</b> in the country.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} have <b>our</b> <b>dinner</b> first, Godfrey. Then I {{can go on}} {{steadily}} with these fomentations while you take your gun and look round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Major!" [...] cried Patsy, suddenly. [...] "There's Danny Reeves's restaurant. Let's get off {{and have}} <b>our</b> <b>dinner</b> now; I'm as hungry as a bear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{understanding}} you are!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Do you know, although I love <b>our</b> <b>dinners</b> here, I {{sometimes feel}} as though this room were a little cage, a little {{corner of the world}} across the threshold of which you had drawn a chalk line, so that no one of your world or mine might enter. The coming of Mr. Thain was almost like an earthquake." ...|$|R
60|$|To-day saw Ward. His uncle [2] is dying, and W. don't much {{affect our}} Dutch determinations. I dine {{with him on}} Thursday, {{provided}} l'oncle is not dined upon, or peremptorily bespoke by the posthumous epicures before that day. I wish he may recover--not for <b>our</b> <b>dinner's</b> sake, but to disappoint the undertaker, and the rascally reptiles that may well wait, since they will dine at last.|$|R
5000|$|Such experiences, however, were {{offset by}} others less wholesome. In Saybrook, where Madam Knight {{stopped for a}} mid-day dinner, she complained of the landlady: “Shee told us shee had some mutton wch shee would broil, wch I was glad to hear; … but it being pickled and my Guide said it smelt strong of head sause, we left it, and pd sixpence apiece for <b>our</b> <b>Dinners,</b> wch was only smell.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There, Joan," [...] he said, as {{he entered}} the house, [...] "is a nice little duck for <b>our</b> <b>dinner.</b> Do you now think your husband cannot shoot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Meanwhile," [...] Van Teyl observed, {{putting his}} paper away, [...] "we are {{neglecting}} <b>our</b> <b>dinner.</b> Nothing {{like a good}} dose of sensationalism for giving us an appetite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe, yer honor," [...] Tim said doubtfully; [...] "but I mind me that, when I was a boy, me and {{my brother}} Peter was {{throwing}} sods at an old tomcat of my mother's, who had stolen <b>our</b> <b>dinners,</b> and it ran up a wall ten feet high. Well, yer honor, the tiger is as big as a hundred tomcats, and by the same token he {{ought to be able to}} run up a wall--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{taken us}} up, then," [...] said my lady; [...] "it's {{very kind of}} her, and I dare say we shall like it when we git used to it, only at first one don't fancy being took--well, taken up, at all. She {{is going to give}} our balls for us; and wants to invite all <b>our</b> <b>dinners.</b> But I won't stand that. I will have my old friends and I won't let her send all the cards out, and sit mum at the head of my own table. You must come to me, Arthur and Major--come, let me see, on the 14th.--It ain't one of <b>our</b> grand <b>dinners,</b> Blanche," [...] she said, looking round at her daughter, who bit her lips and frowned very savagely for a sylphide.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty cold, but we {{have plenty}} of wood, and we are used to snow and gales up here. We often coast down, the whole lot of us, and that is great fun. We take <b>our</b> <b>dinners</b> and have games noon-spells, and so we get on first rate; some of my boys are big fellows, older than I am, and they clear the roads and make the fire and look after us, and we are real happy together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he won't. Nor will <b>our</b> <b>dinner.</b> Mrs. Beale always {{lets the}} kitchen fire {{out during the}} afternoon. And how she's going to light it with that----" ...|$|E

60|$|When we had {{finished}} <b>our</b> <b>dinner,</b> Mrs. Lecks pushed back her chair, and {{sat for a}} few moments in thought, as was her wont before saying anything of importance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} would {{brighten}} things up," [...] said Dora. [...] "It's <b>our</b> first <b>dinner</b> together since--since--you know," [...] and she blushed prettily.|$|R
6000|$|In truth, {{it was a}} merry little feast. We {{had gone}} without <b>our</b> <b>dinners,</b> in order to [...] "save our appetites," [...] and we did ample justice to Felicity's good things. Paddy sat on the Pulpit Stone and watched us with great yellow eyes, knowing that tidbits would come his way later on. Many witty things were said--or at least we thought them witty--and uproarious was the laughter. Never had the old King orchard known a blither merrymaking or lighter hearts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly. We {{have found}} one unknown friend, who {{supplied}} us with <b>our</b> <b>dinners.</b> There is no absolute {{reason why we}} should not find one who would supply us with means of escape. There must be {{a great number of}} people who sympathize with us, and whose hearts are with King James. I have seen several men come from the market, stand and look up at this prison, and then walk off, slowly, as if they were filled with pity for us. Now, I propose that one of us shall always be at the window." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Kitty eats everything,' was the placid answer, 'and I do {{not think}} we can blame Ellen, for she often comes down after <b>our</b> <b>dinner</b> to find {{something}} for the nursery supper.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{have but}} a {{shoulder}} of mutton with onion sauce,' said Mrs Crummles, {{in the same}} charnel-house voice; 'but such as <b>our</b> <b>dinner</b> is, we beg you to partake of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|When our hasty {{meal was}} concluded, {{and the wine}} placed on the table, the {{domestic}} informed us, [...] "that Mr. Rashleigh had desired to be told when <b>our</b> <b>dinner</b> was removed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A groom!" [...] exclaimed Myra, with an elfish laugh; [...] "I believe, if {{the truth}} were really known, {{we ought to be}} making our own beds and washing <b>our</b> own <b>dinner</b> plates." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't {{you come}} to dinner with me?" [...] asked Lawson. [...] "Mrs. Wilcox, some artist friends, and I are messing over {{in one of the}} old quarters, and <b>our</b> mid-day <b>dinner</b> is waiting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{think that}} we have been very considerate, Mr. Brooks," [...] Selina remarked, with an {{engaging}} smile. [...] "We gave up <b>our</b> usual <b>dinner</b> this evening as papa had to leave so early." ...|$|R
