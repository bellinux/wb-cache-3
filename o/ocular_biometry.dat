40|$|Myopia is {{a serious}} health problem that has reached {{epidemic}} levels in Asian cities such as Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore. However, {{there is a lack}} of cross-sectional and longitudinal data on refractive error and <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> in young adults, especially in Singapore. Despite the high prevalence of myopia in Singapore, vision-related quality of life (VRQOL) is also inadequately examined. This longitudinal study sets out to examine the refraction, <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> and VRQOL over a 24 -month period. Participants were recruited from the student pool of a tertiary education institution. Subjective refraction, <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry,</b> and accommodative response measurements were performed for participants. The NEI-RQL- 42 questionnaire and a bespoke questionnaire were completed by participants. Out of 99 participants (age range 16 to 22 year) at the baseline visit, 86. 8 % were myopic. The age of initial refractive correction was significantly associated with refractive error, while near work, sports activities, outdoor activities, accommodative responses, and primary school leaving examinations were not. Among the 88 participants who completed the 24 month visit, the percentage of myopes remained stable, with no increase in myopia. Ocular biometric parameters also remained stable, with only a non-clinically significant increase of 0. 02 mm in axial length. Non-Myopes exhibited the highest VRQOL, while Mod/High-Myopes had the lowest VRQOL. Myopia and contact lens wear were found to be the main contributors towards poorer VRQOL. VRQOL remained stable over the 24 month period, with the exception that moderate and high myopes exhibited an improvement in VRQOL on their dependence of correction. In conclusion, this study presented novel findings on stable refraction and <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> in Singapore young adults over a 24 month period, which was contrary to previous findings on university students. In addition, VRQOL remained unchanged over a 24 month period, where myopia and contact lens wear were found to cause poorer VRQOL in participants...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between objectively measured ambient light exposure and longitudinal changes in axial eye growth in childhood. METHODS A total of 101 children (41 myopes and 60 nonmyopes), 10 to 15 years of age participated in this prospective longitudinal observational study. Axial eye growth was determined from measurements of <b>ocular</b> optical <b>biometry</b> collected at four study visits over an 18 -month period. Each child’s mean daily light exposure was derived from two periods (each 14 days long) of objective light exposure measurements from a wrist-worn light sensor. RESULTS Over the 18 -month study period, a modest but statistically significant association between greater average daily light exposure and slower axial eye growth was observed (P ¼ 0. 047). Other significant predictors of axial eye growth in this population included children’s refractive error group (P < 0. 001), sex (P < 0. 01), and age (P < 0. 001). Categorized according to their objectively measured average daily light exposure and adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, baseline axial length, parental myopia, nearwork, and physical activity), children experiencing low average daily light exposure (mean daily light exposure: 459 6 117 lux, annual eye growth: 0. 13 mm/y) exhibited significantly greater eye growth than children experiencing moderate (842 6 109 lux, 0. 060 mm/y), and high (1455 6 317 lux, 0. 065 mm/y) average daily light exposure levels (P ¼ 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS In this population of children, greater daily light exposure was associated with less axial eye growth over an 18 -month period.

40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} ocular {{response}} to silicone-hydrogel (SiH) contact lens wear, {{a relatively new}} contact lens material that has a higher modulus of rigidity and different surface coating than used in conventional hydrogel materials. The properties of SiH materials differ significantly from conventional hydrogels and, using subjective and objective means of assessment, the thesis examines how these properties affect reflection and <b>biometry,</b> <b>ocular</b> physiology, tear film characteristics, symptomatology, adverse events and complications. A range of standard and newly designed investigative techniques were employed, and latter involving novel imaging techniques, for the objective assessment of physiological changes which occur with contact lens wear. The study {{is the first to}} combine these techniques with biochemical analyses of the tear film composition. Forty-seven subjects were fitted with SiH lenses and randomly allocated to one of the two materials currently on the market (Lotrafilcon A or Balafilcon A) on an either daily or continuous wear basis. An additional control group of 14 age-matched non-contact lens wearers were monitored over the same period. Measurements were taken before and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after initial fitting. The findings reported in this thesis will enable contact lens practitioners and manufacturers to understand further the optical, physiological and biochemical nature of the ocular response to SiH contact lenses and hence facilitate the development of this important generation of contact lens material.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effects of {{incorporating}} individual <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> measures of corneal curvature, refractive error, and axial length on scan length obtained using Spectralis spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Methods Two SD-OCT scans were acquired for 50 eyes of 50 healthy participants, first using the Spectralis default keratometry (K) setting followed by incorporating individual mean-K values. Resulting scan lengths were compared to predicted scan lengths produced by image simulation software, based on individual <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> measures including axial length. Results Axial length varied from 21. 41 to 29. 04 mm. Spectralis SD-OCT scan lengths obtained with default-K ranged from 5. 7 to 7. 3 mm, and with mean-K from 5. 6 to 7. 6 mm. We report a stronger correlation of simulated scan lengths incorporating the subject’s mean-K value (ρ[*]=[*] 0. 926, P[*]<[*] 0. 0005) compared to Spectralis default settings (ρ[*]=[*] 0. 663, P[*]<[*] 0. 0005). Conclusions Ocular magnification appears to be better accounted for when individual mean-K values are incorporated into Spectralis SD-OCT scan acquisition versus using the device’s default-K setting.

40|$|Purpose. This study reports {{data from}} an 18 -month {{longitudinal}} study of neophyte contact lens wearers and compares changes in <b>ocular</b> refraction and <b>biometry</b> induced by daily wear and continuous wear of two different silicone hydrogel (SiH) materials. Methods. Forty-five subjects {{were enrolled in the}} study and randomly assigned to wear one of the two silicone hydrogel materials: Lotrafilcon A or Balafilcon A lenses on either a daily or continuous wear basis. Measurements of objective refraction, axial length, anterior chamber depth, corneal curvature, and the rate of peripheral corneal flattening were performed before and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after initial fitting. Results. Mean spherical equivalent refractive error increased in the myopic direction in all contact lens groups across time (p < 0. 001). Axial length was the main biometric contributor to the development of myopia. After 18 months of lens wear, subjects in the Lotrafilcon A group showed the greater mean increase in myopia (i. e., - 0. 50 D). Conclusions. The results of this study show that increases in myopia, similar if not higher than those found to occur normally in young adult noncontact lens wearers, still occur with silicone hydrogel contact lens wear. The main biometric contributor to the progression of myopia was an increase in axial length. Differences between our results and those of previous studies with silicone hydrogel contact lenses could be attributed to the differing populations used in which both age and occupation may have played a role.

Methods: In a population-based cross-sectional ophthalmic survey of 2418 adults (≥ 40 years old) living in the rural villages in central Myanmar, height and weight were measured using a standardized protocol, and body mass index was calculated. Non-cycloplegic refraction and corneal curvature were determined by an autorefractor. Ultrasound pachymetry was performed and <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry,</b> including axial length, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness and vitreous chamber length were measured using A-mode ocular ultrasonography. Results: Height and weight were significantly correlated with age, gender and all the ocular biometric parameters, except lens thickness. After adjusting for age and gender, taller and heavier persons had eyes with longer axial length, deeper anterior and vitreous chambers, and flatter and thicker corneas than shorter persons. Height was not significantly correlated with refraction, and heavier persons tended to be less myopic (P < 0. 001). Multivariate linear regression models revealed consistent results with the findings for association between height, weight and <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> and refractive error.

Methods: The study was a prospective cross-sectional comparative study of different techniques of <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> from diagnostic equipment (biometry probe 10  MHz Sonomed® A-scan (PACSCAN 300 A, USA). Measurement variables were obtained among children and adults undergoing cataract surgery.

Their ages ranged from 18 to 95 years with a mean of 64. 7 (SD ±  12. 9) years. There were 55 (59. 8 %) males and 37 (40. 2 %) females, with a male to female ratio of 1. 5 : 1. Average axial length (22. 0 – 24. 4  mm) eyes were the most common eyes measured in 75 (81. 5 %) of the cases. The means of the axial lengths biometry values with immersion and contact technique were 23. 66 (± 1. 36) and 23. 46  mm (± 1. 46); the axial length differences was 0. 2  ±  0. 26  mm (range 0. 0 – 0. 94  mm) and statistically significant (95 % CI of the Difference 0. 15 to 0. 26, p =  0. 000).

MethodsIn this prospective interventional case series, 21 primary angle closure suspects were enrolled. Intraocular pressure, refraction, <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> (Lenstar, LS 900), and anterior chamber parameters (Pentacam HR) were measured at four occasions: before PI (before and after mydriasis with phenylephrine) and two weeks after PI (before and after mydriasis). The study was conducted on both eyes and only one eye per patient, in random, was included in the analysis. ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 60 ± 7 years and 17 (81 %) were female. There were no significant differences in intraocular pressure, refraction, keratometry, biometric and anterior chamber parameters between groups, except for anterior chamber volume, which showed increments with PI and mydriasis. The corresponding values for anterior chamber volume were as follows: 88. 2 ± 13. 7 mm 3 before PI, undilated; 106. 3 ± 18. 8 before PI, dilated; 99. 0 ± 14. 6 after PI, undilated, and 107. 4 ± 16. 5 after PI, dilated (P< 0. 001).

SettingSiriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. DesignProspective comparative study. MethodsOne hundred eyes from 100 cataract patients were enrolled in this study. Each patient was measured with 2 optical biometers, a newer swept-source optical biometer (IOLMaster 700) and a standard partial coherence interferometry biometer (IOLMaster 500) by 2 independent operators. The keratometry, axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth, white-to-white corneal diameter, and intraocular lens (IOL) power, calculated by the SRK/T and the Haigis formulas for each device, were recorded. Intraoperator repeatability and interoperator reproducibility of both devices were analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Agreement of <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> and IOL power between the 2 devices was evaluated using the Bland-Altman method. ResultsThe repeatability and reproducibility of the swept-source and standard biometers were high for all <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> parameters (ICC, 0. 93 - 1. 00). The agreement between the 2 biometers was also high (ICC, 0. 92 - 1. 00). The IOL powers obtained from both devices were not distinct. Because of {{the density of the}} cataracts, the AL in 5 eyes could be measured only by the swept-source biometer.

Random clustering sampling was used to identify adults aged 50 years and above in Xuhui and Baoshan districts of Shanghai. Refraction was determined by subjective refraction that achieved the best corrected vision based on monocular measurement. <b>Ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> was measured by IOL Master. The crystalline lens power of right eyes was calculated using modified Bennett-Rabbetts formula. We analyzed 6099 normal phakic right eyes. The mean crystalline lens power was 20. 34 ± 2. 24 D (range: 13. 40 - 36. 08). Lens power, spherical equivalent, and anterior chamber depth changed linearly with age; however, axial length, corneal power and AL/CR ratio did not vary with age. The overall prevalence of hyperopia, myopia, and high myopia was 48. 48 % (95 % CI: 47. 23 %- 49. 74 %), 22. 82 % (95 % CI: 21. 77 %- 23. 88 %), and 4. 57 % (95 % CI: 4. 05 - 5. 10), respectively.

40|$|Background: A new commercially {{available}} optical low coherence reflectometry device (Lenstar, Haag-Streit or Allegro Biograph, Wavelight) provides high-resolution non-contact measurements of <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry.</b> The study evaluates {{the validity and}} repeatability of these measurements compared with current clinical instrumentation. Method: Measurements were taken with the LenStar and IOLMaster on 112 patients aged 41 – 96 years listed for cataract surgery. A subgroup of 21 patients also had A-scan applanation ultrasonography (OcuScan) performed. Intersession repeatability of the LenStar measurements was assessed on 32 patients Results: LenStar measurements of white-to-white were similar to the IOLMaster (average difference 0. 06 (SD 0. 03) D; p?=? 0. 305); corneal curvature measurements were similar to the IOLMaster (average difference - 0. 04 (0. 20) D; p?=? 0. 240); anterior chamber depth measurements were significantly longer than the IOLMaster (by 0. 10 (0. 40) mm) and ultrasound (by 0. 32 (0. 62) mm; p< 0. 001); crystalline lens thickness measurements were similar to ultrasound (difference 0. 16 (0. 83) mm, p?=? 0. 382); axial length measurements were significantly longer than the IOLMaster (by 0. 01 (0. 02) mm) but shorter than ultrasound (by 0. 14 (0. 15) mm; p< 0. 001). The LensStar was unable to take measurements due to dense media opacities in a similar number of patients to the IOLMaster (9 – 10 %). The LenStar biometric measurements {{were found to be}} highly repeatable (variability = 2 % of average value). Conclusions: Although there were some statistical differences between <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> measurements between the LenStar and current clinical instruments, they were not clinically significant. LenStar measurements were highly repeatable and the instrument easy to use...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{models of}} the human eye {{have been used in}} visual science for {{purposes}} such as providing a framework for explaining optical phenomena in vision, for predicting how refraction and aberrations are affected by change in <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry,</b> and as having computational tools for exploring the limitations imposed on vision by the optical system of the eye. We address the issue of what is understood by optical model eyes, discussing the “encyclopedia” and “toy train” approaches to modelling. An extensive list of purposes of models is provided. We discuss many of the theoretical types of optical models (also schematic eyes) of varying anatomical accuracy, including single, three and four refracting surface variants. We cover the models with lens structure in the form of nested shells and gradient index. Many optical eye models give accurate predictions only for small angles and small fields of view; if aberrations and image quality are important to consider, such paraxial model eyes must be replaced by finite model eyes incorporating features such as aspheric surfaces, tilts and decentrations, wavelength-dependent media and curved retinas. Many optical model eyes are population averages, and must become adaptable to account for age, gender, ethnicity, refractive error and accommodation. They can also be customised for the individual when extensive <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> and optical performance data are available. We consider which optical model should be used for a particular purpose, adhering to the principle that the best model is the simplest fit for the task. We provide a glimpse into the future of optical {{models of the}} human eye. This review is interwoven with historical developments, highlighting the important people who have contributed so richly to our understanding of visual optics...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} the recruitment, ophthalmic examination methods {{and distribution of}} <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> {{of participants in the}} Norfolk Island Eye Study, who were individuals descended from the English Bounty mutineers and their Polynesian wives. Methods: All 1, 275 permanent residents of Norfolk Island aged over 15 years were invited to participate, including 602 individuals involved in a 2001 cardiovascular disease study. Participants completed a detailed questionnaire and underwent a comprehensive eye assessment including stereo disc and retinal photography, ocular coherence topography and conjunctival autofluorescence assessment. Additionally, blood or saliva was taken for DNA testing. Results: 781 participants aged over 15 years were seen (54 % female), comprising 61 % of the permanent Island population. 343 people (43. 9 %) could trace their family history to the Pitcairn Islanders (Norfolk Island Pitcairn Pedigree). Mean anterior chamber depth was 3. 32 mm, mean axial length (AL) was 23. 5 mm, and mean central corneal thickness was 546 microns. There were no statistically significant differences in these characteristics between persons with and without Pitcairn Island ancestry. Mean intra-ocular pressure was lower in people with Pitcairn Island ancestry: 15. 89 mmHg compared to those without Pitcairn Island ancestry 16. 49 mmHg (P =. 007). The mean keratometry value was lower in people with Pitcairn Island ancestry (43. 22 vs. 43. 52, P =. 007). The corneas were flatter in people of Pitcairn ancestry but there was no corresponding difference in AL or refraction. Conclusion: Our study population is highly representative of the permanent population of Norfolk Island. <b>Ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> was similar to that of other white populations. Heritability estimates, linkage analysis and genome-wide studies will further elucidate the genetic determinants of chronic ocular diseases in this genetic isolate. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the in vivo ocular morphological and contractile changes occurring within the accommodative apparatus prior to the onset of presbyopia, with particular reference to ciliary muscle changes with age and the origin of a myopic shift in refraction during incipient presbyopia. Commissioned semi-automated software proved capable of extracting accurate and repeatable measurements from crystalline lens and ciliary muscle Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) images and reduced the subjectivity of AS-OCT image analysis. AS-OCT was utilised to document longitudinal changes in ciliary muscle morphology within an incipient presbyopic population (n= 51). A significant antero-inwards shift of ciliary muscle mass was observed after 2. 5 years. Furthermore, in a subgroup study (n= 20), an accommodative antero-inwards movement of ciliary muscle mass was evident. After 2. 5 years, the centripetal response of the ciliary muscle significantly attenuated during accommodation, whereas the antero-posterior mobility of the ciliary muscle remained invariant. Additionally, longitudinal measurement of <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> revealed a significant increase in crystalline lens thickness and a corresponding decrease in anterior chamber depth after 2. 5 years (n= 51). Lenticular changes appear to be determinant of changes in refraction during incipient presbyopia. During accommodation, a significant increase in crystalline lens thickness and axial length was observed, whereas anterior chamber depth decreased (n= 20). The change in <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> per dioptre of accommodation exerted remained invariant after 2. 5 years. Cross-sectional ocular biometric data were collected to quantify accommodative axial length changes from early adulthood to advanced presbyopia (n= 72). Accommodative axial length elongation significantly attenuated during presbyopia, which was consistent with a significant increase in ocular rigidity during presbyopia. The studies presented in this thesis support the Helmholtz theory of accommodation and despite the reduction in centripetal ciliary muscle contractile response with age, primarily implicate lenticular changes in the development of presbyopia...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 20 million {{cataract}} {{operations are}} performed per year worldwide, routinely removing the opaque cataractous lens and implanting an artificial intraocular lens (IOL). Modern technologies {{used to treat}} cataract are highly sophisticated and the operation involves remarkable skills; however the IOL power calculation in certain circumstances can be unsatisfactory. Currently the calculation of required IOL power is based on formulas developed from the paraxial geometrical optics equations and/or statistical analysis of retrospective cases. This work aims to improve upon the methodologies currently used to predict required IOL power, particularly for unusual eyes with extreme <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> (e. g. extreme axial length or corneal shape).

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the features of}} extrafoveal retinoschisis (EFRS) in highly myopic eyes detected by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). Methods: In this retrospective case series, 89 eyes of 65 patients with high myopia and coexisting EFRS were included. The participants underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity, <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry,</b> refraction, and perimetry. Three-dimensional wide-field scans were obtained with SS-OCT, and en face images were reconstructed with custom software. En face OCT features of EFRS were determined by two ophthalmologists masked to clinical characteristics. The associations of EFRS subtypes with <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> and other OCT changes were evaluated as well. Results: In wide-field SS-OCT scans, EFRS was classified into three different types, the inner limiting membrane (ILM) detachment and inner and outer EFRS, according to the specific layer of the splitting. All these three types were most frequently distributed in the inferotemporal quadrant (71. 2 % for ILM detachment, 59. 5 % for inner EFRS, and 75. 0 % for outer EFRS). Inner limiting membrane detachment and inner EFRS were often adjacent to peripapillary atrophy. Outer EFRS tends to coexist with inner EFRS, as {{we did not observe}} any case with standalone outer EFRS or with coexisting with ILM detachment. Eyes with all three types combined had the longest axial length (29. 1 ± 1. 26 mm, P = 0. 003) and the greatest refractive error (- 13. 0 ± 2. 86 diopters [D], P = 0. 014). The incidence of retinal microfolds and breaks among subgroups was significantly different (P = 0. 012 and 0. 003, respectively). Staphyloma was associated with outer EFRS (30. 6 % with versus 7. 6 % without outer EFRS). Conclusions: Wide-field SS-OCT reveals the spatial distribution of retinoschisis outside the fovea, and associations with retinal vessels and other retinal landmark structures. Further observations on the longitudinal changes and functional damage would help lead {{to a better understanding of}} its mechanism and prognosis. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E

It will also {{examine the relationship between}} myopia and potential modifiable risk factors and will assess potential gene-environment interactions by examining parents and siblings. Methods: The target population is a stratified random cluster sample of 1750 Year 1 (age 6 years) and 1500 Year 7 (age 12 years) students from Sydney metropolitan schools. Procedures (comprehensive parent-administered questionnaire and examination) involve standardized protocols to allow for comparison with international population-based data. Examinations include a detailed assessment of visual acuity, cover testing for strabismus, identification of amblyopia, slit-lamp examination, non-contact <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry</b> and cycloplegia (cyclopentolate) followed by autorefraction, optical coherence tomography, retinal thickness measurement, digital mydriatic retinal photography and aberrometry.

40|$|PURPOSE: To explore ocular {{changes in}} healthy people after exercise. METHODS: Twenty five volunteers {{underwent}} exercise for 15 minutes on a treadmill. Measurements of choroidal thickness, intraocular pressure (IOP), <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry,</b> {{and blood pressure}} were taken before and after exercise. Enhanced Depth Imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) {{was used to measure}} choroidal thickness at the fovea. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. Ocular biometric measures were collected using A scan ultrasound. Blood pressure was measured concurrently with the acquisition of the scans. RESULTS: Twenty five volunteers (25 eyes) {{with a mean age of}} 25. 44 ± 3. 25 years were measured. There was a significant increase in systolic and diastolic pressure after exercise (P 0. 05). CONCLUSION: There was a significant decrease in IOP from exercise without a change in choroidal thickness and ocular biometric measures. IOP and choroidal thickness were not correlated, suggesting that the IOP decrease from exercise is not due to changes in choridal thickness...|$|E

Fractal analysis offers a simple quantitative method to characterise {{the complexity of the}} branching vessel network in the retina. Several methods have been proposed to quantify the fractal properties of the retina. Methods: Twenty five healthy volunteers underwent retinal photography, retinal oximetry and <b>ocular</b> <b>biometry.</b> A robust method to evaluate the fractal properties of the retinal vessels is proposed; it consists of manual vessel segmentation and box counting of 50 degree retinal photographs centred on the fovea.
