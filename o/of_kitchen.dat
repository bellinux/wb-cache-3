5|$|As {{the glaciers}} {{retreated to the}} {{northeast}} about 20,000 years ago, glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway, or channel, that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch <b>of</b> <b>Kitchen</b> Creek. The retreating glaciers also left deposits of debris 20to 30feet (6.1to 9.1m) thick, which formed a dam blocking water from draining into Big Run. Instead water from Ganoga Lake and the area that later became Lake Jean was diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch <b>of</b> <b>Kitchen</b> Creek. These diversions added about 7square miles (18km²) to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50percent to 20.1square miles (52km²).|$|E
5|$|The waterfalls are on {{the section}} <b>of</b> <b>Kitchen</b> Creek that flows down the Allegheny Front, a steep {{escarpment}} between the Allegheny Plateau {{to the north and}} the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to the south. The glens are made of sedimentary rocks from the Huntley Mountain and Catskill Formations that formed up to 370million years ago in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The waterfalls are the result of increased flow in Kitchen Creek from glaciers enlarging its drainage basin during the last Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|The waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park {{are on the}} Allegheny Front, {{which is}} the {{boundary}} between the Allegheny Plateau to the north and the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to the south. The headwaters <b>of</b> <b>Kitchen</b> Creek are on the dissected plateau, from which the stream drops approximately 1,000feet (300m) in 2.25miles (3.62km) as it flows down the steep escarpment of the Allegheny Front. Much of this drop occurs in Glen Leigh and Ganoga Glen, two narrow valleys carved by branches <b>of</b> <b>Kitchen</b> Creek, which come together at Waters Meet. The branch in Glen Leigh has eight named waterfalls and lies north of the confluence, while the branch in Ganoga Glen has ten named waterfalls and lies to the northwest. Ricketts Glen lies south of and downstream from Waters Meet; here the terrain becomes less steep, and there are fewer named waterfalls. The DCNR names only four in Ricketts Glen, all on Kitchen Creek; the USGS GNIS names these and one more on the creek, and Brown's book on Pennsylvania waterfalls adds a sixth named falls on a tributary.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{pages were}} filmed per day, {{six days a}} week, with three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular time}} with the crew then moving on to film an equal number <b>of</b> <b>kitchen</b> scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with the dog and often groomed the dog at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more believable, but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.|$|E
5|$|In Saint Lucia, downpours {{triggered}} torrential flooding {{along the}} island's easternmost coast from October5 through October6. In Dennery Quarter, flash floods affected about 500 households; among them, 400 had their houses flooded or severely damaged. Several residences {{had to be}} evacuated, and some people were trapped in their homes. Residents also suffered from the absence of drinking water, lack of electricity, and the inability to prepare meals due to the loss <b>of</b> <b>kitchen</b> equipment and other utensils. In response, the area was declared a disaster zone; a total of EC$500,000 ($185,185USD) was approved to assist flood victims, {{as well as an}} additional US$44,194 allocated from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.|$|E

5|$|Ricketts Glen is {{the name}} given to the Kitchen Creek valley south and {{downstream}} of Waters Meet. It is 1.8miles (2.9km) between Pennsylvania Route 118 and Waters Meet on the Falls Trail, making this the longest glen. The three northernmost waterfalls are all within 0.5miles (0.80km) of Waters Meet, and are only a short hike {{from the bottom of}} Ganoga Glen or Glen Leigh. The southern part of this glen has large areas of old-growth forest, chiefly hemlocks. Ricketts Glen is entirely in the Catskill Formation and all of the falls on this section <b>of</b> <b>Kitchen</b> Creek have plunge pools.|$|E
5|$|Ricketts' {{stone house}} {{served as the}} base for the Ozone hiking club of Wilkes-Barre's {{excursions}} on the mountain; the club gave its name to Ozone waterfall in the park. In 1879 Ricketts started the North Mountain Fishing Club, for anglers on the lake and creek. Guests of the hotel paid one dollar to fish as a club member. In 1889 Ricketts hired Matt Hirlinger and five other men to build the trails along the branches <b>of</b> <b>Kitchen</b> Creek and its waterfalls. It took them four years to complete the trails and stone steps through the glens.|$|E

5|$|The {{result was}} {{increased}} water flow in Kitchen Creek, {{which has been}} cutting the falls in the glens since. The gradient or slope <b>of</b> <b>Kitchen</b> Creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin, as Phillips Creek still does. The increased basin size means that Kitchen Creek in the glens is too steep for its present amount of water flow. As Kitchen Creek continues to cut into the rock and erode it up the Allegheny Front, the creek's slope will decrease and become less steep. In the future, the creek's flow and slope are predicted to become {{similar to those of}} other nearby creeks with similar size drainage basins. This process could take so long that a new glacial period might occur before the transformation is complete.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} two families, {{one in each}} {{half-hour of}} the episode, preparing their family recipe while the professional chefs cook a restaurant {{version of the same}} meal. The family begins by revealing the dish they have selected to cook to the chefs as well as how longer they think it will take to prepare it. The chefs are then given {{the same amount of time}} to create their own version. Once the first cook-off is complete, the second family is brought out, and the procedure is repeated with their own meal. After the second cook-off, the judges reveal the winning dish from each round. If the family's home cooked meal beats the chefs' professional version, the family wins $25,000; if the chefs win, the family receives $1,000 worth <b>of</b> <b>kitchen</b> supplies.|$|E

50|$|Through fundraising, similar kitchens {{were later}} founded in various {{other areas of}} London through the Invalid <b>Kitchens</b> <b>of</b> London {{movement}} (which evolved from the Southwark Invalid Kitchen), under the patronage of Queen Mary. After {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, it was found necessary to increase the number <b>of</b> <b>kitchens</b> dramatically, partly because so many hospital places had to be allocated for the treatment of wounded soldiers (which meant that other patients were obliged to convalesce at home), and partly because there were wounded soldiers who themselves were recovering at home rather than in the hospitals. In 1915, the number <b>of</b> <b>kitchens</b> increased from 17 to 29, although the numbers tended to fluctuate in proportion to the amount of funding available.|$|R
