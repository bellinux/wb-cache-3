5000|$|The {{stereotype}} fit {{hypothesis was}} developed by Heilman in order to evaluate the then current {{role of women in}} high-power positions in the workplace. Since Heilman's initial research, many studies have been conducted to determine how women are affected by job positions which are considered to be more masculine. For example, Lyness & Heilman (2006) utilized archival <b>organizational</b> <b>data</b> from a multinational finances company to study the effects of stereotype fit on performance evaluations and promotions. Their study found upper-level female managers were rated more negatively than men in similar or lower positions and females in lower management positions. The authors also found that out of those promoted, females received more favorable ratings than their male counterparts [...] - [...] suggesting a more stringent threshold for promotion for women (see shifting standards). In a similar study by Eagly & Karau (2002), because of male-manager stereotypes, women are seen as less likely to fit managerial roles and, as a result, when they do achieve those positions, are looked on less favorably when performing the same managerial duties.|$|E

Four methods of assessing nonresponse bias (analysis of known characteristics of a population, subsampling of nonresponders, wave analysis, and linear extrapolation) were applied {{to the results of}} a postal survey of U.
