5|$|Ottawa derivational {{morphology}} forms basic word stems with {{combinations of}} word roots (also called initials), and affixes {{referred to as}} medials and finals to create words to which inflectional prefixes and suffixes are added.

5|$|Personal pronouns {{exist for}} the first and second person, while the old demonstrative pronouns have come to form third person (proximal and distal) pronouns. <b>Other</b> <b>word</b> (sub-)classes include {{interrogative}} pronouns, conjunctions (which take participles), spatials, and particles, the last being rather numerous.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any <b>other</b> <b>word</b> class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{number of}} {{previous}} studies reported dissociations between the processing of number <b>words</b> and <b>other</b> <b>words</b> and reasoned that there are fundamentally different mental representations and/or processing strategies related to these types of words. Messina et al. reported the performance of Italian aphasic patients with words and number words in different tasks [1]. In line with previous studies, they found that lexical errors formed the dominant error type in number words, whereas phonological errors were the most frequent error type in <b>other</b> <b>words.</b> Messina et al. [1] concluded that speech production processes differ categorically between number <b>words</b> and <b>other</b> <b>words,</b> leading to qualitatively different error patterns in language breakdown. The present study examined error types in number <b>words</b> and <b>other</b> <b>words</b> {{in a sample of}} 15 German patients with aphasia using the same tasks as Messina et al. [1]. Performance in reading and repeating number <b>words</b> and <b>other</b> <b>words</b> was analysed. In general, we replicated the dissociation of error types between number <b>words</b> and <b>other</b> <b>words</b> reported by Messina et al. [1] and others. However, in contrast to previous assumptions this dissociation was not categorical but rather gradual. We suggest that psycholinguistic stimulus properties (such as number of repetitions per morpheme) and type of task influenced error types in a gradual fashion...|$|R

25|$|The {{practice}} of separating the prefix of the infinitive mode from the verb, by {{the intervention of}} an adverb, is not unfrequent among uneducated persons… I am not conscious, that any rule has been heretofore given in relation to this point… The practice, however, of not separating the particle from its verb, is so general and uniform among good authors, and the exceptions are so rare, that the rule which I am about to propose will, I believe, prove to be as accurate as most rules, and may be found beneficial to inexperienced writers. It is this :—The particle, TO, which comes before the verb in the infinitive mode, must {{not be separated from}} it by the intervention of an adverb or any <b>other</b> <b>word</b> or phrase; but the adverb should immediately precede the particle, or immediately follow the verb.|$|E
