50|$|New {{technologies}} are under development that could revolutionize the detection and monitoring of fugitive emissions. One technology, known as {{differential absorption lidar}} (DIAL), {{can be used to}} remotely measure concentration profiles of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere up to several hundred meters from a facility. DIAL has been used for refinery surveys in Europe for over 15 years. A pilot study carried out in 2005 using DIAL found that actual emissions at a refinery were fifteen times higher than those previously reported using the emission factor approach. The fugitive emissions were equivalent to 0.17% of the <b>refinery</b> <b>throughput.</b>|$|R
25|$|It was {{not until}} the 20th century that rich oil fields were {{discovered}} in the area. On 16 July 1909, after secret negotiation with the British consul, Percy Cox, assisted by Arnold Wilson, Sheik Khaz'al agreed to a rental agreement for the island including Abadan. The Sheik continued to administer the island until 1924. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company built their first pipeline terminus oil refinery in Abadan, starting in 1909 and completing it in 1912, with oil flowing by August 1912 (see Abadan <b>Refinery).</b> <b>Refinery</b> <b>throughput</b> numbers rose from 33,000 tons in 1912-1913 to 4,338,000 tons in 1931. By 1938, it was the largest in the world.|$|R
30|$|At present, oil {{products}} are {{still one of}} the major energy sources in industries, such as power generation, transportation, metallurgy, chemical industry and light industry. According to statistics, <b>refinery</b> <b>throughput</b> is 76.8  ×  106 bbl/d (BP 2014) and pipelines can provide an economic transportation mode for petroleum industries. As a result, in both producing and consuming countries, a large amount of {{oil products}} is transported from refineries or wharfs to oil depots through pipelines and then pumped to down-stream markets (Li et al. 2015; Liang et al. 2012 a). Oil depots connecting up-stream sources and down-stream markets, {{play a vital role in}} the entire transportation system (Duan et al. 2016). However, it is complex to make a scheduling plan. On the one hand, oil depots have large turn-round volume and complex operations. On the other hand, the delivery of contaminated oil to the down-stream stations is a systematic issue and the operation of each oil depot is interrelated with others.|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of South African raw sugar is sold to export markets. Consistently good filterability of this sugar is important for satisfying the requirements of customers. To the refiner, the filterability of raw melt is important as this affects <b>refinery</b> <b>throughput.</b> Analysis of filtrationimpeding impurities in raw sugar has shown that, among other things, poor juice clarification {{could be related to}} poor filtering sugars. To this end, a South African Sugar Association sponsored investigation into sources of high turbidity in clarified juices and their relation to poor filtering sugars was begun. Results from the 2002 season show that both process variables and cane quality were causes of high juice turbidities. In particular, flow disturbances, poor pH control, and poor and frequent start-up and shutdown incidents were major process variable contributors to poor turbidities. Some of the worst start-up and shutdown incidents would have resulted in carryover. Poor cane quality consistently resulted in high juice turbidity. While cane quality is largely a field issue, evidence suggests that slowing down of the factory does improve juice turbidity. This strategy would be particularly beneficial when employed to minimise the frequency of the shutdown and start-up often associated with poor cane supply. It is planned to correlate juice turbidity to sugar filterability and to relate these to various aspects of cane quality. Filterability of raw sugar is generally only measured at the Sugar Terminal and then only on composited samples. More frequent measurements are needed for process monitoring and, to this end, filterability test equipment is being manufactured for use at mills...|$|R

40|$|Rotary kilns {{fired by}} coal or gas burners {{are widely used}} to process mineral sands to extract pure minerals, most {{commonly}} titanium dioxide, (TiO 2), in Western Australia. The kilns vary in size depending on <b>refinery</b> <b>throughput,</b> however most are very large items up to 70 metres long and 6 meters in diameter. The kilns are constructed from carbon manganese structural and pressure vessel plates and welded {{in the same manner}} a s large pressure vessels, however structural welding standards are applied. The mineral sands are purified using a pyrometallurgical process where the internal operating temperature reaches approximately 1200 °C. These temperatures are outside the operational limits of carbon manganese steel, so a protective internal layer of refractory approximately 250 mm thick is required to reduce the shell temperature to between 100 °C and 200 °C. The refractory is poured in strips along the bottom of the kiln incorporating refractory anchors to stabilise the refractory upon drying. The refractory anchors are 253 MA stainless steel, secured to the kiln shell via a welded lug incorporating a slot. This design is referred to as a “rotor lok” assembly. Failure of the welded lug is relatively common during service, requiring costly kiln shutdown for remedial work and casting new refractory. The failures are mainly contributable to stress concentrations present at the fillet weld toes, with fatigue the failure mechanism in all cases. When failures arise, movement of the refractory lining over time causes a loss of lining where irreversible damage to the kiln shell occurs. This dissertation researches and discusses alternative methods for securing the 253 MA stainless steel refractory anchor to the kiln shell to provide a higher level of serviceability and reliability to prevent costly unexpected refinery shutdown. Over time, total replacement of the refractory is necessary, and renewing the anchor attachments using current methods is time consuming and expensive without consideration to lost production revenue. Stud welding is proposed as a realistic option for the application of securing the refractory anchor. The author has attempted to persuade operators of rotary kilns that this option is viable, by applying mechanical testing regimes to selected studs which show the stud welded option out performs the welded lug in all testing applied...|$|R
40|$|An investigative {{study on}} {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils of different sampling stations in Effurun metropolis and its environs of the Niger Delta Area of Nigeria was carried out with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Among the 16 US EPA priority PAHs determined, pyrene was observed {{to be the most}} abundant compound at all sites (20 %), followed by fluoranthene (14 %), phenanthrene (12 %), chrysene (10 %) and benzo(ghi) perylene (6 %). High concentrations of pyrene could be attributed to anthropogenic source such as industrial and vehicular emissions. On the other hand, naphthalene, acenathalene and anthracene accounted for 3. 2 %, 1. 6 %, and 1. 1 %, respectively. The <b>observed</b> trend: <b>Refinery</b> > Ekpan > Enerhen > Water Resources > Alegbo > Ugborikoko > Ugboroke could be attributed to the density of industrial and commercial activities in each area. Clear differences in the total PAH between urban/industrial and rural areas were observed. The results showed that PAH levels in soils from heavily industrial sites were higher in concentrations to the effect that Refinery locations were comparatively higher than all other locations. The higher levels of PAHs <b>observed</b> in the <b>Refinery</b> location are clear indications of combustion emissions and gas flaring from fractionating towers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the fundamental}} drivers of Russian oil {{production in the}} current low oil price environment, highlighting a number of dichotomies currently at work. The low oil price has forced Russian oil companies to cut dollar expenditure and to re-assess their investment strategies, apparently putting oil production and exports at risk. However, the impact of rouble devaluation {{and changes in the}} fiscal regime can help to offset these negative factors. US and EU sanctions have restricted access to technology and finance, but import substitution and a search for alternative sources of funding can start to redress these problems. New field developments are being delayed, but a number of projects are already underway that can help to keep production flat in 2015. Arctic and tight oil projects have been undermined by sanctions but this has caused the Russian industry to re-focus on arguably more economic assets in core regions. Finally, even if production does remain flat or even decline slightly, exports may continue to grow as domestic <b>refineries</b> reduce <b>throughput</b> due to recent tax changes that disadvantage production of fuel oil...|$|R
40|$|An {{extended}} follow-up from 1977 - 84 {{was achieved}} in {{a cohort of}} 11, 567 nickel workers engaged in mining, milling and smelt-ing originally studied from 1950 - 76. Exposure data were incor-porated into the analysis. One nasal cancer occurred. The lung cancer Standardized Mortality Ratio beyond 15 years from first exposure was significantly high overall (128) and in miners (153). However, detailed analyses by era of first mining and du-ration of mining, as well as cumulative exposure to different nickel species, did not appear consistent with an occupational etiology since significant trends were not observed. At the levels of exposure incurred, large increases in lung and nasal cancer, <b>observed</b> in nickel <b>refineries</b> elsewhere, did not occur...|$|R
40|$|Remarkable polygenetical {{structures}} were <b>observed</b> at a <b>refinery</b> rehabilitation site in Wedel/Holstein. The polygonal shaped, channel-like structures are incised in mid-Saalian clayey, chalk-rich till. They are symmetrically semicircular shaped {{and filled with}} calcareous, silty sands that {{can be interpreted as}} sandy reworked till with aeolian components. The width reaches from approx. 0. 3 to 1. 5 metres, the depth up to approx. 0. 8 metres. Horizontal cracks up to more than 10 meters in lengths, occurring as narrow belts of sand with reddish colour, are often centrally aligned in the channel-like structures. The present-day red colour is not natural but related to pollution. These belts reach {{down to the bottom of}} the channel like structures. At the lower site of the channel-like structures glacitectonic fissures with a width up to a few centimetres were to be traced into a depth of several metres to the basis of the excavat ion. The genesis of the channel-like structures is discussed. e. g. a possible relation with the pre-existing glacitectonic joints resp. the expected periglacial paleohydrogeological setting...|$|R
40|$|Whole {{effluent}} assessments (WEA) {{are being}} investigated as potential tools for controlling aqueous industrial discharges and minimizing environmental impact. The present study investigated how toxicity {{and the presence}} of potentially bioaccumulative substances altered when refinery effluents were subjected to biodegradation tests. Three petrochemical effluents were assessed, two freshwater and one saline, and subjected to two different types of biodegradation tests, resembling either a ready style (dissolved organic carbon (DOC) -die away) or an inherent style (Zahn-Wellens) test and the toxicity and potential to bioaccumulate parameters were re-analysed during and after biodegradation. A high proportion of the potentially bioaccumulative substances (PBS) in these effluents was easily biodegradable. Biodegradation not only lowered the PBS concentration but also toxicity. Appropriate controls are required however, as some increases in toxicity were observed after 4 h. In the present study, six other petrochemical effluents were also assessed for their PBS content and toxicity to increase the understanding of the relationship between PBS and toxicity. The results showed that the PBS concentrations in these samples were lower than the estimated benchmarks of acute toxicity for algae, fish and crustacean, although two samples were above the critical PBS values for chronic narcotic toxicity for Daphnia magna, which support the assumption that narcotic effects are mainly responsible for the <b>observed</b> toxicity in <b>refinery</b> effluents. It can be concluded that for facilities processing petroleum products that the measurement of PBS is a suitable surrogate for toxicity tests at the screening stage. Finally, the combination of persistency, bioaccumulation, and toxicity tests was shown to have additional value compared to an approach using only toxicity tests. © 2011 SETAC...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the criteria and the recommended standard based thereon which {{were prepared to}} meet the need for preventing impairment of health from occupational exposure to inorganic nickel. The criteria document fulfills {{the responsibility of the}} Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under Section 20 (a) (3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to "... develop criteria dealing with toxic materials and harmful physical agents and substances which will describe [...] . exposure levels at which no employee will suffer impaired health or functional capacities or diminished life expectancy {{as a result of his}} work " experience. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), after a review of data and consultation with others, formalized a system for the development of criteria upon which standards can be established to protect the health and to provide for the safety of employees exposed to hazardous chemical and physical agents. The criteria and recommended standard should enable management and labor to develop better engineering controls and more healthful work practices and should not be used as a final goal. These criteria for a standard for inorganic nickel are part of a continuing series of criteria developed by NIOSH. The proposed standard applies to the processing, manufacture, and use of inorganic nickel as applicable under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The standard was not designed for the population-at-large, and any extrapolation beyond occupational exposures is not warranted. The standard is intended to (1) protect against injury from inorganic nickel, (2) be measurable by techniques that are valid, reproducible, and available to industry and official agencies, and (3) be attainable with existing technology. However, it will only substantially reduce the risk of developing nickel-related cancers and minimize the risk of developing dermatitis. Ingestion and inhalation of, and dermal exposure to, nickel are common, since nickel is present in air, soil, water, food, and household objects. Although nickel is commonly found in the air, it is present in higher concentrations where there is environmental pollution as a result of the burning of fossil fuels or the processing of nickel. The recommended standard for inorganic nickel is based on the conclusion that these substances are carcinogenic. An excess number of deaths from lung cancer and nasal cancer has been <b>observed</b> in nickel <b>refinery</b> workers. After review of the relevant data, it was concluded that a substantial portion of those excess deaths was caused by exposure to airborne nickel compounds. It might be reasoned from the limited animal data that only nickel subsulfide is a carcinogen; or the interpretation might be made, based on some epidemiologic studies. that only one stage of nickel refining presents a risk of cancer. In addition, it might be concluded from limited data on human exposures and environmental concentrations that the safe threshold level of exposure to nickel compounds is greater than the recommended environmental limit. Should sufficient evidence be developed to demonstrate that any of these is a correct interpretation or that some nickel compounds are not carcinogenic, the recommended standard for inorganic nickel will be considered for revision. The available evidence indicates that workers can be adversely affected by skin contact with nickel, particularly when it is in solution. Because of the ubiquity of nickel in the nonoccupational environment, some individuals may develop a sensitivity to nickel regardless of precautions taken in the workplace. The standard cannot protect these individuals from developing recurrent dermatitis when occupationally exposed to inorganic nickel. However, it will greatly reduce the risk of unsensitized workers becoming sensitive to nickel in the course of their employment. Even though there is considerable information about occupational health problems associated with inorganic nickel, several major areas require further research. Epidemiologic studies are needed to determine the risk of developing nickel-related cancers in occupations which have not been adequately studied, eg, welding, plating, and refining nickel oxide ore; inhalation experiments in suitable animal species are needed to supplement these studies. Both animal and human studies are needed to ascertain whether the limited information on reproductive effects has any relevance to human exposure. Animal studies are needed to characterize the acute and chronic toxicities of the many nickel compounds for which insufficient information is available. The health effects of occupational exposure to nickel carbonyl are not discussed in this document, nor have the effects of simultaneous exposure to nickel and cadmium been reviewed herein. The effects,of nickel carbonyl are discussed in "Special Occupational Hazards Review and Control Recommendations for Nickel Carbonyl" and the effects of cadmium are discussed in the "Criteria for a Recommended Standard [...] Occupational Exposure to Cadmium. " Two other reviews of nickel provide additional information on its toxicity. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) prepared monographs on nickel and nickel compounds in 1973 [1] and 1976 [2], in which evidence for the carcinogenicity of all nickel compounds was considered. The Committee on Medical and Biologic Effects of Environmental Pollutants of the National Academy of Sciences published in 1975 a comprehensive review (NAS-NRC report) [3] of nickel which also included nickel carbonyl.
