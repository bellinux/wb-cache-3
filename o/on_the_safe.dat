5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil.

5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> accumulation of singles.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA hollow {{thick-walled}} cylinder made of functionally {{graded material}} subjected to twist has been analyzed. The objective {{of this paper is}} to provide the guidance to design the torsion of thick-walled cylinder made of {{functionally graded material}} so that collapse of cylinder due to external pressure can be avoided. The concept of transition theory based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> concept of Lebesgue strain measure has been used to simplify the constitutive equations. Results have been analyzed theoretically and discussed numerically. From the discussion, we can conclude that highly non-homogeneous cylinder is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> side of <b>the</b> design as compared to lesser non-homogeneous cylinder. This is because of the reason that percentage increase in pressure required for initial yielding to become fully plastic is very high for non-homogeneous cylinder whose non-homogeneity increases radially as compared to lesser non-homogeneous cylinder. Also, non-homogeneous cylinder whose thickness is very high is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> side of <b>the</b> design as compared to less thick-walled cylinders because percentage increase in pressure required for initial yielding to become fully plastic is very high for highly thick-walled cylinders as compared to other cases...|$|R
