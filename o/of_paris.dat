Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University <b>of</b> <b>Paris</b> relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University <b>of</b> <b>Paris</b> and the Pasteur Institute.|$|E

From then on, the new reservoir system became <b>Paris's</b> principal source <b>of</b> drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning <b>of</b> <b>Paris's</b> streets.
