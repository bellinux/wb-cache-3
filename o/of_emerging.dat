The common earwig was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but tends to be more common in the southern and southwestern parts of the United States. The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed earwig (Doru aculeatum), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, other families can be found in North America, including Forficulidae (Doru and Forficula being found there), Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effects of different types of furrow opener and operation speed on soil properties, draft force and percentage <b>of</b> <b>emerged</b> tuber seedling. The experiment was conducted on a clay-silt textured soil using hoe, shoe and shovel type furrow openers with 2. 02, 3. 28 and 4. 50 km h - 1 operation speeds, respectively. After planting, soil penetration resistance, ridge height, mean emergence dates and percentage <b>of</b> <b>emerged</b> tuber seedling were determined. Soil penetration resistance increased with increasing operational speeds for each furrow opener type. The draft force requirement of furrow openers increased with operation speeds. Percentage <b>of</b> <b>emerged</b> tuber seedling was between 66. 37 and 82. 67 %, based on furrow opener type and operational speeds. The lowest soil penetration resistance, draft force and high percentage <b>of</b> <b>emerged</b> tuber seedling occured found with shovel type furrow opener...|$|R
5|$|Huldrych Zwingli or Ulrich Zwingli (1 January 1484– 11 October 1531) was {{a leader}} of the Reformation in Switzerland.

He also thought that industrial development was suffering from short-sighted executives, self-interested unions, high taxes, and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O'Neill's detailed explanations <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Rix Nicholas {{returned}} to Australia, and in 1928 she married Edgar Wright, {{whom she had}} met during her travels in the early 1920s. The couple settled at Delegate, New South Wales; their only child, a son named Rix Wright, was born in 1930. Though she continued to paint significant works including The Summer House and The Fair Musterer, Rix Nicholas, a staunch critic of modernism who was disdainful of the works <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> major artists such as Russell Drysdale and William Dobell, grew {{out of step with}} trends in Australian art. Her pictures remained didactic, portraying an Australian pastoral ideal, and reviews of her exhibitions grew more uneven. She held her last solo show in 1947. Rix Nicholas remained at Delegate until her death in 1961. Her works are held in most major Australian collections, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, Australian War Memorial, National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the Queensland Art Gallery.|$|E

5|$|Many thrips are pests of {{commercial}} crops {{due to the}} damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop. Some thrips serve as vectors for plant diseases, such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips, but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include the tomato spotted wilt virus and the impatiens necrotic spot viruses. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of plant diseases caused by tospoviruses. Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing globalization of trade and the growth of greenhouse agriculture, thrips, unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include F. occidentalis, Thrips simplex, and Thrips palmi.|$|E

Wenger {{was a member of}} the football governing body's technical committee, responsible for analysing the 1994 World Cup, and made a presentation to coaches <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> football nations. His speech was closely followed by Japanese delegates, whose country had invested millions into the restructuring of its football league system. Representatives of Toyota, the majority owner of Nagoya Grampus Eight soon met with Wenger and offered him the chance to become the club's manager. Wenger deliberated, even though the idea of working abroad appealed to him; negotiations between the two parties lasted for two months. In that time, he sought the advice of his closest friends and family, and flew to Japan to watch Nagoya Grampus' striker Gary Lineker make his final appearance before his professional retirement. In December 1994, Wenger agreed to become manager of Nagoya Grampus, on a two-year contract worth ¥75m annually.|$|E

The Polish communists became the most influential Polish factor in the politics <b>of</b> <b>emerging</b> Poland, despite having minuscule popular support. PKWN recognized the legal continuity of the March Constitution of Poland, as opposed to the April Constitution. On September 6, PKWN issued its momentous land reform decree, the consequences of which would fundamentally alter the antiquated social and economic structure of the country. Over one million peasant families benefited from the parceling of the larger estates.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe study <b>of</b> <b>emerged</b> {{community}} {{structure is}} an important challenge in networks analysis. In fact, several methods have been proposed in the literature to statistically determine the significance of discovered structures. Nevertheless, most of existing analysis models consider only the structural aspect <b>of</b> <b>emerged</b> communities. We are interested in studying the robustness <b>of</b> <b>emerged</b> communities in peer-to-peer (P 2 P) networks.

Hence, rather than examining the robustness only on the structural properties of the graph, we {{will focus on the}} parameters that allow the emergence of community structures. In fact, perturbing these parameters might destroy most of the obtained properties at the emerged level. To the best of our knowledge, robustness of networks has never been considered from this angle before. In this paper, we study the impact of perturbing the content and the profile of nodes on the emerged communities in P 2 Pnetworks. We show how these alterations affect both structure and information supported by the emerged structures...|$|R
