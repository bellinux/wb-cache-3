25|$|Ngugi {{makes the}} {{dichotomy}} between the villagers (the honest working class) and the elite (corruption) most {{visible in the}} speech that Nyakinyua gives before the villagers, which motivates them {{to make the trip}} to Nairobi. She says, “I think we should go. It is <b>our</b> <b>turn</b> to make things happen. There was a time when things happened the way we in Ilmorog wanted them to happen. We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang them and we danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us.... We must surround the city and demand back our share” (pp.115–116). However, along their way, they are unjustly detained by Kimeria the businessman, who reveals that he is colluding with the MP, and who afterwards rapes Wanja.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Milan players {{who had played}} in the 2005 final were delighted with the victory after they lost two years previous. Kaká claimed victory was all the sweeter as a result: [...] "What {{happened}} then was strange, just six minutes when we played not so good and we paid for that." [...] Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso echoed his teammates sentiments: [...] "The defeat two years ago will stay me for a lifetime, {{but this is a}} different story. It's <b>our</b> <b>turn</b> to celebrate now." [...] Striker Filippo Inzaghi, who missed the final in 2005, was delighted to have scored the goals that won the final for Milan: [...] "I've scored quite a few times in Europe, but scoring in the Champions League final is something special." [...] Milan President and owner Silvio Berlusconi was equally delighted about the success, adding that [...] "the fortune we lacked in Istanbul we had with us tonight." ...|$|E

500|$|Various {{scenes in}} Hot Fuzz feature {{a variety of}} action film DVDs such as [...] and scenes from Point Break and Bad Boys II. Wright {{revealed}} {{that he had to}} get permission from every actor in each video clip, including stunt men, to use the clips and {{for the use of the}} DVD covers had to pay for the rights from the respective studios. The film parodies clichés used in other action movies. On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies, Pegg has said, [...] "Men can't do that thing, which is the greatest achievement of humankind, which is to make another human, so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into people's heads... It's <b>our</b> <b>turn</b> to grab the gun by the hilt and fire it into your face." [...] Despite this, Pegg maintains that the film is not a spoof, in that [...] "They lack the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material. Because we're looking up to it." [...] The film also includes various references to The Wicker Man, in which Edward Woodward had played a policeman tough on law and order.|$|E
2500|$|After {{learning}} what happened, Bhutto famously replied, [...] "Don't worry. <b>Our</b> <b>turn</b> will come". In 1967, {{a team of}} Pakistani scientists, under Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry, produced the first batch of radioisotopes at the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology. The research in nuclear technology at PINSTECH began to pick up speed, and Abdus Salam began to supervise Pakistani research institutes.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{response}} to corruption was very solid ... {{but it became}} clear after a while that these scams reached {{all the way to}} the president himself," [...] said Kenya's former anti-corruption chief John Githongo in Michela Wrong's book It's <b>Our</b> <b>Turn</b> to Eat. Most notorious of a raft of graft scandals was the multi-billion shilling Anglo Leasing case, which emerged in 2004 and involved public cash being paid to a complicated web of foreign companies for a range of services—including naval ships and passports—that never materialised." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first two}} {{representative}} games were styled as the [...] "Honourable Ivo Bligh's Team versus Mr Murdoch's XI". The Aussies took £200 per player {{in each of}} these games as record-breaking crowds poured into the M.C.G., and the New Year's Day attendance was 23,000. The highlight of the first Test was an innings of 85 in 135 minutes from George Bonnor as Australia made 291 in its first innings. Rain came down during the England innings, making the pitch more difficult than it had been. England, struggling to cope with this, made only 177 and was forced to follow on 114 runs behind. Mr Murdoch's XI won easily by 9 wickets, and the Colonial press saw the victory as confirmation of Australia's superiority. Bligh, however, later commented, [...] "Some of us still cherished the hope that <b>our</b> <b>turn</b> was yet to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tutu preached {{a message}} of {{forgiveness}} during a 1989 trip to Israel's Yad Vashem museum, saying [...] "Our Lord would {{say that in the}} end the positive thing that can come is the spirit of forgiving, not forgetting, but the spirit of saying: God, this happened to us. We pray for those who made it happen, help us to forgive them and help us so that we in <b>our</b> <b>turn</b> will not make others suffer." [...] Some found this statement offensive, with Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center calling it [...] "a gratuitous insult to Jews and victims of Nazism everywhere." [...] Tutu was subjected to racial slurs during this visit to Israel, with vandals writing [...] "Black Nazi pig" [...] {{on the walls of the}} St. George's Cathedral in East Jerusalem, where he was staying.|$|E
2500|$|Conference {{attendance}} gets {{much attention}} on Gerbic's bi-weekly segments on the Skeptic Society's Skepticality podcast. She stresses {{how important it}} is for skeptics to attend, and if there aren't conferences nearby, then to create a conference, be it a SkeptiCamp or a Skeptics in the Pub event. She insists that conference attendance is the first step towards activism. [...] "What I do know is that the one-on-one contact recharges our batteries. People like Harriet A. Hall (Skepdoc), Lindsay Beyerstein (co-host of Point of Inquiry), and myself came from CSI’s Skeptic's Toolbox. We weren't primarily authors or lecturers, just people with a passion for the skeptical movement who decided it was <b>our</b> <b>turn</b> to step up. You can’t buy that fire, but sometimes you might have to kick the embers to keep us (and others) out there fighting what seems to be an insurmountable world of woo. Conferences are essential." ...|$|E
