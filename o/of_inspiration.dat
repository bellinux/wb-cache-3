5|$|El Greco's {{personality}} and work were a source <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for poet Rainer Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke's poems (Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II., 1913) was based directly on El Greco's Immaculate Conception. Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who felt a great spiritual affinity for El Greco, called his autobiography Report to Greco {{and wrote a}} tribute to the Cretan-born artist.|$|E

5|$|The {{authors have}} named several other authors as sources <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> when writing the novels. In an online author chat, Cherith Baldry listed the authors that inspire her as {{including}} Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Shakespeare. In the same chat, Victoria Holmes stated that Jacqueline Wilson, Kathy Reichs, and J. K. Rowling {{are some of}} the authors that inspire her. According to the official website, other authors who have inspired the writers include Enid Blyton, Lucy Daniels, Ellis Peters, Tess Gerritsen, Kate Ellis, Lisa Gardiner, and Meg Cabot. The authors have also mentioned several other sources <b>of</b> <b>inspiration.</b> The New Forest in southern England was the base for the forest where the original series took place. Other influential locations include Loch Lomond, as well as the Scottish Highlands. Nicholas Culpeper, a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine, also had an influence on the Warriors series. His book, Culpeper's Herbal, is used as a source by the authors for the herbal remedies that the cats use in the books. In addition, the authors suggested that they may use some fan-created names in future books. Also mentioned as a source <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> was the film series Rambo.|$|E

5|$|Although in his preface, Barker cites {{his primary}} source <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> as John Smith's The Generall Historie of Virginia (1624), he was likely more {{influenced}} {{by a series of}} popular books by John Davis, including, Travels of Four Years and a Half in the United States of America (1803), Captain Smith and Princess Pocahontas (1805), and The First Settlers of Virginia (1806) which featured a more sexualized and romanticized characterization of Pocahontas.|$|E
5|$|An Egyptian historian, {{known by}} his Greek name as Manetho (c. 3rd century BC), {{was the first}} to compile a {{comprehensive}} history of Egypt. Manetho was active during the reign of Ptolemy II (r. 283–246 BC) and used The Histories by the Greek Herodotus (c. 484 BC–c. 425 BC) as his main source <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for a history of Egypt written in Greek. However, the primary sources for Manetho's work were the king list chronicles of previous Egyptian dynasties.|$|E

5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} several {{significant}} works of modern literature. Her romantic attachment with Pericles has inspired {{some of the}} most famous novelists and poets of the last centuries. In particular the romanticists of the 19th century and the historical novelists of the 20th century found in their story an inexhaustible source <b>of</b> <b>inspiration.</b> In 1835 Lydia Maria Child, an American abolitionist, novelist, and journalist, published Philothea, a classical romance set in the days of Pericles and Aspasia. This book is regarded as the most successful and elaborate of the author's productions, because the female characters, especially Aspasia, are portrayed with great beauty and delicacy.|$|E
5|$|Chronicles {{edited by}} Kogălniceanu and Costache Negruzzi were the source <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for several {{historical}} novelists, beginning with Alexandru Odobescu. His {{relationship with the}} peasant representative to the ad hoc Divan, Ion Roată, is briefly mentioned in an anecdote authored by Ion Creangă (Moș Ion Roată). He is also {{the subject of a}} short writing by Ion Luca Caragiale (first published by Vatra in 1894). Symbolist poet Dimitrie Anghel, whose father, the National Liberal parliamentarian Dimitrie A. Anghel, had been well acquainted with Kogălniceanu, authored a memoir detailing the fluctuating relationship between the two political figures, as well as detailing one of the former Premier's last speeches.|$|E
5|$|David was {{conceptualized}} {{as a character}} to provide a non-human perspective for the theme of meeting one's creators in Prometheus, with him representing the next generation {{in a line of}} creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors. Fassbender, who was director Ridley Scott's first choice for the role, helped fashion the character to share traits with T. E. Lawrence, who was a source <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> as a control freak caught between two cultures- the cultures being humanity and synthetics, in David's case. As the series progresses, David's behaviors and motivations evolve from a mysterious agent with ambiguous motivations to a character directly opposing the well-being of humanity.|$|E

5|$|El Greco's {{dramatic}} and expressionistic style {{was met with}} puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco {{is regarded as a}} precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.|$|E
5|$|French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously {{examined}} Manutius's work (and, it is thought, De Aetna in particular) as {{a source}} <b>of</b> <b>inspiration.</b> This examination extended to in some cases copying his first 'M' shown in De Aetna which had no serif pointing out of the letter at top right, a design considered very eccentric. (It has been suggested {{to be the result}} of defective casting, especially since Manutius' later fonts do not show it.) The Griffo font was only cut in a single size, so French punchcutters made modified versions of the design to suit different sizes, with a more delicate structure at larger sizes.|$|E
5|$|Goldman pursued an {{independent}} education on her own, however, and {{soon began to}} study the political turmoil around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done? (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative. The book enthralled Goldman and remained a source <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> throughout her life.|$|E

5|$|In modern history, orators such as Henry Clay would mimic Demosthenes's technique. His {{ideas and}} {{principles}} survived, influencing prominent politicians and movements of our times. Hence, he constituted a source <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for {{the authors of}} The Federalist Papers (a series of 85 essays arguing for the ratification of the United States Constitution) and for the major orators of the French Revolution. French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau {{was among those who}} idealised Demosthenes and wrote a book about him. For his part, Friedrich Nietzsche often composed his sentences according to the paradigms of Demosthenes, whose style he admired.* P. J. M. Van Tongeren, Reinterpreting Modern Culture, 92.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot (Old Father Goriot, 1835) was {{his next}} success, in which Balzac transposes {{the story of}} King Lear to 1820s Paris in order to rage at a society bereft of all love save the love of money. The {{centrality}} of a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position—not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau, but {{also the fact that}} he had fathered a child, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, with his otherwise-married lover, Maria Du Fresnay, who had been his source <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for Eugénie Grandet.|$|E
5|$|Marlohe {{had secured}} the role after two auditions for {{director}} Sam Mendes and casting director Debbie McWilliams. She looked to Xenia Onatopp {{as a point}} <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> for her performance. Distancing herself from the Bond girl title, she interpreted the character as more modern and realistic. Media commentators characterized Sévérine as a femme fatale and an anti-heroine. Costume designer Jany Temime designed Sévérine's wardrobe using concepts from film noir as well as contemporary fashion, with close attention paid to the black dress she wears when meeting Bond in a Macau casino.|$|E
