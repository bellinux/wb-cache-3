5|$|The author {{believes}} that determinations {{of what should}} be censored from whom should not {{be made by the}} government, stressing that a society must ensure that there is a tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship. She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should and should not be censored, resulting in negative <b>overreaching</b> consequences of censorship. Heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should be sure there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E

5|$|The book starts by {{quoting the}} First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from {{creating}} legislation that limits free speech or {{freedom of the}} press. The author analyzes {{the impact of this}} clause and refers to the writer of the United States Constitution, James Madison, who believed that freedom of the press would serve as a form of separation of powers to the government. Lewis writes that an expansive respect for freedom of speech informs the reader as to why citizens should object to governmental attempts to block the media from reporting about the causes of a controversial war. Lewis warns that, in a state in which controversial views are not allowed to be spoken, citizens and reporters merely serve as advocates for the state itself. He recounts key historic events in which fear led to <b>overreaching</b> acts by the government, particularly from the executive branch. The author gives background on the century-long process by which the U.S. judicial system began defending publishers and writers from attempts at suppression of speech by the government.|$|E

25|$|Christopher Marlowe, {{also known}} as Kit Marlowe (baptised 26 February 156430 May 1593), was an English playwright, poet and {{translator}} of the Elizabethan era. Marlowe was the foremost Elizabethan tragedian of his day. He greatly influenced William Shakespeare, {{who was born in}} the same year as Marlowe and who rose to become the pre-eminent Elizabethan playwright after Marlowe's mysterious early death. Marlowe's plays are known for the use of blank verse and their <b>overreaching</b> protagonists.|$|E

25|$|Ranetti's literature, {{redolent of}} Caragiale and Anton Bacalbașa, was mostly ephemeral in nature, and often {{referenced}} {{the politics of}} his native Mizil. His articles, fables, sketch stories and plays, with their critique of Francization and affectation, earned him a following in the general public, but were regarded by critics and scholars as dated, <b>overreaching,</b> or overall inferior to the Caragiale model. His satire often had very precise targets, including King Carol I and his courtier Ioan Kalinderu, politician George D. Pallade, and actor Ion Brezeanu. In addition to putting out original texts, Ranetti was a noted translator and dramaturge, who adapted works by Georges Courteline and Paul Gavault.|$|E
25|$|The Court also {{rejected}} the theoretical underpinnings of the National League of Cities v. Usery decisionthat the Constitution's {{recognition of the}} sovereignty of the states necessarily implies limits on the power of the federal government to regulate their employment relations. In the majority's view, the constitutional grant of authority to Congress to regulate interstate commerce was not qualified by any implied limitation on the right to regulate the activities of the states when they engaged in interstate commerce; on the contrary, the Commerce Clause invalidates state regulations that interfere with commerce, while the Supremacy Clause allows Congress to preempt state laws that conflict with federal law in this area. According to the majority, the framers believed that state sovereignty could be maintained by the peculiar structure they adopted: a Senate in which each state was given equal representation, regardless of its population, an electoral college that gave the states the power to choose electors, and the indirect election of Senators by the legislature of each state prior to the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Noting that the same Congress that extended the FLSA to cover government-run mass transit systems also provided substantial funding for those systems, the Court concluded that the structure created by the framers had indeed protected the states from <b>overreaching</b> by the federal government.|$|E
25|$|Before the British {{could decide}} upon a policy, however, Sukarno struck again, making an {{airborne}} assault Labis {{in the night}} of 1–2 September. Though the raid was a catastrophic failure, {{with one of the}} transport planes crashing en route, and the remainder of the troops arriving scattered with little food and battered morale, the move further infuriated the Malaysians, who in turn put pressure upon the British to act. The next day, colonial secretary Duncan Sandys authorized on-site naval commander Admiral Varyl Begg to plan for strikes against Indonesian bases in Sumatra. The British plans for retaliation were pre-empted once again, but this time by an act of their own. On August 27, the aircraft carrier HMS Victorious had sailed through the Sunda Straits without proper permission being gained from Indonesian authorities. The Indonesians, who feared that the British were attempting to provoke them into attacking the carrier as the Americans had the Vietnamese during the Gulf of Tonkin incident that had occurred earlier that month, were incensed. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio barred the Victorious return passage through the Strait on 2 September, posing a direct challenge to the British. Officials in London determined that the challenge had to be met, and that the Victorious should return through the way it came. This stance, however, met important opposition. Washington {{did not want to be}} dragged into a military action due to the British <b>overreaching</b> themselves. And even more importantly, Begg himself opposed the passage, due to the inability of the Victorious to defend herself in the Strait. What became known as the Sunda Straits Crisis was peacefully resolved, after several weeks of tension, by the Indonesians offering London another strait to pass through at Lombok, that gave the Allies an out from war, and Jakarta a passage that could be easily screened by their warships. By this time, tensions were beginning to wind to a close, though more landings were attempted that December, as both sides seemed to recognize the disadvantage of fully escalating the Confrontation through any greater action.|$|E

Then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards." [...] He rejected the <b>overreaching</b> portrayals of nature in its [...] "totality", as found in the work of contemporary painters like Adrian Ludwig Richter (1803–84) and Joseph Anton Koch (1768–1839).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} whether <b>overreached</b> athletes show psychomotor slowness after a period of high load training. Fourteen well-trained cyclists (10 male, 4 female, mean age 25. 3 [SD = 4. 1] years, mean maximal oxygen consumption 65. 5 [SD= 8. 1] ml/ kg-min) performed a maximal graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer, filled out two questionnaires and performed two tests of psychomotor speed before and after high load training and after two weeks of recovery training. A control group performed the two tests of psychomotor speed on the same occasions without changing physical activity levels. Five cyclists were classified as functional <b>overreached,</b> seven cyclists were classified as well-trained and two cyclists were excluded from analysis. Results showed no significant differences in psychomotor speed between the control, well-trained and functional <b>overreached</b> groups on the three measurements. A trend towards psychomotor slowness was found for the functional <b>overreached</b> compared to the control group after high load training. Additional research with more subjects and a greater degree of overload training is necessary to more conclusively determine if psychomotor speed can be used as an early marker for overtraining...|$|R
