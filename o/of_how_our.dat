25|$|Some of Feyerabend's work {{concerns}} {{the way in}} which people's perception of reality is influenced by various rules. In his last book, unfinished when he died, he talks <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>our</b> sense of reality is shaped and limited. Conquest of Abundance: A Tale of Abstraction versus the Richness of Being bemoans the propensity we have of institutionalizing these limitations.|$|E
25|$|Theological determinism: The {{idea that}} the future is already {{determined}}, either by a creator deity decreeing or knowing its outcome in advance.

25|$|Logic and the {{philosophy}} of language are closely related. Philosophy of language {{has to do with}} the study <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>our</b> language engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.|$|E

25|$|Davidson {{argues that}} as a culture, our {{attention}} blindness represents a significant challenge that we must examine and meet head on; particularly since the Internet has revolutionized virtually every aspect <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>our</b> lives function now. The Internet, Davidson suggests, has catapulted us into an immediate, collaborative, and interconnected existence that {{is characterized by the}} sudden breakdown of barriers between private and public, work and play, domestic and foreign, office and home, etc. Davidson notes that although our lives have been irrevocably altered in these fundamental ways, our most important educational, corporate, and social institutions have not substantially changed in correlation with these upheavals. She claims that those in educational and corporate spheres continue to operate in 20th century modes (founded {{to meet the challenges of}} industrialization) as though we were currently not living through momentous, epochal changes.|$|E

500|$|On {{the second}} day of the tournament RB Leipzig beat Benfica by two goals. Halstenberg opened the score in the 19th minute, {{combining}} well with Federico Palacios before shooting the ball into the top left corner of the net. RB Leipzig made sure of victory in the second half when Marvin Compper scored. From Dominik Kaiser's free-kick, the defender headed the ball beyond Benifca goalkeeper Bruno Varela. RB Leipzig ended the tournament in third place with five points, whereas Benfica finished bottom of the table on two points. Hasenhüttl was delighted with his team's performance, telling reporters: [...] "I am proud <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>our</b> young players performed.

2500|$|In 2012, she {{published}} her {{findings from}} a study into the evolution of stars within galaxies which themselves are members of galaxy clusters, using the Gemini North Observatory in Hawaii. [...] The research found that a galaxy's position within the galactic cluster affected stellar evolution within that galaxy: the closer a galaxy is {{to the center of}} a cluster, the sooner it stops forming new stars. The interpretation of this is that near the centre of the cluster, the large number of close galactic neighbours influence each other through gravitation to produce a sea of hot gas, and that hot gas seems to be the limiting factor that constrains new star formation. Mergers of galaxies also play a part: her forecasts <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>our</b> own Milky Way galaxy will merge with the Andromeda Galaxy and the two smaller Magellanic Cloud galaxies in several billion years have prompted further new studies into how that will affect the rates of star formation locally.|$|E

60|$|Since {{writing this}} story {{some years ago}} I have been {{reminded}} by an aged friend who knew 'Rhoda Brook' that, in relating her dream, my forgetfulness has weakened the facts our of which the tale grew. In reality it was while lying down on a hot afternoon that the incubus oppressed her and she flung it off, with the results upon {{the body of the}} original as described. To my mind the occurrence of such a vision in the daytime is more impressive than if it had happened in a midnight dream. Readers are therefore asked to correct the misrelation, which affords an instance <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>our</b> imperfect memories insensibly formalize the fresh originality of living fact--from whose shape they slowly depart, as machine-made castings depart by degrees from the sharp hand-work of the mould.|$|E
6000|$|Now here is {{an actual}} instance, a small case <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>our</b> social {{conscience}} really works: tame in spirit, wild in result, blank in realisation; a thing without the light of mind in it. I take this paragraph from a daily paper:&mdash;"At Epping, yesterday, Thomas Woolbourne, a Lambourne labourer, {{and his wife were}} summoned for neglecting their five children. Dr. Alpin said he was invited by the inspector of the N.S.P.C.C. to visit defendants' cottage. Both the cottage and the children were dirty. The children looked exceedingly well in health, but the conditions would be serious in case of illness. Defendants were stated to be sober. The man was discharged. The woman, who said she was hampered by the cottage having no water supply and that she was ill, was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment. The sentence caused surprise, and the woman was removed crying, 'Lord save me!'" ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{suppose the}} readers of that work of {{reference}} had looked for the portrait of Charles I. and found {{the head of a}} policeman. Suppose it had been taken, modern helmet and all, out of some snapshot in the Daily Sketch of the arrest of Mrs. Pankhurst. I think we may {{go so far as to}} say that the readers would have refused to accept it as a lifelike portrait of Charles I. They would have formed the opinion that there must be some mistake. Yet the time that elapsed between Stephen and Mary was much longer than the time that has elapsed between Charles and ourselves. The revolution in human society between the first of the Crusades and the last of the Tudors was immeasurably more colossal and complete than any change between Charles and ourselves. And, above all, that revolution should be the first thing and the final thing in anything calling itself a popular history. For it is the story <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>our</b> populace gained great things, but to-day has lost everything.|$|E
