5|$|In 2006, renewed {{criticism}} regarding current Premier Jean Charest's {{limited use}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> {{led to another}} proposal for a proper official residence. Charest, who heads a family of five and lives in Montreal, saw little reason to move them across the province. These proposal were never taken further, and Charest's successor, Pauline Marois, made regular use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment.</b>|$|E

5|$|Local {{residents}} said that {{fire safety requirements}} at the high-rise were lax, and that workers often tossed used cigarettes into the building's hallways. Week-long safety inspections were done on the two other buildings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> complex, {{both of which were}} unharmed. The several hundred people living in those buildings were expected to be allowed to move back on 20 December 2010. Until then, the survivors would live in 17 nearby hotels.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inefficient {{targeting}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments,</b> <b>the</b> shortage <b>of</b> <b>apartments</b> worsens, and <b>the</b> prices <b>of</b> non-Hitas <b>apartments</b> rise.|$|R

5|$|Some critics {{believed}} that the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> building, as well as Walter's coin tosses coming up heads, are references to the 1966 tragicomedy Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, which in turn derives from the characters of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet.|$|E
5|$|The {{footage of}} Don {{returning}} to bed after kicking Andrea out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> was actually reverse footage of Don {{getting out of}} bed only minutes before, which led some to believe that this was a directorial touch by Shakman to help the viewer discern the dream sequence by including unreal footage.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to loss {{of power in the}} left engine, the flight crew were unable to control their aircraft before it struck the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E

5|$|For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{only the}} {{interior}} {{of one of the}} four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase leading from the first floor to the attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads to the dining room with large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located on the east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> contains two bedrooms and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and {{it is likely that the}} same would have been done for the first floor unit. The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified because it has been split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests the expanse of the modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} in London that Whistler met Joanna Heffernan, the model who would become his lover. By 1865, Whistler had already used her {{as a model for}} other paintings, among these Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2. Heffernan {{supposedly}} had a strong influence over Whistler; his brother-in-law Francis Seymour Haden refused a dinner invitation in the winter of 186364 due to her dominant presence in the household. In January 1864, Whistler's mother Annalater depicted in the painting Arrangement in Grey and Blackarrived to stay with her son in London. As a result, Heffernan had to move out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment,</b> and only visited as a model. Still, Heffernan's presence displeased Whistler's mother, and his relationship with both women became strained.|$|E

5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E

5|$|In April 1972 {{her husband}} Casimiro died; {{he had never}} taken an {{interest}} in Wicca or esotericism and Valiente later claimed that theirs had been an unhappy relationship. Newly widowed, she soon had to move as the local council decided that her home was unfit for human habitation; she was relocated into council accommodation in the mid-1960s tower block of Tyson Place in Grosvenor Square, Brighton. Her flat was described by visitors as cramped, being filled with thousands of books. It was there that she met Ronald Cooke, a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> block's residents' committee; they entered into a relationship and she initiated him into Wicca, where he became her working partner. Together they regularly explored the Sussex countryside, and went on several holidays to Glastonbury, further considering moving there. She also joined a coven that was operating in the local area, Silver Malkin, after it was established by the Wiccan High Priestess Sally Griffyn.|$|E
5|$|JIVE Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{for the song}} to be directed by Billie Woodruff. It was produced under Geneva Films, while the choreography was created by Wade Robson. The narrative of the video shows Spears dreaming as she sleeps in her room. As the dream begins, Spears is shown in a blue and silver futuristic room with several different levels, where she sings and walks around, and puts {{her feet on the}} wall while wearing a shiny silver outfit. MTV news reporter Ellen Thompson considered it the sexiest moment of the music video. As the video continues, Spears is seen on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> building she lives in, performing a dance segment in a red top and black skirt with a few backup dancers. The following scenes shows the singer wearing white clothes and singing in the room in which she is sleeping, while her love interest comes into her room to see her. Together, they start a pillow fight that shortly ends after Spears is shown again in her room still sleeping, however, now with a smile upon her face. A longer dance segment intercalates with all the scenes during the whole video.|$|E
5|$|The {{riverside}} façade {{is formed}} by the main residential bulk and the library wing on the west side, which offers a contrast in shape and design, notably through its single, very large window. The {{main part of the}} façade is symmetrically arranged around an avant-corps of four columns with Corinthian capitals. The avant-corps is crowned with a voluminous triangular pediment, again adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan, while the library wing is crowned with a semicircular pediment. That pediment was originally surmounted by two copper statues of angels, now lost. The library wing {{was not part of the}} original 1727 plan but was conceived in 1733, after the cardinal bought up and demolished a row of houses on the current rue de Rohan. The architect, Robert de Cotte, was thus able to distribute the interior spaces of the residential bulk on an even grander and also more practical plan, notably putting the main staircase to the left (east) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> wing instead of the centre.|$|E

5|$|To English-speaking audiences, Mühe was {{probably}} {{best known for}} portraying Hauptmann (Captain) Gerd Wiesler in Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others, 2006), which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2007. The film {{is set in the}} mid-1980s, and Wiesler is a Stasi agent who is assigned to bug and conduct surveillance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> of an East German playwright, Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), and his girlfriend, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). However, he becomes disillusioned about the necessity of monitoring the couple for national security reasons after discovering that the government minister who ordered the surveillance did so for sexual rather than political motives. Gradually, Wiesler's heart moves from contempt and envy to compassion. For his performance, in 2006 Mühe received, among other things, the Beste darstellerische Leistung – Männliche Hauptrolle (Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role), Gold, at Germany's most prestigious film awards, the Deutscher Filmpreis (German Film Awards); and the Best Actor Award at the European Film Awards.|$|E
5|$|The tenth season closes several long-running storylines. Charlie {{breaks up}} with Ross {{to get back}} {{together}} with her ex-boyfriend. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being together and decide {{it would be best}} to remain friends. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). In the series finale, Erica gives birth to twins, to the surprise of Monica and Chandler— a boy, Jack (after Monica's father), and a girl, Erica (named after the birth mother). Monica and Chandler prepare to move to the suburbs, and Joey becomes upset with the changes in his life. Rachel gets fired from her job and accepts a new offer in Paris, but Ross, realizing he loves her, chases after her. Rachel realizes she loves him, too, and cancels her flight to Paris, agreeing to stay with him. The series ends with all the friends plus Monica and Chandler's new babies leaving the apartment, heading to Central Perk for a final cup of coffee.
