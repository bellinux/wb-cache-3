The 1952 Jordanian Constitution does forbid the extradition of ‘political refugees…on account of their political beliefs or their defence of liberty'. Furthermore, the government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with UNHCR in 1998, underlining its agreement to the definition of a refugee and the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement.</b> [...] Historically, the Jordanian government has granted full citizenship to the vast majority of Palestinian refugees, while UNRWA administers aid and provides health and education services to those living in refugee camps. [...] Its policies towards Iraqis have been less clear. Currently, the government estimates that 450,000 - 500,000 Iraqis live in Jordan, although only 31,000 of these Iraqis are registered with UNHCR. The regime has followed the principles of Arab hospitality and brotherhood by opening its doors to thousands of Iraqis; yet its policies towards them with regard to provision of basic services have been less clear. Moreover, it has preferred to use ‘visitor’ or ‘guest’ when referring to Iraqis, avoiding the socially and politically loaded term ‘refugee’ and the subsequent need to establish more permanent arrangements, services and solutions that would strain Jordanian infrastructure. [...] The situation for Palestinians from Iraq fleeing to Jordan after 2003 following the invasion of Iraq is yet more difficult. Aside from a few with family connections inside Jordan, the majority of Palestinians were refused entry or free movement inside the country. Thus, many were stranded in No Man’s Land between Iraq and Jordan, or detained in Al-Raweished Camp within Jordan.|$|E

40|$|The European Union {{and other}} {{countries}} on the Balkan route for migrants have recorded a large {{increase in the number}} of asylum seekers. In parallel with the increased number of refugees trying to enter the territory of the EU, measures for migration management have tightened, and the right to asylum at the level of the Member States has been interpreted more and more restrictive. Search for protection from persecution has become a reason for closing borders and disabling access to territory and asylum system. However, access to asylum system is the first step in the realization of the right to asylum as guaranteed by international, European and national law. In addition to allowing access to territory and asylum system, which implies an <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> states to accept refugees in order to confirm the need for international protection in a fair and efficient procedure, the states are obliged to respect the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this paper is to clarify the connection between providing access to asylum system and respect for the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement.</b> Analysis in the paper was done by legal-dogmatic method of research and interpretation of legal acts and other authorities, as well as of UNHCR relevant recommendations and documents. The assumption is that without the provision of access to territory and asylum system the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> cannot be respected. Apart from the international refugee law and doctrinal interpretations, it derives from the practice of the European Court of Human Rights regarding the prohibition of torture or other inhuman treatment or punishment guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

The Irish Government claims that it has received comprehensive and unequivocal Diplomatic Assurances from the United States that no persons have been, are being, or will be 'rendered' through Irish airspace and Shannon Airport and that these Assurances are sufficient to fulfill Ireland's Article 3 obligations, should they arise. This essay, forthcoming in the Irish Yearbook of International Law, examines two fundamental questions that arise in relation to this issue: (1) is Ireland's jurisdiction engaged as a 'transit state' under Article 1 of the ECHR, and (2) if jurisdiction is engaged, could the Diplomatic Assurances provided be sufficient for Article 3 purposes.

40|$|Australia {{has shifted}} {{the way it}} conceives its {{international}} obligations under the Refugee Convention, calling into question its continuing viability as a protection instrument. The Refugee Convention was a progressive step towards the international {{recognition of human rights}} and justice. It invokes the key <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement,</b> which prohibits State Parties from returning a vulnerable person to a place where their life or security is threatened. The Refugee Convention must contend with state sovereignty, which is the integral right of states to control the entry and residence of those within their territories. In the last few decades, the Refugee Convention has been confronted by a number of major challenges. In the current climate, the principle of state sovereignty is in competition with the humanitarian goal of protecting refugees. When faced with asylum seekers at their borders, many States have adopted restrictive practices in order to evade their protection obligations. This indicates a clear preference for sovereignty at the expense of human rights. While historically committed to the Refugee Convention, the governments of Australia have since implemented a range of measures to deter refugees from seeking asylum. Of these, the most contentious include prolonged mandatory detention and offshore processing. These policies are a blatant violation of Australia’s obligations under the Refugee Convention, especially with respect to non-refoulement. It is clear that the Refugee Convention is not being honoured in the way that it once was. It will be argued that despite contemporary issues, the Refugee Convention’s key principle of non-refoulement is the most significant obligation for protecting refugees and remains highly significant...|$|E

However, over the past decade, a series of events in particular areas have challenged this perception. The status of refugees and how they are treated represents one such area. The status of asylum seekers has always been a matter of concern as Hong Kong has never been a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Additionally, recent court decisions regarding the question of non-refoulement and the absence of a government screening process for refugees make it increasingly difficult for observers to accept Hong Kong as a forward-looking, world-class city. This article examines recent decisions that deal with Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s obligations under international law regarding avoiding the ejection of refugees to jurisdictions where they will likely face persecution or torture. In particular, this article focuses on C. and Others v. Director of Immigration, in which Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s Court of First Instance considered whether an <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> exists, and whether Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s government has a duty to provide a screening process to determine the status of all refugee claimants.

In light of these decisions, this article outlines the current procedures used to determine refugee status and highlights the difficulties faced by refugees while awaiting resettlement in a third country.

40|$|Much {{uncertainty}} {{obscures the}} future of offshore processing in Australia, following the recent High Court ruling on the unlawfulness of the Malaysia Solution in Plaintiff M 70 / 2011 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, and the tumultuous political response which has ensued.   First of all, {{it is useful to}} clarify the basis for the High Court’s 6 : 1 decision, which turned on the interpretation of section 198 A(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). That legislative provision was held to constitute the sole source of power for the Minister to transfer asylum seekers from Australia to another country for determination of their refugee status. Under that section, the Minister is to ‘declare’ that the recipient country provides access for asylum seekers to effective procedures for refugee status determination, and furthermore, that it provides protection for asylum seekers and refugees. In a categorical rejection of the Commonwealth Government’s submission that the validity of such a declaration depended ‘on the existence of the Minister’s declaration itself, not the truth of the content of that declaration’, the majority of the court held that the criteria in section 198 A(3) needed to be satisfied as a matter of objective fact to the satisfaction of the court. As the joint majority judgment emphasised, the legislation confers a power to ‘declare that a specified country has the relevant characteristics’, not to declare that the Minister ‘thinks or believes or is satisfied that the country has those characteristics’. In interpreting this section, the joint judgment recognised that it amounted to ‘a reflex of Australia’s obligations’ under the Refugee Convention and Protocol. Significantly, states that are a party to these international instruments are not only bound by the fundamental <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> (which protects refugees from being returned to places where their lives or freedom would be threatened), but also by the requirement to provide refugees with important additional protections, including rights to freedom of religion, access to the courts, employment and education, and moreover, access to these rights without discrimination as to race, religion or country of origin. The court recognised that such rights could only be meaningfully guaranteed to refugees if a legal framework was in place to provide for those rights. This conclusion was fatal to the validity of the Minister’s declaration under section 198 A(3) in respect of Malaysia – a country which is not bound by international law to provide these rights (not being a party to the Refugee Convention or Protocol), which does not recognise refugee status (let alone afford rights to refugees) in its domestic legislation, and which was not legally bound to adhere to its arrangement governing the refugee swap with Australia. Unsurprisingly, the aftermath of the High Court decision has seen a clamour from the federal opposition that the Gillard government should resume processing of asylum seekers on Nauru, which recently acceded to the Refugee Convention and Protocol. Yet, the government rejects that a valid declaration may be made in respect of that country. What is the basis of this claim? Essentially, while a legal obligation to provide the procedures and protections referred to in section 198 A(3) is necessary, it is unlikely to be sufficient, to ground a valid declaration under that provision of the Migration Act without further evidence that those procedures and protections are actually accorded to asylum seekers and refugees. Although a finding on this issue was left open by the joint judgment in Plaintiff M 70, French CJ took an affirmative position on this question, and it is likely – as the Solicitor-General recognised in his advice to the Government – that this position would be adopted by the High Court if the issue arose for determination. The Solicitor-General has therefore concluded in his advice that what is likely to be necessary for a valid declaration in relation to Nauru is proof that Nauru has arrangements in place to ensure practical compliance with its obligations under the Refugee Convention and that its treatment of asylum seekers and refugees complies in practice with human rights standards acceptable to at least the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Such evidence is at the present time wholly lacking in relation to Nauru. So the High Court decision places in real doubt the offshore processing plans of both major political parties. However, rather than to recognise the soundness of the High Court’s judgment on the importance of securing protection for asylum seekers and refugees, the Gillard Government is now attempting to circumvent the decision by amending the Migration Act: a proposed new section 198 AB that gives the Minister the power to designate a country as an ‘offshore processing country’, where the only condition on the exercise of that power is that ‘the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to designate the country to be an offshore processing country’. Section 198 AA would state that ‘it is a matter for the Minister to decide which countries should be designated as offshore processing countries’ and ‘the designation of a country … need not be determined by reference to the international obligations or domestic law of that country’. In a move of political brinkmanship, the Coalition has indicated that despite its support for offshore processing, it will not vote for the Bill without a requirement that the ‘offshore processing country’ be a party to the Refugee Convention. (Of course, this gives Nauru, but not Malaysia, the tick of approval.) Yet, the whole idea of a Bill which evades judicial recognition of the entitlements of asylum seekers and refugees is an ill-fated move. Australia, as a party to the Refugee Convention and Protocol, has undertaken to respect the rights recognised in these instruments – rights which vitally respond to the protection needs of individuals who, fleeing from persecution in their country of origin, are in need of assistance from the international community. It is well-established at international law that Australia cannot ‘contract out’ of these obligations to asylum seekers and refugees merely by transferring them to another country. If such a transfer takes place, and the recipient country is not bound to provide those individuals with protection, and indeed, does not provide them with effective protection – as is envisaged by the Bill – Australia will be in serious breach of its international obligations. It is most disconcerting that neither Julia Gillard nor Tony Abbott are troubled by this. As the political stalemate on offshore processing deepens, the fragile future of those individuals seeking asylum in Australia hangs in the balance.

40|$|The {{rights of}} {{refugees}} and {{basic human rights}} are inextricably linked. Today's human rights abuse is tomorrow's refugee movements. Quite often, refugees' rights are curtailed by the same states that declare them in accordance with international and domestic instruments, only because they are non-nationals. While the foundation of refugee rights is the principle that all {{men and women have}} the right to belong to a society in which they are protected by the state, the respect to the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> {{is at the core of}} being a refugee. Even though the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) proclaims rights to all, including refugees, states use international principles of sovereignty to shut their doors in front of asylum seekers. Furthermore, it is not easy to utilise international mechanisms of protection to instigate complaints against a potential host state, based on its arbitrary act to shut its doors. This is because one needs to seek remedies before authorities of the same country where she or he has been denied. In addition, international law has few precedents on the matter even assuming it was treated as an exception to the former rule. This situation puts refoulement victims in a dilemma. [...] . Since the first time when the wave of asylum seekers from Rwanda hit Tanzania in 1959, the flow of refugees continues. Tanzania has hosted refugees not only from its neighbouring countries, but also as far as from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Somalia. With an estimated number of 602, 00 refugees population in 2004, Tanzania was among the top five refugee-hosting countries in the world. Tanzania ratified the international and regional refugee instrumetns, as well as other human rights instruments that may enhance the protection of refugees. Subsequently, Tanzania enacted appropriate legislation in order to make the refugee instruments enforceable within the national legal framework. The principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> is enshriend in all legal instruments of which Tanzania has an international, regional and national obligation to respect. However, in recent years a trend of sporadic incidents in which the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> was not respected, has been observed. For instance, in October 2004, 68 Burundian asylum seekers were forced to return to Burundi following the orders of the local authorities. One of the most recent incidents occurred in January 2005 when the government returned two families of nine persons, despite assurances made to UNHCR that they would be granted refugee status. This research looks at the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> the Government of Tanzania to protect rights of asylum seekers and refugees. This is in line with the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> as enshrined under international and regional instruments of which Tanzania ratified. It further explores the role of international communities in responsibility sharing (often referred to in the humanitarian community as 'burden sharing') as a way to ensure that all states respect the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement.</b> [...] .

At its core, the agreement aims to address the flow of irregular migrants and asylum seekers traveling across the Mediterranean from Turkey to Greece, by allowing returns of “all irregular migrants”. The aim of this thesis has been to examine if these actions limit two fundamental refugee rights; the right to seek asylum and the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement.</b> If so, are these restrictions legitimate according to Seyla Benhabib’s and Joseph Carens’ theory? These two theoreticians have been chosen because they problematize the conflicting view of state sovereignty in relation to refugees’ rights. This is significant when the state maintains border control and is responsible to prevent refugees from entering the state. This thesis shows that the EU-Turkey agreement is not compatible with the practical <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> states under international law and the European Union asylum policy, simply because Turkey is not a safe third country for refugees to be sent back to. Thus, the actions within the agreement does restrict refugees’ right to seek asylum and the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement.</b> These restrictions cannot be considered legitimate, based on the thesis’ theoretical approach. To study the EU-Turkey agreement involves addressing one of the most urgent topics in international law and political theory, as well as providing normative grounds for future migration agreements between states. ...|$|R

Thus, to ensure compliance of the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement,</b> Canada established the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment ("PRRA") process. My thesis focuses on the procedural set up of the PRRA process, which makes it difficult for an applicant to qualify for an oral hearing. Oral hearing may be held in the PRRA process if the Minister, on the basis of prescribed factors, is of the opinion that a hearing is required. Three prescribed factors under section 167 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations ("IRPR ") restrict the possibility of having an oral hearing in the PRRA process. They remove the discretionary ability of PRRA Officers to call for oral hearings to assess or reassess the credibility of the applicant or the claim. The lack of oral hearing or the difficulty in obtaining one could adversely affect the fairness of the PRRA process. Moreover, oral hearings address procedural issues such as the right to reply and the duty to disclose. My thesis will demonstrate that: (1) higher level of procedural fairness, arising from common law, necessitates an oral hearing for the PRRA process with respect to credibility assessment; (2) the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> is a principle of fundamental justice; and (3) the prescribed factors, for determining whether an oral hearing is required for the PRRA process, violate section 7 of the Charter and cannot be saved by section 1. Therefore, section 167 of the IRPR is unconstitutional and invalid...|$|R

Irregular arrival toAustralia in fact has an important influence for political and economic condition. In aneffort to respond these issues, the Australian government under the leadership of PrimeMinister Tony Abbott issued a policy named Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB). Themain key of the policy will be carried out by intercepting the entire Irregular MaritimeArrival (IMA) and combating the practice of people smuggling. The purpose of thisresearch is to describe the implementation of the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> in theOSB 2 ̆ 7 s policies that run during the reign of PM Abbott. This research showed thatAustralia had violated the principle <b>of</b> <b>non-refoulement</b> in the implementation of the policy. Australia is also suspected of committing violations of human rights of refugees andasylum seekers.
