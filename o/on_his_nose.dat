5|$|In January 1987, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery for an enlarged prostate which caused further worries about his health. No cancerous growths were found, however, {{and he was}} not sedated during the operation. In July of that year, aged 76, he underwent a third skin cancer operation <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in the coffin, {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin seemed too small for him; its lid had pressed down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 1985, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove cancerous polyps from his colon. He relinquished presidential {{power to the}} Vice President for eight hours in a similar procedure as outlined in the 25th Amendment, which he specifically avoided invoking. The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful. Reagan resumed {{the powers of the}} presidency later that day. In August of that year, he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells from his nose. In October, more skin cancer cells were detected <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> and removed.|$|E

5|$|In early March 2006, Helms {{suffered}} a broken nose. After complaining to Long {{about having to}} wrestle on the March 10 episode of SmackDown!, Long told Helms {{that he did not}} have to defend his title, but put Helms in a champion versus champion match against the United States Champion, Chris Benoit. During the match, Helms attempted to leave, but was blocked by other cruiserweights who threw Helms back into the ring, resulting in Helms losing the match. Helms underwent successful surgery <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> and was expected to miss five to six weeks. During this time SmackDown! announcers stated that Helms had a no-compete clause in his contract allowing him to waive the thirty-day title defense rule due to any injury. Helms returned to the ring on the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, teaming with MNM to face Super Crazy, London and Kendrick in a six-man tag team match. Helms continued to defend his belt during pay-per-views, but he made more regular appearances on SmackDown!s sister show, Velocity.|$|E
5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Gratwick attempted to join the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF).

60|$|Ordinarily {{he would}} have {{accepted}} battle ere it was offered, and have waged a pleasant and unscrupulous campaign.

25|$|Each one has {{at least}} ten or twelve horses, and they have them so well-trained that they follow them {{wherever}} {{they want to take}} them, and they mount first on one and then on another. When they are on a raid, each horse has a bag hung <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> in which his fodder is put, and he feeds as he follows his master, and they do not stop going by night or by day. And they ride so hard that they cover in one day and one night fully six days' journey or seven or eight. And while they are on the way they will not seize anything or carry it along, before their return, but when they are returning, then they seize plunder and make captives and take anything they can get. Nor do they go armed, except that they wear a garment of sheepskin and carry bows and arrows.|$|E

He would also insist that all pictures of himself were meticulously airbrushed.|$|E
500|$|The dog once {{replaced}} Duffman as the mascot for Duff Beer in {{the episode}} [...] "Old Yeller Belly" [...] (season 14, 2003), {{after he was}} seen drinking from a can of beer by balancing it <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> He becomes known as Suds McDuff and boosts sales of Duff Beer, making the family's fortunes explode. However, this prompts his original sleazy owner and racing trainer to visit the Simpsons and prove that he's {{the owner of the}} dog. The family later figures that if they can get Duffman to replace Suds as the Duff mascot, they can get their dog back. They plan to turn Duffman into a hero at a Duff Beer-sponsored beach volleyball event; however, their plan fails and a drunk shark that's discovered at the event becomes the new mascot instead. Santa's Little Helper gladly returns to the Simpson family.|$|E
500|$|In January 1920, Speyer Brothers {{sold its}} {{shareholding}} in the UERL for approximately £1 million ( [...] today). A month later, Speyer put the Grosvenor Street house {{up for sale}} although it did not reach its reserve price at auction. On 1 April 1922, Speyer and his remaining partner in the London bank, Henry William Brown, dissolved Speyer Brothers. The Grosvenor Street house was eventually sold in early 1923 and became the American Women's club. [...] Speyer rejoined the surviving American and German branches of the family bank and continued to live in New York. In 1929, he lived in Washington Square. He died on 16 February 1932 in Berlin, after having travelled there for an operation <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> He was buried in Dahlem, Berlin. He had continued to hold his baronetcy, although it became extinct with his death as he had no male heirs.|$|E
5000|$|Igongi Jeonsanggut, {{a curious}} ritual. The shaman makes tteok and wine, then {{suddenly}} {{pretends to be}} ill. He signifies that his head is ill by putting a tteok <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head, and also puts a tteok <b>on</b> <b>his</b> ears, <b>nose,</b> chin, shoulder, hip, belly, legs, and feet. Then, the shaman uses the power of Igong to expel the sickness from the body.|$|R

500|$|An {{operation}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> {{before the}} 1935 season delayed Hutton's {{appearance on the}} cricket field that year. Attempting to return too quickly, he endured poor health which limited his subsequent appearances and effectiveness; {{by the middle of}} August he had scored a total of just 73 runs. A century against Middlesex led to run of bigger scores, and his contribution to Yorkshire's County Championship victory that season was 577 runs at an average in first-class matches of 28.85. [...] In the winter of 1935–36 Hutton went on his first overseas tour, as Yorkshire visited Jamaica. In the 1936 season he reached 1,000 runs in a season for the first time—1,282 runs at an average of 29.81—and was awarded his county cap [...] in July. He took part in several large partnerships through the season, including one of 230 with Sutcliffe, although he experienced a sequence of low scores in May and June.|$|E
500|$|Pippa Trench (née Croker) (Janine Duvitski) – Patrick's wife sought {{friendly}} {{relations with}} the Meldrews and, after a while, became good friends with Margaret. The two women usually attempt to get the men {{to make peace with}} each other at least once per series. Eventually Patrick proposes that the Trenches move house, but they soon realise that the Meldrew curse has followed them: Victor sent workmen to their home, thinking they were removal men who had initially come to the wrong house. They were in fact from a house clearance firm Margaret had employed to clear her late cousin Ursula's country mansion. The workmen consequently cleared Patrick and Pippa's house of their entire furniture and sold it for a mere four hundred and seventy five pounds. Pippa is slightly dim-witted (once described by Victor as a [...] "gormless twerp" [...] on an answering machine message, unaware she was listening)for example, believing Victor had murdered an elderly blind man simply because the victim had been found clutching a double-one domino in his hand, and Victor had two pimples <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
500|$|Comet {{was portrayed}} by five horses, {{each with a}} {{different}} talent. The main horse was Copper, chosen by veteran wrangler Gordon Spencer because it was calm and gentle. Campbell nicknamed the horse [...] "Leadbelly" [...] due to its ability to remain calm during action or dialogue scenes. Another horse, Boss, was used for long-range shots, chase scenes, and elaborate stunts, such as leaps through windows. Ace was called in when the crew had to shoot scenes in which the horse reared. Near {{the end of the}} season, a horse named Comet was trained, its name chosen so that the horse would get used to hearing it on set. The [...] "true show horse" [...] was Strip, which was adept at doing tricks, such as lip movements, head nods, and hoof stamping. According to Spencer, all those stunts [...] "as well as tying the knots and opening the door and going into rooms and all of that" [...] were done by Strip. For these scenes, Spencer would stand off-camera and use a stick to signal Strip. Campbell had a special pocket sewn into his costume and filled it with grain to reward Strip after every take. No other horse had more scenes than Strip and Copper. [...] With white colorings <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> and legs, Strip's appearance was chosen for Brisco's steed; Copper and the other horses were touched up with [...] "clown white" [...] greasepaint to match Strip's markings.|$|E

500|$|While Pixar usually designs their {{characters}} to be caricatured, Carl {{was even more}} so, being only three heads high. He was not given elderly features such as liver spots or hair in his ears to keep him appealing, yet giving him wrinkles, pockmarks <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> a hearing aid, and a cane to make him appear elderly. Docter wanted to push a stylized feel, particularly the way Carl's head is proportioned: he has a squarish appearance to symbolize his containment within his house, while Russell is rounded like a balloon. The challenge on Up was making these stylized characters feel natural, although Docter remarked the effect came across better than animating the realistic humans from Toy Story, who suffered from the [...] "uncanny valley". Cartoonists Al Hirschfeld, Hank Ketcham, and George Booth influenced the human designs. Simulating realistic cloth on caricatured humans was harder than creating the 10,000 balloons flying the house. New programs were made to simulate the cloth and for Kevin's iridescent feathers. To animate old people, Pixar animators would study their own parents or grandparents and also watched footage of the Senior Olympics. The directors had various rules for Carl's movements: he could not turn his head more than 15–20degrees without turning his torso as well, nor could he raise his arms high. However, they also wanted him to grow more flexible {{near the end of}} the film, transforming into an [...] "action hero".|$|E
