5|$|Elaborate lattices {{are found}} in Indian Jaali work, carved in marble to adorn tombs and palaces. Chinese lattices, always with some symmetry, exist in 14 of the 17 {{wallpaper}} groups; they often have mirror, double mirror, or rotational symmetry. Some have a central medallion, and some have a border in a frieze group. Many Chinese lattices have been analysed mathematically by Daniel S. Dye; he identifies Sichuan as the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{introduction}} to the series is the Pilot Assist feature. Intended for players new to the series, it is a passive auto-piloting feature that assists players by nudging {{them away from the}} edges of the track or from walls, though its effects at higher speed settings are less desirable. Wipeout HD allows players to control their craft by using the motion-sensitive features of the PlayStation's Sixaxis controller. Motion control comes in two variants: pitch and steering, or pitch only. The former allows the craft to be totally controlled by moving the controller, while the latter only allows the nose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> to be raised or lowered by motion control, with the steering either controlled by analogue stick or D-pad.|$|E
40|$|A new {{collection}} of essays on Muriel Rose (1897 - 1986) edited by Jean Vacher, Collections Manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crafts</b> Study Centre.

5|$|During the {{ceremony}} of initiation, the candidate {{is expected to}} swear (usually on a volume of sacred text appropriate to his personal religious faith) to fulfil certain obligations as a Mason. In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit). There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will further explore the ritual and symbolism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft,</b> others will focus their involvement on the social side of the Lodge, while still others will concentrate on the charitable functions of the lodge.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{is driven}} back to Area 51 {{along with two}} other Men in Black, Howard Grodin and Jeff Smoodge. After an angry {{telephone}} call from Fletcher's wife, Joanne, Mulder—still inside Fletcher's body—goes to Fletcher's home. Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives {{a telephone call from}} Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed the wreckage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E
5|$|Selected {{as one of}} the Mercury Seven astronauts, Grissom was {{the pilot}} of the second American {{suborbital}} flight, in the Liberty Bell 7. The hatch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> blew off and filled with water, causing it to sink {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. His next flight was in the Project Gemini Program in a craft named the Molly Brown, which was a successful mission. He was killed along with fellow astronauts Ed White and Roger Chaffee during a pre-launch test for the Apollo 1 mission at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (then known as Cape Kennedy), Florida. He was the first of the Mercury Seven to die. He was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross and, posthumously, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.|$|E

40|$|Malaysia have various crafts include crafts for {{religious}} purpose, however, {{we are still}} using Feldman’s art criticism model. Feldman’s criticism model do not accommodate contextual value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crafts</b> and is not made to judge crafts. Most of art lecturers are familiar with Feldman’s art criticism model because its simplicity which only four phases; describe, analyze, interpret, and judge. This study used content analysis and interviewed two postgraduate students who studied pottery in Mambong Village. I modify Feldman’s art criticism model and propose three phase model; internal, original and historical context. Internal context; description include visual and material descriptions, how pottery or handicraft is made, original context; styles, values, principle design within local context, compare and contrast, examine original and other country influences the styles and historical context: historical moments, events, and trends relate to handicraft, how other interpreters have understood it, {{where it has been}} placed in <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> art. <b>The</b> model will help student or researchers to evaluate and appreciate <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>crafts</b> including religious crafts. Students will not only know how to judge <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crafts,</b> but they will also appreciate the history and cultural context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crafts...</b>|$|R
5|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the {{movement}} in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges, dating from the Regius Poem in about 1425 {{to the beginning of the}} 18th century. Alluding to the membership of a lodge of operative masons, they relate a mythologised history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft,</b> the duties of its grades, and the manner in which oaths of fidelity are to be taken on joining. The fifteenth century also sees the first evidence of ceremonial regalia.|$|E
5|$|With few fixed {{structures}} in the main marketplace, the plain traditionally served as a public open space on days when the market was not operational. Before the Reformation in the 1530s, its main use was as a venue for religious festivals, particularly the annual procession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Craft</b> Guilds at Corpus Christi. Most public religious festivals were abandoned following the Reformation and the subsequent dissolution {{of many of the}} mediaeval guilds, and the leading event on Norwich's civic calendar became the annual inauguration of the mayor, which took place each May.|$|E
5|$|From Ozone Park, {{he moved}} to Manhattan, where a counter-cultural {{community}} had built up around the Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side that contained an array of gay people, hippies, occultists and others adopting bohemian lifestyles. Without money, he resorted to working as a rent boy, and made use of both marijuana and LSD. Although he briefly returned to Catholicism, in 1971 he read a copy of Witchcraft Today (1954), a book authored by Englishman Gerald Gardner, the founder of Gardnerian Wicca, and it reignited his interest in Pagan religion. In the autumn, he tracked down Leo Martello (1931–2000), a prominent gay rights activist and Pagan Witch who practiced his own Italian-focused form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Craft</b> known as the Strega tradition. Although he felt that Buczynski was too inexperienced in magic to begin practicing Strega Craft, Martello befriended and shared his contacts with the young man, and took him {{with him on a}} visit to Herman Slater (1935–1992), a fellow New Yorker who was of Jewish heritage. Like Buczynski and Martello, Slater was gay, and a romantic relationship soon developed between Buczynski – who was attracted to bears – and the older man. Buczynski moved in with Slater to an apartment in the Brooklyn Heights in June 1972.|$|E

5|$|Niadra is a zerg broodmother {{and leader}} of the Niadra Brood. She was created by Sarah Kerrigan when she battled the protoss on Kaldir. Although she succeeded in {{preventing}} them from contacting the Golden Armada, one of the protoss ships attempted to flee from the planet and travel to Shakuras. To prevent them from surviving, Kerrigan placed a parasitic larva within the captured protoss colonist Lasarra and dropped the psionic veil that prevented her from being warped back to her people. After being teleported to the ship, the protoss attempted to warn the Templar but died as the parasitic larva spawned from her body. Shortly afterwards, it began infesting the local animals kept onboard by the protoss and hid within the ventilation shafts where it found a safe location to mature into a queen. Kerrigan gave her the name Niadra and tasked her with eliminating all the protoss on board the ship, a task she accomplished with assistance from her zerg offspring. After damaging the vessel's warp drive, Niadra and her brood became the only occupants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft,</b> but they had traveled beyond the reach of Kerrigan's ability to communicate. With few other options, Niadra decided to continue the Queen of Blades' last directives: to survive, grow her brood, and destroy the protoss.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft.</b> You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{exhibition}} Academic Choice {{combines the}} scrutiny and {{care of each}} individual selector and the persuasive reasoning each one has given to support their choice <b>of</b> objects from <b>the</b> Centre's collections. The first exhibition focused on selections made by academic staff from the University for the Creative Arts. For this second exhibition, we have drawn from a wider academic constituency, including UCA staff, but also visiting International staff from partner Higher Education Institutions who spend time on their projects based in the Centre. The intention remains to curate an eclectic and idiosyncratic exhibition that explores <b>the</b> deep reaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crafts</b> Study Centre's collections and its remarkable archives. We are delighted that among the 2016 selectors will be Professor Simon Ofield-Kerr, Vice Chancellor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University for the Creative Arts; Sharon Ting, Course Leader, BA Textiles for Fashion and Interiors, Jean Vacher, Curator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crafts</b> Study Centre as well as independent colleagues such as Áslaug Thorlacius, Director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reykjavik School <b>of</b> Visual Arts and <b>the</b> <b>Crafts</b> Study Centre's Founder Fellow in Modern Craft, Dr Stephen Knott and the emerging writer and researcher Kimberley Chandler.

2500|$|There {{are also}} [...] "Craft Chambers" [...] (Handwerkskammern), which have less {{resemblance}} to ancient guilds {{in that they}} are organized for all crafts in a certain region, not just one.

5|$|The aim of {{the game}} remains the same from its predecessor: {{complete}} increasingly difficult challenges {{to move on to}} the next race. The difficulty level is changed by increasing the top speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft,</b> through four different classes (Vector, Venom, Rapier and Phantom). The number of laps needed to complete a race also increased with each new class. Victory in the challenge modes is the game's ultimate accomplishment. These modes are similar to a championship where players have to race every track to become champion; however, rather than tallying up points, Challenge mode takes a very single player-centric approach by only allowing progress to the next track by coming in first on the current track. Players can lose the mode by losing all three lives, which are lost by finishing a race in worse than third position. By winning all the races, the player is crowned champion and given access to faster modes, new tracks and ultimately the Piranha craft.|$|E
5|$|Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) later {{reports to}} Reyes and Scully that Comer has died. Reyes accuses Toothpick Man {{and others in}} the room of killing Comer. Meanwhile, Scully visits Doggett, who warns her not to trust the cultists. However, Scully goes to meet Josepho near Calgary. Josepho claims to be {{protecting}} William, but demands Mulder's head as collateral in exchange for the baby's release. When Josepho returns to the wreck site, the Overcoat Woman relates that the aperture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> began to glow when William started crying. The craft soon rises up out of the ground. Looking on the site from a distance, Scully and Reyes see the craft burst out of an enclosure and into space, lighting the ground beneath it on fire as it goes. The two find an unharmed William among the charred bodies of the cultists.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} the construction, testing {{and analysis of}} a large scale lifting paddlewheel craft. No large scale vehicle of this style exists to date; a small scale version has previously been successful.

This included the analysis and prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crafts</b> performance, operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lifting paddlewheels and comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> successful small scale <b>craft</b> to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prototype constructed. The prototype did not operate as the lifting paddlewheels were intended. Predictions initially showed a deficit in power comparable with <b>the</b> <b>craft</b> comparison which showed a large difference in the power to weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crafts.</b> Modifications to increase the power and following tests proved to also be unproductive. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farm bike prototype dynamics showed a possibility of successful operation should certain criteria be met...|$|R

25|$|The SR.N1 was {{powered by}} a 450hp Alvis Leonides engine {{powering}} a vertical fan in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft.</b> In addition to providing the lift air, {{a portion of the}} airflow was bled off into two channels on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>craft,</b> which could be directed to provide thrust. In normal operation this extra airflow was directed rearward for forward thrust, and blew over two large vertical rudders that provided directional control. For low-speed maneuverability, the extra thrust could be directed fore or aft, differentially for rotation.|$|E
