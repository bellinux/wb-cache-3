By March 1, the tugboat Sea Victory had towed the bow from the beach and out to sea, initially followed by an <b>oil</b> <b>skimmer</b> vessel, OSRV Oregon Responder. However, another severe storm forced the skimmer back to port, and when the tug was 50miles(65km) off the coast, the tow line broke. The bow section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near Waldport, Oregon on March 3, approximately 80miles (130km) {{to the north of}} the original grounding site. On March 8, the bow was again refloated, and by March 11 it was successfully towed 280miles(450km) off the coast by Sea Victory and a second tug, Natoma. At this location, the Pacific Ocean is approximately 10,000feet (3,000m) deep. The bow was sunk by two US Navy ships, the destroyer USS David R. Ray and the submarine USS Bremerton. Four hundred pounds (180kg) of high explosives were attached to the bow and detonated. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from David R. Rays 5-inch (127mm) deck guns then punctured the hull. After 40 minutes, the ship was still afloat with darkness and a storm approaching. To expedite the sinking, Bremerton fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the underside of the ship. Within ten minutes, the bow section flooded and sank stern-first, trapping the remaining oil within.|$|E

50|$|A monitoring-well <b>oil</b> <b>skimmer</b> remediates various oils, {{ranging from}} light fuel oils such as petrol, light diesel or {{kerosene}} to heavy {{products such as}} No. 6 oil, creosote and coal tar. It consists of a continuously moving belt that runs on a pulley system driven by an electric motor. The belt material has a strong affinity for hydrocarbon liquids and for shedding water. The belt, which can have a vertical drop of 100+ feet, is lowered into the monitoring well past the LNAPL/water interface. As the belt moves through this interface, it picks up liquid hydrocarbon contaminant which is removed and collected at ground level as the belt passes through a wiper mechanism. To the extent that DNAPL hydrocarbons settle {{at the bottom of}} a monitoring well, and the lower pulley of the belt skimmer reaches them, these contaminants can also be removed by a monitoring-well <b>oil</b> <b>skimmer.</b>|$|E

The cutters Active, Confidence) and Reliance received their upgrades during the 1980s. Eleven more vessels would undergo renovation throughout the 1990s before the program came to a close. The yard's overhaul gave each MMA cutter an anticipated additional 15 years of service life. In 1985, the yard completed a major renovation of a ferryboat for coast guard use at Governor's Island, New York. The Kulshan,http://www.evergreenfleet.com/crowncity.html a 30-year-old vessel bought by the Coast Guard from the State of Washington's ferry system, was renamed the Governor following renovation at the yard.

An <b>oil</b> <b>skimmer</b> has recently been developed by Extreme Spill Technology (EST) Inc. for automated oil recovery by using vacuum mechanism. This thesis discusses numerical and experimental results of the hydrodynamic performance of the oil recovery process conducted by the <b>oil</b> <b>skimmer.</b> The process of oil recovery by the vacuum mechanism is complicated and involves multi-phase and multi-scale moving interfaces, including oil, water, atmospheric air and attenuated compressible air on the top part of the vacuum tower, a moving interface of an oil slick, oil droplets and air bubbles of different scales. The recovery process was simplified into a three-phase flow problem involving oil, water and air and simulated using a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) method. The volume of fluid (VOF) method was employed to capture the moving surfaces between the fluid phases. Numerical results were compared with the experimental data. The research was also extended to optimize the geometry of the tower along with the service speeds of the <b>oil</b> <b>skimmer</b> model for maximizing oil recovery.

Pollution prevention aims at reducing or eliminating the creation of pollutants at the source by substituting or using less hazardous materials and increase efficiency. However, one particular area that to date has received very little attention is the generation of hazardous wastes from parts cleaning devices in maintenance workshops. Given the detrimental effects of the solvent often used in parts cleaning, it is essential to encourage maintenance workshops to adapt pollution prevention. A promising alternative is the substitution of solvent by aqueous cleaning solution, which will completely eliminate the generation of hazardous wastes during parts cleaning. Aiming to stimulate small quantity of generators of hazardous waste to switch to aqueous parts cleaning, a comprehensive review was conducted to investigate issues associated with parts cleaning practices using solvent and aqueous cleaning solutions. The performance of aqueous parts cleaning was then evaluated using two small industrial part cleaning devices.

40|$|Nigeria is {{from the}} oil sector. Nigeria’s oil {{reserves}} are about 31. 5 billion barrels, while Nigeria’s crude oil production averaged 2. 118 {{million barrels per day}} in 2002. Oil spillage is a major environmental problem in Nigeria. Between 1976 and 1996 Nigeria recorded a total of 4835 oil spill incidents, which resulted in a loss of 1, 896, 960 barrels of oil to the environment. In 1998, 40, 000 barrels of oil from Mobil platform off the Akwa Ibom coast were spilt into the environment causing severe damage to the coastal environment. Oil spillage has led to very serious pollution and destruction of flora, fauna and resort centers, pollution of drinkable water, destruction of properties and lives along the Nigerian coast. Oil spillage has also caused regional crisis in the Niger Delta. Factors responsible for oil spillage in the zone are; corrosion of oil pipes and tanks, sabotage, port operations and inadequate care in oil production operations and engineering drills.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the oil {{skimming}} market and evaluate what drives company competitiveness and market attractiveness. Throughout the thesis, the total oil skimming market has been divided into an industrial market and an offshore market as these applications have entirely different requirements. However, the skimming market in general is underdeveloped and the long lifetime of the equipment has {{a negative impact on}} the market development speed. It is therefore characterised by a fragmented body of competitors and diverging pricing. Instead of price being an order-winning aspect, recovery rate and ability to pick up a large variety of oils {{has been found to be}} important.   In this inductive, and interpretivistic case study, a model for market analysis of an underdeveloped market is developed and applied to Sandvik Process Systems’ oil skimming business. The study is based on an extensive interview program with oil skimming equipment manufacturers, and oil spill response companies. The model comprises of an external, and an internal analysis synthesised into a SWOT-matrix from which five strategic directions are extracted. These directions are described as well as their respective business impact on Sandvik Process Systems.   Sandvik Process Systems’ skimmer is a steel belt skimmer developed in the 1960 ’s. With a lifting height of up to three metres and a width of up to 400 mm, the Sandvik <b>oil</b> <b>skimmer</b> is capable of lifting 354 litres per hour in optimal conditions. Compared to its competitors, the skimmer is a low cost alternative priced at 66 - 75 % below industry average.   However, the results of the analysis indicate a poor competitiveness of Sandvik Process Systems’ product. Due to an inferior technology, Sandvik Process Systems’ skimmer lacks the capacity needed to target the offshore market. Therefore, the product can only target the industrial market. Meanwhile, many competitors offer complete solution packages including as pumps, storage tanks, and a variety of specialised skimmers in order to increase their competitiveness.   Looking at the competitors it is clear that Sandvik Process Systems’ skimmer does have advantages. However, many of the advantages are based on organisational strengths which are difficult to leverage. Also, the organisation does not have any experience from the oil skimming market and due to the small size of the market, it is doubtful if Sandvik Process Systems are able to devote the necessary resources to overcome this hurdle. Due to a revenue target set at EUR 2. 33 million, Sandvik Process System’s skimmer would require a 23. 9 % of the market value or 119 % of the number of skimmers sold.   Despite this thesis reaching the conclusion that Sandvik Process Systems should not enter the oil skimming market; it also stipulates that Sandvik Process Systems does have the potential to successfully sell skimmers. However, reaching the goal of EUR 2. 33 million is deemed unlikely...|$|E

About our work: A preliminary attempt has been made by us in our laboratory to study in detail the absorption and adsorption capacity (at room temperature 22 o C), effect of salinity and reusability factor of cotton on various fractions of crude oil on Sea Water (Bay of Bengal) using various types of cotton (seeded cotton, mattress cotton, machinery/threaded cotton and clinical cotton) and readily available fuels. All the results obtained here have been recorded while performing the experiments in our laboratory and are based on our own original research. These experimental results obtained have been presented. Along with this a statistica...|$|R
40|$|In this research, oil {{pollution}} management using natural and waste materials as adsorbents was studied. Most {{of the oil}} based industries emit oily wastewater rich in heavy oil particles. Therefore, this study was mainly focused to investigate {{a solution to the}} oily wastewater. Oil pollution management was achieved in two ways as oil recovery and oil treating using two different adsorbents in two stages. In recovery stage, human hair was used as the adsorbent and experiments were carried out in two ways; as batch wise using hair pieces and continuously using a belt skimmer. Experiments revealed that human hair can recover 70. 5 % of oil from oily water and 1. 35 mL of oil was recovered per gram of hair. The skimmer belt was prepared using human hair and the unit was used for continuous <b>oil</b> recovery. <b>Skimmer</b> Experiments showed that 75 % of oil recovery after 30 rotations of the belt. The dissolved and emulsified oil amount in wastewater was not reduced in recovery section. Therefore, in treatment stage, treating the dissolved and emulsified oil is the main objective and adsorption of oil onto carbonized rice husk was studied. Though carbonized rice husk was the main adsorbent in treatment stage other adsorbents, raw rice husk and saw dust, were also tested. The optimum carbonization temperature, 600 °C and optimum carbonization period, 3 hours were used to prepare the carbonized rice husk. Batch experiments showed that carbonized rice husk has capability to adsorb 84 % of dissolved and emulsified oil from aqueous solutions within 30 minutes when adsorbent dosage is 5 g/L. Batch experiments were examined in detail for carbonized rice husk to determine the factors affecting the oil adsorption. Experiments showed that Initial solution pH, initial oil concentration, contact time, adsorbent dosage and particle size affect on oil adsorption. The adsorption kinetics of oil onto carbonized rice husk followed second order kinetic model confirming the chemisorption of oil particles onto carbonized rice husk and equilibrium data were satisfactorily fitted to Langmuir isotherm confirming monolayer oil adsorption onto the carbonized rice husk. Monolayer oil adsorption capacity of 2. 24 mg of oil/ g of carbonized rice husk was observed. Tests on oily wastewater samples from a service station showed that combination of these two units can be used effectively for treating the oily wastewater.
