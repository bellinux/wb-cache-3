500|$|James Robinson, {{the script}} editor for Planet B {{said that one}} of the main {{advantages}} of a series such as this is that it can be set anywhere saying, [...] "One week it's westerns, one week it's full-on sci-fi space operas, and that's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> things about the best sci-fi concepts. I think, you know, the Doctor Who's and the Quantum Leap's, you kind of get a different show each week." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E

60|$|He took <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> little trouts on his plate, and, {{by way of}} experiment, touched {{its tail}} with his finger. To his horror, it was {{immediately}} transmuted from an admirably fried brook-trout into a gold-fish, though {{not one of those}} gold-fishes which people often keep in glass globes, as ornaments for the parlor. No; but it was really a metallic fish, and {{looked as if it had}} been very cunningly made by the nicest goldsmith in the world. Its little bones were now golden wires; its fins and tail were thin plates of gold; and there were the marks of the fork in it, and all the delicate, frothy appearance of a nicely fried fish, exactly imitated in metal. A very pretty piece of work, as you may suppose; only King Midas, just at that moment, would much rather have had a real trout in his dish than this elaborate and valuable imitation of one.|$|E
60|$|Emily {{had grown}} into great {{sweetness}} and grace, and Mrs. Deerhurst had gone on very well. Of course, people were unkind enough to say, it was only because she had such prey in view as Lord Torwood; but, whatever withheld her, {{it is certain that}} Emily only had the most suitable and reasonable pleasures for a young lady, and was altogether as nice, and gentle, and sensible, as could be desired. There never was a bit of acting in her, she was only allowed to grow in what seemed natural to her. She was just <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> simple girls of that day, doing her quiet bit of solid reading, and her practice, and her neat little smooth pencil drawing from a print, as a kind of duty to her accomplishments every day; and filling books with neat up-and-down MS. copies of all the poetry that pleased her. Dainty in all her ways, timid, submissive, and as it seemed to me, colourless.|$|E

After leaving college I tried to please him by {{tackling}} one thing after another that he set me to do. On the square, I had no head for business. I made a mess of everything. The governor got sore. He kept ramming the harpoon into me till I just couldn't stand it. What little ability I possessed deserted me when I got my back up, and there you are. Dad and I had a rather uncomfortable half hour. When I quit--when I told him straight out that I was going West to fare for myself, why, it wouldn't have been so tough if he hadn't laughed at me. He called me a rich man's son--an idle, easy-going spineless swell. He said I didn't even have character enough to be out and out bad. He said I didn't have sense enough to marry <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> girls in my sister's crowd. He said I couldn't get back home unless I sent to him for money. He said he didn't believe I could fight--could really make a fight for anything under the sun. Oh--he--he shot it into me, all right." ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{there be}} many {{pictures}} on my mind. Of a huge manufacturing city of {{three hundred thousand}} souls lighted and warmed by natural gas, so that the great valley full of flaming furnaces sent up no smoke wreaths to the clear sky. Of Musquash itself lighted by the same mysterious agency, flares of gas eight feet long, roaring day and night {{at the corners of}} the grass-grown streets because it wasn't worth while to turn them out; of fleets of coal-flats being hauled down the river on an interminable journey to St. Louis; of factories nestling in woods where all the axe-handles and shovels in the world seemed to be manufactured daily; and last, of that quaint forgotten German community, the Brotherhood of Perpetual Separation, who founded themselves when the State was yet young and land cheap, and are now dying out because they will neither marry nor give in marriage and their recruits are very few. The advance in the value of land has almost smothered these poor old people in a golden affluence that they never desired. They live in a little village where the houses are built old Dutch fashion, with their front doors away from the road, and cobbled paths all about. The cloistered peace of Musquash is a metropolitan riot beside the hush of that village. And there is, too, a love-tale tucked away among the flowers. It has taken seventy years in the telling, for the brother and sister loved each other well, but they loved their duty to the brotherhood more. So they have lived and still do live, seeing each other daily, and separated for all time. Any trouble that might have been is altogether wiped out of their faces, which are as calm as those of very little children. To the uninitiated those constant ones resemble extremely old people in garments of absurd cut. But they love each other, and that seems to bring one back quite naturally to the girls and the boys in Musquash. The boys were nice boys--graduates of Yale of course; you mustn't mention Harvard here--but none the less skilled in business, in stocks and shares, the boring for oil, and the sale of everything that can be sold by one sinner to another. Skilled, too, in baseball, big-shouldered, with straight eyes and square chins--but not above occasional diversion and mild orgies. They will make good citizens and possess the earth, and eventually wed <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> white muslin dresses. There are worse things in this world than being [...] "one of the boys" [...] in Musquash.|$|E

[...] Reviewing it for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of a possible four, writing: [...] "The first lighthearted, laugh-oriented family Western in a long time, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> things about it is, it doesn't feel the need to justify its existence.

I mean, that was okay, so you adjust. But I think <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> things they do here is {{challenge}} the characters.

David, in a 2005 interview, believed, [...] "I was fired off Spider-Man {{because it was}} felt at the upper editorial level that a novice comic-book writer shouldn't be handling the adventures of Marvel's flagship character". Former series writer Gerry Conway, who additionally wrote Web of Spider-Man from 1988 to 1990, returned to Spectacular after which he left both books to become a story editor on the TV series Father Dowling Mysteries.

He used his joint duty as Web of Spider-Man writer to tie together storylines in the two separate titles and strengthen the continuity between them.

Recordings of The Narrative began in 2009 while they performing at concerts and especially SXSW and CMJ showcases.

During the immediate aftermath of his 1996 loss to Clinton, Dole recalled that his critics thought that [...] "I didn't loosen up enough, I didn't show enough leg. They said I was too serious [...] [...] [...] It takes several months to stop fretting about it and move on. But I did." [...] Dole remarked that his decisive defeat to Clinton made it easier for him to be [...] "magnanimous". On his decision to leave politics for good after the 1996 presidential election campaign, despite his guaranteed stature as a former Senate leader, Dole stated [...] "People were urging me to be a hatchet man against Clinton for the next four years. I couldn't see the point.
