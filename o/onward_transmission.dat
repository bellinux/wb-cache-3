The earliest recorded example was at Haywards Heath in February 1858, where coaches for Hastings were slipped from a London-Brighton express. Thereafter the practice was used by other railways. Before 1914, 21 coaches were slipped each day on the Brighton main line. Coaches were slipped at Horley and Three Bridges for stations to East Grinstead, Forest Row and Horsham, or at Haywards Heath for stations to Brighton and Eastbourne.

25|$|From the 1920s, London was {{surrounded}} by a number of large freight Marshalling yards, where long distance freight was brought and re-organised into new trains for <b>onward</b> <b>transmission</b> to its destination. Three of these yards, at Feltham, Norwood and Hither Green were operated by the Southern Railway. The requirement for a fast freight transfer locomotive between these yards, and across London to other railway yards provided a challenge for Richard Maunsell. The electrified suburban lines were busy with commuter traffic that took priority over freight workings, and the London network abounded in junctions and signal stops. The design brief called for a powerful locomotive with good acceleration and adhesion. One that was able to climb the steep gradients over the flying junctions that were to be found all over the Southern Railway's London network. The ability to operate over tight curves and be able to move from a standstill on the aforementioned gradients were also key considerations that needed to be incorporated into the design. A tank locomotive design was also preferable since the journeys were relatively short, and the work would involve frequent changes in direction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: High HIV- 1 plasma viral loads (PVLs) in sub-Saharan Africa, {{partly because}} of high rates of coinfection, {{may have been one}} of the drivers of the “explosive ” {{epidemics}} seen in that region. Using a previously published framework of infectiousness and survival, we estimate the excess <b>onward</b> HIV- 1 <b>transmission</b> events (secondary infections) resulting from coinfection-induced changes in PVL during asymptomatic HIV- 1 infection. For every 100 HIV-infected people, each suffering 1 episode of tuberculosis infection, there are 4. 9 (2. 7 th– 97. 5 th percentile: 0. 2 – 21. 5) excess <b>onward</b> HIV- 1 <b>transmission</b> events attributable to this coinfection. Other estimates are malaria 0. 4 (0. 0 – 2. 0), soil-transmitted helminths 3. 1 (0. 1 – 14. 9), schistosomiasis 8. 5 (0. 2 – 38. 6), filariasis 13. 3 (0. 3 – 89. 2), syphilis 0. 1 (0. 0 – 1. 6), herpes simplex virus 4. 0 (0. 0 – 24. 2), and gonorrhea 2. 1 (0. 1 – 8. 0) trans-missions. If these higher PVLs confer a shorter life expectancy and higher infectiousness, then their impact on transmission is, in general, reduced.

40|$|Objectives To {{estimate}} {{the costs and}} benefits of clinical pathways incorporating a point of care (POC) nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for chlamydia and gonorrhoea in genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics compared with standard off-site laboratory testing. Method We simulated 1. 2 million GUM clinic attendees in England. A simulation in Microsoft Excel was developed to compare existing standard pathways of management for chlamydia and gonorrhoea with a POC NAAT. We conducted scenario analyses to evaluate the robustness of the model findings. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Secondary outcomes included the number of inappropriate treatments, complications and transmissions averted. Results The baseline cost of using the point of POC NAAT was £ 103. 9 million compared with £ 115. 6 million for standard care. The POC NAAT was also associated with a small increase of 46 quality adjusted life years, making the new test both more effective and cheaper. Over 95   000 inappropriate treatments might be avoided by using a POC NAAT. Patients receive diagnosis and treatment on the same day as testing, which may also prevent 189 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease and 17   561 <b>onward</b> <b>transmissions</b> annually. Discussion Replacing standard laboratory tests for chlamydia and gonorrhoea with a POC test could be cost saving and patients would benefit from more accurate diagnosis and less unnecessary treatment.

We reconstructed the broad molecular epidemiology of HIV from individuals with primary HIV- 1 infection (PHI) enrolled in France in the ANRS PRIMO C 06 cohort over 15  years. ResultsSociodemographic, geographic, clinical, biological and pol sequence data from 1356 patients were collected between 1999 and 2014. Network analysis was performed to infer genetic relationships, i. e. clusters of transmission, between HIV- 1 sequences. Bayesian coalescent-based methods were {{used to examine the}} temporal and spatial dynamics of identified clusters from different regions in France. We also evaluated the use of network information to target prevention efforts. Participants were mostly Caucasian (85. 9 %) and men (86. 7 %) who reported sex with men (MSM, 71. 4 %). Overall, 387 individuals (28. 5 %) were involved in clusters: 156 patients (11. 5 %) in 78 dyads and 231 participants (17 %) in 42 larger clusters (median size: 4, range 3 – 41). Compared to individuals with single PHI (n =  969), those in clusters were more frequently men (95. 9 vs 83 %, p <  0. 01), MSM (85. 8 vs 65. 6 %, p <  0. 01) and infected with CRF 02 _AG (20. 4 vs 13. 4 %, p <  0. 01). Reconstruction of viral migrations across time suggests that Paris area was the major hub of dissemination of both subtype B and CRF 02 _AG epidemics. By targeting clustering individuals belonging to the identified active transmission network before 2010, 60 of the 143 <b>onward</b> <b>transmissions</b> could have been prevented. ConclusionThese analyses support the hypothesis of a recent and rapid rise of CRF 02 _AG within the French HIV- 1 epidemic among MSM.

50|$|In {{the second}} version, the {{analogue}} of the bucket is a queue {{in the flow}} of traffic.

Currently, there is no information systematically being collected on non-Medicare eligible HIV+ patients in Australia. The objectives {{of this study are}} to describe the population recruited to the Australian HIV Observational Database (AHOD) Temporary Residents Access Study (ATRAS) and to determine the short- and long-term outcomes of receiving (subsidized) optimal ART and the impact on onwards HIV transmission. Methods: ATRAS was established in 2011. Eligible patients were recruited via the AHOD network. Key HIV-related characteristics were recorded at baseline and prospectively. Additional visa-related information was also recorded at baseline, and updated annually. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the ATRAS cohort in terms of visa status by key demographic characteristics, including sex, region of birth, and HIV disease status. CD 4 cell count (mean and SD) and the proportion with undetectable (< 50 copies/ml) HIV viral load are reported at baseline, 6 and 12 months of follow-up. We also estimate the proportion reduction of <b>onward</b> HIV <b>transmission</b> based on the reduction in proportion of people with detectable HIV viral load. Results: A total of 180 patients were recruited to ATRAS by June 2012, and by July 2013 39 patients no longer required ART via ATRAS, 35 of whom became eligible for Medicare-funded medication. At enrolment, 63 % of ATRAS patients were receiving ART from alternative sources, 47 % had an undetectable HIV viral load (< 50 copies/ml) and the median CD 4 cell count was 343 cells/µl (IQR: 222 – 479). At 12 months of follow-up, 85 % had an undetectable viral load. We estimated a 75 % reduction in the risk of <b>onward</b> HIV <b>transmission</b> with the improved rate of undetectable viral load. Conclusions: The immunological and virological improvements highlight the importance of supplying optimal ART to this vulnerable population. The increase in proportion with undetectable HIV viral load shows the potentially significant impact on HIV transmission in addition to the personal health benefit for each individual...|$|R
40|$|Globally, HIV/AIDS claims {{more than}} two million lives each year. Further, the {{widespread}} co-infection of HIV with HBV and syphilis alters the clinical presentation with fatal consequences. Timely effective monitoring of people with HIV is crucial both in preventing those infected from developing AIDS and in limiting <b>onward</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Currently however, HIV diagnostic tools are limited to single marker detections, laboratorybased, require the input of skilled clinical personnel and are not suitable for transportation to resource limited regions – regions where infection rates are often at their highest. There is a driving need to develop new pointof-care (POC) technologies for early diagnosis and smart patient monitoring. Directly relevant to this objective, we are developing an affordable multi-functional, real-time handheld device, similar to glucose sensor, which is capable of detecting viral multiple markers from small sample volumes (e. g. a drop of blood). This approach enhances the specificity and the accuracy of early diagnosis and with the precise administration of antiretroviral drugs, HIV can be managed sustainably. Our POC prototype is based on Multi-marker Cantilever Nanosensors platform that integrates sample sorting (nanopillars) and surface capture chemistries. This technology offers many opportunities for direct detection of proteins such as antigens and antibodies against infectious organisms and potentially for the direct detection of organisms themselves without the need for labelling. Nanopillars acts as microfluidic sieve to separate and concentrate different markers of infection from clinical samples which are present in low copies. The antigens are detected and quantified by flowing across an array of cantilever nanosensors functionalised with carefully selected high affinity capture molecules raised against different (sub) types of HIV virions. Subsequently, the specific biomolecular binding event is translated into a nanomechanical signal analysed by the interference pattern created when they are illuminated by a laser. Here we find the sensor geometry and receptor chemistry are key to the limit of HIV multiple marker detection particularly in the regimens that allow for early diagnosis. We show that the cantilever arrays have the potential for highthroughput multi-target screening and are amenable for large scale production of compact, portable POC device to be used anywhere in the world...|$|R

50|$|A further {{restriction}} is {{that the}} leaky bucket as a queue traffic shaping function only transmits packets on the ticks; hence, if it is used within a network, equivalent to UPC and NPC, it also imposes a fixed phase on the <b>onward</b> <b>transmission</b> of packets. Whereas, when using a leaky bucket meter to control <b>onward</b> <b>transmission,</b> a packet is transmitted {{as soon as it}} conforms, i.e. relative to the previous one or, if it already conforms, its arrival time; not according to some arbitrary local clock. Perversely, {{in the context of the}} transfer delay, this imposition of a fixed phase that may, over time, differ from that of an otherwise conforming input packet stream, constitutes a delay variation and hence a jitter. Jitter caused in this particular way could only be observed where the delay is measured as the transit time between two separate measurement points, one either side of the leaky bucket as a queue shaping function. However, in the context of real-time data transmissions, it is this end-to-end delay that determines the latency of received data. Hence, the leaky bucket as a queue is unsuitable for traffic shaping real-time transmissions.|$|E
