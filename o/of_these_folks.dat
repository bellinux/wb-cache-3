It's a welfare cowboy mindset." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{reference}} to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: [...] "he most the DNA evidence can show is that several <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> are interrelated…. We would need an independent control sample from some member of Jesus' family to confirm that these were members of Jesus' family. We do not have that at all." [...] This quote clarifies {{the fact that the}} documentarians do not believe they have tested the DNA and have proven it to be Jesus. They simply used DNA testing to prove that the [...] "Jesus son of Joseph" [...] and the [...] "Mariamne" [...] in this tomb were not maternally related (i.e. {{that they did not have}} the same mother or grandmother). The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could just as well have been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary.|$|E
2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus that a lot <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> have appeared in genre shows in the past, {{but it was not}} designed that way. We also {{wanted to make sure that}} as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television with my parents, and we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E

6000|$|While Mr. Pleydell {{was thus}} vaunting his {{knowledge}} of his profession, the waiter reentered with Mr. Driver, his mouth still greasy with mutton pies, and the froth of the last draught of twopenny yet unsubsided on his upper lip, with such speed had he obeyed the commands of his principal. 'Driver, you must go instantly and find out {{the woman who was}} old Mrs. Margaret Bertram's maid. Inquire for her everywhere, but if you find it necessary to have recourse to Protocol, Quid the tobacconist, or any other <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folks,</b> you will take care not to appear yourself, but send some woman of your acquaintance; I daresay you know enough that may be so condescending as to oblige you.

50|$|In spite <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folk</b> etymologies, {{with the}} {{deciphering}} of the Linear B script in the 20th century, the original Greek φοῖνιξ was decisively {{shown to be}} derived from Mycenaean Greek po-ni-ke, itself open to a variety of interpretations.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Faithful, there were Dúnedain in the South who manned Númenórean garrisons at places like Umbar.

60|$|It {{had poured}} with rain {{about the time}} of their arrival, {{notwithstanding}} which they did not seem disheartened; for, of course, in this climate, it enters into all their calculations to be drenched through and through. By and by the sun shone out, and it has continued to shine and shade every ten minutes ever since. All these people were decently dressed; the men generally in dark clothes, not so smartly as Americans on a festal day, but {{so as not to be}} greatly different as regards dress. They were paler, smaller, less wholesome-looking and less intelligent, and, I think, less noisy, than so many Yankees would have been. The women and girls differed much more from what American girls and women would be on a pleasure-excursion, being so shabbily dressed, with no kind of smartness, no silks, nothing but cotton gowns, I believe, and ill-looking bonnets,-- which, however, was the only part of their attire that they seemed to care about guarding from the rain. As to their persons, they generally looked better developed and healthier than the men; but there was a woful lack of beauty and grace, not a pretty girl among them, all coarse and vulgar. Their bodies, it seems to me, are apt to be very long in proportion to their limbs,--in truth, this kind of make is rather characteristic of both sexes in England. The speech <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folks,</b> in some instances, was so broad Lancashire that I could not well understand it.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole thing}} perplexes me much; and I am {217} sure {{there must be}} an {{explanation}} which will leave Mr. Lilly's reputation for common sense and fair dealing untouched. Can it be--I put this forward quite tentatively--that Mr. Lilly is the victim of a confusion, common enough among thoughtless people, and into which he has fallen unawares? Obviously, {{it is one thing to}} say that the logical methods of physical science are of universal applicability, and quite another to affirm that all subjects of thought lie within the province of physical science. I have often declared my conviction that there is only one method by which intellectual truth can be reached, whether the subject-matter of investigation belongs to the world of physics or to the world of consciousness; and one of the arguments in favour of the use of physical science as an instrument of education which I have oftenest used is that, in my opinion, it exercises young minds in the appreciation of inductive evidence better than any other study. But while I repeat my conviction that the physical sciences probably furnish the best and most easily appreciable illustrations of the one and indivisible mode of ascertaining truth by the use of reason, I beg leave to add that I have never thought of suggesting that other branches of knowledge may not afford the same discipline; and assuredly I have never given the slightest ground for the attribution to me of the ridiculous contention that there is nothing true outside the bounds of physical science. Doubtless people who wanted to say something damaging, without too nice a regard to its truth or falsehood, have often enough misrepresented {218} my plain meaning. But Mr. Lilly is not one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> at whom one looks and passes by, and I can but sorrowfully wonder at finding him in such company.|$|E
60|$|This was Mr. Clive's {{first and}} last {{appearance}} as a gambler. J. J. looked very grave when he heard of these transactions. Clive's French friend did not please his English companion at all, nor the friends of Clive's French friend, the Russians, the Spaniards, the Italians, of sounding titles and glittering decorations, and the ladies who belonged to their society. He saw by chance Ethel, escorted by her cousin Lord Kew, passing through a crowd of this company one day. There was not one woman there who was not the heroine of some discreditable story. It was the Comtesse Calypso who had been jilted by the Duc Ulysse. It was the Marquise Ariane to whom the Prince Thesee had behaved so shamefully, and who had taken to Bacchus as a consolation. It was Madame Medee, who had absolutely killed her old father by her conduct regarding Jason: she had done everything for Jason: she had got him the toison d'or from the Queen Mother, and now had to meet him every day with his little blonde bride on his arm! J. J. compared Ethel, moving in the midst <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folks,</b> to the Lady amidst the rout of Comus. There they were the Fauns and Satyrs: there they were, the merry Pagans: drinking and dancing, dicing and sporting; laughing out jests that never should be spoken; whispering rendezvous to be written in midnight calendars; jeering at honest people who passed under their palace windows--jolly rebels and repealers of the law. Ah, if Mrs. Brown, whose children are gone to bed at the hotel, knew but the history of that calm dignified-looking gentleman who sits under her, and over whose patient back she frantically advances and withdraws her two-franc piece, whilst his own columns of louis d'or are offering battle to fortune--how she would shrink away from the shoulder which she pushes! That man so calm and well bred, {{with a string of}} orders on his breast, so well dressed, with such white hands, has stabbed trusting hearts; severed family ties; written lying vows; signed false oaths; torn up pitilessly tender appeals for redress, and tossed away into the fire supplications blistered with tears; packed cards and cogged dice; or used pistol or sword as calmly and dexterously as he now ranges his battalions of gold pieces.|$|E

60|$|At {{the best}} she was blinded, and where she lay in her {{darkness}} no man might come because of the superstitions <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folk.</b> Even if Kari became Inca, it would not help me or her, should she still live, since he was the fiercest bigot of them all and swore that he would kill me, his friend, rather than that I should touch her, the vowed to his false gods.|$|R
50|$|The folk {{literature}} {{created by}} men, women, and children consists of folk songs, song narratives, lullabies, work songs, women songs, different {{other kind of}} songs, general tales, wonder tales proverbs, riddles and so on. Telugu folk literature is very rich for all these genres. Collection and researching <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folk</b> genres has been started in the colonial period itself.

5000|$|My {{personal}} {{take on it}} is, for one, I don’t think it's {{nearly as}} visionary as any one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> have found.

And even maybe looking at the ghosts as these figures that represent fortune or prestige or things that you might be chasing at the expense of paying proper attention to your family.|$|E
50|$|Obeah is {{associated}} with both benign and malignant magic, charms, luck, and with mysticism in general. In some Caribbean nations, Obeah refers to folk religions of the African diaspora. In some cases, aspects <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folk</b> religions have survived through syncretism with Christian symbolism and practice introduced by European colonials and slave owners. Casual observation may conclude that Christian symbolism is incorporated into Obeah worship, but in fact may represent clandestine worship and religious protest.|$|R
50|$|As {{people became}} better educated {{and moved to}} the city, they lost some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folk</b> beliefs. But in the city and among educated persons alike, superstition could still be found, even in the early 1990s. Sorcerers, palm readers, and readers of cards had shops, {{particularly}} in poorer neighbourhoods, but not exclusively so. In short, a strong undercurrent of superstition still remained in Portugal. The formal Church disapproved of superstitious practices but was powerless to do much about them.|$|R

5000|$|Breen was {{notoriously}} anti-Semitic. In {{a letter}} to the Jesuit priest and then-editor of America, Rev. Wilfrid Parsons, Breen wrote that Hollywood consisted of [...] "a rotten bunch of vile people with no respect for anything beyond the making of money. Here we have Paganism rampant and in its most virulent form. Drunkenness and debauchery are commonplace. Sexual perversion is rampant...any number of our directors and stars are perverts. Ninety-five percent <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> are Jews of an Eastern European lineage. They are, probably, the scum of the earth."

5000|$|There {{were a few}} strongmen, whom {{historian}} E.

In his analysis, <b>these</b> <b>folk</b> caudillos were in contrast to Europeanized elites who viewed the lower orders with contempt. He gives examples of Juan Facundo Quiroga, Martín Güemes and other Argentine caudillos, most importantly Juan Manuel de Rosas, who were popular and populist caudillos. Burns attributes the urban elites’ bafflement and their contempt for followers <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>folk</b> caudillos {{for much of the}} negative role assigned to caudillos.|$|R
