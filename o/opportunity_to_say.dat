Others disagreed, {{asserting that the}} lyrics supported female power and sexual freedom. Martel defended Ratajkowski's performance, saying: [...] "it's very, very funny and subtly ridiculing." [...] Ratajkowski {{did not think of}} the video as sexist and claimed that the producers, through the use of humor and sarcasm, [...] "took something that on paper sounded really sexist and misogynistic and made it more interesting". She said that the song [...] "gave me an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the things that I felt about feminism today and about women in general in pop culture." [...] Ratajkowski did not feel objectified and enjoyed performing in a sexual manner: the attention given to the nudity in the video, she said, shows that America has not advanced as far as it should have, and, she believes, society represses sexuality, which is bad for both sexes.|$|E
500|$|Storylines for a {{potential}} series had been drafted by writer Mike Bullen during production of the pilot. When production on the series began, producer Christine Langan worked with him to create detailed plots for all six episodes, also acting as a script editor to redraft Bullen's work. Many of the plots were drawn from his own life; Pete and Jenny bringing up their new baby paralleled Bullen and his wife, whose first child was born in late 1997. The scenes where Pete and Jenny attend the antenatal classes were written from Bullen's memory, {{when he and his}} wife were [...] "given callipers, forceps and a suction cup to play with". The conclusion of the fourth episode, in which Pete's father dies on the way to his grandson's christening, was suggested by Harries, whose own experience of the death of his father taught him that people rarely have the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to loved ones in real life. Not all storylines were based on real life: For Karen and David's marriage guidance scenes in Episode 5, Bullen consulted the relationship support charity Relate. Actors and directors also had input into the scripts; Bullen's original script for the marriage therapy scenes ended with David shouting and apparently using a fire extinguisher as an offensive weapon. Bathurst was not convinced that was something that his character would do, as David is [...] "too much of a coward to do anything overtly" [...] and would not leave himself so [...] "exposed": ...|$|E
500|$|In 1973, Sinatra {{came out}} of his {{short-lived}} retirement with a television special and album. The album, entitled Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back, arranged by Gordon Jenkins and Don Costa, was a success, reaching number 13 on Billboard and number 12 in the UK. The television special, Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra, reunited Sinatra with Gene Kelly. He initially developed problems with his vocal cords during the comeback due to a prolonged period without singing. That Christmas he performed at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas, and returned to Caesars Palace the following month in January 1974, despite previously vowing to perform there again [...] He began what Barbara Sinatra describes as a [...] "massive comeback tour of the United States, Europe, the Far East and Australia". In July, while on a second tour of Australia, he caused an uproar by describing journalists there– who were aggressively pursuing his every move and pushing for a press conference– as [...] "bums, parasites, fags, and buck-and-a-half hookers". After he was pressured to apologize, Sinatra instead insisted that the journalists apologize for [...] "fifteen years of abuse I have taken from the world press". In the end, Sinatra's lawyer, Mickey Rudin, arranged a final concert which was televised to the nation, and Sinatra was given the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "I love your attitude, I love your booze" [...] to the Australian people. In October 1974 he appeared at New York City's Madison Square Garden in a televised concert that was later released as an album under the title The Main Event– Live. Backing him was bandleader Woody Herman and the Young Thundering Herd, who accompanied Sinatra on a European tour later that month.|$|E

As negotiations continued between the actresses and the network, Rosenthal planned a finale that [...] "could serve as an ending or a beginning of a new chapter and a new season". Graham later said that at the time they finished filming, [...] "there was a 50/50 chance we'd be returning", and requested that the finale provide [...] "an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye" [...] to the characters, in case of cancellation.

Ecstatic Grumman workers had passed the hat to buy the cigarettes in appreciation of O'Hare's combat victories in one of their F4F Wildcats. A loyal Camel smoker, Butch opened a carton, deciding that it was the least he could do for the good people back in Bethpage. In his letter to the Grumman employees he wrote, [...] "You build them, we'll fly them and between us, we can't be beaten."

2500|$|According to Diana Muir the {{earliest}} identified {{use of the}} phrase by an opponent of Zionism occurred shortly after Britain issued the Balfour Declaration. Muir also cites other pre-statehood uses, including one in 1918 by Ameer Rihami, a Lebanese-American, Christian Arab nationalist, who wrote that [...] "I would even say ... 'Give the land without a people to the people without a land' if Palestine were really without a people and if the Jews were really without a land". Rihami argued that Jews needed no homeland in Palestine because they enjoyed everywhere else [...] "equal rights and equal <b>opportunity,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the least". And a use by someone she describes as an early twentieth-century academic Arabist who wrote that, [...] "Their very slogan, 'The land without a people for the people without a land,' was an insult to Arabs of the country". American journalist William McCrackan said, [...] "We used to read in our papers the slogan of Zionism, 'to give back a people to a Land without a People,' while {{the truth was that}} Palestine was already well-peopled with a population which was rapidly increasing from natural causes".|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Instinct", Beckett {{develops}} a retrovirus to turn Wraith into humans by stripping the Iratus DNA from them. After the first subject, a Wraith girl named Ellia, experiences {{the opposite of}} the desired effect, he tests a perfected retrovirus on a captured Wraith named Michael. [...] Although the experiment works, Michael discovers his identity and reverts into a Wraith after his escape. In the season two finale, [...] "Allies", Michael contacts Atlantis with a proposal to use the retrovirus against rival Wraith hives, but Beckett realizes Michael's betrayal too late. After Michael's Wraith ships are stopped from getting to Earth in [...] "Misbegotten", the humanized Wraith are transported to an isolated planet (M8G-352), where Beckett teaches them how to administer the retrovirus. However, a group led by Michael realize their true histories and capture him. Beckett is later rescued by his teammates, not knowing that Michael has taken a sample of Beckett's DNA. A group of Ancients evict the expedition from Atlantis in the mid season three two-parter [...] "The Return". Beckett is given a surgery post at Stargate Command (SGC) on Earth, but he and some former expedition teammates return to the city to save it from Asuran siege and imminent destruction by the SGC. In [...] "Sunday", Beckett is killed while attempting to safely dispose an explosive tumor that he had removed from a patient. His body and personal effects are sent back to his family on Earth. McKay, who had developed a close friendship with Beckett, tells Beckett's mother himself. McKay later has a vision of Carson, brought on by his subconscious mind, which gives him the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye.|$|E
