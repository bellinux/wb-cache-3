All of these possibilities, with the exception of if such a star existed exactly behind or in front of Kepler-10, were effectively ruled out; even with this, the Kepler team found that if a star was indeed aligned with Kepler-10 as seen from Earth, such a star would probably not be a giant star.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals {{between the ages of}} 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia.

5|$|The {{microstructure}} of Gobioolithus eggshell has {{not been}} thoroughly studied, and heavy recrystallization of most specimens {{makes it difficult to}} examine the eggshell structure or pore system. The eggshell consists of two (or possibly three) structural layers. The inner layer, called the mammillary layer, is about half the thickness of the outer, or continuous, layer. On the outside, many specimens have a recrystallized outer layer. This could simply due to diagenesis or it could be a true external zone, which is a third layer present in most bird eggs but is rare in non-avian dinosaurs. However, a few specimens are unaffected by recrystallization. These do not have a third layer, but this does not rule <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the eggshell originally had a three layers since the external layer can easily separate {{from the rest of the}} eggshell. These specimens also reveal an angusticanaliculate pore system, which means that the pores have a low density, and are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{analyses}} {{using different}} sets of anatomical data have since cast doubt on a dromaeosaurid classification for Balaur. In 2013, a larger analysis containing {{a wide variety of}} coelurosaurs found that Balaur was not a dromaeosaurid at all, but a basal avialan, more closely related to modern birds than to Jeholornithiformes but more basal than Omnivoropterygiformes. A study published in 2014 found Balaur to be sister to Pygostylia. An independent analysis using an expanded version of the original data set (the one that found Balaur to be a dromaeosaurid) drew a similar conclusion in 2014. In 2015, researchers Andrea Cau, Tom Brougham, and Darren Naish published a study which specifically attempted to clarify which theropods were close relatives of Balaur. While their analysis could not completely rule <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> B. bondoc was a dromaeosaurid, they concluded that this result was less likely than the classification of Balaur as a non-pygostylian avialan based on several important bird-like features. Many of the presumed unique traits would in fact have been normal for a member of the Avialae. Typical bird features included the degree of fusion of the limb bones, the functional first toe, the first toe claw not being smaller than the second claw, a long penultimate phalanx of the third toe, a small fourth toe claw and a long fifth metatarsal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: On Aug 18, 2013, Sakurajima volcano in Japan erupted on a {{relatively}} large-scale. Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) had used to detect volcanic ash in the surrounding area {{on the next day}} of this eruption. The geomagnetic variation has been analyzed using geomagnetic data from Cheongyang observatory in Korea and several geomagnetic observatories in Japan. First, we reconstruct geomagnetic data by principal component analysis and conduct semblance analysis by wavelet transform. Secondly, we minimize the error of solar effect by using wavelet based semblance filtering with Kp index. As a result of this study, we could confirm that the geomagnetic variation usually occur at the moment of Sakurajima volcano eruption. However, we cannot rule <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> it could have been impacted by other factors besides volcanic eruption in other variation’s cases. This research is an exceptional study to analyze geomagnetic variation related with abroad volcanic eruption uncommonly in Korea.
