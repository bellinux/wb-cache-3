5|$|A large {{volcanic}} eruption from any volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field would have major {{effects on the}} Sea-to-Sky Highway and municipalities such as Squamish, Whistler, Pemberton and probably Vancouver. Because <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>concerns,</b> the Geological Survey of Canada is planning to create hazard maps and emergency plans for Mount Cayley, as well as Mount Meager north of the volcanic field, which experienced a major {{volcanic eruption}} 2,350years ago similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.|$|E
5|$|The tasselled {{wobbegong}} has little economic value, though its attractive skin is occasionally used for leather. In Australian waters, {{it is not}} fished and faces minimal threats. However, elsewhere in its range it may be negatively affected by extensive fishery activity and habitat degradation from pollution, blast fishing, and coral removal. Because <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>concerns,</b> the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|Like other {{volcanic}} {{zones in}} the Garibaldi Belt, volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. This {{is partly because}} the field {{is located in a}} remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the last few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt is located in a highly populated area. Because <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>concerns,</b> significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge {{on the state of the}} Garibaldi volcanoes. This improvement is continuous and will support the understanding to monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism.|$|E

25|$|Historically most U.S. ethanol {{has come}} from corn and the {{required}} electricity for many distilleries came mainly from coal. Debate ensued about ethanol's sustainability.

25|$|The {{development}} of a bioenergy industry in Ontario faces many challenges including, but not limited to, high costs owing to the small-scale nature of technologies used to convert biomass to energy and environmental issues (e.g., declining soil productivity and increased fertilizer and pesticides use) related to intensive harvesting of biomass for energy production. That said, research that {{has been carried out}} to address some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>concerns</b> suggests that the adoption of sustainable management practices that aim at maintaining ecological functions of forest and agro-ecosystems may sustain biomass production without adverse impacts to the environment.|$|E
25|$|Bioethanol {{is a form}} of {{renewable}} energy that can be produced from agricultural feedstocks. It can be made from very common crops such as hemp, sugarcane, potato, cassava and corn. There has been considerable debate about how useful bioethanol is in replacing gasoline. Concerns about its production and use relate to increased food prices due to the large amount of arable land required for crops, as well as the energy and pollution balance of the whole cycle of ethanol production, especially from corn. Recent developments with cellulosic ethanol production and commercialization may allay some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>concerns.</b>|$|E
25|$|Surface mining of coal {{completely}} eliminates existing vegetation, {{destroys the}} genetic soil profile, displaces or destroys wildlife and habitat, degrades air quality, alters current land uses, {{and to some}} extent permanently changes the general topography of the area mined. This often results in a scarred landscape with no scenic value. Of greater concern, the movement, storage, and redistribution of soil during mining can disrupt the community of soil microorganisms and consequently nutrient cycling processes. Rehabilitation or reclamation mitigates some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>concerns</b> and is required by US Federal Law, specifically the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.|$|E

25|$|The aircraft's {{radar and}} {{missiles}} {{proved to be}} effective and pilots reported that the Lightning was easy to fly. However, {{in the first few}} months of operation the aircraft's serviceability was extremely poor. This was due to the complexity of the aircraft systems and shortages of spares and ground support equipment. Even when the Lightning was not grounded by technical faults, the RAF initially struggled to get more than 20 flying hours per aircraft per month compared with the 40 flying hours that English Electric believed could be achieved with proper support. In spite <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>concerns,</b> within six months of the Lightning entering service, 74 Squadron was able to achieve 100 flying hours per aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Cronkite was {{replaced}} as anchor {{of the program}} the Monday after his retirement, March 9, 1981, by then 49-year-old Dan Rather, {{who had been with}} CBS News as a correspondent since the early 1960s and later became a correspondent for the network's newsmagazine 60 Minutes. Concerns about excessive liberalism in the media were frequently leveled at Rather, the CBS Evening News, CBS News and CBS in general. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>concerns</b> dated from Rather's position as White House correspondent for the network's news division during the Nixon administration. An interview related to the Iran–Contra affair with then-Vice President George H.W. Bush where the two engaged in a shouting match on live television did little to dispel those concerns. Rather apologized for his behavior in statements the following day.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the battle, the Athenian commanders had to decide which of several pressing tasks to focus their attention on. Conon was still blockaded at Mytilene by 50 Spartan ships, and decisive action against those ships could lead to their destruction before they had a chance to join the remainder of Callicratidas' fleet. At the same time, however, the survivors from the 25 Athenian ships sunk or disabled in the battle remained afloat off the Arginusae islands. To address both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>concerns,</b> the generals decided that all eight of them would sail with the majority of the fleet to Mytilene, where they would attempt to relieve Conon, while the trierarchs Thrasybulus and Theramenes would remain behind with a smaller detachment to rescue the survivors; both of these missions, however, were thwarted by the sudden arrival of a storm which drove the ships back into port. The Spartan fleet at Mytilene escaped, and rescuing the drowning sailors proved impossible.|$|E
