The original manuscript was not a single volume.|$|E
5|$|The {{calendar}} for the ELCA {{is similar}} to many other Western Calendars in {{that it does not}} commemorate any persons from the <b>Old</b> <b>Testament.</b> The calendars of the Orthodox Churches have <b>Old</b> <b>Testament</b> individuals, and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod has done the same. At one point there was a proposal to include a day on the Episcopal Church calendar (which was taken into consideration by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in developing the Lutheran Book of Worship) for <b>Old</b> <b>Testament</b> saints following the octave of All Saints (November 8), but this idea was ultimately rejected as tokenism.|$|E
5|$|While large {{portions}} of the <b>Old</b> <b>Testament</b> are missing, {{it is assumed that}} the codex originally contained the whole of both Testaments.
