5|$|Other {{problems}} may occur along with {{low back pain}}. Chronic low back pain is associated with sleep problems, including a greater amount of time needed to fall asleep, disturbances during sleep, a shorter duration of sleep, and less satisfaction with sleep. In addition, a majority of those with chronic low back pain show symptoms of depression <b>or</b> <b>anxiety.</b>|$|E
5|$|Speech {{assessment}} {{also contributes}} to assessment of mood, for example people with mania <b>or</b> <b>anxiety</b> may have rapid, loud and pressured speech; {{on the other hand}} depressed patients will typically have a prolonged speech latency and speak in a slow, quiet and hesitant manner.|$|E

At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare.|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Anxiety</b> <b>or</b> {{depression}} symptoms {{may increase}} the risk of developing asthma, and their interaction with obesity is not known. We aimed to assess the association of <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> depression symptoms and the joint association of these symptoms and obesity with incident asthma. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of 23 599 adults who were 19 – 55 years old and free from asthma at baseline in the Norwegian Nord–Trøndelag Health Study. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to measure <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> depression symptoms. Obesity was defined as a body mass index ≥ 30. 0 kg/m 2. Incident asthma was self-reported new cases of asthma during the 11 -year follow-up. Results Having <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> depression symptoms was associated with incident asthma [odds ratio (OR) 1. 39, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 09 – 1. 78). Obese participants with <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> depression symptoms had a substantially higher risk of incident asthma (OR 2. 93, 95 % CI 2. 20 – 3. 91) than any other group (non-obese participants without <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> depression symptoms [reference], non-obese participants with <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> depression symptoms (OR 1. 20, 95 % CI 1. 00 – 1. 45) and obese participants without <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> depression symptoms (OR 1. 47, 95 % CI 1. 19 – 1. 82) ]. The relative excess risk for incident asthma due to interaction between <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> depression symptoms and obesity was 1. 26 (95 % CI 0. 39 – 2. 12). Conclusions This study suggests that having <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> depression symptoms contributes to the development of asthma in adults. The risk of asthma may be further increased by the interaction between <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> depression symptoms and obesity...|$|R
5|$|There is {{no single}} treatment, and the {{effectiveness}} of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood <b>or</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines, while {{useful in}} the {{management}} of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia <b>or</b> <b>anxiety</b> management. Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting {{more than a quarter of}} people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Those who are long-term users of benzodiazepines should not be withdrawn rapidly, as severe anxiety and panic may develop, which are known risk factors for relapse into alcohol abuse. Taper regimes of 6–12 months have been found to be the most successful, with reduced intensity of withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep <b>or</b> <b>anxiety.</b> This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E

5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, <b>or</b> <b>anxiety</b> syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E
