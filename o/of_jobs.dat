However, domestic researchers need a further understanding on the content,measurement and other research conclusions <b>of</b> <b>job</b> embeddedness.

Furthermore, job satisfaction is an important determinant of the self-reported probability <b>of</b> <b>job</b> search, which in turn effectively predicts actual job changes.

5|$|Because the Laborers {{had more}} {{applicants}} than jobs available, {{the process for}} getting a job on the pipeline through Laborers Local 942 was a multi-tiered process.

C-level members had to have at least two years of experience outside of Alaska or be an Alaska resident for at least one year. D-level was for everyone else, and D-level people rarely got jobs. That didn't stop people from trying.
