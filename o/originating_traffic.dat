2500|$|The {{formation}} of Burlington Northern in 1970 from {{the merger of}} the Northern Pacific, the Great Northern, Burlington Route, and the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway on March 3 [...] created a stronger competitor on most Milwaukee Road routes. To boost competition, the ICC gave the Milwaukee Road the right to connect with new railroads in the West over Burlington Northern tracks. Traffic on its Pacific Extension increased substantially to upwards of four trains a day each way as it began interchanging cars with the Southern Pacific railroad at Portland, Oregon and Canadian railroads at Sumas, Washington. [...] The railroad's foothold on transcontinental traffic leaving the Port of Seattle increased so exponentially that the Milwaukee Road held a staggering advantage over BN carrying nearly 80% of the <b>originating</b> <b>traffic</b> along with 50% of the total container traffic leaving the Puget Sound (prior to severe service declines after roughly 1974).|$|E
50|$|This meant common control, as {{described}} above: all the digits were recorded, then {{passed to the}} common control equipment, the marker, to establish the call at all the separate switch stages simultaneously. A marker-controlled crossbar system had in the marker a highly vulnerable central control; this was invariably protected by having duplicate markers. The great advantage was that the control occupancy on the switches was {{of the order of}} one second or less, representing the operate and release lags of the X-then-Y armatures of the switches. The only downside of common control was the need to provide digit recorders enough to deal with the greatest forecast <b>originating</b> <b>traffic</b> level on the exchange.|$|E
50|$|The G&GR {{company was}} {{dependent}} on the Monkland and Kirkintilloch line for <b>originating</b> <b>traffic</b> from the Monklands coalfield, and when the Wishaw and Coltness Railway (W&CR) opened in 1833, its traffic from further south passed over the M&K line too. Although the G&GR had planned for locomotive operation, there was evidently also significant horse-drawn traffic. The M&KR was seeking parliamentary authority to double their line, and the G&GR {{tried to get a}} clause giving them running powers to the Wishaw and Coltness line. The G&GR argued that when the M&K line was doubled, traffic for each direction should be allocated to each track; the G&GR argued that the two tracks should be allocated to locomotive use and (their own) horse-drawn trains respectively. There was clearly friction between the two companies, arising from horse-operated G&GR trains delaying M&KR locomotive trains.|$|E
40|$|Military {{applications}} for multicasting abound. In this pa-per, we propose a multicast {{data link protocol}} for third-generation (3 G) high frequency (HF) radio networks, and evaluate its ability to support IP multicasting of military messages in HF radio networks. Background Multicasting is a one-to-many traffic delivery technique employed at the physical, link, and/or network layers. Traffic flowing from an originating node is delivered more or less simultaneously to multiple receivers. In some ap-plications, only one node <b>originates</b> <b>traffic</b> to its multicast group, while in others any member of a multicast group can <b>originate</b> <b>traffic</b> that is sent to {{all members of the}} group...|$|R
5000|$|... dIVI Translation is {{intended}} to benefit the network operators (ISPs) to effectively share the public IPv4 addresses among a set of customers (since IANA has run out of public IPv4 addresses). In parallel, it leverages IPv6 in the network {{in a manner that}} makes IPv4-customer <b>originated</b> <b>traffic</b> looks like native IPv6 traffic in the network, resulting in simplified operations. More importantly, (unlike CGN44, DS-Lite, CGN64 etc.) dIVI/dIVI-PD does not require any Stateful NAT, DNS64 and ALG in the network, thereby benefiting the network operator to not deal with any NAT logging etc. dIVI maintains end-to-end address transparency and bidirectional-initiated communications.|$|R
40|$|Usually, {{the number}} of users within a cell in a mobile {{cellular}} network is considered infinite; hence, M/M/n/k model is appropriate for new <b>originated</b> <b>traffic,</b> but {{the number of}} ongoing calls around a cell is always finite. Hence, the traffic model of handoff call will be M/M/n/k/N. In this paper, a K-dimensional traffic model of a mobile cellular network is proposed using the combination of limited and unlimited users case. A new call admission scheme (CAS) is proposed based on both thinning scheme and fading condition. The fading condition of the wireless channel access to a handoff call is prioritized compared to newly originated calls...|$|R

30|$|The model mainly {{focuses on}} road {{transport}} and calculates freight transport demand in four steps. Thus, <b>originating</b> <b>traffic</b> is identified and derived from structural data related to traffic areas (e.g., economic sectors, number of active driving employees of companies). The <b>originating</b> <b>traffic</b> is then {{determined by the}} average number of trips and destination. In a second step, the terminating traffic potentials are calculated based on the distribution of industries and recipient structure of these industries. These characteristics are used to weight originating trips to destination. Subsequently, origins and destinations are linked by their volume and potential as well as taking into account distances, for instance. In a final step, tours are generated and assigned to a network model [21].|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{wireless}} priority services (WPS) {{are provided}} using call queueing with a weighted round-robin schedule {{based on a}} fixed parameter. In this paper, we introduce a flexible, analytically-based scheme for dealing with ad-mission control in a cellular network that supports emer-gency service. In the scheduling scheme, a priority queue is used to ensure the wise utilization of system resources while guaranteeing the priority of public handoff traffic. Also, probabilistic scheduling is considered for adaptively ensur-ing the high admission rate of emergency traffic and pro-tecting public calls for different traffic demands. The ad-mission of emergency traffic and public <b>originating</b> <b>traffic</b> can be flexibly adjusted. Numerical results about the eval-uation of this strategy are presented and show an obvious improvement over related strategies...|$|E

40|$|HTTP header {{enrichment}} allows mobile {{operators to}} anno-tate HTTP connections via {{the use of}} a wide range of re-quest headers. Operators employ proxies to introduce such headers for operational purposes, and—as recently widely publicized—also to assist advertising programs in identi-fying the subscriber responsible for the <b>originating</b> <b>traffic,</b> with significant consequences for the user’s privacy. In this paper, we use data collected by the Netalyzr network trou-bleshooting service over 16 months to identify and charac-terize HTTP header enrichment in modern mobile networks. We present a timeline of HTTP header usage for 299 mobile service providers from 112 countries, observing three main categories: (1) unique user and device identifiers (e. g., IMEI and IMSI), (2) headers related to advertising programs, and (3) headers associated with network operations.
