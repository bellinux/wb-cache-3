50|$|Impact F-2: Presence of the <b>overhead</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> would {{increase}} {{the probability of a}} wildfire (Class I)- The presence of the <b>overhead</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> would create an ongoing source of potential wildfire ignitions {{for the life of the}} project. Line faults can be caused by such unpredictable events as conductor contact by floating debris, gunshots, and helicopter collisions; these events are rare but would be unavoidable. Impact F-2 is considered a significant impact because certain ignition sources are unavoidable. Due to the potential for unavoidable ignitions related to the presence of the <b>overhead</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> to occur during extreme fire weather, the presence of the project would significantly increase the likelihood of a catastrophic wildfire (Class I). The risk of ignitions and the risk of damage from a project-related ignition can be reduced, though not to a level that is less than significant.|$|E

It is shown that simulation results are very sensitive to shunt conductance values. Laboratory measurements were carried out to provide better estimations for overhead line shunt conductances. Different insulator types, arrangements, and voltage classes were considered in the measurements. The estimated values can be used as default values for <b>overhead</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> in EMTP programs...|$|R

The outcome of not fighting a wildfire in an otherwise defensible landscape under favorable weather conditions is that it is able to build in size and intensity unchecked by firefighters who are forced to wait until the fire passes through the area. Delays in containment allow for rapid fire perimeter growth. With the increase in the fire perimeter comes the potential for wind-blown embers to ignite spot fires ahead of the fire front, which further complicates fire suppression activities." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractElectromagnetic {{transient}} {{calculation of}} <b>overhead</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> is {{strongly influenced by}} the natural resistivity of the ground. This varies from 1 – 10 K (Ω•m) depending on several media factors and on the physical composition of the ground. The accuracy on the calculation of a system transient response depends in part in the ground return model, which should consider the line geometry, the electrical resistivity and the frequency dependence of the power source. Up to date, {{there are only a}} few reports on the specialized literature about analyzing the effects produced by the presence of an imperfectly conducting ground of <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> in a transient state. A broad range analysis of three of the most often used ground-return models for calculating electromagnetic transients of <b>overhead</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> is performed in this paper. The behavior of modal propagation in ground is analyzed here into effects of first and second order. Finally, a numerical tool based on relative error images is proposed in this paper as an aid for the analyst engineer to estimate the incurred error by using approximate ground-return models when calculating transients of <b>overhead</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R

This technology {{is based on}} the phenomenon that the magnetic field distribution at the top level of a transmission tower can reflect the operation states of the <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> including current amplitude and phase angle imbalances. A current source reconstruction method based on stochastic optimization strategy was developed to reconstruct the electrical parameters from the magnetic field emanated by the <b>overhead</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines.</b> This concept of current monitoring by magnetic field sensing and current source reconstruction was experimentally implemented and verified in our laboratory setup. A typical model of 500 kV three-phase <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> was simulated to further corroborate this technology.

50|$|To {{connect the}} new power station {{to the major}} load centres, a 52 mi new 110 kV wood pole line was first built to Gore.

50|$|The upgrade {{brought the}} total {{converter}} station capacity to 1348 MW (648+700 MW), however the link {{was restricted to}} 1240 MW due to the <b>overhead</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> rating restricting Pole 1's operating capacity to 540 MW. After the retirement {{of the last of}} the original submarine cables, the overall HVDC link transfer capability was restricted further to 1040 MW due to the single Pole 2 cable across Cook Strait.|$|E
