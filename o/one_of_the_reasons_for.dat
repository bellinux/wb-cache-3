5|$|Another {{impact was}} the {{competition}} with Canada that Australia and New Zealand had with Irish immigration. The increasing Irish immigration {{was seen as}} an economic boon by these antipodean countries. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the increase was due to many Irish deciding against emigrating to the warring nations of North America.|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of George I, the May Fair had fallen into disrepute and was {{regarded}} as a public scandal. The 6th Earl of Coventry, who lived on Piccadilly, considered the fair to be a nuisance and led a public campaign against it along with local residents. It was abolished in 1764. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> Mayfair's subsequent boom in property development was to keep out lower class activities.|$|E

He survived the shooting, but the incident created a huge popularity wave for MGR. This eventually helped to increase the popularity of not only MGR, but also the DMK in the election, and is attributed as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> {{the victory of the}} DMK.|$|E
5|$|After Marcello Lippi's reappointment as the {{national}} team's manager following Euro 2008, Totti {{announced that he would}} play in the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa if he were to receive a call-up; however, there was no official statement release from Totti or Lippi about a possible comeback. For the final tournament, Totti was not named in the 23-man squad, and Italy was subsequently eliminated, failing to win a match and finishing last in their group, their worst-ever World Cup performance. Diego Maradona and former national teammates Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluigi Buffon said <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> Italy's early exit was {{due to the lack of}} creative players like Totti in the team.|$|E

5|$|Before 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' {{residents}} {{worked in}} Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% {{of the economy}} in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade. In the wake of the Intifada, unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an OCHA report in 2008, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city, leading to the relocation of many businesses.|$|E
5|$|Both second-round {{candidates}} and the incumbent president were initially {{arrested by the}} junta. Members of the Military Council, which ran the country until an interim National Transitional Council was established on 15 April, said that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the coup was the incumbent civilian administration's call for Angolan help to reform the military. Following international condemnation and sanctions against leaders of the junta, an agreement was signed {{that led to the}} third place candidate in the election, Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, being selected as interim president. The presidential election was aborted and postponed {{for at least two years}} into the future. An interim government is tasked with administering Guinea-Bissau in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Coupled {{with his}} {{interest}} on cars, Lee's project of building SMI {{as a global}} automotive company started out with technical assistance from Nissan, a company {{which at the time}} of SMI's early stages was in dire financial straits. SMI's affiliation with Nissan could have been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> Renault buying a major share of the company, as Renault had become a major shareholder of Nissan by then. One of the very early planners for SMI has stated that technical affiliations for SMI were initially considered with Volkswagen, BMW or Honda. From 1998, Renault Samsung Motors sold cars in Chile with the introduction of the SQ5 (the current SM5).|$|E

5|$|Gabon gained its {{independence}} from France on 17 August 1960. The country had a relatively high standard of living and {{was considered one of}} the more stable countries in West Africa, both politically and economically. At the time of the coup, the country had an estimated US$200 average annual income {{and was one of the}} few countries in Africa with a positive trade balance, with exports exceeding imports by 30 percent. As of 1964, the country was among the largest producers of uranium and manganese in French Africa, which Time suggested was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> France's response to the coup. It also had petroleum, iron, and logging interests stationed in Gabon.|$|E
5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow a buildup of dead organic matter, which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, which was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth is {{considered}} one of the most musically influential groups that originated in the 1980s. As part of the early American thrash metal movement, the band's music was a direct influence on death metal. Sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris wrote that the mainstream success of Megadeth was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the expansion of extreme metal to countries where it had previously been unknown. The band's sound and album artwork influenced a number of thrash metal bands in the 21st century, including Toxic Holocaust and Warbringer. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Megadeth has sold 9.2 million copies of its albums in the United States between 1991 and 2014.|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the {{increase}} in the numbers of skyscrapers during the period was the growth in demand for office workers. In part this demand was fuelled by many U.S firms becoming larger and more complex, and white-collar sectors such as insurance and banking grew in scale. It was also driven by changing technology. The typewriter was joined in the office by the adding machine, the telephone and filing cabinets, all adding to the demand for office space and requiring increasingly specialised workers.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> {{the long}} period of neglect of Schubert's piano sonatas seems to be their {{dismissal}} as structurally and dramatically inferior to the sonatas of Beethoven. In fact, the last sonatas contain distinct allusions and similarities to works by Beethoven, a composer Schubert venerated. However, musicological analysis has shown that they maintain a mature, individual style. Schubert's last sonatas are now praised for that mature style, manifested in unique features such as a cyclical formal and tonal design, chamber music textures, and a rare depth of emotional expression.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> {{the move}} from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars {{would not be able}} to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E

5|$|The {{war against}} Bulgaria {{was the first}} major {{undertaking}} carried out by Basil II after his ascension to the throne in 976, although the Bulgarian attacks had begun in that year. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the ten years of inaction was the policy of one of the strongest nobles in Byzantium, Basil, who de facto ruled the Byzantine Empire {{in the first years of}} his namesake. During that time, the main objective of the government in Constantinople was to crush the rebellion of the military commander Bardas Skleros in Asia Minor between 976 and 979.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1960s the piers at Weston-super-Mare, Clevedon, Portishead and Minehead {{were served}} by the paddle steamers of P and A Campbell who ran regular {{services}} to Barry and Cardiff as well as Ilfracombe and Lundy Island. The pier at Burnham-on-Sea was used for commercial goods, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway {{was to provide a}} link between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel. The pier at Burnham-on-Sea is the shortest pier in the UK. In the 1970s the Royal Portbury Dock was constructed to provide extra capacity for the Port of Bristol.|$|E
5|$|Copp {{wrote that}} Charnwood should have {{produced}} a rapid breakthrough but concedes that the battle {{was one of the}} most difficult of the campaign. Buckley singles out poor cooperation between armoured and infantry units as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> such high Allied losses; he is critical of the habit of tanks standing off from German positions and firing the infantry onto the objective like artillery, instead of moving forward to give close support. He further notes that from the German perspective, the Anglo-Canadian forces apparently lacked the desire or ability to press home their advantages, citing Kurt Meyer's opinion that during the battle the Allies allowed the opportunity of destroying his 12th SS Panzer Division to elude them. Buckley comments on the defensive power of the British and Canadian formations. The German practice of conducting immediate local counter-attacks to retake lost ground cost them many of their best troops, losses they could ill-afford. He illustrates this with a typical action during which the Germans lost 13 tanks to British self-propelled anti-tank guns.|$|E
