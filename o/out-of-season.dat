5|$|Fishers {{have been}} trapped since the 18th century. They have been popular with trappers {{due to the}} value of their fur, which has been used for scarves and neck pieces. The best pelts are from winter {{trapping}} with secondary quality pelts from spring trapping. The lowest-quality furs come from <b>out-of-season</b> trapping when fishers are moulting. They are easily trapped, and the value of their fur was a particular incentive for catching this species.|$|E
5|$|Unlike ski jumping, {{which can}} be contested in the summer on {{specially}} equipped hills, ski flying is strictly a winter sport and {{not part of the}} Winter Olympics; no world records have therefore been set at the games. Also in contrast to ski jumping, athletes are not able to practice on ski flying hills <b>out-of-season,</b> as they are used only for competition events. Among the Alpine countries there is an unwritten gentlemen's agreement forbidding athletes under the age of 18 to participate in ski flying events, although an exception was made for 17-year-old Domen Prevc in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Singing also occurs {{outside the}} {{breeding}} season, taking place {{throughout the year}} apart from the moulting period. The songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion. The function of such <b>out-of-season</b> song is poorly understood. Eleven other types of call have been described including a flock call, threat call, attack call, snarl call and copulation call. The alarm call is a harsh scream, and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly. They chatter while roosting and bathing, making {{a great deal of}} noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby. When a flock of common starlings is flying together, the synchronised movements of the birds' wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres (yards) away.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for <b>out-of-season</b> social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E
5|$|Polled Dorsets are a {{medium-sized}} sheep that are long lived and prolific, heavy milkers. They produce hardy lambs with moderate growth and maturity that yield heavily muscled carcasses. Their fleece is very white, strong, close, free from dark fiber and extends down the legs. When shorn, fleece averages {{between five and}} nine pounds (2.23 to 4kg) in ewes and fifty to seventy percent of their fleece can be used. The staple length ranges from 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10cm) with a numeric count of 46's-58's. The fiber diameter ranges from 27.0 to 33.0 microns. At maturity, ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds (67 to 91kg), some weighing more in show condition. Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds (102 to 125kg). Dorsets are noted {{for their ability to}} be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for <b>out-of-season</b> breeding. They {{are one of the few}} breeds that have this characteristic. Multiple births are common and they work well in commercial operations, including programs where rams are specifically used to sire lambs for slaughter. These rams are known as terminal sires since their genetics are more suitable for slaughter than breeding purposes.|$|E
5|$|When {{alerted to}} the {{possibility}} of Michael Farrar having been poisoned in the months before the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the castor beans that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The label on the seed packets identified them as a product of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer found contact information for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten packets of the <b>out-of-season</b> seeds and explained that she needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer. Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of castor beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having become ill earlier in the year.|$|E
25|$|Flooded {{cultivation}} {{has some}} advantages over dry-land cultivation: higher yields (about double), <b>out-of-season</b> production (which {{may result in}} higher prices), and weed control (which flooding facilitates). On the other hand, in flooded production systems taro requires a longer maturation period, investment in infrastructure, and higher operational costs, and monoculture is likely.|$|E
25|$|This {{sudden and}} intense storm was {{especially}} unusual because it occurred in December, while the typical rainy season in coastal Venezuela lasts from May to October. These <b>out-of-season</b> rains formed when a cold front interacted with a moist southwesterly {{flow in the}} Pacific Ocean. This interaction produced moderate to heavy rainfall starting {{in the first week}} of December and culminating in the 14–16 December event that caused the deadly floods and debris flows.|$|E
25|$|During one OOF {{meeting in}} June, a Motion {{was made on}} behalf of Dr. Spong and OrcaLab to use OOF funds to {{contract}} commercial fishermen from the Namgis First Nation of Johnstone Strait, BC, to catch and provide wild salmon for Springer {{while she was in}} her seapen in Dongchong Bay, Hanson Island, the repatriation site and territory of the Namgis. If the money were approved, Dr. Spong would help arrange an <b>out-of-season</b> fishing permit from DFO, and Namgis Chief Bill Cranmer would put together a boat and crew. A member of OOF, together with a representative from NMFS present at the meeting, urged instead the use of farmed Atlantic salmon provided by a local aquaculture company, even though the First Nations in the region were adamantly opposed to fish farms in their waters. It was argued that the logistics of feeding Springer wild fish was too much to take on for the team, particularly this close to the capture date.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the large}} number of unusual dishes, Schwa is perhaps best known for Carlson's simple, modern {{interpretation}} of Italian classics. Among the most popular dishes is the quail egg ravioli, which has been on the menu since day one. [...] Considered the restaurant's signature dish, it consists of a single ravioli stuffed with quail egg yolk and laced with truffle butter. [...] Schwa is known for emphasizing locally grown produce, and many dishes feature organic ingredients. [...] However, The Local Beet (a website that promotes eating locally grown food) questioned Schwa's commitment to the principle, noting the use of <b>out-of-season</b> strawberries and peas. Most dishes are served with purées.|$|E
500|$|Mills {{noted that}} consequentialism does not merely {{expect that the}} {{consequences}} to one entity is determined. It requires {{a review of the}} consequences to all. When Marty observes Judd's <b>out-of-season</b> shooting of a deer, he uses the incident to blackmail him to sell Shiloh to him. However, this places deer in the future in danger of Judd's hunting. Marty sadly reflects: [...] "By lettin' him get away with this, I'm putting other deer in danger. He kill this one out of season, he'll figure maybe he can kill some more. To save Shiloh, I'm making it harder for deer". In essence, he selects the [...] "domestic love over the grander principle".|$|E

Noctilucent clouds are not fully understood and are a recently discovered meteorological phenomenon; there is no confirmed record of their observation before 1885, although {{they may have been}} observed a few decades earlier by Thomas Romney Robinson in Armagh. [...] Doubts now surround Robinson's <b>out-of-season</b> records, following observations, from several points around high northern latitudes, of NLC-like phenomena following the Chelyabinsk bolide entry in February 2013 (outside the NLC season) that were in fact stratospheric dust reflections visible after sunset.|$|E
500|$|Christine Mitchell, {{reviewing}} the Chawton House reprint in 2010 for the Jane Austen Society of North America, [...] wrote that Eliza Smith's book [...] "met the growing {{need for a}} text to assist women with their task of maintaining a household." [...] She quotes Elizabeth Wallace's introduction as saying that it gives modern readers reason to appreciate having a refrigerator and a global food system that brings us <b>out-of-season</b> produce. Yet, she observes, the English housewife had many varieties of vegetables, 30 kinds of seafood and 35 kinds of poultry (including hares and rabbits). She notes that the book also describes home remedies, the housewife having to function as [...] " [...] chef, doctor, pharmacist, exterminator, chemist, laundress, and all-around handy-woman." [...] Reflecting that the recipes would [...] "probably never" [...] be used today, and the medicines are useless, the book remains invaluable for researchers, gives readers {{a glimpse into the}} world of Jane Austen and her contemporaries, and richly documents eighteenth-century English life.|$|E

60|$|The {{place had}} the true <b>out-of-season</b> charm. There were two stately dining-rooms besides {{the one where}} we dined, and there were {{pleasant}} spaces where we had afternoon tea or after-dinner coffee, and from which a magnificent stairway ascended to the upper halls, and a quiet lift waited our orders, with the landlord or his son to take us up; and so lonely and quiet and gentle, with porters and chambermaids speaking beautiful Tuscan, and watchful attendants everywhere prophesying and fulfilling our wants. It was a keeping to make the worst believe in their merit, and we were not the worst. Outside, the environment flattered or rewarded us with a garden of laurel and other evergreens, and with flower-beds where the annuals were beginning to show the gardener's designs in their sprouting seeds. Beyond these ample villa bounds a tram-car murmured {{to and from the}} well-removed city, and beyond its track lay a line of open-air theatres and variety shows and bathing establishments, as at our own Atlantic City, but here in enduring masonry instead of the provisional wood of our summer architecture.|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned away}} with impatience and, glancing about the room, {{perceived}} {{on a small}} table of the same type as the secretary a somewhat massive book with the label of a circulating library, which she proceeded to pick up as for refuge from the impression made on her by her boy. He watched her do this and watched her then slightly pause at the wide window that, in Buckingham Crescent, commanded the prospect they had ramified rearward to enjoy; a medley of smoky brick and spotty stucco, of other undressed backs, of glass invidiously opaque, of roofs and chimney-pots and stables unnaturally near--one of the private pictures that in London, in select situations, run up, as the phrase is, the rent. There was no indication of value now, however, in the character conferred on the scene by a cold spring rain. The place had moreover a confessed <b>out-of-season</b> vacancy. She appeared to have determined on silence for the present mark of her relation with Harold, yet she soon failed to resist a sufficiently poor reason for breaking it.

60|$|The {{inhabitants}} of San Sebastian will {{not hesitate to}} say that it is the prettiest town in Spain, and I do not know that they could be hopefully contradicted. It is very modern in its more obvious aspects, with a noble thoroughfare called the Avenida de Libertad for its principal street, shaded with a double row of those feathery tamarisks, and with handsome shops glittering on both sides of it. Very easily it is first of the fashionable watering-places of Spain; the King has his villa there, and the court comes every summer. But they had gone by the time we got there, and the town wore the dejected look of <b>out-of-season</b> summer resorts; though there was the apparatus of gaiety, the fine casino at one end of the beach, and the villas of the rich and noble all along it to the other end. On the sand were still many bathing-machines, but many others had begun to climb for greater safety during the winter to the street above. We saw one hardy bather dripping up from the surf and seeking shelter among those that remained, but they were mostly tenanted by their owners, who looked shoreward through their open doors, and made no secret of their cozy domesticity, where they sat and sewed or knitted and gossiped with their neighbors. Good wives and mothers they doubtless were, but no doubt glad to be resting from the summer pleasure of others. They had their beautiful names written up over their doors, and were for the service of the lady visitors only; there were other machines for gentlemen, and no doubt it was their owners whom we saw gathering the fat seaweed thrown up by the storm into the carts drawn by oxen over the sand. The oxen wore no yokes, but pulled by a band drawn over their foreheads under their horns, and they had the air of not liking the arrangement; though, for the matter of that, I have never seen oxen that seemed to like being yoked.|$|E
