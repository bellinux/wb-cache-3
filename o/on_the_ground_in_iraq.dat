The 550 combat troops deployed on an overwatch mission in central southern Iraq were withdrawn in mid-June 2008, fulfilling an election promise.

As of early 2009 around 150 support personnel remained in Iraq. In contrast, the Australian force in Afghanistan was expanded, with Rudd announcing in April 2009 an increase from 1,100 to 1,550 personnel.|$|E

50|$|In the April 7, 2014 meeting, Maliki {{claims that}} the Americans “lied” about their {{armament}} commitments. A letter addressed to Maliki, dated April 15, 2014, from the overseer of the US weapons delivery program to Iraq {{seems to be a}} direct response to Maliki’s claim. It began with “We have provided you with all that you have asked for.” The significance of this letter is in the clarity that was available to the US administration as to the actual conditions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> at the time. President Obama had made the jayvee analogy to David Remnick a few months earlier. Clearly, there was far more direct engagement by the US in Iraq and the consequent ability to judge the potential for a wider conflict should have been better than the public statements of the Obama administration would indicate.|$|E
50|$|Some {{predicted}} {{that if there}} wasn't a balance of representation between Sunnis and Shias, {{that the country was}} at risk of increased insurgency and perhaps civil war. The current insurgency, lacking the command and control infrastructure needed for large scale military operations, is not equipped to stage more than a haphazard guerrilla campaign. The withdrawal of 150,000 U.S. and British troops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> as desired by about 82 percent of Iraqis, is likely to remove motivation for internal Iraqi conflict, since only about one percent of Iraqis believe that the coalition troops are responsible for any improvements in security in Iraq. According to an interview with Rajaa al-Bhayesh, a political scientist at Baghdad's Mustansiriya University, fear of wider civil conflict—beyond the likely continuation of violence by fringe groups like al Qaeda—is likely to promote the spirit of compromise.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a series}} of ads that may have {{received}} the most attention for the group, VoteVets.org presented three generals, two of whom were commanders <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> who became critical of President Bush's execution of the war. Those were Major General (ret.) John Batiste, Major General (ret.) Paul Eaton, and General Wesley Clark. Major General Batiste had commanded the First Infantry Division in Iraq, and Major General Eaton {{had been the first}} to be in command of rebuilding Iraqi Defense Forces {{after the fall of the}} Saddam regime. Those ads ran in the districts of Congressmen and Senators that the group felt were ready to abandon the President on the war. In fact, four targets of the ad were part of the so-called [...] "gang of eleven" [...] Republicans who went to the White House to complain to President Bush about the war, right after the ad aired.

Following the mandate of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, The president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, was forced to allow UN inspectors back to his country in November 2002. UN Resolution 1441 was an actual enhancement of previous United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 and provided: [...] "that Iraq shall provide UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) immediate, unimpeded, unconditional, and unrestricted access to any and all, including underground, areas, facilities, buildings, equipment, records, and means of transport which they wish to inspect, as well as immediate, unimpeded, unrestricted, and private access to all officials and other persons whom UNMOVIC or the IAEA wish to interview in the mode or location of UNMOVIC’s or the IAEA’s choice pursuant to any aspect of their mandates".|$|E

5000|$|Aside from {{traditional}} media, {{there exists a}} new form of journalism in Iraq - citizen journalism. Blogging has become a major source of information for people in Iraq and around the world on popular opinion. Since 2003, the Iraqi blogosphere grew to include many people who either previously had no background in journalism or means to make their voices heard. One prominent Iraqi blogger is a dentist who lives in London, for example, and runs his own personal blog as well as a forum for English-speaking Iraqis. Iraq has had a long history of outward migration of its citizens for both political and economic reasons, beginning most heavily in the 1940s. So, engaging the Iraqi exile and refugee community in dialogues about developments <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> brings back in {{a large portion of the}} Iraqi citizenry that has previously been unable to join in the debates. Youth in particular are participating in this mechanism for communication, feeling that they finally have a way to project their opinions. Voices that had been silenced are now being heard and are providing a service in an environment where traditional media is falling short of delivering sufficient information about events and sentiments on the ground. During the 2005 referendum on the Iraqi Constitution, bloggers were instrumental in conveying the opinions and recommendations of Iraqis.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his role}} as Special Presidential Envoy, McGurk has worked to {{organize}} a global coalition of nations as well as coalitions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Syria to help eject ISIL from its strongholds. He was intimately involved, for example, in negotiating agreements between Arabs and Kurds {{to prepare for the}} liberation of Mosul. He also helped lead negotiations with Turkey to open Incirlik airbase for counter-ISIL missions, and prepare the historic defense of Kobani in Syria by negotiating with Turkey to permit the Kurdish Peshmerga to enter the besieged city through Turkish territory. McGurk has since visited the battlefields of Kobani where he met officials from the Kurdish Democratic Union Part (PYD) and its People's Protection Units (YPG),as well as the front lines in Mosul to meet with Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish Pershmerga prior to an offensive to secure {{the eastern side of the}} city. He met with former PKK members in Kobene and took a plaque from them. [...] He has also helped rally the global coalition for military and financial contributions to support major counter-ISIL operations in Iraq and Syria, with emphasis on post-conflict stabilization and returning the displaced to their homes. In August 2017, McGurk stated that the Trump administration had [...] "dramatically accelerated" [...] the U.S.-led campaign against ISIL, citing estimates that almost one-third of the territory taken from ISIL [...] "has been won in the last six months." [...] McGurk favorably cited [...] "steps President Trump has taken, including delegating decision-making authority from the White House to commanders in the field." ...|$|E
