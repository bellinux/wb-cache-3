50|$|In Europe, where {{production}} and use <b>of</b> <b>whip</b> <b>cream</b> chargers originated, there are presently 3 factories involved in its production. Standard size for <b>whip</b> <b>cream</b> chargers is 8 grams of nitrous oxide per cartridge. <b>Whipped</b> <b>cream</b> chargers {{are intended for}} low-volume or occasional use, such as home kitchens, restaurants, and coffee shop applications. For very high volume commercial use, there do exist regulated tank systems for filling much larger containers and dispensing more <b>whipped</b> <b>cream.</b> These are more desirable if volume is in excess of a production level of 10 liters per hour. <b>Whipped</b> <b>cream</b> chargers {{are designed to be}} opened with a device that punctures the thin metal seal at the narrow end <b>of</b> the tube; <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> dispensers have this integrated into the device's cap.|$|R
25|$|Gibraltarian cuisine is {{the result}} of a long {{relationship}} between the Andalusian Spaniards and the British, as well as the many foreigners who made Gibraltar their home over the past three centuries. The culinary influences include those from Malta, Genoa, Portugal, Andalusia and Britain. This marriage of tastes has given Gibraltar an eclectic mix of Mediterranean and British cuisine. Profiteroles, a French choux pastry ball with a sweet filling <b>of</b> <b>whipped</b> <b>cream,</b> is considered to be Gibraltar's national dish. These are often served after a meal including Calentita, a baked bread-like dish made with chickpea flour, water, olive oil, salt and pepper.|$|E
500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{many of the}} scenes in [...] "The Reporter" [...] were improvised by the actors. For example, Chris Pratt changed the {{original}} line about Mark, [...] "He's thinking with his wiener instead of his brain," [...] to [...] "He's thinking {{with the head of}} his wiener, instead of the head of his brain." [...] Aziz Ansari also improvised the line about Mark, [...] "That dude has stuck it in some crazy chicks." [...] Schur was surprised NBC censors allowed either of the lines to stay in the episode. The clip of Leslie trying to confront a raccoon loose in the city hall building was originally filmed for a Parks and Recreation commercial, but was later included into this episode. The scene was filmed to establish a running gag that Pawnee has a terrible raccoon infestation problem. The J.J.'s Diner eatery featured in the episode was named after Goor's wife. Poehler speedily eats tremendous amounts <b>of</b> <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> on her waffles. This was inspired by Parks and Recreation story editor Rachel Axler, who producer Morgan Sackett said is [...] "a tiny, bird-like woman" [...] who eats enormous amounts <b>of</b> <b>whipped</b> <b>cream.</b>|$|E

Chemical analyses consist of moisture content and water activity variables, while physical analyses consist of overrun and stiffness variables, also observation on decoration properties. The second objective {{of this study is to}} determine the <b>whipping</b> <b>cream</b> premix shelf-life based on its chemical and physical characteristics. The <b>whipping</b> <b>cream</b> premix shelf-life measured using Accelerated Shelf Life Test (ASLT) Arrhenius Model, with three different extreme temperatures, i. e. 21 °C, 27 °C and 37 °C.

Based on water activity variable, the shelf-life <b>of</b> <b>whipping</b> <b>cream</b> premix on supermarket temperature (25 °C) is 250 days...|$|R
40|$|Vegetable <b>whipped</b> <b>creams</b> are {{nowadays}} {{a popular}} {{alternative to the}} traditional dairy <b>whipped</b> <b>creams.</b> The emulsions standing at the base <b>of</b> vegetable <b>whipped</b> <b>creams</b> are classified as O/W emulsions. During whipping air is incorporated and entrapped by a fat crystallize network. This is achieved by the fat droplets interaction through the partial coalescence mechanism. Hence {{the presence of a}} crystalline fat phase is imperative within the formulation <b>of</b> the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream.</b> In order to control the partial coalescence and stabilize both the emulsion and the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream,</b> emulsifiers are required. Therefore in such systems, proteins and LMW surfactants coexists and dictate the degree and rate of partial coalesce. This allows the tailoring of the sensorial attributes and physico-chemical properties <b>of</b> the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> (e. g. stability, overrun, texture). Nevertheless the impact of the components on the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> properties has to be understood as a whole and not as individual effects of fats, proteins and LMW surfactants...|$|R

Every little helps, as the tod says, when, etc. At night at the Theatre de Madame, where we saw two petit pieces, Le Mariage de Raison, and Le plus beau jour de ma vie--both excellently played. Afterwards at Lady Granville's rout, which was as splendid as any I ever saw--and I have seen beaucoup dans ce genre.

40|$|<b>Whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are oil-in-water {{emulsion}} which by whipping can be formed to a foam by {{the incorporation of}} air into the system. Traditionally <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are made out of milk but today imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> based on vegetable fat has gained {{a large share of}} the marked due to their many benefits compared to traditionally <b>whipping</b> <b>creams.</b> Imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are both cheaper and more flexible than traditionally creams. By vary the characteristics of the fat system and the cream recipe the properties of the imitation creams can be adapted to fit the purpose of a specific product. The aim of this thesis was to increase the understanding of how different types of fat systems and other ingredients affect the properties <b>of</b> imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> based on vegetable fat. This was done by studying three vegetable fat systems with different physicochemical properties. The properties of the fat systems were characterized and the three fat systems were then used for making different imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams.</b> The properties <b>of</b> the creams were characterized and the properties of the fat systems and the creams were assessed and compared with each other. The study showed that the fat characteristics that generally seem to have the highest impact on the properties <b>of</b> <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are the structure, the solid fat content and the crystallization temperature of the fat. A fat solution with a hard structure, a high crystallization temperature and a high solid fat content at a wide range of temperatures overall seem to provide the <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> with the best properties. This as these fat properties provide the creams with a high foam stability, a high overrun and a short whipping time. This study has also shown that other ingredients than the fat systems provide the creams with diverging properties. This is best shown by the results of the freeze-thaw stability which indicate that a recipe with a high amount of sugar seem to provide the <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> with good freeze-thaw stability. Other properties <b>of</b> the <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> also seem to be very much influenced by other ingredients than the fat systems but further studies are needed to provide clarity to the complexity of the interplay of the ingredients in <b>whipped</b> <b>creams...</b>|$|R
