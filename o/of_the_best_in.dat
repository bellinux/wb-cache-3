5|$|The 1984 draft {{class is}} {{considered}} to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> NBA history as it produced five Hall of Famers and seven All-Stars. However, it was also marked by the Blazers' selection of Sam Bowie, considered one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history. It is believed that the Blazers picked Bowie over Michael Jordan because they already had an All Star shooting guard in Jim Paxson and a young shooting guard in Clyde Drexler, whom they drafted in the 1983 draft. Although Drexler went on to have a successful career, Bowie's career was cut short by injuries; he had missed two of the past three seasons in his college career as well. Despite having a 10-year career in the NBA and averaging 10.9points and 7.5rebounds per game, Bowie's career was interrupted by five leg surgeries, which limited him to 139games in 5years with the Blazers.|$|E
