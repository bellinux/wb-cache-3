25|$|Mayonnaise is an <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsion</b> {{which is}} stable at room {{temperature}} because it reaches phase equilibrium. At freezing temperatures, the structures inside mayonnaise undergo crystallization {{depending on the type}} of emulsion. Unlike mayonnaise, butter is a water-in-oil emulsion with the water phase having a higher freezing point than oil. When frozen, the small water droplets suspended in the continuous oil phase freeze where they are, while the rest of the oil stays in place. On thawing the butter, it regains its properties as the water droplets melt in their original locations.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional {{mayonnaise}} is {{a mixture}} of egg, vinegar, oil and spices (especially mustard). Mayonnaise made in this fashion typically contains 70–80% fat. Despite the high oil content relative to water, mayonnaise is an <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsion.</b> This emulsion is formed by first mixing the eggs, vinegar and mustard and then slowly blending in the oil. This results in an emulsion consisting of a closely packed [...] "foam" [...] of oil droplets. By contrast, if the oil and aqueous phases are mixed all at once the result is a water-in-oil emulsion similar in viscosity to the oil from which it is made. Without an emulsifying agent oil floats on top of water forming separate layers.|$|E

This work examined the potential of <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> as a lycopene delivery system for foods. <b>Oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> containing lycopene were prepared using different kinds of surfactant (cationic, anionic, and nonionic) and oil types (corn oil, stripped corn oil, and hexadecane). The formation of fatty acid oxidation products and the degradation of lycopene and tocopherol were then monitored. Fatty acids and lycopene had greater stability in <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> stabilized by cationic dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) or nonionic polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether than by anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Oxidative stability in the corn <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> stabilized by SDS was in the following order: tocopherol 3 ̆c lycopene 3 ̆c fatty acids. When emulsions were prepared using different carrier oils, the lycopene stability was in the following order: nonstripped corn oil 3 ̆e hexadecane 3 ̆e tocopherol-stripped corn oil. Lycopene degradation rates were similar in emulsions with and without fatty acids, suggesting that lycopene loss was independent of the presence of fatty acids. These results suggest that the stability of lycopene in <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> could be inhibited by altering the emulsion droplet interface and by the presence of tocopherols...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of emulsified olive oil stabilizing systems used for pork backfat replacement on frankfurter characteristics. The <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> were stabilized with various protein systems formulated using sodium caseinate, soy protein isolate, meat protein and microbial transglutaminase. These emulsions presented excellent fat and water binding properties, with no noticeable release of exudate after heating. Penetration parameters differentiated several types of rheological behaviour in <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> as affected by the emulsified olive oil stabilizing system. Generally frankfurters made with the different <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> presented good water and fat binding properties, greater (P< 0. 05) hardness, cohesiveness and chewiness and poorer (P< 0. 05) adhesiveness than control (all pork fat) frankfurters. Matrix morphological characteristics of frankfurters were affected by the type of <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> used as non-meat ingredients.

40|$|Citral {{stability}} in <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> at pH 3. 0 with solid or liquid octadecane was determined. Citral degradation was faster in anionic {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) -stabilized emulsions than non-ionic polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether (Brij) -stabilized emulsions. Crystallization of octadecane in both Brij- and SDS-stabilized emulsion droplets resulted in faster degradation of citral. Crystallization of octadecane in emulsion droplets increased citral partitioning into the aqueous phase, with 41 - 53 % of the total citral in the aqueous phase when octadecane was solid compared to 18 - 25 % when octadecane was liquid. This research suggests that factors that increase partitioning of citral out of the droplets of <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> increase citral degradation rates.

40|$|<b>Oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> have {{wide range}} of {{applications}} in food industry because of their structure-forming properties, and as delivery systems of polyunsaturated fatty acids into foods. The thermodynamic instability of oil and water, and high susceptibility of unsaturated fatty acids to oxidation lead to physical and oxidative stability in <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions.</b> These instability processes are generally controlled by incorporating proteins and polysaccharides into <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate xanthan/enzymatically modified guar (XG/EMG) polysaccharides on the physical and oxidative stability of 2 wt% whey protein stabilized <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> containing 20 % v/v menhaden fish oil. Enzymatic modified guar gum was obtained by hydrolyzing native guar gum using α-galactosidase enzyme. Emulsions were prepared for guar gum (GG), xanthan gum (XG), xanthan/guar (XG/GG), and xanthan/enzymemodified guar (XG/EMG) gum mixtures using 0, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 15, 0. 2, and 0. 3 % gum concentrations. Emulsions were then evaluated for creaming, viscosity, particle size, and microstructure to evaluate the physical stability, and peroxide value, TBARS value and GC-MS solid phase micro extraction (SPME) experiments were performed to evaluate the oxidative stability. Emulsions containing XG/EMG gum mixtures exhibited better creaming stability and higher viscosity of all the emulsion types. However, XG/EMG gum concentrations did not affect the droplet size of the emulsions. The microstructures revealed decreased flocculation in emulsions with XG/EMG mixtures. The primary and secondary lipid oxidation measurements indicated that emulsions containing XG/EMG gum mixtures were more effective in preventing the lipid oxidation of all the emulsion types. From the results, it is evident that XG/EMG gum mixtures can be used as emulsifiers in <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> to increase both physical and oxidative stability...|$|R

The protein concentration within the cheese matrix is directly proportional to the viscosity of the solution due to their interactions with hydrated protein molecules. Therefore, the continuous phase of the <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsion</b> has a greater contribution to the viscosity of the cheese product over than the discontinuous phase.|$|E
30|$|The {{requirements}} {{of an effective}} and economic transportation of heavy crude oils as <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> are to have the highest oil content for the targeted viscosity reduction. The viscosity of the emulsion desired to reduce the pumping cost is around 400 cP at ambient temperature. The viscosity of the <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> is generally very low below the phase inversion point (i.e. the change of the continuous phase from water to oil). Above phase inversion, water-in-oil emulsions result in sharp increase in emulsion viscosity. Hence, phase inversion point of a certain oil/water system should be avoided.|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{abundance}} of water phase in oilfield operations as it is produced along with the oil in often large quantities, viscosity reduction in heavy crude oils and bitumens {{can be achieved by}} transporting these crude oils as <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> (Langevin et al. 2004). This does not impose any operational problems during emergency shutdowns (Simon and Poynter 1970) since emulsions can be stabilized {{for long periods of time}} using nonionic surfactants because they are cheap and thermodynamically stable in saline water (Rivas et al. 1998). Emulsions are prepared by mixing the oil and water phases through stirring and/or flow through flow restrictions such as valves and chokes. The produced <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> can have a viscosity more than two orders of magnitude lower than the oil (Yaghi and Al-Bemani 2002). An additional advantage of the transport of heavy oil via <b>oil-in-water</b> <b>emulsions</b> is the reduction in pipe corrosion sediment formation (Poynter and Tigrina 1970).|$|R
