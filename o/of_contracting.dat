5|$|Many equestrians were publicans, {{in charge}} of tax-collecting in Asia (Asia in Roman times meant {{essentially}} the Roman-dominated area that is now referred to as western Anatolia), and <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> for construction projects. The equestrian class would get to control a court that tried senators for misconduct in provincial administration. In effect, the equestrians replaced senators already serving at the court. Thus, Gaius became an opponent of senatorial influence. Other reforms implemented by Gaius included fixing prices on grain for the urban population and granting improvements in citizenship for Latins and others outside the city of Rome.|$|E

40|$|This chapter surveys {{major issues}} arising in the {{economic}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> law. It begins with an introductory discussion of scope and methodology, and then addresses four main topics that correspond to the major doctrinal divisions of the law <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> These divisions include freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> (the extent <b>of</b> private power to create binding obligations), formation <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> (the procedural mechanics of exchange, and the rules that govern pre-contractual behavior), contract interpretation (the consequences that follow when agreements are ambiguous or incomplete), and enforcement of contractual obligations (the choice between private and public enforcement, and the legal remedies that follow from breach <b>of</b> <b>contract).</b> In each <b>of</b> these sections, we provide an economic analysis of relevant legal rules and institutions, and of the connections between legal arrangements and corresponding topics in microeconomic theory, such as welfare economics and the theory <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> Coase Theorem, contract formation, incomplete <b>contracts,</b> breach <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> remedies for breach...|$|R

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|In India, Fairley {{continued}} his research into schistosomiasis. The disease was unknown in India but snails were abundant {{and there was}} danger that troops returning from Egypt might introduce it. In the absence of human schistosoma, Fairley investigated bovine schistosoma, which infected water buffalo and other domesticated animals in the Bombay area. Experiments with monkeys proved that daily intravenous doses of tartaric acid were an effective treatment. Fairley also carried out pioneering work on Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis). However, his main interest was Tropical sprue. But {{he was unable to}} determine its cause or discover a cure; in spite <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> the disease himself and making some advances in its treatment. He was invalided out of India, travelling to the United Kingdom to recuperate in 1925. While in India he had met Mary Evelyn Greaves, and they were married at the Presbyterian Church, Marylebone, on 28 October 1925.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{a series}} of Historical Public Exposure Studies were {{conducted}} to assess past releases and public exposures. For example, the figure at right illustrates the calculated lifetime cancer risk to a laborer from the 1957 Rocky Flats fire. The key shows the cancer risk due to exposure during the 1957 event per million persons. This figure means that an outdoor laborer in the reddest part of Arvada would have roughly a two-in-a-million risk <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> cancer (0.000002) from being outside during the 1957 fire.

50|$|Although the Restatement <b>of</b> <b>Contracts</b> {{is still}} an {{influential}} academic work, certain aspects have been superseded in everyday legal practice by the Uniform Commercial Code.

5|$|While living indoors {{decreases}} the risk <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> certain diseases, living in close quarters with other rats, {{being unable to}} always seek proper protection from environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity), being fed an unhealthy diet, and the stresses inherently associated with living in an unnatural habitat can all adversely affect a rat's health {{to make them more}} prone to specific conditions. Specifically, Tyzzer's disease, protozoic infections (e.g. Giardia muris), and pseudotuberculosis are usually seen in stressed or young rats. Additionally, pet rats are exposed to Streptococcus pneumoniae, a zoonotic disease caught from humans, not the same bacteria associated with strep throat. A human-associated fungus, Pneumocystis carinii (also found in almost all domesticated animals) is usually asymptomatic in the rat, unless the rat's immune system is compromised by illness. If this occurs the infection can develop into pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in HD {{is generally}} around 20years following {{the onset of}} visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and {{an increased risk of}} aspirating food or drink both increase the risk <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> pneumonia. The second greatest risk is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, physical injury from falls, and malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|When {{emergency}} services arrived, they were initially {{unable to provide}} assistance as the high temperatures of the molten steel prevented them from entering the area {{and they had to}} wait for the steel to cool. When they were eventually able to access the area, they discovered thirty-two workers had been killed by the spill. Six others in the room survived and were rushed to the hospital with severe burns. According to doctors, five workers were initially listed as being in a stable condition, with the others listed as critical. They were said to be of risk <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> infections through their burns. However, an earlier statement on the website of the State Administration of Work Safety published conflicting information, saying that the thirty-two deceased represented everyone in the room at the time, and that only two people were injured - the operators of the ladle. The official Xinhua press agency also released a report stating that the ladle fell on workers below, but this was unclear as in to whether the workers were in fact crushed or whether this, too, conflicted with the other reports.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} in this dissertation investigates the impact of pacta sunt servanda in the South African law <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The notion that agreements seriously entered into must be honoured is an age-old principle which has found recognition in South African law. The common law foundational principles <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> law are explained {{and the impact of}} the Constitution on these principles is analysed. The Constitution is the highest law in the land and all law, including the common law, must conform to it. The cornerstones of the South African law <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> are good faith, freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> sanctity <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and privity <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The competing common law foundational values are discussed with particular emphasis on the principles <b>of</b> sanctity <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The notion <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is a constitutionally recognised principle which is associated with party autonomy and denotes minimal state interference. Pacta sunt servanda states that obligations created in terms of an agreement must be honoured; therefore parties who enter into contractual agreements with the relevant intention are obliged to respect the agreement. There are many dimensions to a contract which affect its meaning as a legal instrument, apart from the legal dimension there is also a structural dimension <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> With regards to the structural dimension, the interpretation and the drafting <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> is relevant because this is the process by which the agreement between the parties is codified and interpreted. In order for the principle of pacta sunt servanda to operate successfully in contractual agreements, the written contract must clearly indicate the intention of the parties. In this research both interpretation and drafting <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> will be examined to identify their impact on the principle of pacta sunt servanda. Pacta sunt servanda influences the interpretation and drafting <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> and must therefore always be considered when executing contractual agreements. The case law in this research highlights the fact that courts are in favour of contractual validity and have accepted pacta sunt servanda as a cemented principle in the South African law <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.

40|$|Within our commercialised market society, {{contractual}} relationships are objectified and valued in monetary terms. This {{raises the question}} of the transferability <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> Transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> implies a substitution of one the existing contractual parties. It intends the transfer of the entire contractual position of the transferor to a third party, as a result of which the latter would fully replace the transferor, who is completely discharged from the contractual relationship. An important advantage is that the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> upholds the identity of the contractual relationship and thus maintains that relationship with all its securities and defences. The term <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> and any prescription which has commenced, will continue to run and the contract will in principle be governed by the law as applied {{at the time of its}} conclusion. In Belgian and French law a general theory <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is lacking. Not only the possibility of a full substitution of a contractual party, but also the requirements for the conclusion of the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and its consequences are highly debated. Moreover, the distinction between a transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and a transfer of contractual rights/debts is unclear. The research therefore envisages to develop a general legal regime for the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> ut singuli. The first part of the research is a conceptual analysis of the possibility of a transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> It focuses on the concept of contractual relationship/contractual position as distinct from the concept of contractual right or contractual debt/ obligation. Subsequently, the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is considered as a (subjective) modification of the contractual relationship. The second part of the research discusses the conclusion of the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and more specifically the consent requirement and clarifies the different consequences of a transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> such as the discharge of the transferor. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The 19 th century saw the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> law {{based on the}} idea <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The influence <b>of</b> free market economy and laissez-faire contributed to the idea that individuals should be left free to make private arrangements. The 20 th century saw great social and economic change, which heralded a swing away from the classic theory <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> During this period it began to be realized that the notion of freedom of choice rested on many uncertain and fragile assumptions.
