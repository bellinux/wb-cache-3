5|$|The {{publication}} debuted {{at number}} one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Generally well received by critics, <b>Outliers</b> was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much <b>Outliers</b> felt like an autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background {{and the rest of the}} publication to conclude the book. Reviewers also appreciated the questions posed by <b>Outliers,</b> finding it important to determine how much individual potential is ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The Inner Hebrides to {{the north}} of Ardnamurchan, made up of the Small Isles (including Eigg and Rùm), Skye, Raasay and their <b>outliers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} {{cultural}} {{differences between the}} Colombian pilots and American air traffic controllers was discussed in Malcolm Gladwell's book <b>Outliers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{names of}} {{uninhabited}} islands {{follow the same}} general patterns as the inhabited islands. The following are the ten largest in the Hebrides and their <b>outliers.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of Bath are Lansdown, Langridge and Solsbury hills. These are <b>outliers</b> of the Cotswolds. Bath is noted for its thermal waters (48°C) that are rich in calcium and sodium sulphates.|$|E
5|$|The {{birds of}} Thailand are mainly {{typical of the}} Indomalaya ecozone, with affinities to the Indian subcontinent to the west, and, {{particularly}} in Southern Thailand, with the Sundaic fauna to the southeast. The northern mountains are <b>outliers</b> of the Tibetan Plateau, with many species of montane birds, and in winter the avifauna is augmented by migrants from the eastern Palearctic and Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|Paxata is {{a privately}} owned {{software}} company headquartered in Redwood City, California. It develops self-service data preparation software that gets data ready for data analytics software. Paxata's software {{is intended for}} business analysts, as opposed to technical staff. It is used to combine data from different sources, then check it for data quality issues, such as duplicates and <b>outliers.</b> Algorithms and machine learning automate certain aspects of data preparation and users work with the software through a user-interface similar to Excel spreadsheets.|$|E
5|$|The {{death rate}} per 100 million miles {{traveled}} in 2015 ranged from 0.52 in Massachusetts to 1.89 in South Carolina. (The Massachusetts rate translates to about 3.25 fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km. The South Carolina rate translates to about 11.8 fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km.) In South Carolina, North Dakota and Texas, more than 40% of road fatalities {{were attributed to}} {{driving under the influence}} (DUI). A plot of vehicle-miles traveled per capita vs fatalities per 100,000 population shows Montana, South Carolina and West Virginia as <b>outliers</b> with higher than expected fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Later, Gladwell compares Langan with Oppenheimer, {{the father}} of the atomic bomb. Noting that they typify innate natural {{abilities}} that should have helped them both succeed in life, Gladwell argues that Oppenheimer's upbringing made a pivotal difference in his life. Oppenheimer grew up in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Manhattan, {{was the son of a}} successful businessman and a painter, attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School on Central Park West, and was afforded a childhood of concerted cultivation. <b>Outliers</b> argues that these opportunities gave Oppenheimer the chance to develop the practical intelligence necessary for success. Gladwell then provides an anecdote: When Oppenheimer was a student at University of Cambridge he attempted to poison one of his tutors. He avoided punishment, and continued his studies by using the skills gained from his cultivated upbringing in his negotiation with the university's administrators, who had wanted to expel him.|$|E
5|$|Like {{several other}} volcanoes in {{northern}} British Columbia, Level Mountain was volcanically active during past glacial periods. Its involvement with glaciation resulted in several interactions between magma and ice, affording multiple examples of glaciovolcanic processes. Evidence for contemporaneous volcanism and glaciation is widespread throughout the massif. This includes interlayered unconsolidated fluvioglacial and tuffaceous deposits, tills and glacial erratics {{at the base}} of tuffs and lava flows, lahars composed of till and agglomerate, tuyas on the uppermost surface of the shield and as <b>outliers,</b> till cemented by siliceous sinter and the presence of freshwater pillow basalts and volcano-glacial tuff breccias. It is possible that geothermal outputs at Level Mountain had an influence on dynamics of past ice sheets much like the modern Grímsvötn caldera is an important heat source beneath Vatnajökull in Iceland. However, like other large NCVP volcanoes, much of Level Mountain was formed prior to glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands today as {{a body of work}} that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without <b>outliers</b> like Björk.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>outliers</b> {{are common}} in HTS experiments, and methods such as z-score are {{sensitive}} to <b>outliers</b> and can be problematic. As a consequence, robust methods such as the z*-score method, SSMD*, B-score method, and quantile-based method have been proposed and adopted for hit selection.|$|E
25|$|If {{the sample}} has <b>outliers,</b> they {{necessarily}} include the sample maximum or sample minimum, or both, {{depending on whether}} they are extremely high or low. However, the sample maximum and minimum need not be <b>outliers,</b> {{if they are not}} unusually far from other observations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Outliers,</b> {{being the}} most extreme observations, may include the sample maximum or sample minimum, or both, {{depending}} on whether they are extremely high or low. However, the sample maximum and minimum are not always <b>outliers</b> because {{they may not be}} unusually far from other observations.|$|E
25|$|If the {{uncertainty}} of the observations is not known from external sources, then the weights could be estimated from the given observations. This can be useful, for example, to identify <b>outliers.</b> After the <b>outliers</b> have been removed from the data set, the weights should be reset to one.|$|E
25|$|Least {{absolute}} deviation (LAD) regression is a robust estimation technique {{in that it}} is less sensitive to the presence of <b>outliers</b> than OLS (but is less efficient than OLS when no <b>outliers</b> are present). It is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation under a Laplace distribution model for ε.|$|E
25|$|<b>Outliers</b> {{can occur}} by chance in any distribution, {{but they often}} {{indicate}} either measurement error or that the population has a heavy-tailed distribution. In the former case one wishes to discard them or use statistics that are robust to <b>outliers,</b> while {{in the latter case}} they indicate that the distribution has high skewness and that one should be very cautious in using tools or intuitions that assume a normal distribution. A frequent cause of <b>outliers</b> is a mixture of two distributions, which may be two distinct sub-populations, or may indicate 'correct trial' versus 'measurement error'; this is modeled by a mixture model.|$|E
25|$|The sample maximum {{and minimum}} {{are the least}} robust statistics: they are maximally {{sensitive}} to <b>outliers.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Grubbs' {{test for}} <b>outliers</b> {{may be used}} to detect samples {{deviating}} from the group.|$|E
25|$|Mahalanobis {{distance}} and leverage {{are often used}} to detect <b>outliers,</b> especially {{in the development of}} linear regression models.|$|E
25|$|Malcolm Gladwell {{discusses}} the crash {{in the context}} of cultural effects on power structures in his book <b>Outliers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a set {{of numbers}} might contain <b>outliers,</b> i.e., data values which are much lower or {{much higher than the}} others.|$|E
25|$|In Iran <b>outliers</b> in the Y-chromosomes and Mitochondrial DNA {{gene pool}} are {{consisted}} {{by the north}} Iranian ethnicities, such as the Gilaki's and Mazandarani's, who's genetic build up including chromosomal DNA are nearly identical to the major South Caucasian ethnicites, namely the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijani's. Other <b>outliers</b> are made by the Baloch people, representing a mere 1-2% of the total Iranian population, who have more patrilinial and mitochondrial DNA lines leaning towards northwest South Asian ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|With this method, higher {{standard}} deviation can indicate <b>outliers,</b> {{although this is}} a relative measure as the absolute value depends partly {{on the number of}} bins.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} {{how to deal with}} an outlier should depend on the cause. Some estimators are highly {{sensitive}} to <b>outliers,</b> notably estimation of covariance matrices.|$|E
25|$|The {{t-distribution}} {{is often}} used {{as an alternative to}} the normal distribution as a model for data, which often has heavier tails than the normal distribution allows for; see e.g. Lange et al. The classical approach was to identify <b>outliers</b> and exclude or downweight them in some way. However, it is not always easy to identify <b>outliers</b> (especially in high dimensions), and the t-distribution is a natural choice of model for such data and provides a parametric approach to robust statistics.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{sensitivity}} to <b>outliers,</b> the sample extrema cannot reliably {{be used as}} estimators unless data is clean – robust alternatives include {{the first and last}} deciles.|$|E
25|$|This {{can either}} be an {{advantage}} or a drawback: if extreme values are real (not measurement errors), and of real consequence, as in applications of extreme value theory such as building dikes or financial loss, then <b>outliers</b> (as reflected in sample extrema) are important. On the other hand, if <b>outliers</b> {{have little or no}} impact on actual outcomes, then using non-robust statistics such as the sample extrema simply cloud the statistics, and robust alternatives should be used, such as other quantiles: the 10th and 90th percentiles (first and last decile) are more robust alternatives.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases where}} {{the cause of the}} <b>outliers</b> is known, it may be {{possible}} to incorporate this effect into the model structure, for example by using a hierarchical Bayes model, or a mixture model.|$|E
25|$|In {{the data}} mining task of anomaly detection, other {{approaches}} are distance-based and density-based such as Local Outlier Factor, {{and most of}} them use the distance to the k-nearest neighbors to label observations as <b>outliers</b> or non-outliers.|$|E
25|$|The sample {{kurtosis}} is {{a useful}} measure of {{whether there is a}} problem with <b>outliers</b> in a data set. Larger kurtosis indicates a more serious outlier problem, and may lead the researcher to choose alternative statistical methods.|$|E
25|$|The median {{can be used}} as {{a measure}} of {{location}} when a distribution is skewed, when end-values are not known, or when one requires reduced importance to be attached to <b>outliers,</b> e.g., because they may be measurement errors.|$|E
25|$|In general, if {{the nature}} of the {{population}} distribution is known a priori, it is possible to test if the number of <b>outliers</b> deviate significantly from what can be expected: for a given cutoff (so samples fall beyond the cutoff with probability p) of a given distribution, the number of <b>outliers</b> will follow a binomial distribution with parameter p, which can generally be well-approximated by the Poisson distribution with λ = pn. Thus if one takes a normal distribution with cutoff 3 standard deviations from the mean, p is approximately 0.3%, and thus for 1000 trials one can approximate the number of samples whose deviation exceeds 3 sigmas by a Poisson distribution with λ = 3.|$|E
25|$|His {{tabulated}} {{results have}} been studied for the air water interface, and in general the values he obtained reflect the theoretical refraction given by modern theory, but the <b>outliers</b> are distorted to represent Ptolemy's a priori model {{of the nature of}} refraction.|$|E
25|$|The Theil–Sen {{estimator}} is {{a simple}} robust estimation technique that chooses {{the slope of the}} fit line to be the median of the slopes of the lines through pairs of sample points. It has similar statistical efficiency properties to simple linear regression but is much less sensitive to <b>outliers.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{values for}} θ and δ are passed through filters and {{subjected}} to statistical analysis. <b>Outliers</b> are discarded and an estimate of time offset {{is derived from the}} best three remaining candidates. The clock frequency is then adjusted to reduce the offset gradually, creating a feedback loop.|$|E
