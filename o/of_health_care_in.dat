25|$|The cost <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> {{retirement}} is large because {{people tend to}} be ill more frequently in later life. Most countries provide universal health insurance coverage for seniors, although in the United States many people retire before they become eligible for Medicare at age 65. In 2006, Medicare Part D went into effect in the United States, expanding benefits to include prescription drug coverage.|$|E
25|$|The {{general state}} <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> Myanmar is poor. The {{military}} government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking {{among the lowest}} in the world. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of the public health system in the state, in the fiscal year 2002-2003.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 study {{published}} in the journal BMC Medical Services Research by James Kahn, et al., found that the actual administrative burden <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> the United States was 27% of all national health expenditures. The study examined both direct costs charged by insurers for profit, administration and marketing but also the indirect burden placed on health care providers like hospitals, nursing homes and doctors for costs they incurred in working with private health insurers including contract negotiations, financial and clinical record-keeping (variable and idiosyncratic for each payer).|$|E

25|$|While {{the number}} of {{hospitals}} increased rapidly from the late 19th century onward, it was still uncommon to be treated in one. The largest causes of mortality were coronary heart diseases for men and breast cancer for women. In 1929, a special committee was established to evaluate the status <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> Finland. Due {{to the lack of}} service providers outside cities, it was suggested that municipalities establish local hospitals for their citizens. The decision to establish publicly funded hospitals can be considered the base of the current model of modern health care in Finland.|$|E
25|$|Medicare {{also has}} an {{important}} role driving changes in the entire health care system. Because Medicare pays for a huge share <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> every region of the country, it {{has a great deal}} of power to set delivery and payment policies. For example, Medicare promoted the adaptation of prospective payments based on DRG’s, which prevents unscrupulous providers from setting their own exorbitant prices. Meanwhile, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has given Medicare the mandate to promote cost-containment throughout the health care system, for example, by promoting the creation of accountable care organizations or by replacing fee-for-service payments with bundled payments.|$|E
25|$|Medicare is a {{publicly}} funded {{universal health care}} system in Australia. Operated by the Department of Human Services, Medicare is the primary funder <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> Australia, funding primary health care for Australian citizens and permanent residents including Norfolk Island. Residents are entitled to subsidised treatment from medical practitioners, eligible midwives, nurse practitioners and allied health professionals who have been issued a Medicare provider number, and can also obtain free treatment in public hospitals. The plan was introduced in 1975 by the Whitlam Government as Medibank, and was limited to paying customers only in 1976 by the Fraser Government. Hawke reintroduced universal health care in 1984 as Medicare.|$|E

25|$|Medicare {{differs from}} private {{insurance}} available to working Americans {{in that it}} is a social insurance program. Social insurance programs provide statutorily guaranteed benefits to the entire population (under certain circumstances, such as old age or unemployment). These benefits are financed in significant part through universal taxes. In effect, Medicare is a mechanism by which the state takes a portion of its citizens' resources to guarantee health and financial security to its citizens in old age or in case of disability, helping them cope with the enormous, unpredictable cost <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> <b>In</b> its universality, Medicare differs substantially from private insurers, which must decide whom to cover and what benefits to offer to manage their risk pools and guarantee their costs don't exceed premiums.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, the modern {{hospital}} {{was beginning to}} take shape with a proliferation {{of a variety of}} public and private hospital systems. By the 1870s, hospitals had more than trebled their original average intake of 3,000 patients. In continental Europe the new hospitals generally were built and run from public funds. The National Health Service, the principal provider <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom, was founded in 1948. During the nineteenth century, the Second Viennese Medical School emerged with the contributions of physicians such as Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky, Josef Škoda, Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra, and Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis. Basic medical science expanded and specialisation advanced. Furthermore, the first dermatology, eye, as well as ear, nose, and throat clinics in the world were founded in Vienna, being considered as the birth of specialised medicine.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> the United States is {{attributed}} variously to technological advance, administration costs, drug pricing, suppliers charging more for medical equipment, the receiving of more medical care than {{people in other}} countries, the high wages of doctors, government regulations, the impact of lawsuits, and third party payment systems insulating consumers from {{the full cost of}} treatments. The lowest prices for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and payments to physicians are in government plans. Americans tend to receive more medical care than people do in other countries, which is a notable contributor to higher costs. In the United States, a person is more likely to receive open heart surgery after a heart attack than in other countries. Medicaid pays less than Medicare for many prescription drugs due to the fact Medicaid discounts are set by law, whereas Medicare prices are negotiated by private insurers and drug companies. Government plans often pay less than overhead, resulting in healthcare providers shifting the cost to the privately insured through higher prices.|$|E
