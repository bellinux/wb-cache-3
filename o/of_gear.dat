40|$|Abstract. For {{reducing}} the development time and cost, determining the load of accelerated contact fatigue testing of a multi-case and multi-stage drive train, multilevel design load method {{was used to}} calculate the pitting equivalent loads <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> according to the load spectrum. A reasonable load of pitting fatigue testing was determined after analyzing and studying the pitting equivalent loads <b>of</b> <b>gears.</b> Based on a reducer used for a cement mixer, the pitting equivalent loads <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> were calculated, and the load of pitting fatigue testing was determined. The damage ratios <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> were calculated by the pitting equivalent loads <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> and the testing load, separately, using software MASTA.

5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the rear wheel) the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front wheel.|$|E

This equipment includes flashlights, signal mirrors, tactical vests, safety vests, and food that will last them at least 24hours. The equipment carried by ground teams varies much by the mission at hand. Urban direction finding (UDF) missions necessitate only a small kit <b>of</b> <b>gear.</b> But intensive mountain search and rescue can require packs that provide for up to 72 hours of operational supplies and tool for the location, rescue and extraction of lost or crashed parties. This gear includes the above, plus additional water, meals, and survival gear.

5|$|South-pointing chariot: Although {{the claim}} of Wei Dynasty {{mechanical}} engineer and statesman Ma Jun (fl. 220–265) that the south-pointing chariot was first invented by the mythological Yellow Emperor are dubious, his south-pointing chariot was successfully designed and tested in 255 AD with many later models recreated in subsequent dynasties; this device was a wheeled vehicle with differential gears that ensured a mounted wooden figurine would always point in the southern direction {{no matter how the}} vehicle turned, in essence a non-magnetic compass. The Book of Song written in the 6th century states that the device was successfully reinvented by the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–500) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). The Japanese historical text Nihon Shoki, compiled by 720, states that the device was crafted and presented as a gift to Emperor Tenji (661–672) on two different occasions (658 and 666) by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) Chinese Buddhist monks Zhi Yu and Zhi You. The wheeled vehicle device was described in intricate detail in the historical text covering the Song Dynasty (960–1279), i.e. the Song Shi (compiled 1345); for example, it revealed the number <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> teeth on each mechanical gear wheel, the diameter of each gear wheel, and how these gear wheels were properly positioned.|$|E
