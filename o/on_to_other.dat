5|$|Brettingham moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> projects. In the 1760s, he was {{approached}} by his most illustrious patron, the Duke of York (brother of King George III), to design {{one of the greatest}} mansions in Pall Mall, namely York House. The rectangular mansion that Brettingham designed was built in the Palladian style on two principal floors, with the state rooms as at Norfolk House, arranged in a circuit around the central staircase hall. The house was a mere pastiche of Norfolk House, but for Brettingham it had the kudos of a royal occupant.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a rumoured sequel for the PlayStation 2 was reported. The rumours later proved false however. While Sony {{contemplated}} {{the notion of}} a G-Police game for the PlayStation 2 (who had bought Psygnosis, renaming it Studio Liverpool), they decided that, because G-Police was not as successful as other games, Studio Liverpool would instead concentrate on the Formula 1 and Wipeout franchises. Furthermore, the development team responsible for G-Police and Weapons of Justice had moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> ventures. In 2007, G-Police was made available for download on PlayStation 3. Computer and Video Games noted that the graphics looked poor by current standards but deemed it still enjoyable to play.|$|E

5|$|Marble Madness was commercially {{successful}} {{following its}} December 1984 release and was positively received by critics. Around 4,000cabinets were sold, and {{it soon became}} the highest-earning game in arcades. However, the game consistently fell from this ranking during its seventh week in arcades that Atari tracked the game's success. Cerny attributed the six-week arcade life to Marble Madnesss short gameplay length. He believed that players lost interest after mastering it and moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> games. The arcade cabinets have since become fairly rare. Stan Szczepanski holds the official world record of 187,880 points.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May, Vieira and Rui Costa {{travelled}} to Manchester {{to persuade}} Sven-Göran Eriksson {{to return for}} a third stint with Benfica.

Benfica then contacted Getafe manager Michael Laudrup and Brazilian manager Zico. After failing {{to come to terms with}} either, the club turned to first choice Sánchez Flores and signed him on 24 May. Sánchez Flores would be aided by technical assistant Fran Escribá, goalkeeper coach Emilio Álvarez and fitness coach Pako Ayestarán, with Diamantino Miranda and Chalana links to club management.|$|E

5|$|SIM Lite was {{originally}} proposed for a 2005 launch, aboard an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV).

Tech defensive line coach Todd Grantham was replaced by Charley Wiles after Grantham resigned to take the same job at Michigan State. To prevent Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer from likewise seeking a different position, the school signed him to a new five-year contract at a salary of more than $148,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of Planescape: Torment takes place in Sigil, a city located atop an {{infinitely}} tall spire {{at the center of}} the multiverse, that connects the planes with each other via a series of portals. The city is overseen by the powerful Lady of Pain, while fifteen factions control different functions of the city related to each group's world view. Every faction strives for further control of the city. The Nameless One can even join several of these factions during the game.

5|$|With {{most of the}} Revie built team {{retiring}} {{or moving}} <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> clubs, Armfield had to rebuild the squad, though Bremner would still play 38 games in the 1975–76 campaign.

5|$|With the Matabele wars over, Burnham {{decided it}} was time to leave Africa and move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> adventures. The family {{returned}} to California. Soon after, Fred traveled to Alaska and the Yukon to prospect in the Klondike Gold Rush, taking with him his eldest son Roderick, who was then 12 years old. On hearing of the Spanish–American War, Burnham rushed home to volunteer his services, but the war had ended before he could get to the fighting. Burnham returned to the Klondike having played no part in the war. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt regretted this as much as Burnham and paid him a great tribute in his book.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of waiting and {{training}} followed. Throughout 1943–1944, the division was re-organised under the jungle divisional establishment. This saw {{a reduction in the}} division's artillery, vehicles, equipment and manning, with divisional strength falling from around 18,000 men to about 16,000. The division also lost many of its experienced personnel during this time as they were promoted and moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> formations; although it also received reinforcements from the disbanded 30th Brigade. The division's next deployment would not come until November 1944 when they were committed to the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Once again they would be unified as a full division, with several units that had previously been detached, including the 2/3rd Field Regiment and the 19th Brigade, rejoining the division.|$|E

5|$|After a long tenure on Monday nights, Keibler and Christy Hemme, {{were moved}} to SmackDown! on August 25, {{as part of a}} trade that brought Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle to Raw. On SmackDown! Keibler participated in {{lingerie}} matches and bikini contests. After a short absence, Keibler began a short feud with Jillian Hall, which led to the two having a match on Velocity, which Keibler lost. This would be Keibler's final match with WWE. Keibler then asked for time off to appear on Dancing with the Stars. During this time, Keibler's WWE.com profile was moved from SmackDown! to RAW, though she never made an appearance on the brand before leaving the company. Keibler's final mention on WWE programming occurred on the March 6, 2006 episode of RAW, where she was insulted by Candice Michelle for placing third on Dancing with the Stars during Michelle's unveiling of her Playboy magazine cover. After completing her stint on Dancing with the Stars, Keibler officially parted ways with WWE in July 2006 to move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> endeavors.|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis began {{development}} in 2002. The Compilation was first unveiled in 2003 with {{the announcement of}} Advent Children. None of the titles in the series {{up to that point}} were traditional role-playing games like the original. The explanation for this was that traditional RPGs took long production periods and a large staff, which would have made the project stand out a bit too much. One of the other considerations for the team was not to make the titles lightweight as X-2 had been, due to backlash from parts of the fanbase. Conversely, making Final Fantasy X-2 reminded the team that they did not need to stick to completely serious traditional RPGs, enabling the original creation of the Compilation. While Advent Children was the first Compilation title to begin production, it ran into problems during post-production, resulting in the first released title being Before Crisis, despite it being the second title to begin development. Before Crisis was also originally planned for release in North America, but the mobile phones available in North America at the time were not able to handle the game. In addition, the producer Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> projects, leaving its localization unlikely. Japanese animation studio Madhouse created a commercial to promote Before Crisis. Due to its success and staff feelings that important scenes from VII represented in Advent Children had been needlessly disjointed, the studio was chosen to produce an animated film: this eventually became Last Order. Crisis Core was originally going to be an action game, but became an action RPG, staying within the staff's design strengths while incorporating action elements.|$|E
5|$|Born in Ireland, Daily {{first began}} playing {{baseball}} professionally around the Baltimore area, often receiving more lucrative offers {{to play in}} more prominent leagues, all of which he declined, preferring {{to stay in the}} local area. His reputation, along with actions such as verbally assaulting umpires and fans, forced him to move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> teams, which landed him in New York City playing for the Metropolitans, which was an all-professional club but had yet to join a major league; they later joined the National League in 1883. He became the team's ace pitcher, winning 38games, including notable victories against Cap Anson's Chicago White Stockings, and most of the other top professional teams in the country at the time.|$|E

5|$|DecembeRadio played {{its last}} concert on November 8, 2012. No {{announcement}} of the band's dissolution was ever made, but in 2013 the three remaining members formed a secular country music trio called JEBtown, which played at least one show in Nashville and filmed a music video for a studio track. By 2014, the band members had moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> projects. Josh Reedy toured as a bass player with Chris Cagle, then joined Thomas Rhett's band as a keyboardist and guitarist. Brian Bunn had a stint as a touring guitarist with Third Day, then joined Reedy in Rhett's band. Eric Miker became a youth pastor and worship band musician at Jewel City Church in Shinnston, West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Fleas {{arose in}} the early Cretaceous, most likely as ectoparasites of mammals, before moving <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> groups {{including}} birds. Each species of flea {{is more or less}} a specialist on its host animal species: many species never breed on any other host, though some are less selective. Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group: for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium which causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread by rodents such as the black rat, which were bitten by fleas that then infected humans. Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world's population.|$|E
5|$|PETA {{took on the}} Pokémon {{series with}} Pokémon Black and Blue, a parody of Pokémon Black and White that focuses on animal {{fighting}} and experimentation. In role-playing-style battles, the player controls a Pikachu who escapes its Trainers, Cheren. Pikachu first fights Cheren and then moves <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> Trainers in order to rescue their Pokémon from ownership. Pikachu recruits these Pokémon to its cause, {{as well as the}} sympathetic Nurse Joy. A sequel, Pokémon Red, White, and Blue, followed in 2013. The game suggests that Nintendo's continual releases of Pokémon games reduce humans' empathy for animals. Also a role-playing game, it stars Pikachu and Miltank, who battle McDonald's characters like the Hamburglar in a crusade against the rare but ongoing practice of meat production in the Unova region.|$|E
