With the game won, rather than play <b>out</b> <b>time</b> Baxter's {{confidence}} over-extended into arrogance to make fun of his opponents with the ball. In the last minute he went to 'nutmeg' an opponent, who was having none of it and broke Baxter's leg with his challenge. This was to be a watershed for Baxter. During the four months in which he was unable to play he began drinking to his detriment; this ultimately was to curtail his playing career and his life.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the final}} match for Bradman in England, and the ground was crowded despite rain interruptions. It was Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson {{at the expense of}} Ring. The host captain Walter Robins won the toss and decided to bat, but Lindwall took 6/59 in an innings that lasted into the second day, bowling four of his victims and taking five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs. Bradman and Barnes made 153 and 151 respectively, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 225 after Morris was out for 62. Loxton hit a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face, breaking his nose. Australia reached 2/407 on the third and final afternoon before collapsing to 8/469 before Bradman declared without attempting to force a result. Leveson-Gower's XI played <b>out</b> <b>time,</b> with Bradman bowling the last over.|$|E

The study sought to detail the practice of <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> to investigate teachers' perceptions of <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> and to gain further understanding into teachers' choices regarding <b>time</b> <b>out</b> use. These objectives were achieved {{with the use of a}} comprehensive, written survey directed to 151 lead preschool teachers at 18 randomly selected preschool programs within Hamilton County, Ohio. Written discipline policies from 9 preschool programs included in the survey sample were also analyzed as they related to the use of <b>time</b> <b>out.</b> Fifty completed surveys were returned representing a well-balanced sample of lead teachers across multiple demographic variables. Results indicated that 66 % of teachers were using <b>time</b> <b>out</b> and there were not any distinguishable differences among the variables collected between those teachers who used <b>time</b> <b>out</b> and those who did not. Teachers' <b>time</b> <b>out</b> practices included verbal or visual warnings for children, discussion, and redirection. Teachers defined <b>time</b> <b>out</b> as an action, as a period of time, and as a place. 63 % of teachers did not perceive <b>time</b> <b>out</b> as punishment; nonetheless 55 % perceived that <b>time</b> <b>out</b> had the potential to be harmful to young children. The majority of teachers using <b>time</b> <b>out</b> did so because they perceived that the child learned through <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> but other teachers indicated that young children were not able to comprehend <b>time</b> <b>out.</b> Some teachers used <b>time</b> <b>out</b> due to the perceived social and emotional benefits for the child while other teachers perceived <b>time</b> <b>out</b> to be detrimental to children's social and emotional development.

25|$|West Indies (269 and 369 {{for five}} declared) drew with England (355 and 197 for four). One {{of the great}} {{partnerships}} of Test cricket took the match away from England after {{they appeared to be}} {{on the way to a}} straightforward victory. Sobers and Holford came together with West Indies just nine runs ahead with five second innings wickets down. In 320 minutes, they put on an unbeaten 274, with Sobers making 163 and Holford, in just his second Test, 105. Earlier sound batting by Butcher, Nurse and Sobers in West Indies's first innings middle order enabled a respectable total despite Higgs' six wickets for 91. England's reply relied on 96 from Tom Graveney, 91 from Jim Parks and 60 from Geoffrey Boycott. Basil D'Oliveira, in his first Test, was unluckily run out when a shot from Parks deflected on to the stumps at the bowler's end and Hall pulled a stump out. After Sobers' second innings declaration, England lost four quick wickets, but Milburn, in his second Test also, hit an unbeaten 126 and he and Graveney saw <b>out</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1980, {{which was}} a wet summer, West Indies had the better of all five Test matches, although, with the rain {{constantly}} intervening, {{they were able to}} win only one of them. Botham had a poor season as a bowler and, in all first-class cricket, took just 40 wickets at the high average of 34.67 with a best return of only four for 38. He did better as a batsman, scoring 1,149 runs (the second time, after 1976, that he topped a thousand in a season) at 42.55. He completed two centuries and six other half-centuries. His highest score in the season was ultimately the highest of his career: 228 for Somerset against Gloucestershire at Taunton in May. He batted for just over three hours, hitting 27 fours and ten sixes. With Gloucestershire batting <b>out</b> <b>time</b> for a draw on the final day, Somerset used all eleven players as bowlers. Apart from an innings of 57 in the first Test, Botham contributed little to England in the series and that innings was the only time he reached 50 in all his twelve Tests as England captain.|$|E
25|$|England were in Pakistan from November 1977 to January 1978, playing three Tests {{and three}} LOIs. Botham was almost fully {{recovered}} from his foot injury {{but did not}} play {{in any of the}} Tests. He took part in all three LOIs and in some of the first-class matches against club teams. From January to March, England were in New Zealand for a three-match Test series under the captaincy of Geoff Boycott. Botham impressed in a first-class match against Canterbury at Lancaster Park, scoring 126 not out in the second innings against an attack including Richard Hadlee and was selected for the first Test at Basin Reserve. Botham had an indifferent game there and England, twice bowled out by Hadlee, lost by 72 runs. In the next match at Carisbrook against Otago, Botham achieved a 10wM with seven for 58 (his career best return to date) in the second innings, enabling the England XI to win by six wickets. England won the second Test at Lancaster Park by 174 runs after an outstanding all-round performance by Botham who scored 103 and 30 not out and took five for 73 and three for 38. He also held three catches. The final Test was played at Eden Park and was drawn, the series ending 1–1. New Zealand batted first and totalled 315 with Geoff Howarth scoring 122. Botham took five for 109 in 34 overs. England replied with 429 all out (Clive Radley 158, Botham 53). New Zealand then chose to bat <b>out</b> <b>time</b> and Howarth scored his second century of the match (Botham none for 51). Botham's form in New Zealand cemented his place in the England team.|$|E
