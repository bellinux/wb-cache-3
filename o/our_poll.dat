Brunner explained the plan in an interview: [...] "In terms of Ohio and what happened in the 2004 presidential election, there has been a crisis in confidence in our election system in Ohio, both nationally and in our state. One of the quickest ways to repair that {{is to make sure that}} we have adequate numbers of poll workers. ... We suggested this as one tool that the boards of elections would have available to them for recruiting poll workers. We would be looking to do this similar to how we recruit jurors, only jurors are recruited for two weeks of service whereas we'd only be asking for three days. It would also allow us to offer split shifts to poll workers. In Ohio the polling places are open for thirteen hours, so essentially a poll worker works at least fourteen hours; with the average age of <b>our</b> <b>poll</b> workers at 72, that's a tough day for anyone, no matter what their age is. ...

Thomas Mulcair and Brian Topp were the most likely to be known by respondents. 36% of respondents were aware of Thomas Mulcair while 31% were aware of Brian Topp. Paul Dewar (27% aware) and Peggy Nash (23%) rounded out the top four. Among NDP supporters (those who said they would vote NDP if an election were held the time of the poll), the order was the same with Mulcair (38%), Topp (32%), Dewar (27%), and Nash (21%) in the top four. Over three in ten NDP supporters had not heard of any of the candidates prior to <b>our</b> <b>poll.</b> Regionally, Mulcair's name recognition in Quebec exceeded all other competitors in all other regions of the country and his national lead in name recognition was almost entirely due to Quebecers' awareness of him. 64%of Quebec respondents were aware of Thomas Mulcair. Outside of Quebec, Mulcair's name recognition never exceeded 25%.|$|E

The poll methodology was explicitly designed to detect partisan manipulation of the vote count, and to separate evidence for manipulation from poll sampling bias. Our premise was that politically motivated tampering would target races that were projected to be competitive, while the perpetrators would be less motivated to interfere in races that were not projected to be close. Designing <b>our</b> <b>poll</b> to be maximally sensitive to such a pattern, we selected 16 counties around the country where, of the three most prominent races (Governor, Senator or US House), there was at least one competitive contest and one noncompetitive contest. In our study, the responses of the same group of respondents were compared to official election results for pairs of races, one competitive and one noncompetitive. We used paired data analysis to compare discrepancies between poll and official count for these matched pairs. Our results revealed much larger discrepancies in competitive than in noncompetitive races (...|$|E

40|$|This study revisits the {{scalability}} {{issue of}} polling I/O, i. e., select() and poll(). Although polling I/O was an efficient and hence popular I/O multiplexing mechanism, {{it is believed}} inadequate today to handle {{tens of thousands of}} concurrent TCP connections because the scanning cost of such a large connection list is overwhelmingly high. However, the real problem of polling I/O is not in the se-mantics itself, but in various implementation factors such as memory allocations and copies to process a system call, pointer operations and function calls through VFS, and wait channel management to handle events. To miti-gate these overheads and reinstate polling I/O as an effi-cient I/O multiplexing mechanism, we have developed a fast polling I/O library based on POSIX real-time signals. This library implements the full functionality of polling I/O by managing the state transition of each connection notified with real-time signals. Traditional polling I/O has a weakness especially when it polls a small number of ac-tive connections together with a huge number of idle ones. <b>Our</b> <b>polling</b> I/O library is proved to achieve high perfor-mance in that situation. ...|$|R
