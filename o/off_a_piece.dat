500|$|Like most spiders, the pedipalps {{of mature}} males {{end in a}} bulb {{terminating}} in a thin, curved [...] projection called an embolus, through which sperm is released during mating. Female U. catleyi have been observed with broken-off embolus tips lodged in their genitalia. This has been hypothesized {{as a type of}} [...] "sperm-plug" [...] or copulatory plug, where, by breaking <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of his anatomy (a process known as genital mutilation or genital breakage), a male physically precludes other males from successfully mating with the female, one of many types of sperm competition in animals. An alternative to the sperm competition function is that genital mutilation might allow males to more rapidly escape and avoid being cannibalized after mating, although this function is thought to be unlikely in Unicorn since there are no significant size differences between sexes, and cannibalism is more common when females are much larger than males. Sperm plugs of various types, including gelatinous or waxy substances, have been observed in at least 41 spider families, and are generally thought to ensure paternity. U. catlyei is one of only few goblin spiders known or suspected to utilize sperm plugs.|$|E
500|$|A case of {{the latter}} {{situation}} is a species of cleaner fish and its mimic, though in this example the model is greatly disadvantaged {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their body to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes that then let it clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean—and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's [...] "dance". Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of its fin before fleeing. Fish grazed on in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, so both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E

2500|$|Their live shows, fed {{by their}} improvisational {{approach}} to music, made the Grateful Dead different from most other touring bands. While most {{rock and roll}} bands rehearse a standard show for their tours that is replayed night after night, city after city, the Grateful Dead never did. As Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, [...] "We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of paper." [...] They maintained this operating ethic throughout their existence. For each performance, the band drew material from an active list of {{a hundred or so}} songs.|$|E

Tierney was hospitalized at Bellevue Hospital Center; he was released for rehabilitation on December 28. The December 20 performance was ended prematurely. [...] After rehearsals for stricter safety procedures involving the harnesses, the show resumed with the evening performance on December 23. [...] Tierney was released from New York University's Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine on January 5, 2011. He returned to the show for rehearsals on April 25, 2011 and performed in the show on opening night.

2500|$|By 3017, {{near the}} {{beginning}} of the story told in The Lord of the Rings, Sauron had learned from Gollum that Bilbo Baggins of The Shire had the One Ring in his possession. Sauron entrusted its recovery to the Nazgûl. They reappeared [...] "west of the River", riding black horses that were bred or trained in Mordor to endure their terror. They learned that the Ring had passed to Bilbo's heir, Frodo, and followed him and his companions to Bree. Aragorn arrived ahead of them and hid the Hobbits from their pursuers, but eventually five of the Nazgûl cornered Frodo and his company at Weathertop, where the Witch-king stabbed Frodo in the shoulder with the Morgul blade, breaking <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of it in the Hobbit's flesh. When all Nine were swept away by the waters of the river Bruinen, their horses were drowned, and the Ringwraiths were forced to return to Mordor to regroup.|$|E
2500|$|Catherine Gordon {{was taught}} to read {{at a young age}} and had a passion for literature, a passion she shared with her son. Byron would read through the Bible, {{focusing}} predominantly on the Old Testament, and he would also read works dealing with history or narrative tales like the Arabian Nights. However this passion for reading was not the only passion mother and child shared; Catherine was also known for having a violent temper. The son inherited his mother's temper but he would not speak while he experienced various fits. On one occasion, the young Byron bit <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of a china saucer during his [...] "silent rage". Byron's problems were compounded by his mother's lack of money, especially with her having to provide for her delinquent husband. When word reached her that John Byron had died, she cried out loud enough for her neighbourhood to hear. However, her troubles were not over, for in his final moments John Byron had incurred even more debt, which burdened his widow to the point of having to move to another home in worse conditions.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the rescue}} efforts {{following}} the bombing, a Catholic Chaplain named George Pucciarelli tore <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of his Marine camouflage uniform {{to make a}} skullcap ("kippah") for Resnicoff, after Resnicoff used his to wipe the blood from a wounded Marine's face. This widely reported story, recounted in President Reagan's 1984 speech, was entered into the Congressional Record. [...] The story was credited with helping {{the passage of the}} religious apparel amendment allowing military personnel to wear head coverings for religious reasons (an amendment that had failed to pass in the House of Representatives for two years prior to the recounting of this story). This story was also quoted by some military leaders who had previously opposed the uniform policy change, but now supported it, including the Commandant and Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps. This amendment reportedly laid the groundwork for the directive (later, changed to a Department of Defense Instruction)that established wide-ranging changes to official military policies and procedures for the Accommodation of Religious Practices Within the Military Services.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1942, when Gen. Wainwright {{decided to}} {{surrender}} at Corregidor, he ordered Bunker {{to lower the}} U.S. flag and burn it to prevent its falling {{into the hands of}} the Japanese forces. Wainwright later recalled, [...] "Promptly at noon this May 6, 1942, I ordered the white flag run up and our firing ceased. It was with the sickest of feelings that I gave the white-flag-raising order to Colonel Paul D. Bunker." [...] Instead of burning the entire flag, Bunker cut <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> and concealed it under a patch on his shirt. Before he died in the Japanese prison camp, Bunker sent for Colonel Delbert Ausmus, cut the flag remnant into two pieces and gave one of the pieces to Ausmus. He told Colonel Ausmus he did not expect to survive the prison camp and that it was Ausmus' duty to take his piece of the flag to the Secretary of War. Ausmus concealed the remnant in his shirt cuff, and shortly after the war ended, Ausmus delivered it to Secretary Patterson. In November 1945, Ausmus described the circumstances under which he received the remnant from Bunker:"He was taken to Billibid prison in Manila and came down with pneumonia.

2500|$|On this {{particular}} instance, {{the captain was}} piloting the landing and said, [...] "All right. Give them {{to me on the}} flare. I have given up." [...] This was not their usual routine. Sixty feet from the runway, the captain began to reduce power in preparation for the flare and said, [...] "Okay" [...] to the first officer. The first officer immediately deployed the spoilers on the flare, instead of just arming them. The aircraft began to sink heavily and the captain, realizing what had happened, pulled back on the control column and applied full thrust to all four engines. The nose lifted, but the aircraft still continued to sink, hitting the runway with enough force that the number four engine and pylon broke off the wing. There was also a tail strike at this time. Realizing what he had done, the first officer began apologizing to the captain. Apparently unaware of the severity of the damage inflicted on the aircraft, the crew managed to lift off for a go-around, but the lost fourth engine had torn <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of the lower wing plating and the aircraft was now trailing fuel, which ignited. The first officer requested a second landing attempt on the same runway but was told it was closed due to debris and was directed to another runway.|$|E
2500|$|One {{example of}} visible {{religious}} apparel {{cited in the}} instructions as authorized, provided it passes the [...] "neat and conservative" [...] test, is the kippah (skullcap) worn by some Jewish personnel, referred to in some military directives by the Yiddish word, [...] "yarmulke." [...] The modern history of authorizing the kippa {{under the rubric of}} [...] "religious accommodation" [...] began with a 1986 Supreme Court case (Goldman v. Weinberger) involving an orthodox rabbi who was serving in the air force as a psychologist, not a chaplain, who had been told to remove his kippa. When the court affirmed that existing military regulations did give the military the right to prohibit the kippa if it so chose—and deferred to Congress to decide whether to change the situation—Congress attempted to introduce the [...] "neat and conservative" [...] approval rule in a proposed [...] "Religious Apparel Amendment." [...] That proposed amendment failed to pass for two years, ultimately passing after a story about two navy chaplains present during the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing was read into the Congressional Record. The story focused on Catholic Chaplain George Pucciarelli, who tore <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of his Marine Corps uniform to replace Jewish Chaplain Arnold Resnicoff's kippah, bloodied after being used to wipe the faces of wounded Marines. This amendment passed, and was eventually incorporated into the newer DOD religious accommodation directive, which now exists in revised form as DOD Instruction 1300.17.|$|E
