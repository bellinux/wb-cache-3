6000|$|We {{have already}} seen that {{this view of the}} <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets</b> harmonizes with the {{characters}} of their orbits; but the evidence hence derived is much stronger than was indicated. The great majority of cometary orbits are classed as parabolic; and it is ordinarily inferred that they are visitors from remote space, and will never return. But are they rightly classed as parabolic? Observations on a comet moving in an extremely eccentric ellipse, which are possible only when it is comparatively near perihelion, must fail to distinguish its orbit from a parabola. Evidently, then, it is not safe to class it as a parabola because of inability to detect the elements of an ellipse. But if extreme eccentricity of an orbit necessitates such inability, it seems quite possible that comets have no other orbits than elliptic ones. Though five or six are said to be hyperbolic, yet, as I learn from one who has paid special attention to comets, [...] "no such orbit has, I believe, been computed for a well-observed comet." [...] Hence the probability that all the orbits are ellipses is overwhelming. Ellipses and hyperbolas have countless varieties of forms, but there is only one form of parabola; or, to speak literally, all parabolas are similar, while there are infinitely numerous dissimilar ellipses and dissimilar hyperbolas. Consequently, anything coming to the Sun from a great distance must have one exact amount of proper motion to produce a parabola: all other amounts would give hyperbolas or ellipses. And if there are no hyperbolic orbits, then it is infinity to one that all the orbits are elliptical. This is just what they would be if comets had the genesis above supposed.|$|E
6000|$|Passing by {{the common}} and conceded {{facts of the}} {{dimensions}} of the planets, and the extent of their orbits, what thoughts are awakened by the suggestion that the fixed stars are the centres of other solar systems, and the eccentric comets are links to connect them all in one great and harmonious design! The astronomers tell us that some of these comets have no visible nucleuses--that the fixed stars are seen through their apparent densest parts, and that they can be nothing but luminous gases; while, on the other hand, others do betray dark compact bodies of more solid matter. Fixed stars unaccountably disappear, as if suddenly struck out of their places. Now, we know that aerolites are formed in the atmosphere by a natural process, and descend in masses of pure iron. Why may not the matter of one globe, dispersed into its elements by the fusion of its consummation, reassemble in the shape of comets, gaseous at first, and slowly increasing and condensing in the form of solid matter, varying in their course as they acquire the property of attraction, until they finally settle into new and regular planetary orbits by the power of their own masses, thus establishing a regular reproduction of worlds to meet the waste of eternity? Were the earth dissolved into gases by fusion, what would become of its satellite the moon? Might not the principles of our planet, thus volatilized, yield to its nearer attraction, assemble around that orb, which, losing its governing influence, should be left to wander in infinite space, subject to a new but eccentric law of gravity, until finally reduced again within the limits of some new system? How know we that such is not the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>comets?</b> ...|$|E

Stardust aerogel tracks show considerable compositional diversity and the degree of impact related thermal modification and destruction is also highly variable. We are performing systematic examinations of entire Stardust tracks to discern the representative mineralogy and <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>comet</b> Wild 2 components and to search for well preserved fine grained materials. Previously, we used ultramicrotomy to prepare sequential thin sections of entire "carrot" and "bulbous" type tracks along their axis while preserving their original shapes [2]. This technique allows us to characterize the usually well-preserved terminal particle (TP), but also any associated, fine-grained fragments that were shed along the track pathway. This report focuses on coordinated analyses of surviving indigenous cometary materials (crystalline and amorphous) along the aerogel track walls, their interaction with aerogel during collection and comparisons with their TPs.
