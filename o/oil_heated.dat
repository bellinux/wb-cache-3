50|$|Boiled oil is the raw <b>oil</b> <b>heated</b> with driers, such as {{litharge}} or red lead, to {{a temperature}} from 350° to 500 °F, {{at which it}} is maintained {{for three or four}} hours. It is thick and much darker in color than the raw oil, drying much more quickly, with a coat hard and glossy but less elastic than that produced by raw oil. Poppy-seed oil is expressed from the seeds of the poppy plant. It does not possess the tenacity and quick-drying powers of boiled linseed oil, but being of a very light color it is used for delicate colors. Turpentine is used as a solvent, diluent, or thinner, to bring the paint to a proper consistency so as to allow it to be spread in a thin even coat. When a flat dull surface is desired, turpentine alone is used with the base and the oil is omitted. The best turpentine comes from the pine forests of America. French turpentine is next in quality. Russian turpentine is the cheapest, and has usually a strong and unpleasant odor that renders it objectionable to work with. In consequence of the high price of turpentine of good quality, and the increasing difficulty of obtaining it, substitutes are coming into general use. Driers are substances usually added to paint to hasten the process of oxidation, i.e. the drying, of the oil. Some pigments possess this quality, as red lead and white lead.|$|E

40|$|A Low-fat Diet Containing Heated Soybean Oil Promotes Hyperglycemia in C 57 BL/ 6 J Mice Introduction: The {{metabolic}} {{effects of}} consuming mildly oxidized lipids {{as compared to}} highly oxidized lipids are not well documented. Consumption of highly oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids, even in a low-fat diet, may {{be a threat to}} one’s health. Previous studies in our lab have shown that mice consuming soybean <b>oil</b> <b>heated</b> for 3 hours, compared to unheated, gain less body weight, but more fat pad mass, and 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes treated with soybean <b>oil</b> <b>heated</b> for ≥ 6 hours have abrogated triglyceride accumulation. Another study showed that rats fed highly oxidized <b>oil</b> (<b>heated</b> 3 ̆e 24 hrs), as compared to fresh soybean oil and fish oil, had lower fat pad mass and weight gain but developed glucose intolerance. This suggested that the extent of lipid oxidation determined the subsequent metabolic risk. Objective: Our aim, in the current study, is to investigate if a low-fat diet with soybean <b>oil</b> <b>heated</b> for increasing time points (3 h, 6 h and 9 h) alter fat mass and glucose tolerance. Methods: Six week old, male, C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were randomly divided into six groups (n= 8 /group). Three groups were fed a low fat diet with soybean <b>oil</b> <b>heated</b> for 3 (3 hr-HO), 6 (6 hr-HO), or 9 (9 hr-HO) hours for 16 weeks. Another three groups were pair-fed to each of the 3 hr-HO, 6 hr-HO and 9 hr-HO groups with a low-fat diet containing unheated oil (PF-UHO). Food consumption was recorded every 3 - 4 days, and body weights were recorded weekly. Soy oil in the diets was analyzed for products of oxidation. At 16 weeks, blood glucose levels were measured after a 6 hour fast; fat pad and liver weights were recorded, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture for serum insulin analysis. Results: Final weight gain was not significantly different between all HO groups as a percent of their respective PF groups (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). The feeding efficiency for 3 hr, 6 hr, and 9 hr-HO groups as a percent of PF was 92. 75, 113. 02, and 111. 28, respectively. Mean weights of all fat pads for HO groups decreased with heating time as a percent of PF, although these differences were not statistically significant. Blood glucose was lowest in the 3 hr-HO group and significantly increased from 3 hr-HO group to 6 hr-HO group (p= 0. 021) as a percent of PF. Serum insulin levels decreased for the HO groups as heating time increased, although these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Consuming a diet with increasing amounts of oxidized lipids decreased fat pad mass and insulin levels, while increasing fasting glucose levels. This paradoxical relationship between increased glucose in the presence of decreased insulin in c 57 BL/ 6 J mice could be due to either reduced insulin secretion or increased insulin resistance. Further research in our lab will aim to analyze triglyceride accumulation in the liver and muscle cells of these mice to determine if oxidized lipids promote ectopic fat deposition...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to use anti-radical power (ARP) to study early lipid oxidation events during frying. The 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH¿) test was used to determine the ARP.

The decrease of the ARP highly correlated with the increase of the peroxide value for soybean <b>oil</b> <b>heated</b> at 110 °C (R 2 = 0. 99).

The ARP of soybean oil was found to decrease faster at 110 °C than at 180 °C, suggesting different mechanisms of radical formation. The total polar compounds of frying oil in which French fries were fried did not differ significantly from frying oil that was heated alone.
