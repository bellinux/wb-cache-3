Within a year, Brooks' physical growth began to catch up and he started to regain the dominant position. He also switched from distance to sprint events.|$|E

The request was granted by Jean, and the prorogation lasted until January 26, 2009. The opposition coalition dissolved shortly after, with the Conservatives winning a Liberal supported confidence vote on January 29, 2009.|$|E

5|$|Team {{cohesion}} {{is viewed}} as ‘‘a general indicator of synergistic group interaction—or process’’. Furthermore, cohesion {{has been linked to}} greater coordination during team-tasks as well as improved satisfaction, productivity, and group interactions. Team efficacy refers to team members’ perceptions of task-specific team competence. This construct is thought to create a sense <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> within the team that enables the group to persevere when faced with hardship.|$|E
5|$|After the Reform Bill was {{rejected}} in the Lords, the House of Commons immediately passed a motion <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> affirming {{their support for}} Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of the House of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in the House of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{power is}} {{exercised}} by the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers {{which make up}} the government, while the legislative power is vested in the unicameral parliament, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature, and the Constitutional Court is charged with ruling on the conformity of laws and decrees with the constitution. The Council of State is the tribunal of last resort for administrative cases, and the High Court of Appeals for all others. The prime minister is elected by the parliament through a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the government and is most often {{the head of the}} party having the most seats in parliament. The prime minister is Binali Yıldırım, who replaced Ahmet Davutoğlu on 24 May 2016.|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam {{saw that}} the party had little chance of being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class. He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given {{a voice in the}} conference. In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist. Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Paul Krugman {{released}} his book The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, arguing that economic {{conditions similar to}} what existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published , a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small as {{it does not take}} into account Keynes's insight on the importance <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.|$|E

5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E
5|$|In a {{referendum}} {{called by the}} National Council, and held {{on the same day}} as {{the second round of the}} presidential election, the electorate voted to overturn a law providing for the nationalization of citizens' share in the major national insurance company. Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law. After both election and referendum results were announced, the Prime Minister Janez Janša announced that he might resign, following what he perceived to be a heavy defeat for the Government. The Government later won a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the National Assembly.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years of experience with Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and {{an opportunity for the}} poor to improve their own situations. He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> and self-sufficiency when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While being careful not to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.|$|E
50|$|In modern times, {{passage of}} a motion <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> is a {{relatively}} rare event in two-party democracies. In almost all cases, party discipline is sufficient to allow a majority party to defeat a motion <b>of</b> no <b>confidence,</b> and if faced with possible defections in the government party, the government is likely to change its policies rather than lose a vote <b>of</b> no <b>confidence.</b> The cases in which a motion <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> has passed are generally those {{in which the government}} party's slim majority has been eliminated by either by-elections or defections, such as the 1979 vote <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> in the Callaghan ministry in the UK which was carried by one vote, forcing a general election which was won by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party.|$|R

5|$|In early 1345, Kantakouzenos sent Franciscan monks to the regency to make {{an offer}} of conciliation, but it was rejected. Despite this show <b>of</b> <b>confidence,</b> the regency's {{position}} remained insecure. The defections of the previous winter had weakened their control of the capital, and in response Apokaukos launched a series of proscriptions. He also ordered {{the construction of a}} new prison to house political prisoners. On 11 June 1345, while undertaking an inspection of the prison unaccompanied by his bodyguard, Apokaukos was lynched by the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Initially, President Grinius {{refused to}} resign, {{but he was}} {{eventually}} persuaded that Polish invasion was imminent and that Smetona had sworn to uphold the constitution. On 19 December 42 delegates of the Seimas met (without the Social Democrats or the Peasant Popular Union) and elected Aleksandras Stulginskis as the new Speaker of the Seimas. Stulginskis was the formal head of state {{for a few hours}} before Smetona was elected as the President (38 deputies voted for, two against, and two abstained). The Seimas also passed a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the new cabinet formed by Voldemaras. Constitutional formalities were observed thereby. The Lithuanian National Union secured other major roles: Antanas Merkys assumed office as Minister of Defense and Ignas Musteikis as Minister of the Interior.|$|E
5|$|Mahler {{had been}} {{convinced}} {{from the start}} of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W. Adorno, Robert Simpson and Jonathan Carr found its optimism unconvincing, and considered it artistically and musically inferior to Mahler's other symphonies. Conversely, it has also been compared—by Deryck Cooke—to Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No.9 as a defining human statement for its century.|$|E

The decisive results achieved by the Indian Army during this war, under the able military leadership of Manekshaw, gave the nation a new sense <b>of</b> <b>confidence,</b> and in recognition of his services, in January 1973 the president of India conferred the rank of field marshal on him.

5|$|On , {{a senior}} army officer on active duty, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, {{prompted}} a second crisis {{when he went}} public with allegations that Lloyd George had lied to Parliament on military matters. Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal). While Asquith's presentation was poor, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote <b>of</b> <b>confidence.</b> He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's allegations. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen civilian control of the military. Meanwhile, the German offensive stalled and was ultimately reversed. Victory came on 11 November 1918.|$|E
