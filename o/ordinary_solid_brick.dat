40|$|Abstract Brick {{used with}} stone in an {{alternate}} order-especially on monumental masonry buildings-is {{one of the}} basic construction materials in Ottoman classical architecture. Parallel to the announcement of Tanzimat Declaration (1839), to the political and economical relations improved with European states and to the Industrial Revolution in Europe, an effective change had been seen on design concept and construction techniques in Ottoman architecture. Many new buildings were built using modern materials and imported techniques such as <b>solid</b> <b>brick</b> (in western norms) masonry walls, steel beams at the horizontal and vertical bearers, cement and concrete. The product of modern <b>solid</b> <b>bricks</b> in western standards had been realized in Ottoman territories {{in the last quarter of}} 19 th century.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the series of}} experimental tests of reinforced-concrete (R/C) frame structures infilled with <b>solid</b> <b>brick</b> wall and opening brick walls to evaluate contributions of brick infills with openings to lateral strength of RC frames. Four 1 / 4 -scale single story and single bay RC frame specimens, one bare frame and three infilled frames, were tested by applying the static monotonic lateral load to the upper beam of specimens. During the testing, lateral displacements of infilled structure were monitored to control the incremental lateral loads. The cracks, crack propagation and major cracks were observed throughout the tests to identify the mechanism failure of specimens. As the results, failure of brick wall was prior {{to the failure of}} RC columns. The lateral strength and stiffness of infilled frames were always higher than those of bare frame. The <b>solid</b> <b>brick</b> infill significantly increases the lateral strength of overall RC frame more than two times. The brick infill with a center opening of size 40...|$|R
