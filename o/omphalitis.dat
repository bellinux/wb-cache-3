The umbilical cord dries more quickly and separates more readily when exposed to air [...] However, each hospital/birthing center has its own recommendations for care of the umbilical cord after delivery. Some recommend not using any medicinal washes on the cord. Other popular recommendations include triple dye, betadine, bacitracin, or silver sulfadiazine. With regards to the medicinal treatments, there is little data to support any one treatment (or lack thereof) over another. However one recent review of many studies supported the use of chlorhexidine treatment {{as a way to}} reduce risk of death by 23% and risk of <b>omphalitis</b> by anywhere between 27-56% in community settings in underdeveloped countries.

50|$|<b>Omphalitis</b> of newborn is {{the medical}} term for {{inflammation}} of the umbilical cord stump in the neonatal newborn period, most commonly attributed to a bacterial infection. Typically immediately after an infant is born, the umbilical cord is cut with a small remnant (often {{referred to as the}} stump) left behind. Normally the stump separates from the skin within 3-45 days after birth. A small amount of pus-like material is commonly seen {{at the base of the}} stump and can be controlled by keeping the stump open to air to dry. Certain bacteria can grow and infect the stump during this process and as a result significant redness and swelling may develop, and in some cases the infection can then spread through the umbilical vessels to the rest of the body. While currently an uncommon anatomical location for infection in the newborn in the United States, it has caused significant morbidity and mortality both historically and in areas where health care is less readily available. In general, when this type of infection is suspected or diagnosed, antibiotic treatment is given, and in cases of serious complications surgical management may be appropriate.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Although <b>omphalitis</b> (umbilical infections) among newborns {{is common}} {{and a major}} cause of {{neonatal}} deaths in developing countries, information on its burden and etiology from community settings is lacking. This study aimed to determine the incidence and etiology of <b>omphalitis</b> in newborns in high neonatal mortality settings in Karachi, Pakistan. Methodology: Trained community health workers surveyed all new births in three low-income areas from September 2004 to August 2007. Pus samples from the umbilical stumps were obtained from babies with pre-defined signs of illness and subjected to culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Results: Among 6904 births, 1501 (21. 7 %) newborns were diagnosed with <b>omphalitis.</b> Of these, 325 (21. 6 %) were classified as mild, 1042 (69. 4 %) as moderate, and 134 (8. 9 %) as severe, 141 (9. 3 %) were associated with clinical signs of sepsis. The incidence of <b>omphalitis</b> was 217. 4 / 1000 live births, moderate-severe <b>omphalitis</b> 170. 3 per 1000 live births, and associated with sepsis 20. 4 per 1000 live births. Of 853 infants with purulent umbilical discharge, 64 % yielded 583 isolates. The most common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, of which 291 (95. 7 %) were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and 13 (4. 2 %) methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes 105 (18 %), Group B beta-hemolytic streptococci 59 (10 %), Pseudomonas spp., 52 (8. 9 %), Aeromonas spp. 19 (3. 2 %), and Klebsiella spp. 12 (2 %).

40|$|Problem statement: <b>Omphalitis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of {{mortality}} in chicks during the first week after hatching. Escherichia coli strains are the most common isolated bacteria from <b>omphalitis</b> cases of chickens. Bacterial colonization in the host cells surfaces is a critical first step in the pathogenesis of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates. Thus the current study was undertaken to determine the presence and prevalence of several adhesin-encoding genes in E. coli isolates from <b>omphalitis</b> of chicks. Approach: One hundred four E. coli isolates were recovered from <b>omphalitis</b> cases and were identified by standard biochemical tests. The omphalitis-derived isolates were examined for the presence of fimbrial and non-fimbrial adhesin-encoding genes by PCR technique. Results: Most (93. 26 %) of the E. coli isolates exhibited at least one of the examined adhesin-encoding genes. None of the isolates contained the afaI B-C, afa E-VIII and f 17 A genes. The two most prevalent genes were crl (87. 50 %) and fimH (77. 88 %). P (papC) and S (sfa) fimbriae encoding genes were detected in 8 (7. 69 %) and 5 (4. 80 %) isolates respectively. Seven combination patterns of the adhesin-encoding genes were detected. In 83 (79. 80 %) isolates combinations of 2 - 4 genes were detected. The gene combinations of crl-fimH and fimH- papC were the two most prevalent patterns respectively. Fourteen (13. 46 %) isolates showed crl gene alone and 7 (6. 73 %) isolates were negative for examined genes. Conclusion: The current study showed that some of the adhesin-encoding genes are more prevalent in E. coli isolates from <b>omphalitis</b> of chicks but, E. coli isolates may be expressing still unknown adhesins that could have a role in the pathogenicity of omphalitis-derived isolates...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In {{developed}} countries, where <b>omphalitis</b> {{has become}} rare and related mortality nil, benefits of antiseptic use in umbilical cord care {{have not been}} demonstrated. We aimed to assess the noninferiority of dry care compared with antiseptics in France where antiseptic use is widespread. METHODS: We conducted a noninferiority, cluster-randomized, 2 -period crossover trial, in 6 French university maternity units including all infants born after 36 weeks' gestation. Maternity units {{were randomly assigned to}} provide either their usual antiseptic care or a dry care umbilical cord method for a 4 -month period, and then units switched to the alternate cord cleansing method for a 4 -month period. The primary outcome was neonatal <b>omphalitis,</b> adjudicated by an independent blinded committee based on all available photographs, clinical, and bacteriological data. We used a noninferiority margin of 0. 4 %. Analysis was performed per protocol and by intention to treat. RESULTS: Among 8698 participants, <b>omphalitis</b> occurred in 3 of 4293 (0. 07 %) newborns in the dry care group and in none of the 4404 newborns in the antiseptic care group (crude difference: 0. 07; 95 % confidence interval: - 0. 03 to 0. 21). Late neonatal infection, parental appreciation of difficulty in care, and time to separation of the cord were not significantly different between the 2 groups.

A previous trial in Nepal indicated that umbilical cord cleansing with 4. 0 % chlorhexidine could substantially reduce mortality and <b>omphalitis</b> risk, but policy changes await additional community-based data. Methods The Projahnmo Chlorhexidine study was a three-year, cluster-randomized, community-based trial {{to assess the impact of}} three cord care regimens on neonatal mortality and <b>omphalitis.</b> Women were recruited mid-pregnancy, received a basic package of maternal and neonatal health promotion messages, and were followed to pregnancy outcome. Newborns were visited at home by local village-based workers whose areas were randomized to either 1) single- or 2) 7 -day cord cleansing with 4. 0 % chlorhexidine, or 3) promotion of dry cord care as recommended by WHO. All mothers received basic messages regarding hand-washing, clean cord cutting, and avoidance of harmful home-base applications to the cord. Death within 28 days and <b>omphalitis</b> were the primary outcomes; these were monitored directly through home visits by community health workers on days 1, 3, 6, 9, 15, and 28 after birth.

40|$|Background:Umbilical cord {{infection}} (<b>omphalitis)</b> is a {{risk factor}} for neonatal sepsis and mortality in low-resource settings where home deliveries are common. We aimed to assess the effect of umbilical-cord cleansing with 4 % chlorhexidine (CHX) solution, with or without handwashing with antiseptic soap, on the incidence of <b>omphalitis</b> and neonatal mortality. Methods: We did a two-by-two factorial, cluster-randomised trial in Dadu, a rural area of Sindh province, Pakistan. Clusters were defined as the population covered by a functional traditional birth attendant (TBA), and were randomly allocated to one of four groups (groups A to D) with a computer-generated random number sequence. Implementation and data collection teams were masked to allocation. Liveborn infants delivered by participating TBAs who received birth kits were eligible for enrolment in the study. One intervention comprised birth kits containing 4 % CHX solution for application to the cord at birth by TBAs and once daily by family members for up to 14 days along with soap and educational messages promoting hand washing. One intervention was CHX solution only and another was handwashing only. Standard dry cord care was promoted in the control group. The primary outcomes were incidence of neonatal <b>omphalitis</b> and neonatal mortality. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00682006. Findings: 187 clusters were randomly allocated to one of the four study groups. Of 9741 newborn babies delivered by participating TBAs, factorial analysis indicated a reduction in risk of <b>omphalitis</b> with CHX application (risk ratio [RR]= 0. 58, 95 % CI 0. 41 - 0. 82, p= 0. 002) but no evidence of an effect of handwashing (RR= 0. 83, 0. 61 - 1. 13, p= 0. 24). We recorded strong evidence of a reduction in neonatal mortality in neonates who received CHX cleansing (RR= 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 45 - 0. 85, p= 0. 003) but no evidence of an effect of handwashing promotion on neonatal mortality (RR= 1. 08, 0. 79 - 1. 48, p= 0. 62). We recorded no serious adverse events. Interpretation: Application of 4 % CHX to the umbilical cord was effective in reducing the risk of <b>omphalitis</b> and neonatal mortality in rural Pakistan.

We also summarise the molecular etiologies and pathogenesis underlying SCN, which has only been unraveled in the past few years. While majority of patients with SCN respond to G-CSF which significantly reduces the risk of infections and mortality, dosage of G-CSF should be carefully titrated. Patients requiring high-dose G-CSF should be closely monitored for developing malignant transformation, which is uniformly associated with poor prognosis despite chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{abnormalities}} {{were present}} in 12 out of 30 (40 %) children with extrahepatic portal hypertension of unknown cause, but in only 2 out of 17 (12 %) children with extnahepatic portal hypertension secondary to umbilical vein catheterization or <b>omphalitis.</b> The most frequent abnormalities in this series and in published reports were atrial septal defect, malformation of the biliary tract, and anomalous inferior vena cava. These {{findings are consistent with}} the view that some cases with extrahepatic portal hypertension are congenital in origin...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Four million infants die {{annually}} {{within the}} first 28 days of life (Mir, 2008). This first four weeks of life {{is known as the}} neonatal period, a time frame when infants are most vulnerable to disease and infection. Ninety-nine percent of neonatal deaths occur in low to middle income countries (Mir, 2008). A systemic infection known as sepsis is the ultimate cause of death in 36 % of neonates (Mullany, 2006). Due to lack of population-wide surveillance in the developing world, the proportion of cases originating from umbilical cord infection is largely unknown. Researchers at Aga Khan University Hospital concluded in their community-based study that home births place neonates at risk for umbilical infection and sepsis. Home births are not sterilely performed and the resulting risk of infection is high (Karumbi et al., 2013). Sequelae of umbilical cord infections have been identified as necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis, which is a systemic infection that is often fatal. (Mir, 2008; Mullany 2007). AIM: The aim {{of this study is to}} review proximal, intermediate and distal risk factors in order to determine which <b>omphalitis</b> interventions show the most promise. METHODS: Community-based randomized trials in India, Nepal and Pakistan were reviewed to discern the proximal, intermediate and distal risk factors of <b>omphalitis</b> to determine whether a single or multi-level intervention would best address neonatal <b>omphalitis.</b> RESULTS: A single intervention of 4 % CHX has been displayed by numerous studies to effectively reduce the incidence of omphalitis-related mortality by approximately 25 %. DISCUSSION: Due to the high incidence of <b>omphalitis</b> among neonates, similarities in cultural practices surrounding childbirth, and existing study data, India, Pakistan and Nepal have been chosen as countries of interest. Proximally, agents of disease were identified and the etiologies of such pathogens were explored. Intermediately, delivery practices, hygiene of both caregiver and birthing attendant, the occurrence of skin-to-skin contact encountered by the newborn, cultural practices of applying unsanitary substances to the umbilical cord, and breastfeeding norms are analyzed. Distally, environment, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health systems, and education levels are considered as determinants of this disease (Mullany, et al., 2006). Numerous studies conducting community-based randomized trials have determined that implementation of the topical antiseptic 4 % Chlorhexidine (CHX) can result in an approximate 25 % reduction in overall neonate mortality and between a 27 % to 54 % reduction in the incidence of <b>omphalitis</b> (Imdad et al., 2013). Researcher also cited the long-standing safety record, low cost, strong adhesion rate and activity against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria as the reasoning behind the decision to choose CHX as the topical antiseptic (Mullany et al., 2006). The United Nations Commission on Life-Saving Commodities for Women and Children have requested for the WHO to add 4 % CHX to the list of essential medicines for children. The council is fast-tracking the registration of the medicine to promote manufacturers to produce the drug and drop the cost of it for commercial use. New training protocols for birth attendants will also include instruction on how to correctly apply the antiseptic. Continued stewardship of the CHX intervention could lead to a dramatic reduction in neonatal mortality in the rural regions of South-central Asia potentially saving the lives of over 450, 000 newborns annually (Mullany et al., 2009) ...|$|E
40|$|A questionnaire-based {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to investigate chick mortality at hatching in three commercial hatcheries in and around Jos, central Nigeria. Mortality {{was defined as the}} sum of dead chicks, dead-in-shell embryos and culls due to various other reasons. There was a large variation in culling rates due to poor hatching. The major reasons for culling were dead-in-shell embryos, weak chicks, dead chicks, <b>omphalitis</b> and physical abnormalities such as incomplete feathering, weak limbs, distorted beaks and wetness. There was no significant correlation between the age of breeding flock and percentage of culls indicating that culling rate was not strongly influenced by the age of breeding flock. Although, factors contributing to poor hatching include management and incubation failures, the most probable cause of abnormalities, weak chicks and <b>omphalitis</b> are diseased breeder flocks or poor hygiene and sanitation in hatchery operations. Two of the hatcheries used a combination of formaldehyde and iodine for disinfection but hygiene standards were compromised due to inadequate cleaning in all three hatcheries. The poor hatch experienced in this study suggests that there is considerable room for improvement in hatchery operations particularly with regards to hygiene and sanitation. Adequate training of hatchery operators in understanding the crucial role hygiene plays in ensuring high chick quality is needed...|$|E
