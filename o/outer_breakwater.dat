500|$|In {{response}} to the lessons learned at the disastrous Dieppe raid, the Allies developed new technologies to help ensure the success of Overlord. To supplement the preliminary offshore bombardment and aerial assaults, some of the landing craft were equipped with artillery and anti-tank guns to provide close supporting fire. The Allies {{had decided not to}} immediately attack any of the heavily protected French ports and two artificial ports, called Mulberry harbours, were designed by COSSAC planners. Each assembly consisted of a floating <b>outer</b> <b>breakwater,</b> inner concrete caissons (called Phoenix breakwaters) and several floating piers. The Mulberry harbours were supplemented by blockship shelters (codenamed [...] "Gooseberries"). With the expectation that fuel would be difficult or impossible to obtain on the continent, the Allies built a [...] "Pipe-Line Under The Ocean" [...] (PLUTO). Specially developed pipes [...] in diameter were to be laid under the Channel from the Isle of Wight to Cherbourg by D-Day plus 18. Technical problems and the delay in capturing Cherbourg meant the pipeline was not operational until 22 September. A second line was laid from Dungeness to Boulogne in late October.|$|E

60|$|And {{now we are}} there--in what {{is surely}} the most {{wonderful}} spot in the world, the front firing trench, the <b>outer</b> <b>breakwater</b> which holds back the German tide. How strange that this monstrous oscillation of giant forces, setting in from east to west, should find their equilibrium here across this particular meadow of Flanders. 'How far?' I ask. '180 yards,' says my guide. 'Pop!' remarks a third person just in front. 'A sniper,' says my guide; 'take a look through the periscope.' I do so. There is some rusty wire before me, then a field sloping slightly upwards with knee-deep grass, then rusty wire again, and a red line of broken earth. There is {{not a sign of}} movement, but sharp eyes are always watching us, even as these crouching soldiers around me are watching them. There are dead Germans in the grass before us. You need not see them to know that they are there. A wounded soldier sits in a corner nursing his leg. Here and there men pop out like rabbits from dug-outs and mine-shafts. Others sit on the fire-step or lean smoking against the clay wall. Who would dream to look at their bold, careless faces that this is a front line, and that at any moment it is possible that a grey wave may submerge them? With all their careless bearing I notice that every man has his gas helmet and his rifle within easy reach.|$|E

Two types of breakwater are used: the classical trapezoidal rockfill structures and vertical caissons. The foundation soils are relatively uniform: soft normally consolidated silty clays with thin interlayers of silts and fine sands. These deltaic deposits reach a thickness in excess of 50 m along the breakwaters. Below, a stronger level of gravels in a clay matrix is found. The paper describes {{the properties of the}} deltaic foundation soils as determined in the field and in the laboratory. Particular attention is given to the cyclic instability of foundation soils.

50|$|In 1825, {{an act of}} Congress {{authorized}} the initial construction of a breakwater off of Cape Henlopen {{in order to create}} a harbor for ships in stormy weather. This breakwater was not completed until 1869. As shipbuilding advanced into the second half of the 19th century, this harbor was no longer sufficiently deep for the newer and larger ships of the US Navy. Thus an <b>outer</b> <b>breakwater</b> was constructed to solve this problem in 1892. The new breakwater was built about 1.25 mi north of the original breakwater. Work on this 7950 ft breakwater was finally completed in 1901. The new safe harbor was called the National Harbor of Refuge.|$|E

50|$|Shoaling at Cape Henlopen {{gradually}} {{reduced the}} significance of the light and the Harbor of Refuge Light began to serve mariners in a more practical way at its location on the <b>outer</b> <b>breakwater,</b> much closer to the mouth of the Delaware Bay. As a result of its reduced importance, the light was officially discontinued in 1996. In 1999, the light's ownership was transferred to the State of Delaware. The lighthouse was eventually leased to the Delaware River & Bay Authority, the bi-state group that manages ferries and airports for Delaware and New Jersey. In 2004 the Authority and the Delaware River and Bay Lighthouse Foundation, a non-profit, volunteer organization, entered into a contract whereby the Foundation became advisors on the preservation to be undertaken by the Authority and were responsible for tours and educational activities. Since then tours have been regularly scheduled throughout each summer.|$|E

40|$|The Sea-wave Slot-cone Generator (SSG) is a Wave Energy Converter {{based on}} the wave {{overtopping}} principle; it employs several reservoirs placed {{on top of each}} other, in which the energy of incoming waves is stored as potential energy. Then, the captured water runs through turbines for electricity production. The system works on a wide spectrum of different wave conditions, giving a high overall efficiency. It can be suitable for shoreline and breakwater applications and presents particular advantages, such as sharing structure costs, availability of grid connection and recirculation of water inside the harbor, as the outlet of the turbines is on the rear part of the system. Recently, plans for the SSG pilot installations are in progress at the Svaaheia site (Norway), Port of Hanstholm (Denmark) and Port of Garibaldi (Oregon, USA). In the last-mentioned two projects, the Sea-wave Slot-cone Generator technology is integrated into the <b>outer</b> harbor <b>breakwater</b> and jetty reconstruction projects. In the last years extensive studies have been performed on the hydraulic and the structural response of this converter, with the aim of optimizing the design process. The investigations have been conducted by physical model tests and numerical simulations and many results have been published on both conference proceedings and journals. Main scope of this paper is reviewing the most significant findings, to provide the reader with an organic overview on the present status of knowledge...|$|R
