5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and <b>optimism</b> <b>about</b> politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{warnings}} given by Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup, {{commander of the}} ROK 1st Infantry Division, a general feeling of <b>optimism</b> <b>about</b> {{the outcome of the}} war prevented {{the warnings}} from being taken seriously. With the fighting reached a stalemate at Unsan, General Walton Walker of the Eighth United States Army ordered the US 8th Cavalry Regiment of the US 1st Cavalry Division to resume offensives north by relieving the ROK 12th Regiment. By the time the US 8th Cavalry Regiment reached Unsan on 29 October, the ROK 11th Infantry Regiment of the ROK 1st Infantry Division was also pulling out of Unsan. At the same time, the Chinese had destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division on the east of Unsan. Unsan had now became a northern salient in the UN line containing only the US 8th Cavalry Regiment and the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the Bengals' game, Dickinson was slated to start against the Miami Dolphins on October 24. In the game, he {{completed}} all four passes he attempted for 51yards, and led a 71-yard touchdown drive. However, he suffered a twisted foot and ankle during the game, and was sidelined for what was then an indefinite amount of time. Dickinson returned two weeks later, failing to complete a pass {{in a game against}} the Denver Broncos, and allowing another interception that was returned by John Rowser for a touchdown. Dickinson had his most productive outing the following week, completing 7 of 13 passes for 103yards in a loss to the New York Jets. His last game of the season was against the Cleveland Browns. He completed two of three passes for 29yards in the fourth quarter. After completing the first two passes, he was intercepted by Terry Brown and was hit late after throwing the pass. The result was torn ligaments in his left knee, which ended his season. Despite the season-ending injury, there was still <b>optimism</b> <b>about</b> Dickinson being the Buccaneers' quarterback of the future due to his scrambling ability.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the United States {{news media}} has grown more {{partisan}} {{and thus more}} biased. This has led some people not to trust the United States news media. Others have embraced the new partisan United States news media. However, by embracing a United States news media that is more partisan {{and in a way}} commercial has this led the American public to be exposed to more negative stories about the United States and thus to become more pessimistic about the United States? The United States media’s impact as a source of information has an important affect on how United States citizens view their government and how well they understand the political process. It is important that it be determined that the United States’ news media doesn’t always lead Americans to be pessimistic about the United States, since this can led to a decline in voter turnout, political activism, and other behaviors. By examining how much trust the United States public places in the media, how well they understand politics, the employment status of Americans, the household income of Americans, and how much personal optimism the United States public has, we can better understand what impact the United States media has on <b>optimism</b> or pessimism <b>about</b> the United States. My research question was does the United States media increase <b>optimism</b> or pessimism <b>about</b> the United States? The unit of analysis was American citizens, who are exhibiting either <b>optimism</b> or pessimism <b>about</b> the United States. By performing regression analysis, it was shown that <b>optimism</b> and pessimism <b>about</b> the United States {{has more to do with}} household income and personal optimism rather than distrust in the media...|$|R
50|$|Vigorous {{agitation}} {{for land}} reform {{broke out in}} Ireland from 1880 and soon spread to Scotland. It involved rent strikes, destruction of livestock and farm property, physical occupation of the land, and violence against agents of the landowners. Notable conflicts occurred in Skye, North & South Uist, Tiree and Lewis, with part of the farm of Coll being occupied in a land raid of January 1888. This phase of agitation died down when the Highland economy recovered from its 1880s slump and when <b>optimism</b> grew <b>about</b> government action towards land reform.|$|R

As late as June 1975, David Rigler wrote that Genie continued to make significant strides in every field which the scientists were testing, and Curtiss' contemporaneous accounts expressed some <b>optimism</b> <b>about</b> Genie's social development. Nonetheless, even by mid-1975 most social interactions with her remained abnormal in quality. The scientists wrote that, while her overall demeanor and interactions with others had significantly improved, many aspects of her behavior remained characteristic of an unsocialized person.|$|E

25|$|Positive {{psychology}} – Positive {{psychology is}} the {{scientific study of}} human happiness and well-being, which started to gain momentum in 1998 due to the call of Martin Seligman, then president of the APA. The history of psychology shows that the field has been primarily dedicated to addressing mental illness rather than mental wellness. Applied positive psychology's main focus, therefore, is to increase one's positive experience of life and ability to flourish by promoting such things as <b>optimism</b> <b>about</b> the future, a sense of flow in the present, and personal traits like courage, perseverance, and altruism. There is now preliminary empirical evidence to show that by promoting Seligman's three components of happiness—positive emotion (the pleasant life), engagement (the engaged life), and meaning (the meaningful life)—positive therapy can decrease clinical depression.|$|E

25|$|At {{around the}} same time Curtiss began her work, doctors reevaluated Genie on the Leiter scale and {{measured}} her on the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale, which placed her estimated mental age between a 5- and 8-year-old with a very high degree of scatter. Doctors believed Genie had learned to use her gestalt perception to determine the number of objects in a group, and by the start of the case study she could accurately discern the correct number of up to 7 objects via gestalt perception. Child psychologist David Elkind, who was involved in the grant meetings, evaluated Genie in May 1971 and reported that she was in the concrete operational stage of development, noting that she understood object permanence and could engage in deferred imitation. Genie's physical health also continued to improve, and by this time her endurance had dramatically increased. Her social behavior was still highly abnormal, and doctors were especially concerned that she almost never interacted with people her age, but evaluations from the time expressed some <b>optimism</b> <b>about</b> her prognosis.|$|E

40|$|War is {{most likely}} if you {{overestimate}} others' hostility but underestimate their capabilities. War can occur without misperception, but rarely. Misperception is inaccurate inferences, miscalculations of consequences, and misjudgments about how others will react to one's policies, and may include military <b>optimism,</b> pessimism <b>about</b> long-term diplomatic and military prospects, incorrectly anticipated consequences. Scholars (Jervis included) generally focus on misperceptions of intentions, not situations.

40|$|It is {{a widely}} assumed {{principle}} that organisms reflexively approach possibilities for pleasure and avoid possibilities for pain. However, highly evolved organisms not only reflexively react to future possibilities of pleasure vs. pain, but also evaluate the chance or risk of actually experiencing such possibilities. Given the import of optimism judgments in shaping behavior and other outcomes, the main goal of the current research {{was to examine the}} relationship between the rudimentary systems of approach-avoidance that orient us toward possible outcomes in the environment and the higher-order optimism judgments we make when evaluating whether such outcomes are likely to occur. To this end, two experiments examined the impact of approach-avoidance cues in shaping participants 2 ̆ 7 <b>optimism</b> judgments <b>about</b> experiencing positive and negative future life events. For the primary operationalization of approach-avoidance, college student participants engaged in arm flexion (a motor movement associated with approach) or arm extension (a motor movement associated with avoidance) while simultaneously making <b>optimism</b> judgments <b>about</b> experiencing a range of positive and negative events in the future. A secondary operationalization involved correlations computed between participants 2 ̆ 7 chronic personality tendencies related to approach-avoidance (e. g., positive vs. negative affectivity) and their optimism judgments. The results of these experiments revealed complexities in the relationship between approach-avoidance and optimism, suggesting that when, how and why approach-avoidance cues will shape optimism may critically depend upon 1) the specific operationalization of approach-avoidance, 2) how optimism is measured, and 3) characteristics of the outcomes under consideration. Explanations for the complexities in the results are offered, and attempts are made to link the current work to broader theoretical and practical aspects of the connection between approach-avoidance and optimism...|$|R
