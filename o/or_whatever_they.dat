500|$|Although the New York Dolls {{exhibited}} tongue-in-cheek qualities, Gary Graff {{observed a}} streetwise realism in the album's songs. In Christgau's opinion, Johansen's colloquial and morally superior lyrics were imbued with humor {{and a sense}} of human limits in songs whose fundamental theme was authenticity. This theme was explored in stories about lost youths, as on [...] "Subway Train", or in a study of a specific subject, such as the [...] "schizy imagemonger" [...] on [...] "Personality Crisis". He argued that beneath the band's decadent and campy surface were lyrics about [...] "the modern world... one nuclear bomb could blow it all away. Pills and personality crises weren't evils—easy, necessary, <b>or</b> <b>whatever.</b> <b>They</b> were strategies and tropisms and positive pleasures". According to journalist Steve Taylor, [...] "Vietnamese Baby" [...] dealt with the impact of the Vietnam War at the time on everyday activities for people, whose fun was undermined by thoughts of collective guilt.|$|E

The opening night and all the artists, mainly artists, {{went out there and}} those few people that were into socialites <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> were, they went out. And then after that, you could go out there during a weekday and there would be nobody in the gallery. Nobody gave a damn." [...] -- John Saccaro ...|$|E

2500|$|The Cabinet {{of seven}} {{split on the}} issue, with de Valera casting the {{deciding}} vote. Many of Collins's associates warned him not to go, {{that he was being}} set up as a political scapegoat. Following intense soul-searching and all-night consultations with his most trusted advisors, he resolved to attend [...] "in the spirit of a soldier obeying orders." [...] In private correspondence he foresaw the catastrophe ahead: [...] "Let them make a scapegoat <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> like of me. Someone must go." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Six hundred {{thousand}} <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> guessed at is just, it's not credible," [...] Bush said, and he dismissed the methodology as [...] "pretty well discredited." [...] In December , Bush estimated that 30,000 Iraqis {{had died in}} the war. Asked at the news conference what he thinks the number is now, Bush said: [...] "I stand by the figure a lot of innocent people have lost their life." [...] At a separate Pentagon briefing, Gen. George Casey, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, said that the figure [...] "seems way, way beyond any number that I have seen. I've not seen a number higher than 50,000. And so I don't give it that much credibility at all." ...|$|E

5000|$|Longtime {{professional}} skateboarder Jeff Grosso, {{who grew}} up skateboarding with prominent figures such as Neil Blender and Lance Mountain, joined the company in early 2011 and explained the process in an August 2013 interview: [...] "Ill ask, Ill shoot at the mountaintop, and maybe Ill land at base camp. Once I got the courage to call them up, <b>or</b> <b>whatever,</b> and then <b>they</b> were like, Well, we have to vote., <b>or</b> <b>whatever,</b> cause <b>they</b> run it like a gang ... So once I found out that they all, like, voted yes ... it was a proud moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, faith, Colonel; the goblins, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> else <b>they</b> were, {{had been}} {{favourable}} to honest Desborough, for they reposed {{the whole of}} his person on {{that part of his}} body which--Hark, did you not hear something?--is the central point of gravity, namely, his head." ...|$|R

50|$|Figures of the Bakunawas head {{decorate}} the hilts of many ancient Filipino swords. These swords that originate in Panay {{are said to}} bestow upon the hangaway or mandirigma (sacred warriors) the fearful presence {{and power of the}} Bakunawa (<b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> deity/animal <b>they</b> have on their deity hilt) when they wield their swords in combat.|$|R
50|$|The {{completion}} of the 'Bathing the Buddha' ritual serves as the signal that encourages ordinary mortals to themselves engage in mutual water splashing. Accordingly, people flock to the streets with pots, pans, bottles, <b>or</b> <b>whatever,</b> where <b>they</b> uninhibitedly splash, spray and douse each other with water, with the same gusto with which Westerners engage in a good snowball free-for-all.|$|R

5000|$|Jerry Cantrell {{said of the}} song: It's {{basically}} {{about how}} government and media control the public's perception {{of events in the}} world <b>or</b> <b>whatever,</b> and <b>they</b> build you into a box by feeding it to you in your home.

50|$|Then Kant segues to {{the subject}} of his monarch, Frederick the Great. He states that a monarch should allow his {{subjects}} to do <b>or</b> think <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> find necessary for their salvation, and that such thoughts and deeds are “none of his business.” Religious ideas should not be subject to government oversight, and government should not support “spiritual despotism” against any of his subjects.|$|R
5000|$|In many productions, the {{audience}} is encouraged to behave like a group of naughty, unruly 13- to 14-year-old students in a classroom. Frequently, there is a blackboard on stage, along with chalk that audience members can use to write <b>or</b> draw <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> wish. The actress playing Miss Margarida {{has a great deal}} of power to improvise, and can deliver jokes or rants inspired by audience members.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{beginning}} to feel--every hour I feel more clearly--a sense of complex concealment {{of which you}} are the salient point. Is this Council, or committee, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> are, cooking the accounts of my estate? Is that it?" ...|$|E

5000|$|... "The 'establishment of religion' {{clause of}} the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church.

No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities <b>or</b> institutions, <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> may be called, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> form <b>they</b> may adopt to teach or practice religion.

6000|$|It will {{be remembered}} that {{in the course of}} the last chapter we wholly left out of our account of {{mountain}} lines that group which was called [...] "Lines of Rest." [...] One reason for doing so was that, as these lines are produced by débris in a state of temporary repose, their beauty, <b>or</b> deformity, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> character <b>they</b> may possess, is properly to be considered as belonging to stones rather than to rocks.|$|R
