25|$|The Los Angeles Police Department {{contacted}} Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a {{close friend}} of Bill Cosby for many years, to ask for his phone number. Waters declined to give it to them, instead asking another close friend, Essence magazine publisher Ed Lewis, to be the <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Cosby. However, the police contacted the CBS studio which produced his new series, Cosby, filmed in New York at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens. Cosby was on set at the time when producer Joanne Curley-Kerner informed him of the death of his son. Los Angeles police later spoke with him and discouraged him from flying to Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|On April 10, 2007, a Bahamian {{judge ruled}} Larry Birkhead, photographer, {{as the father}} of Dannielynn. DNA tests had {{established}} Birkhead as the father, with 99.99% certainty. Commenting on the revelation, Birkhead stated, [...] "I hate to be the <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you this but, I told you so. I'm the father...My baby's going to be coming home pretty soon." [...] Birkhead subsequently applied for an amended birth certificate listing him as the father, which paved the way for him to obtain a passport for the baby to leave with him for the United States. Howard K. Stern did not contest the DNA results or the ruling. Subsequent to the ruling, Birkhead returned to the United States with the baby. Smith's mother, Virgie Arthur, appealed the ruling but it was later denied and she was ordered to pay costs.|$|E
2500|$|Murphy's accomplishments are all {{the more}} {{remarkable}} as he was deaf. He was known as [...] "Silent Mike" [...] due to his affliction, and contemporary reports state that, though he was deaf, the affliction was not so severe as to prevent him from hearing all remarks. One report in 1905 noted: [...] "It was characteristic of Murphy to encourage the belief that he was very deaf and thus break down the caution of the lads who prided themselves on their ability to outwit the veteran." [...] In 1908, The Washington Post noted that, though Murphy had been [...] "rather deaf" [...] for several years, his deafness had worsened, such that anyone wanting to speak with him [...] "has to shout {{at the top of his}} lungs." [...] Murphy joked at the time, [...] "I'm not much of a <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> secrets to." [...] When he was in Reno in 1910 for the Jack Johnson–James Jeffries fight, Murphy recalled being approached by a woman who went on at length telling him about her marital problems. After she finished, Murphy told her, [...] "Madame, you have come to the right person. Your secrets are safe. I have not heard a word you said." ...|$|E
