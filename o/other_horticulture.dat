40|$|The {{availability}} of feed and their efficiency of use {{throughout the year}} represent the most important constraint affecting the productivity of animals in any agro-ecosystems. Beside being the largest contributor to the total production cost, logistically feeds need to be available {{on a daily basis}} across the animal’s life time. In order to be competitive, goat production system must be directed toward the optimum utilization of inconventional feedstuffs such as crop residues and agro-industrial by-products. The horticulture crops provide various crop-residues and by products from the processing of its main products. These biomass are potential feedstuffs {{that could be used to}} support the production of goats. The processing of passion fruits (Passiflora edulis) yield by products such as fruit shells and seeds. These products are good energy and protein sources for growing goats. Oriental radish (Raphanus sativus) by-products composed by damaged root parts and culls have high digestible energy and low ether extract content, but have very high moisture content. The pineapple by-products composed by the peel and bagasse of the fruit could be used as energy source for goats. <b>Other</b> <b>horticulture</b> by-products or residues such as citrus pulp, abandoned citrus fruit, forages from Ipomea batatas are of great potential as feeds for goat production. Preserving technology like ensiling could be implemented in utilising those biomass categorized as wet by-products such as pineapple and oriental radish by-products. The technology of complete feed is an effective means in utilizing some of those products with relatively low palatability or to increase its inclusion level in diets. Introducing shade-tolerant forage species as intercrops such as Stenotaphrum secundatum, Brachiaria humidicola and Arachis pintoi in the citrus plantation should increase feed capacity of the area. The multi-purpose trees such as Indigofera sp. and Calliandra calothyrsus both are adaptable to the high altitude area are valuable feeds due to their high nutritional quality. Generation of technology that could maximize the utilization of those biomass as feeds for goat production is necessary. Some technologies that are relevant to that purposes including: 1) ensiling with appropriate inoculants that create optimal fermentation to preserve the product and to prolong the aerobic stability of the silages; 2) ensiling with appropiate absorbants for maximum effluent retention, intake and preference of the silage; 3) the utilization of fibrolytic bacteria; 4) utilization of fibrolytic enzymes in complete feed; and 5) supplementation strategy to optimize the rumen function for maximum utilization of basal diets. Because most of the feedstuffs mentioned above relatively vary in their nutritional quality and quantity, it is suggested that feed budget system, which is based on the {{availability of}} feed rather than the feeding standard system which is based on the animal’s nutrient requirement is a more relevant feeding system for goat production...|$|E

Among them, zoos have unique attractions and {{a strong commitment to}} all living beings. Today, many zoos aim for a display garden quality while educating visitors about plants as well as animals. This research investigated the depth, emphasis, and impact of horticulture at zoos. Surveys and interviews were conducted to gather both qualitative and quantitative data about the role of horticulture in zoo practices and philosophy. Zoo professionals and visitors were surveyed to determine their perceptions about zoo horticulture. Four U. S. zoos served as case study sites revealing six common themes among zoo professionals, including the motivations to implement and purposes of zoo horticulture. The data identified the current state of horticulture at zoos, benefits of implementing horticulture practices, possible challenges to integrating horticulture into the zoo, and the data indicated strategies to effectively promote horticulture to visitors. Recommendations were developed to help guide, integrate, and promote horticultural practices at zoos, particularly those seeking to improve their emphasis on horticulture. To promote horticulture, more than a well-trained and passionate horticulture department is required. The staff of the zoo must collectively support and advocate the importance of zoo horticulture. Zoos attract large numbers of annual visitors, many of whom may not frequent <b>other</b> public <b>horticulture</b> institutions. Zoos have an opportunity to broaden the reach of horticulture exposure and create new relationships in the process. Although plants will likely continue to take a secondary position to the zoo's main message of animal conservation, many zoos are promoting a strong role for horticulture. Animal habitat can rarely be interpreted completely without reference to plants, which consequently highlights the undeniable and strategic role of horticulture at zoos.

Changes in land cover between 1999 and 2013 were analysed to provide better insight into the differences obtained by analysing land use change at pixel level and {{at the level of}} farm units. Land cover change was characterized using multitemporal satellite images, while farm systems were subsequently identified based on cadastral land holdings. Results show that the area covered with grassland has decreased, while the area covered with soybean, winter cereals-soybean double cropping, <b>other</b> crops, and <b>horticulture</b> has increased; the first two with 166 % and 158 % respectively. Over the same period, the number of livestock farms has decreased by 41 %, while the number of cropland farms, horticultural farms and mixed farms have increased. We studied the location of land cover, land cover changes, farm systems and farm systems changes by relating spatial patterns of land use (change) to a set of potential location factors. The location of different land cover types was explained fairly well by this set of socio-economic and biophysical location factors, while the allocation of land cover changes was explained poorly. Farm system locations, on the other hand, were explained with very high accuracy, and farm system changes with a good accuracy. We conclude that farms are a more appropriate unit for land use change analysis than pixels in areas dominated by agricultural use and featuring crop rotations. Analysis at the farm level reduces the noise caused by crop rotations. As farms are the units at which land use decisions are implemented insight in the changes at this level has the potential to better inform land management practices, land use planning and policies...|$|R

(Biographical) Pliny Reasoner was born May 6, 1863, in Princeton, Illinois, to Henry and Mary Ellen Reasoner, and grew up with three younger siblings, his brother Egbert and sisters Julia and Edith. In 1881, he decided to draw on his experience with farming and knowledge of botany to forge a living for himself in sub-tropical Florida. He settled near modern-day Bradenton and began setting up a nursery business. Throughout his time in Florida, Pliny kept up a regular and detailed correspondence with his family in Princeton. His letters give detailed descriptions of his experiences in Florida in the 1880 s. In 1885 Pliny’s younger brother Egbert Reasoner (1869 - 1926) joined him in the nursery business, which specialized in citrus trees and tropical plants. Egbert continued expanding the nursery after Pliny’s death from yellow fever in 1888.

40|$|Provides {{consistent}} {{information for}} each of New Zealand’s 16 regions. This allows us to compare the regions’ economic performance, distinguish their attributes and specialisations, and understand the different roles they play in the New Zealand economy. Summary The 2014 regional economic activity report report shows that nearly all of New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s 16 regions have made good economic progress over the last 12 months, reflecting New Zealand’s recovery after the global financial crisis. Each region provides a different contribution to the New Zealand economy and, while there is diversity, all regions {{have the potential to}} attract further investment, improve their living standards and generate high-value economic growth. Most regions experienced job growth over the last year. This is despite the 2013 drought which particularly affected primary production in the North Island. Canterbury has been the fastest growing region over the last two years, driven by the Christchurch rebuild and supported by its primary sector. Actions to enhance regional economic activity and outcomes need to be underpinned by a sound knowledge of each region’s historical trends and its strengths and weaknesses. This report provides comprehensive and comparative information about economic outcomes and the drivers of those outcomes across all regions. In addition, the government, in partnership with local decision-makers, is this year undertaking in-depth economic growth studies of regions such as East Coast, Northland, Bay of Plenty, and Manawatū-Wanganui. Those studies will help the regions prioritise opportunities for growth and identify how to overcome any barriers to that growth. This report highlights several key findings. First, each region has industry specialisations which have developed historically due to natural resource and infrastructure endowments, geographic location and skills. Those specialisations are the chief contributors to the different economic outcomes seen across the regions. Some sectors, such as dairy farming and milk processing, are benefiting from high commodity prices and market growth while <b>others,</b> such as <b>horticulture,</b> have lower returns. Secondly, the report identifies a regional dimension to the economic disparity between Māori and non-Māori.
