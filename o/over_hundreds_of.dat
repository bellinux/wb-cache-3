5|$|Continents formed, {{then broke}} up and {{reformed}} as {{the surface of}} Earth reshaped <b>over</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> millions of years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent. Roughly 750million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180million years ago.|$|E
5|$|While the Mamluks were {{in power}} from the 13th century to the 16th century, the area of Fustat {{was used as a}} rubbish dump, though it still {{maintained}} a population of thousands, with the primary crafts being those of pottery and trash-collecting. The layers of garbage accumulated <b>over</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> years, and gradually the population decreased, leaving what had once been a thriving city as an effective wasteland.|$|E

5|$|Sandgrouse are gregarious, feeding in {{flocks of}} up to 100 birds. As a {{consequence}} of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. Drinking times vary among the species. Ten species drink at dawn, four at dusk and two at indeterminate times. When drinking, water is sucked into the beak which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, enough water to last twenty four hours can be swallowed in a few seconds. As they travel to water holes, they call to {{members of their own}} species and many hundreds or thousands synchronise their arrival at the drinking site despite converging from many different locations scattered <b>over</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> square miles (kilometres) of territory.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{records that}} in 1097 King WilliamII ordered a wall {{to be built}} around the Tower of London; it was {{probably}} built from stone {{as a replacement for}} the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle, between the Roman wall and the Thames. The Norman Conquest of London manifested itself not only with a new ruling class, but in the way the city was structured. Land was confiscated and redistributed amongst the Normans, who also brought <b>over</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> Jews, for financial reasons. The Jews arrived under the direct protection of the Crown, as a result of which Jewish communities were often found close to castles. The Jews used the Tower as a retreat, when threatened by anti-Jewish violence.|$|E
5|$|The {{islands of}} Japan {{are located in}} a {{volcanic}} zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire. They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring <b>over</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> millions of years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene {{as a result of}} the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. The Boso Triple Junction off the coast of Japan is a triple junction where the North American Plate, the Pacific Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate meets. Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent. The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions <b>over</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size {{for a permanent}} radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting {{the risks associated with}} managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E
5|$|Christof, Pink, and Lily {{travel to}} New York City aboard a {{contraband}} ship, rescue the Nosferatu Samuel from the Sabbat, and infiltrate a warehouse storing the Vyšehrad contraband. There they encounter Wilhem, {{who is now}} a Sabbat under Ecaterina following the collapse of their group. Wilhem reveals that Pink is an assassin working for Vukodlak. Pink escapes and Wilhem rejoins Christof, hoping to reclaim the humanity he has sacrificed during the previous 800 years. Together, Christof, Wilhem, Lily, and Samuel discover that Vukodlak is hidden beneath a church within his Cathedral of Flesh and that Anezka is still in his servitude. In the cathedral they find that Vukodlak has awoken; he tries to influence Christof by offering him Anezka then revealing that she is completely dependent on Vukodlak's blood and will die without him. Christof refuses and Vukodlak drops the group into tunnels beneath the cathedral. Christof finds the Wall of Memories, which hold Anezka's memories of the last millennia, showing she continued to hope as Vukodlak found new ways to defile and torment her. She eventually sacrificed her innocence to gain Vukodlak's trust, using her position to delay his resurrection <b>over</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> years until, with no options left, she prayed for Christof's return. The group returns to the Cathedral and battles Vukodlak.|$|E
