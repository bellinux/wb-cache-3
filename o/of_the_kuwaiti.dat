25|$|Kuwait {{has a large}} wealth-management {{industry}} that stands out in the region. Kuwaiti investment companies administer more assets than those of any other GCC country, save the much larger Saudi Arabia. The Kuwait Financial Centre, in a rough calculation, estimated that Kuwaiti firms accounted for over one-third of the total assets under management in the GCC. The relative strength of Kuwait in the financial industry extends to its stock market. For many years, the total valuation of all companies listed on the Kuwaiti exchange far exceeded the value of those on any other GCC bourse, except Saudi Arabia.

In this study, using the Iranian prawn fishery as a reference, we identified a significant reduction <b>of</b> landings in <b>the</b> <b>Kuwaiti</b> prawn fishery after the Gulf War. We developed a model to estimate annual prawn recruitment from pre-season survey data and found that the post-war recruit-ments were significantly lower than those before the war...|$|R

2500|$|The idea of {{oil well}} and oil reserve smoke pluming into the {{stratosphere}} serving as a main contributor to the soot of a nuclear winter was a central idea of the early climatology papers on the hypothesis; they were considered more of a possible contributor than smoke from cities, as the smoke from oil has a higher ratio of black soot, thus absorbing more sunlight. Hobbs compared the papers' assumed [...] "emission factor" [...] or soot generating efficiency from ignited oil pools and found, upon comparing to measured values from oil pools at Kuwait, which were the greatest soot producers, the emissions of soot assumed in the nuclear winter calculations were still [...] "too high".

Although the passengers were restrained, they were not initially treated badly. The hijackers forced the pilot to fly to Iran, where authorities initially refused the plane permission to land, but later acquiesced on learning it was running out of fuel. After subsequently landing at Mashhad, the hijackers issued their demand for the release of 17 guerrillas held by Kuwait following their conviction for involvement in the 1983 Kuwait bombings.

Reports again emerged of maltreatment, with claims passengers were being beaten for talking without permission, although these stories could not be confirmed. Another request was made for fuel on April 16. Algerian authorities reportedly kept the aircraft {{on the ground there}} at the request of Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian authorities, but talks were stalled when both sides reached an impasse, something Algeria blamed on Kuwait's unwillingness to discuss the 17 prisoners, which it described as [...] "intransigent".

40|$|The recent {{literature}} on stock markets has used modern time series {{techniques such as}} cointegration and causality to identify macroeconomic variables that cause stock index movements. But this type of investigation has {{to a large extent}} remained confined to markets belonging to well developed and diversified economies. Motivated by <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> set-ups involving stock markets from economies with different profiles, this paper concentrates on <b>the</b> <b>Kuwaiti</b> stock market whose unique features as an oil-dependent economy render its investigation a useful exercise. Based on multivariate time-series techniques and using monthly data spanning the period September 1992 to December 1998, the investigation reveals three important factors that are believed to have long-term equilibrium effects on stock market prices in Kuwait. Oil prices, U. S. interest rates and real estate prices are found to form a cointegrating relationship with stock prices. The results in this paper indicate clearly a sharp contrast in terms of stock market dynamics between an oil-dependent economy like Kuwait’s and those of highly diversified economies. It is argued that the reported results are nevertheless logical in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unique features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oil-dependent <b>Kuwaiti</b> economy. ...|$|R
