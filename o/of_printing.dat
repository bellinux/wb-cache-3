5|$|Even {{before the}} advent <b>of</b> <b>printing,</b> the visual {{appearance}} of poetry often added meaning or depth. Acrostic poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem.

5|$|Monotype's {{development}} of Ehrhardt took {{place under the}} influence of executive and historian <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> Stanley Morison, not long after their successful creation of Times New Roman. It began from a recognition that the Janson designs were well-respected by fine printers of the Arts and Crafts period such as Daniel Berkeley Updike, who could print books from them using hand-set type cast from surviving original matrices owned by the Stempel company of Germany. Morison had discussed what he knew of their history with Updike in their extensive correspondence from the 1920s onwards. Modernised versions of the Janson designs for hot metal printing were being created by Linotype and Monotype's American branch at the same time. In addition, Morison was interested in the history <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> in Leipzig, a centre of the German book trade, and would later write an article on the topic.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known herbals were {{produced}} in Europe between 1470 and 1670. The invention in Germany <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> from movable type in a printing press c. 1440 was a great stimulus to herbalism. The new herbals were more detailed with greater general appeal and often with Gothic script {{and the addition of}} woodcut illustrations that more closely resembled the plants being described.|$|E
5|$|Social reforms {{aimed at}} {{removing}} {{practices such as}} sati and social discrimination based upon untouchability, as well as demands for the emancipation of the lower classes, swept across India and influenced Mysore territory. In 1894, the kingdom passed laws to abolish the marriage of girls below the age of eight. Remarriage of widowed women and marriage of destitute women was encouraged, and in 1923, some women were granted the permission to exercise their franchise in elections. There were, however, uprisings against British authority in the Mysore territory, notably the Kodagu uprising in 1835 (after the British dethroned the local ruler Chikkaviraraja) and the Kanara uprising of 1837. The era <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> heralded by Christian missionaries, notably Hermann Mögling, resulted in the founding <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> presses across the kingdom. The publication of ancient and contemporary Kannada books (such as the Pampa Bharata and the Jaimini Bharata), a Kannada-language Bible, a bilingual dictionary and a Kannada newspaper called Kannada Samachara {{began in the early}} 19th century. Aluru Venkata Rao published a consolidated Kannada history glorifying the achievements of Kannadigas in his book Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The color {{reproduction}} {{is based on}} visual perception. The psychophysics experiments present the light source; illuminants and view background affect the results of color matching. Paper is a typical substrate for printed color matching and effects printed color greatly. Now almost all <b>of</b> <b>print</b> papers contain optical brightening agents, which changes significantly the color appearance <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> color and makes color shifting <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> color matching. This paper used CAT 02 chromatic adaptation models to transform the measurements <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> color in paper with and without OBA, compared the effect <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> color matching between before and after transforming with display, present the method using chromatic adaptation transforms to improve the accurate <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> color matching...|$|R

5|$|The {{innovation}} of {{movable type}} printing {{was made by}} the artisan Bi Sheng (990–1051), first described by the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. The collection of Bi Sheng's original clay-fired typeface was passed on to one of Shen Kuo's nephews, and was carefully preserved. Movable type enhanced the already widespread use of woodblock methods <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> thousands of documents and volumes of written literature, consumed eagerly by an increasingly literate public. The advancement <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> deeply affected education and the scholar-official class, since more books could be made faster while mass-produced, printed books were cheaper in comparison to laborious handwritten copies. The enhancement of widespread printing and print culture in the Song period was thus a direct catalyst in the rise of social mobility and expansion of the educated class of scholar elites, the latter which expanded dramatically in size from the 11th to 13th centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{rediscovery of}} ancient texts and the {{invention}} <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of more widely distributed ideas. In {{the first period}} of the Italian Renaissance, humanists favoured the study of humanities over natural philosophy or applied mathematics, and their reverence for classical sources further enshrined the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic views of the universe. Writing around 1450, Nicholas Cusanus anticipated the heliocentric worldview of Copernicus, but in a philosophical fashion.|$|E
5|$|Uzanne's {{bibliophile}} {{activity in}} the early 1880s coincided with the gradual abandonment of manual methods <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> illustrations kin favour of photomechanized methods. His collection of contemporary bibliophilic books was sold in 1894 by Hôtel Drouot.

5|$|After the war, {{under the}} Polish People's Republic, the {{intellectual}} and academic community of Kraków was put under complete political control. The universities were soon deprived <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> rights and autonomy. The Stalinist government ordered {{the construction of the}} country's largest steel mill in the newly created suburb of Nowa Huta. The creation of the giant Lenin Steelworks (now Sendzimir Steelworks owned by Mittal) sealed Kraków's transformation from a university city, into an industrial centre. The new working-class, drawn by the industrialisation of Kraków, contributed to rapid population growth.|$|E
5|$|Between 1769 and 1773, Bellman wrote 65 of 82 of his Epistles, {{as well as}} many poems. He {{attempted}} to publish the poems in 1772, but was unable to obtain the permission of the king, Gustav III, as a political coup intervened. He finally managed to obtain the permission in 1774, but soon discovered that the cost <b>of</b> <b>printing,</b> especially as he was determined to publish the sheet music alongside the text, was prohibitive given his ruinous finances, and he was forced to put off his plans. In 1776 the king gave him a sinecure job as secretary to the national lottery; this supported him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{compounds}} {{account for}} about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably bismuth subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> type. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently {{about a third of}} bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} two decades of his life, Josquin's fame spread abroad along with his music. The newly {{developed}} technology <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> made wide dissemination of his music possible, and Josquin was the favorite of the first printers: one of Petrucci's first publications, and the earliest surviving print of music by a single composer, was a book of Josquin's masses which he printed in Venice in 1502. This publication was successful enough that Petrucci published two further volumes of Josquin's masses, in 1504 and 1514, and reissued them several times.|$|E
5|$|From this {{changing}} society emerged a common, unifying musical language, {{in particular}} the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school. The development <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased {{with the emergence of}} a bourgeois class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated {{in the second half of}} the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria and William Byrd.|$|E

Most of the type had arrived by August, but with Young's death, the translation was never undertaken and the type never used.

40|$|With the {{invention}} <b>of</b> <b>print</b> in the 15 th {{century and the}} emergence of Dutch publishing houses in the 17 th century the need to bring logical collocation to large amounts <b>of</b> <b>prints</b> grew. This order can be utilized to understand the theoretical approach behind its organization. Most early collections are classified according to contemporary art theory: The inventor ranks the highest, regarding the collectors’ appraisal as well as the position within the order. First and foremost prints are considered as reproductions of paintings. Contrary to this the collection of Paulus Behaim (1592 - 1637) in its combination of collection, archive, and lab marks the earliest appraisal <b>of</b> <b>print</b> as an independent and not only reproducing art. Based on the collection’s inventories <b>of</b> <b>prints</b> and printing blocks and plates this thesis demonstrates that for Behaim <b>print</b> is part <b>of</b> sculptura, the art of sculpture. Here the engraver is emphasized and his practice is considered as translating and original. By this Behaim has developed a new and specific appreciation <b>of</b> <b>print</b> as an art form. His practice is based on the largest collection <b>of</b> <b>print</b> and <b>printing</b> blocks <b>of</b> its time, technical knowledge gathered by his own printing experiments, and research into historical artist oeuvres. The collection of Paulus Behaim marks the beginning of an independent scholarly approach to <b>print,</b> the beginning <b>of</b> <b>print</b> connoisseurship...|$|R
40|$|Muscovite {{awareness}} and use <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> books both predated and extended {{beyond the scope}} <b>of</b> native Muscovite <b>printing.</b> The three types of ‘asymmetry’ explored in this survey relate to the wider reception <b>of</b> <b>print</b> in Muscovy. The first and most widely noted is the chronological and cultural mismatch between the spread <b>of</b> <b>print</b> culture in Russia and in Western Europe. The second is the differential chronology and repertoire <b>of</b> local <b>print</b> production by comparison with the use <b>of</b> imported <b>printed</b> materials. The third – {{the main focus of}} the survey – is the phenomenon of “reverse technology transfer”, whereby West European printed materials were appropriated into manuscript culture in Muscovy. Examples are adduced from diverse and unrelated fields: medical knowledge, newspapers, and biblical illustration. Taken together, these patterns of asymmetry not only pose a challenge to “techno-determinist” approaches to the history <b>of</b> writing and <b>print,</b> but reflect a distinctive ecology of media, a distinctive set of cultural filters in the translation <b>of</b> <b>print</b> to Muscovy...|$|R
5|$|Indians {{are known}} to use resist method <b>of</b> <b>{{printing}}</b> designs on cotton fabrics, which {{can be traced back}} 2000 years. Initially, wax and even rice starch were used for printing on fabrics. Until recently batik was made only for dresses and tailored garments, but modern batik is applied in numerous items, such as murals, wall hangings, paintings, household linen, and scarves, with livelier and brighter patterns. Contemporary batik making in India is also done by the Deaf women of Delhi, these women are fluent in Indian Sign Language and also work in other vocational programs.|$|E
5|$|Much Middle Scots {{literature}} {{was produced by}} makars, poets with links to the royal court. These included James I who wrote The Kingis Quair. Many of the makars had university education and so were also connected with the Kirk. However, Dunbar's Lament for the Makaris (c. 1505) provides evidence of a wider tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk now largely lost. Before the advent <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> in Scotland, writers such as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas {{have been seen as}} leading a golden age in Scottish poetry.|$|E
5|$|Old-style serif typefaces by Garamond and {{his colleagues}} finally fell out of use {{altogether}} {{with the arrival of}} what is now called the Didone style <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, promoted by the Didot family in France and others. This favoured a much more geometric, constructed style of letter which could show off the increasingly refined paper and printing technologies of the period. Mosley comments: The upheavals of the Revolution coincided with the major shift in the style <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> types that is associated with the family of Didot, and the stock of old materials abruptly lost its value, except as scrap. Punches rust, and the copper of matrices is recyclable. All traces of the early types that had been {{in the hands of the}} trade typefounders like Le Bé, Sanlecque and Lamesle in Paris vanished completely. No relics of them were saved anywhere, except in commercial centres that had become relative backwaters, like Antwerp, where the Plantin-Moretus printing office piously preserved the collection of its founder... the term caractères de l'Université became attached by default to the set of apparently early matrices that had survived, its provenance forgotten, in the mixed stock of materials of the national printing-office.|$|E

40|$|THISARTICLE EXAMINES THE multidimensionality <b>of</b> <b>print</b> {{materials}} {{in order to}} discuss utility versus value <b>of</b> <b>print</b> materials as they age. Studies of changing uses <b>of</b> <b>print</b> materials over time have shown a bias on the part of researchers in favor of the hypothesis of obsolescence, although studies have failed to conclusively support that hypothesis. Based on issues raised in previously conducted obsolescence studies, this article presents a schema of parameters (superordinate classes of contextual variables) that affect all studies of changing uses <b>of</b> <b>print</b> materials over time. Recent studies have concentrated on the age-date relationship rather than on other parameters (especially the “use ” and “users ” parameters) or they have relegated concern about these parameters to other researchers. This article argues that only by incorporating what can be learned about all the parameters of the seamless web of co-occurring events surrounding the changing uses <b>of</b> <b>print</b> materials will researchers and librarians be able {{to make use of the}} quantitative data on the declining numbers <b>of</b> uses <b>of</b> <b>print</b> materials...|$|R
