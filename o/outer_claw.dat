5000|$|Rhinyptia is a genus of scarab beetles. The genus is characterised by the clypeus {{narrowing}} into a {{long and}} pointed tip (a [...] "snout"). The male has the <b>outer</b> <b>claw</b> of the mid leg unforked. There are about 20 species in the genus and are found in Asia and Africa. The African forms are placed in the subgenus Pararhinyptia. The larvae are white and curled (also known as whitegrubs) as in other scarabs living under the ground and feeding on roots of various plants. Adults feed on flowers and their emergence {{is associated with the}} flowering of various grasses including cultivated millet and cereal crops. Adults are attracted to lights.|$|E

Variation in styles of measurement (both inner and <b>outer</b> <b>claw</b> curvature angles) has made it difficult to compare results across studies, as have over-simplified ecological categories. We sought to increase sample size in a new analysis devised to test claw geometry against ecological niche. We found that taxa from different behavioural categories overlapped extensively in claw geometry. Whilst most taxa plotted as predicted, some fossil taxa were recovered in unexpected positions. Inner and <b>outer</b> <b>claw</b> curvatures were statistically correlated, and both correlated with relative claw robusticity (mid-point claw height). We corrected for mass and phylogeny, as both likely influence claw morphology. We conclude that there is no strong mass-specific effect on claw curvature; furthermore, correlations between claw geometry and behaviour are consistent across disparate clades. By using independent contrasts to correct for phylogeny, we found little significant relationship between claw geometry and behaviour. 'Ground-dweller' claws are less curved and relatively dorsoventrally deep relative to those of other behavioural categories; beyond this it is difficult to assign an explicit category to a claw based purely on geometry...|$|E

40|$|During the {{analysis}} of phytal meiobenthic samples collected from a rocky-sandy beach {{in the state of}} Nayarit, in the Mexican Pacific, several specimens of harpacticoid copepods were obtained and taxonomically examined. These specimens were found to represent an undescribed species of the peltidiid genus Peltidium Philippi, 1839. The new species, P. nayarit sp. n. is described herein. It resembles P. nichollsi Geddes and P. lerneri Geddes from Bahamas but also the widespread P. speciosum Thompson & Scott and P. purpureum Philippi. The new species from the Mexican Pacific differs from its known congeners by its possession of a unique combination of characters, including a modified pectinate seta on the antennary exopod, three terminal setae on the second endopodal segment of leg 1, third exopodal segment of leg 1 with three elements, inner terminal claw twice as long as <b>outer</b> <b>claw,</b> female fifth leg with 5 exopodal setae, exopodal setae I-III stout, spinulose and seta IV being as long as seta V.

40|$|Canine claws {{are complex}} {{epithelial}} structures resembling the mammalian hair fibre, and human nail plate, {{in terms of}} tissue-specific differentiation. They are composed of several distinct epithelial cell lineages undergoing either hard or soft keratinization. The claw plate has three distinct regions: stratum externum, stratum medium (SM) and stratum internum and the underside and tip are cushioned by a soft keratinizing epithelium, the sole. We have examined keratin expression in the canine claw and associated epithelia. Digits from German shepherd dogs were decalcified, processed and sectioned by sledge microtome. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin or treated with specific antibodies to various keratins (immunohistochemistry). Proteins were extracted from claw components and analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The keratinized canine claw plate expressed hair-specific keratins (type I, K 25 -K 38 and type II, K 71 -K 86) but only the inner region of the SM contained K 6 - and K 16 -positive tubules, soft epithelia running through the hard keratinized claw plate. The soft keratinaceous sole epithelium expressed keratins K 5, K 6, K 14, K 16 and K 17 and contained cells with abundant envelopes. The canine claw had two slippage zones, the inner claw bed, between the claw plate and ungula process, which expressed K 17 and the region between the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>claw</b> sheath, equivalent to the hair follicle companion layer, which expressed K 6, K 77, K 16 and K 17. In conclusion, several different cell types have been defined in the canine claw presenting a complex mechanism of cellular differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{were made}} {{of the extent of}} sole and white line lesions on the claws of 1 15 Holstein-Friesian cows on at least three and at most 16 occasions, and some cows were {{followed}} up to their third lactation. All the measurements were made between 12 weeks before calving and 45 weeks after calving. In total, 1016 repeated observations were made. Correlations were calculated between pairs of claws, between types of lesion (sole and white line), and between pairs of the different measurements (number of lesions, proportion of the claw affected, maximum severity score and proportion of the claw affected weighted for severity). The <b>outer</b> hind <b>claws</b> had the greatest extent of lesions of both types. Spearman correlation coefficients and confidence intervals measured the strength of the association. All the associations between claws were positive, suggesting that the lesions did not occur in isolation. Sole and white line lesions were not associated at individual observation points.

40|$|In a {{double-blind}} study, {{the influence}} of biotin supplementation on lameness in dairy cows was investigated over a 13 -mo period. The experimental site was a tropical upland environment and involved over 2705 Holstein and Friesian cows on 20 participating farms. Cows on 10 farms received biotin {{at a rate of}} 20 mg/head per day in the concentrate, and cows on 10 other farms received feed without the biotin supplement. Premixes with or without biotin were incorporated into a grain concentrate that was fed at a constant rate to cows at milking. Farmers maintained accurate records of the nature of hoof problems and any treatment applied. Each herd was evaluated for locomotion scores at 8 -wk intervals. Locomotion scores were significantly correlated with the number of days with measurable rainfall per month (r = 0. 88). The biotin-supplemented herds exhibited better locomotion scores than the unsupplemented herds. In the wet summer period the number of lame cows, as observed by the farmer, were significantly fewer during the rainy period for the biotin-supplemented herds and required fewer antibiotic treatments than unsupplemented herds. Most hoof lesions were most commonly observed in the <b>outer</b> <b>claws</b> of the hind limb. Daily milk production (17. 3 vs. 18. 5 L) was not affected by biotin supplementation. Reduced milk fat percentage and somatic cell counts of bulk milk were recorded in the biotin supplemented herds during the wet, summer period...|$|R

40|$|Conformation and {{locomotive}} characteristics (CLC), i. e., leg conformation and gait movement patterns, may {{be associated}} with osteochondrosis (OC) in pigs. Osteochondrosis and CLC increase the risk of premature culling. This study investigated whether CLC have an explanatory value, over the previously modelled effects of sex, feeding, and housing conditions, on the occurrence and severity of OC in several joints and at the animal level. At 154 to 156 d of age, 267 pigs were subjectively scored on 9 conformation and 2 locomotive characteristics. Scoring was performed on a 9 -point linear grading scale. For conformation characteristics, score 5 indicated normal conformation and scores 1 and 9 indicated severe deviations from normal. For the locomotive characteristics, score 1 indicated normal locomotion and score 9 indicated severe deviation from normal. At 161 to 176 d of age, pigs were slaughtered and joints were dissected for macroscopic evaluation of OC status. Results showed that swaying hindquarters and a stiffer gait were associated with higher scores for OC in, respectively, the femoropatellar (P = 0. 018) and tarsocrural joint (P = 0. 005); smaller inner claws as compared to the <b>outer</b> <b>claws</b> of the front legs was associated with lower scores for OC than equally sized claws in the femoropatellar joint (P = 0. 021) and on animal level (P = 0. 010); steep and weak pasterns of the front legs were associated with higher scores for OC in the elbow joint (P = 0. 004) and on animal level (P = 0. 018); X-shaped hind legs was associated with higher scores for OC on animal level (P = 0. 037); and steep and weak pasterns of the hind legs were associated with lower scores for OC than normal conformation in the tarsocrural joint (P = 0. 05). This study found several CLC that were associated with OC in several joints and at an animal level. This study showed that certain CLC might be used as indicators of OC and included in the criteria for selection of replacement animals for the breeding herd...|$|R
