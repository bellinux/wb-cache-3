5|$|The {{events that}} took place in the western regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR</b> {{occupied}} by Nazi Germany in the first weeks after the German invasion, including Lithuania, marked the sharp intensification of the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|The {{widely known}} sources {{including}} published and written memoirs by victims of psychiatric arbitrariness convey moral and physical sufferings {{experienced by the}} victims in special psychiatric hospitals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR.</b>|$|E
25|$|Often {{considered}} the most powerful indictment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR's</b> gulag ever made. It appeared on the Independent newspaper's poll <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Top 100 books, which surveyed more than 25,000 people.|$|R
50|$|From 1985 to 1991, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev {{attempted}} {{to reduce the}} Soviet Army’s financial straining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR’s</b> economy; he slowly reduced its size, and withdrew it from Afghanistan in 1989.|$|R
50|$|During the Soviet occupation, the United Nations {{was highly}} {{critical}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.S.R.'s</b> interference in <b>the</b> internal affairs <b>of</b> Afghanistan and {{was instrumental in}} obtaining a negotiated Soviet withdrawal under <b>the</b> terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Geneva Accords.|$|R
5|$|Because Kazakhstan {{was once}} a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR,</b> its rail system connects with and carries the same rail gauge as the Russian rail system, {{as well as the}} other Central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the {{collapse}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR</b> in Eastern Europe gave many new countries {{the opportunity to}} compete. Three countries—Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, all of them former Yugoslav republics, won through from a pre-qualifier to compete. After the 1993 event, a relegation system was introduced, allowing even more Eastern European countries to compete: seven more made their debut in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In the USSR itself, glasnost {{weakened}} the bonds {{that held the}} Soviet Union together and by February 1990, with the dissolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR</b> looming, the Communist Party was forced to surrender its 73-year-old monopoly on state power.|$|E
50|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR's</b> {{support for}} Republican Spain in the Spanish Civil War, twelve Pattern 1914/15 guns arrived at <b>the</b> port <b>of</b> Alicante on January 18, 1937. Four {{anti-aircraft}} batteries of three guns were formed.|$|R
2500|$|By <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR's</b> collapse, <b>the</b> Leningrad Metro {{comprised}} 54 {{stations and}} [...] of track. Up until this period, it was officially {{known as the}} 'V.I. Lenin Leningrad Metro <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Order <b>of</b> Lenin' (Леининградский Метрополитен Ордена Ленина имени В.И.Ленина).|$|R
50|$|Although the Soviet Union {{condemned}} the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact — the immediate forerunner to the occupation — {{it is currently}} <b>the</b> policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR's</b> legal successor Russian Federation to deny that the events constituted occupation or were illegal under applicable (international) laws.|$|R
5|$|The {{structure}} {{and number of}} employees of the Ministry were approved by the Council of Ministers. Staffing of the central apparatus of the Ministry, as well as provisions of the departments and divisions, were approved by the Ministry of Justice. The seal of the Ministry of Justice was the state emblem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, in 1939, the International Secretariat was moved to New York City. The resident International Executive Committee failed to meet, largely because of a struggle in the U.S. Socialist Workers Party (SWP) between Trotsky's supporters and the tendency of Max Shachtman, Martin Abern and James Burnham. The secretariat was composed of those committee members {{who happened to be}} in the city, most of whom were co-thinkers of Shachtman. The disagreement centred on the Shachtmanites' disagreements with the SWP's internal policy, and over the FI's unconditional defence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hans Ephraimson-Abt, whose {{daughter}} Alice Ephraimson-Abt had {{died on the}} flight, chaired the American Association for Families of KAL007 Victims. He single-handedly pursued three U.S. administrations for answers about the flight, flying to Washington 250 times and meeting with 149 State Department officials. Following the dissolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.S.R.,</b> Ephraimson-Abt persuaded U.S. Senators Ted Kennedy, Sam Nunn, Carl Levin, and Bill Bradley to write to the Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev requesting information about the flight.|$|E

50|$|Deputy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR‘s</b> 8th {{convocation}} (1970—1974). Twice {{elected as}} deputy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ukraine in <b>the</b> 1960s. Member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> All-Union Communist Party Bolsheviks since 1940. Was member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Communist Party <b>of</b> Ukraine Central Committee in the 1960-1970s.|$|R
50|$|For {{several years}} after World War II there were no new SPAAG models in <b>the</b> <b>USSR</b> except for <b>the</b> BTR-152A (which were armed with two or four 14.5mm KPV heavy machine guns, {{designed}} ZTPU-4) and the BTR-40A (ZTPU-2) wheeled SPAAGs. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR's</b> potential enemies - the United States and Great Britain, had high-quality air forces with substantial ground-attack experience. The {{need for a new}} tracked AA vehicle was apparent.|$|R
5|$|In 1964, after Nikita Khrushchev's ouster, a plenum of the Central Committee (CC) forbade {{any single}} {{individual}} {{to hold the}} two most powerful posts of the country (the office of the General Secretary and the premier), and Kosygin {{was in charge of}} economic administration in his role as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. However Kosygin's position was weakened when he proposed an economic reform in 1965. Under the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was the head of government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR.</b> The premier was the chief of the executive branch and head of the union government as a whole, the premiership was the highest governmental office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition until the establishment of the Presidency in 1990. The premier was responsible and accountable to the Supreme Soviet, and in the period between sessions of the Supreme Soviet, accountable to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The premier was tasked with resolving all state administrative duties within the jurisdiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR</b> to the degree that it did not come under the competence of the Supreme Soviet or the Presidium. The premier managed the national economy, formulated the five-year plans and ensured socio-cultural development.|$|E
5|$|It {{took several}} years {{and a team of}} assistants to piece {{together}} the scanned fragments (many only half a page in width) of the hundreds of documents photocopied by Bukovsky and then, in 1999, to make them available online. Many of the same documents were extensively quoted and cited in Bukovsky's Judgment in Moscow (1995), where he described and analysed what he had uncovered about recent Soviet history and about the relations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR</b> and the CPSU with the West.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR</b> and Germany had already become apparent. It also removed the need for a {{declaration}} of neutrality (which would have granted the Nationalists and Republicans control over neutrals in the areas they controlled), and had little legal standing. In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E
2500|$|While the FNLA and UNITA were {{funded by}} South Africa and the U.S., the Soviet Union had {{provided}} {{billions of dollars}} in military support for the MPLA, which was identified as a socialist group. By <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, Angola had become <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR’s</b> African policy.|$|R
40|$|A {{tremendous}} part {{in solving}} <b>the</b> problems <b>of</b> communist construction {{in our country}} is being played by <b>the</b> long-range plans <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national economy. As is known, <b>the</b> CC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CPSU and the Soviet government made a decision in 1957 to prepare a perspective plan for <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>USSR</b> economy for 1959 - 1965. Carrying out this plan will bring us closer to <b>the</b> solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR's</b> basic economic problem â in the shortest historical period {{to catch up to}} and surpass the most advanced capitalist countries in per capita production. ...|$|R

5|$|Khrushchev {{assisted}} in the purge of many friends and colleagues in Moscow oblast. Of 38top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed—the three survivors were transferred to other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR.</b> Of the 146Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges. In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone {{who worked with him}} was arrested. By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on 20 February 1948, Prokofiev's {{estranged wife}} Lina {{was arrested for}} 'espionage', as {{she had tried to}} send money to her mother in Spain. After nine months of interrogation, she was sentenced by a three-member Military Collegium of the Supreme Court <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR</b> to 20 years of hard labour. She was {{eventually}} released after Stalin's death in 1953 and in 1974 left the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the eleven}} {{individuals}} appointed head of state, three died in office {{of natural causes}} (Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko), one held the position in a temporary role (Vasili Kuznetsov), and four held posts of party leader and head of state simultaneously (Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko and Mikhail Gorbachev). The first head of state was Mikhail Kalinin, who was inaugurated in 1922 after the Treaty on the Creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR.</b> At over twenty years, Kalinin spent the longest time in office; he died shortly after his resignation in 1946. Andropov spent the shortest time in office.|$|E
25|$|Between 1991 and 1997 newly {{independent}} Russia's defence spending fell {{by a factor}} of eight in real prices. In 1998, when Russia experienced a severe financial crisis, its military expenditure in real terms reached its lowest point— barely one-quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR's</b> in 1991, and two-fifths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> 1992, <b>the</b> first year <b>of</b> Russia's independent existence.|$|R
50|$|A further {{indictment}} was Kostov's outspoken criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR's</b> economic {{practices in}} Eastern Europe. At <b>the</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>USSR</b> was buying Bulgarian tobacco at an incredibly low price and then flooding {{the world market}} with it - at prices which undercut Bulgaria (G. and N. Swain, 2003). Another example of this type is Polish coal. The other 10 accused prominent Communists, among them ministers and high Party officials, received life imprisonment, 15 or 12 years sentences.|$|R
50|$|During the cordial Sino-Soviet {{relations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>USSR</b> {{engaged in}} a cooperative technology transfer program with the PRC under which they taught Chinese students and provided the fledgling program with a sample R-2 rocket.|$|R
5|$|Since many Soviet {{soldiers}} had lost {{family and friends}} during the German invasion and partial occupation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR</b> (about 17 million Soviet civilians plus 10 million Soviet soldiers died in World War II, more {{than in any other}} country), many felt a desire for vengeance. Murders of Axis prisoners of war and German civilians are known from cases at Soviet military tribunals. Also, when Soviet troops moved into East Prussia, large numbers of enslaved Ostarbeiter ("Eastern workers") were freed, and knowledge of the suffering and deaths of many of these workers hardened the attitude of many Soviet soldiers towards East Prussians.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Civil Aviation was, {{according}} to the Air Code <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR,</b> responsible for all air transport enterprises and airlines established by it. Soviet civil air transport was the largest by total destinations and vehicles during most of its post-war existence. In the USSR, Aeroflot had a monopoly on all air transport. This ranged from civil transport and cargo to transporting political prisoners to the gulags, and more.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union had 26 major ports, {{eleven of}} them inland ports. There were 70 ports in total. None of the ports could be {{considered}} major by world standards. By the 1980s the majority of Soviet ports were lagging behind the First World technologically. There were also {{a high number of}} surplus workers, many of whom would become redundant if the USSR would introduce new, more advanced, technology. Also, in the northeast territories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR</b> most ports were closed down due to cold climate.|$|E
40|$|During <b>the</b> {{several decades}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR's</b> existence, Soviet mathematicians produced, at intervals, {{a number of}} volumes of survey {{articles}} which {{provide us with a}} series of ‘snapshots’ of Soviet mathematics down the years. In this paper, I introduce these volumes as a resource for historians of Soviet mathematics, and consider the picture they paint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> abstract algebra in <b>the</b> <b>USSR,</b> paying particular attention to the aspects in which these surveys differ from later, retrospective accounts of Soviet algebra...|$|R
40|$|A poster {{dedicated}} to the OSOAVIAKHIM, a non-profit organization which promoted supporting the Soviet military and military-related industry. Caption reads, "OSOAVIAKHIM [...] opora mirnogo truda i oborony S. S. S. R. Daesh' sovetskii dirizhabl'! / ОСОАВИАХИМ [...] опора мирного труда и обороны С. С. С. Р. Даешь советский дирижабль!", meaning, "OSOAVIAKHIM is a cornerstone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR's</b> peaceful work and defense. Let's build a Soviet dirigible!"...|$|R
50|$|During the Cold War, <b>the</b> governments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S., <b>the</b> <b>USSR,</b> Great Britain, and China {{attempted}} {{to educate their}} citizens about surviving a nuclear attack by providing procedures on minimizing short-term exposure to fallout. This effort commonly became known as Civil Defense.|$|R
