50|$|The branch was {{originally}} double track but then was {{worked as a}} single track line after the First World War. The original up line was not lifted but used as a long siding. This siding was later used for the storage of locomotives bound for the scrap yard. There were no intermediate stations and the <b>only</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> on the line was closed in 1957 when the line was worked under one engine in steam.|$|E
50|$|In August 2008, a new {{electronic}} interlocking {{controlled by}} the Leipzig Operating Centre (Betriebszentrale) replaced seven locally operated signal boxes, some using lever frames. It controls the train traffic between Weinböhla and Dresden-Neustadt. It replaced five mechanical interlockings of the Jüdel type and two power signal boxes (Befehlsstellwerk) of S&H type. An automatic track vacancy detection system was not installed. Two dispatchers direct operations using the Sächsischen Befehlsblocks (Saxon command block) system. An upgrade and adaptation of these systems {{in the course of}} the German Unity Transport Project (Verkehrsprojekts Deutsche Einheit) No. 9 has not been possible as the regulations could not have been complied with. Many jobs were lost in relation to signalling, control of points and train detection. Of the seven signal boxes, <b>only</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 1 on the eastern side has been retained as a memorial.|$|E
50|$|In 1913, Benalla {{gained a}} second and third platform, these being a wide island platform, with a {{cantilevered}} verandah, located {{to the west of}} the main station building. The platforms were linked by an iron footbridge, which was provided in 1888, and was located across the station yard. The island platform was removed in 1937, leaving the main platform <b>only.</b> Two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were built in 1888, both being extended in 1914. <b>Only</b> the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at the up end remains today, but is unused.|$|R
50|$|Leipzig-Wahren station did {{not receive}} a central <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> <b>only</b> a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at its exit with a track-diagram relay {{interlocking}} of the GS II DR type. Also, colour-light signals were not installed throughout the station and were essentially only used as entry signals and on the passenger tracks. Electrodynamic track brakes were installed on the marshalling-yard hump.|$|R

50|$|Rhiw Goch has the <b>only</b> {{regularly}} manned <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> on {{the railway}} and the 1974 vintage box {{was replaced by}} a new enlarged box during 2006/7. This included provision for the bats which have made the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> their home.|$|R
25|$|The loop was signalled with up {{home and}} down home, but no starters. At first <b>only</b> a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was present, {{with a long}} {{unbroken}} fence running {{along the back of}} the platforms and no other buildings or lighting. The other station buildings and facilities were probably added circa 1908. Crossing gates protected level crossings {{at both ends of the}} station.|$|R
25|$|Westward Ho!, {{the busiest}} station, {{had its own}} Station Master, Mr. MacLaughlan; it had two {{platform}}s, platform lighting, a passing loop, ticket office, an 8-lever <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and a 2-lever ground frame operated by Mr. Spry; a waiting room, refreshment room, bookstall, level crossing gates and a Concert Hall called the Station Hall. A siding ran to the Westward Ho! Gas Works. An early photograph shows Westward Ho! with <b>only</b> the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and a long unbroken fence running {{along the back of}} the platforms with no other buildings or lighting. The similarity in appearance and construction between the Westward Ho! and Appledore platform buildings suggests that they were both built at the same time, circa 1908.|$|R
50|$|The OS maps of 1895 shows <b>only</b> a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and <b>signals</b> at the location.. By the 1920s {{only minor}} {{infrastructure}} was present {{as might be}} expected at such a remote location with the double track main line, one siding running off to a loading dock to the west, a weighing machine, small buildings and an access off the B744 road to Crosshands with a road over bridge. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> or cabin was situated on {{the eastern side of the}} main line with several semaphore signal posts and cross over points were present with runaway points located in the up line about 400yds towards Hurlford from the <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> In 1898 the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was staffed day and night during the week but only from 7.30am to 8pm on Sundays. The G&SWR Permanent Way Department was responsible for the cleaning of the points and signals rather than staff from Mauchline railway station.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century (circa 1913) on the railway {{embankment}} a control room Gantry was built, the only one of its kind in northern Poland. Architects incorporated into it in the eclectic style of the district. In May 2015, in the face of intention to demolish this unique object by PKP (in all of Poland there are <b>only</b> 5 such <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> all others are located in the Upper Silesia), it was added to the register of monuments.|$|R
5000|$|Constructed in 1835, the Stationmaster's House is a Grade II* Listed Building, whilst the {{footbridge}} and signalbox {{are both}} Grade II Listed. The station {{is one of}} the earliest still in use in the world. Station Road crosses the line by a level crossing and the station layout is unusual in that the platforms are not opposite each other. The west-bound (Carlisle) platform is to the east of the level crossing alongside the stationmaster's house, while the east-bound (Newcastle) platform is {{to the west of the}} level crossing. The overline, elevated <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> once a popular design for the NE line is now almost unique, the <b>only</b> other surviving <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> of this design is at [...]|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} a modern-style halt {{on the line}} and was opened on Monday 7 November 1966 to replace the town's {{original}} larger grander station located further west towards Norton; this closed the previous day and was subsequently demolished in the early 1970s. It was located next to the level crossing carrying the old route of the A19 across the railway. <b>Only</b> the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and footbridge survive {{on the site of the}} original station. The new Billingham station of British Rail was provided with a booking hall, waiting room, parcels office and lavatories. These facilities were lost when the station was reduced to unstaffed halt status towards the end of the 1960s. The station building of 1966 still stands, and is used as the office of local taxi company Binks Taxis.|$|R
50|$|Signals are {{controlled}} from the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at Truro. Axle counters allow one train {{to be in}} the section between Penwithers Junction and Penryn, and another between Penryn and Falmouth Docks. The Up and Down Branch line (the platform line) is signalled for trains in either direction; the Down Loop is <b>only</b> <b>signalled</b> for trains towards Falmouth.|$|R
50|$|Despite the station's size {{there was}} never a <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> At the end of the {{platform}} was the <b>only</b> <b>signal,</b> a single crossbar stop signal topped by a lamp. This was hand operated {{from the base of the}} post and was not interlocked to any points or the level crossing gates. This signal however, for quite a period, was seldom used.|$|R
50|$|In 1908 the GER {{wrote to}} the Board of Trade and advised that the line would never carry passengers. This meant the branch could operate on a one engine in steam {{principle}} and no signals would be required at Snape. This enabled the ever careful GER to make operational savings with the <b>only</b> <b>signalling</b> be approaching the junction (and controlled by the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> there).|$|R
50|$|The station building, {{the nearby}} level {{crossing}} <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and footbridge are each listed buildings. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was the prototype for the Airfix kit <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station {{also had}} three <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> I (Stellwerk I) {{was in the}} {{northern}} part of the station, <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> II was in the middle of the platform. <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> III was in the southern part of the station. Since the 1980s, however, they have been out of operation.|$|R

5000|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) to the West Highland Line, Mallaig Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> worked to Spean Bridge and Banavie Canal Bridge <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> on the routes towards Glasgow and Mallaig respectively. RETB was commissioned by British Rail between Mallaig Junction and Mallaig on 6 December 1987 and between Fort William Junction and [...] on 29 May 1988. As a consequence, Fort William Junction S.B. now works <b>only</b> to Banavie <b>Signalling</b> Centre, on both routes.|$|R
5000|$|... the {{extension}} of the Süderelbe junction interlocking zone, which is now remotely controlled from the modernised <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> in Hamburg-Harburg (and the dismantling of Sf <b>signal</b> <b>box).</b> Veddel Vf, Hob and Wr IV (in the former Hamburg main freight yard) <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> are now also controlled from Hamburg-Harburg and Hob and Wr IV <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> have been dismantled.|$|R
50|$|In 1934 the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{was closed}} and {{semaphore}} Intermediate Block Signals, controlled from Moreton and Hoylake boxes, were introduced, the <b>only</b> such <b>signals</b> on the Liverpool to West Kirby line. They broke the otherwise long distance between Moreton and Hoylake, the two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> on either side. These semaphore signals remained until 1994 when the line was resignalled with colour-light signals. The station underwent refurbishment with work in 2010 which involved new glazing to the footbridge windows and staircase, redevelopment of existing buildings to provide enclosed passenger waiting shelters, a new passenger toilet and automatic entrance doors to the booking hall.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} signalled by {{a mixture of}} semaphore signals and colour lights by several <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> over the years. Almost every station had a <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> Lewes even had five <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> controlling the area including the goods yard. Polegate had three <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> and other <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> at Willingdon and Stone Cross junctions and at Pevensey Bay and Cooden Beach There were also crossing boxes at Ripe, between Glynde and Berwick, and at Wilmington, between Berwick and Polegate.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2013 the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was repainted externally. In June 2016 the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{frame and}} point {{connecting}} rods were renewed increasing {{the life expectancy}} of the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and reducing the chance of failure ...|$|R
50|$|Bidston {{had four}} <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> in 1899. These <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were {{situated}} alongside the Dee, West, East and North junctions. The nearest {{to the station}} was the Bidston Dee Junction box. The second Dee Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{was built in the}} 1930s by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and was much larger than the earlier <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> which had been built by the Wirral Railway. This <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> had a 65-lever frame and also took over the operation of Bidston North Junction, when built. Bidston Dee Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was closed on 17 September 1994, and demolished two months later on 20 November.|$|R
50|$|The {{dismantling}} of the Rhenish line between Steinfurt and St. Arnold started on 30 September 2005. Of the four former <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> two have already been demolished, the Bn <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> on the Rhenish line and the Bmf <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> which was located on the former middle platform. The two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> on the Enschede line (the Bf <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{to the south and}} the Bw <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{to the north of the}} station) are still standing, but are out of service. Since 26 October 2008, signalling and points at the station have been remotely controlled from the electronic signalling centre at Coesfeld (Westf) station.|$|R
50|$|The station did {{not have}} a passing loop being only a block post {{splitting}} the line into two sections. It had a goods yard, <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> goods shed, and a level crossing with gates. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> near the level crossing was replaced by a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> located on the platform in 1915. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was renamed Dousland from Dousland Barn.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station has}} been {{controlled}} by an electronic interlocking at Jena-Göschwitz and built by Siemens since 27 November 2011. One day before, the dispatchers <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> [...] "Jm", {{was taken out}} of operation. The guard <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> [...] "Js", was also closed. Until September 2006, there was another <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> [...] "Jn". All were mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> of the Jüdel type.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> {{were opened}} in 1889, the 13-lever North <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> by Torquay Road level crossing, the 17-lever South <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> by Sands Road level crossing. Both were {{replaced}} in 1924 by two new boxes. The North box closed on 26 March 1988 when control of trains {{was transferred to}} the Panel <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> at Exeter but the South box was retained to monitor the two level crossings. In 1990 this function was transferred to a panel in the station buildings and the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> closed.|$|R
50|$|Lostwithiel <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> is a Grade II listed former Great Western Railway <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> {{located on}} Lostwithiel railway station in Cornwall, England. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> is {{situated}} at {{the northern end of}} Platform 1, adjacent to the level crossing.|$|R
5000|$|At Horsted Keynes, the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and {{an engine}} {{house to the}} south of the station are also Grade II listed buildings. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> is {{described}} as [...] "the only remaining Type 1 <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> on the LBSC line".|$|R
40|$|Modern {{computerised}} railway control {{methods are}} making traditional railway <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> obsolete and most <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> owned by Network Rail in Great Britain will close by 2026. Many of these <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> have a listing as buildings of architectural or historical significance. Listed buildings should ideally {{remain in their}} original location and this particularly applies to <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> where the railway environment is an intrinsic aspect of the listing. However, there is pressure to relocate redundant listed and heritage <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> Primary research methodology is by focusing upon key exemplars to determine the actual situation against theoretical conservation policy and practice. Findings are that while relocation affects the building’s conservation integrity, presentation of relocated <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> in a heritage railway environment provides for interpretation of railway history. The conclusions identify that there are contradictory requirements and pressures in conserving heritage <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> These pressures materially affect the conservation process {{and there is a}} need to redefine accepted conservation theory to cope with the realties of <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> preservation. This will necessitate engagement by all interested parties and a systematic identification of all affected <b>signal</b> <b>boxes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Oban {{originally}} had two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> namely Oban Station <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> (the larger of the two), and Oban Goods Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> The latter was situated {{about a quarter}} mile further south, where the line to the goods yard and engine shed diverged from the single line. The original <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> contained 21 and 5 levers, respectively. The single line between the two boxes was doubled in 1881.|$|R
50|$|The Weilheim station {{originally}} had three mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> 1 controlled movements between {{different parts of}} the station precinct and was located at the northern end of the station west of the tracks. <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> 2 was operated by the train despatcher and was situated south of the entrance building between the local loading tracks and the station building. Both were mechanical interlocking of the Krauss class of 1902. <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> 3 was a mechanical interlocking of the Krauss class of 1925, which controlled the marshalling yard and was located {{at the southern end of}} the sidings to the west of the station. In 1983, the three <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were replaces by a centralised <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> with a track-plan push-button interlocking of the Lorenz L60 class, which is housed in an cubic, three-storey building with an attached observation deck. This <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> controls, in addition to the Weilheim station area, the Wilzhofen and Polling areas. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> is located on the main platform north of the entrance building.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008, the Mathilde <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> took {{over control of the}} {{departure}} yard from Duirburg-Ruhrort port station. All other DB <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> there are now closed and replaced by electrically operated points. A <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at Duirburg port remains in operation.|$|R
50|$|It had {{a passing}} loop, two wooden {{platforms}} and {{what appears to}} have been a ticket office come <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> hut. No freight facilities were provided.
