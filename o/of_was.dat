5|$|After Debonnaire's {{death in}} 1833, Hesketh-Fleetwood {{immersed}} himself in his development plans. Southport, a town he owned much <b>of,</b> <b>was</b> becoming a popular sea bathing resort, and Hesketh-Fleetwood organised {{the construction of a}} promenade. He was becoming concerned over delays {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company and decided to get on with building Fleetwood. He hired his old friend Decimus Burton, who had become a successful architect, and together they discussed what buildings would be required. Hesketh-Fleetwood wanted a church, docks, housing, a gas office, a school and a hotel. Burton agreed that a hotel would be important for passengers to spend the night before travelling on to Scotland. Because those passengers would be arriving from Euston railway station in London, Hesketh-Fleetwood decided to call the hotel the North Euston Hotel. Burton's plans were ready by 1835.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, amateur and {{professional}} wrestling enjoyed widespread popularity in New Zealand popular culture. Part of this <b>of</b> <b>was</b> due to its radio broadcasts from live events both prior to and after the war.

The Wellington Town Hall Concert Chamber was one of the more popular postwar venues for wrestling events. Within a few years, New Zealand champions were traveling oversees as far as Western Canada.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} four {{forms of the}} {{philosophical}} consciousness <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> {{which can lead to}} a break-through of Hegel' s logical ontology at the metalogicallevel. The views of K. Jaspers, S. L. Frank, P T. Raju and D. T. Suzuki are considered in succession. These four modern philosophers conform to the following methodological conditions: a. they <b>are</b> representative <b>of</b> prevailing forms of the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in the traditions of Western, Russian. Indian and Chinese philosophy; b. they have given expression to the metalogical factor in the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> and c. they can be confronted basically. with Hegel's logical ontology. Their views are. structurally characterized by the author and submitted to critical comparison. It is then demonstrated that the Indian philosopher Aurobindo Ghose has assimilated these forms of the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in his personal experience <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> Finally, the author shows how the Western logical Notion <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> is overcome by the metalogical experience <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Due {{partly to}} the limited success of his latest book outside Indiana, Riley was persuaded to begin working with other midwestern writers to attempt to form an {{association}} to promote their work. Popular Indiana writer Lew Wallace, author <b>of</b> , <b>was</b> a major promoter of the effort. During 1885, {{more than one hundred}} writers joined the group. They held their first meeting in July, naming themselves the Western Association of Writers. At the meeting Maurice Thompson was named president, and Riley vice president. The association never succeeded in its goals of creating a powerful advertising force, but became a social club and a rival literary community to the eastern writing establishment. Riley was disappointed with the shortcomings of the group, but came to depend on its regular meetings as a escape from his normally hectic schedule.|$|E

The latter <b>of</b> <b>was</b> particular interest because at one point the Los Alamos Laboratory considered using it in an atomic bomb instead of metallic uranium, but the idea was found to be inefficient, and was shelved. A process was developed to recovery depleted uranium metal from the uranium tetrafluoride left over from the electromagnetic isotope separation process and uranium hexafluoride left over from the gaseous diffusion process. This was operated as a pilot plant that produced kilogram quantities, before being turned over to the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories for implementation on an industrial scale at Oak Ridge.|$|E

This study addresses four areas of importance to the perceptions <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teacheers: (a) Thai university students' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teachers {{from the beginning to}} the end of the course; (b) <b>BE</b> teachers' perceptions <b>of</b> themselves from the beginning {{to the end of the}} course; (c) BE teachers' and students' variables related to their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teachers; and (d) students' perceptions and their teachers' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teachers. This study employs quantitative and qualitative research methods: pre- and post-course surveys and interviews. The surveys were distributed to eight BE teachers and their 57 students at the beginning and the end of the eight-week courses. The results of pre- and post-course surveys were compared to examine how their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teachers may have changed. After the post-course survey, interviews to randomly selected students taught by different BE teachers were conducted to further examine their perceptions. The results showed that both BE teachers and students had positive images <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teachers. Moreover, not many variables were found in both groups <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teachers and their students. However, one variable for each group stood out: experienced and inexperienced teachers, and students enrolled in different language skills courses.

40|$|Heidegger {{argued that}} modern {{human beings have}} {{forgotten}} a more fundamental and originary understanding of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> This forgetting <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> {{is not limited to}} lived experience but permeates the history of philosophy and metaphysics. Put simply, modern philosophy (and, for Heidegger, metaphysics) presupposes a reductive understanding <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> as an entity, or an entity with enduring presence, that ultimately limits the possibilities of human thinking and existence. Educational practice and scholarship also operates from this comportment of a forgetting <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> The following inquiry raises the question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in teaching by phenomenologically engaging with three key distinctions from Heidegger’s thinking as each bears upon educational practice. World and attunement, the first two distinctions, are most accessible in Heidegger’s thinking from his magnum opus Being and Time. The third distinction represents a theme from Heidegger’s later thinking on technology, the danger of Enframing. While not exhaustive, each concept interrogates the many-sided question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in order to illuminate new possibilities for teaching. The inquiry does not offer solutions but rather traces a path that opens and keeps in tension the question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in teaching in order to support further study...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{relation}} between the question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> {{and the question of}} art in the thought of Martin Heidegger. His thought trajectory comprises two different forms <b>of</b> question considering <b>Being.</b> He calls the first one the main question. This form he considers to be metaphysical since it can be traced in traditional philosophical thought back to Plato and Nietzsche, or the thought of the first beginning. The second form is the fundamental question about Being which leads to overcoming of metaphysical understanding <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> and belongs to the thought of the second beginning. This second form, according to his words at the seminar at Le Thor appears in three forms along his thought trajectory; firstly, as a fundamental ontological question of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>Being,</b> then, as significant historical question concerning the truth <b>of</b> <b>Being,</b> and finally, as a topological question concerning the space and spatiality <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> His position concerning art needs to be considered in the light of fundamental issue <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in his thought...|$|R
