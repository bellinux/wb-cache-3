5|$|Durkheim saw the {{population}} density and growth as key {{factors in the}} evolution of the societies and advent of modernity. As the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour. In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.|$|E

25|$|This naming {{convention}} led to much {{confusion in the}} early 20th century, as scholars debated whether Teotihuacan or Tula-Hidalgo was the Tollan described by 16th-century chronicles.

In the Mesoamerican concept of urbanism, Tollan and other language equivalents serve as a metaphor, linking the bundles of reeds and rushes that formed part of the lacustrine environment of the Valley of Mexico and the large gathering <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> city.|$|E

It captures the subtleties and the horror of sin, as well as the gentle power of love and forgiveness, without making or insinuating blanket condemnations against one group. This film expressed the exact opposite, that learning from the example of Christ, there should never be any more violence against any other human being.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The recent {{advancement}} of social media has given users a platform to socially engage {{and interact with}} a global population. With millions of images being uploaded onto social media platforms, there is <b>an</b> increasing interest <b>in</b> inferring the emotion and mood display <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> images. Automatic affect analysis research {{has come a long}} way but has traditionally focussed on <b>a</b> single subject <b>in</b> <b>a</b> scene. <b>In</b> this paper, we study the problem of inferring the emotion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> image. This group affect has wide applications in retrieval, advertisement, content recommendation and security. The contributions of the paper are: 1) a novel emotion labelled database <b>of</b> groups <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> images; 2) <b>a</b> Multiple Kernel Learning based hybrid affect inference model; 3) a scene context based affect inference model; 4) a user survey to better understand the attributes that affect the perception of affect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> image. The detailed experimentation validation provides a rich baseline for the proposed database. I...|$|R

25|$|Afghans are {{regarded}} with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their tribe loyalty {{and for their}} readiness {{to use force to}} settle disputes. As tribal warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreigners to conquer them. One writer considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle. There are various Afghan tribes, and an estimated 2–3 million nomads.|$|E
25|$|The HPI (Human Poverty Index) {{is used to}} {{calculate}} the percentage <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> country who live in relative poverty. In order to better differentiate {{the number of people in}} abnormally poor living conditions the HPI-1 is used in developing countries, and the HPI-2 is used in developed countries. The HPI-1 is calculated based on the percentage of people not expected to survive to 40, the adult illiteracy rate, the percentage of people without access to safe water, health services and the percentage of children under 5 who are underweight. The HPI-2 is calculated based on the percentage of people who do not survive to 60, the adult functional illiteracy rate and the percentage of people living below 50% of median personal disposable income.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{after being}} accused of assaulting his former wife Petra Mollath, Gustl Mollath was tried at the District Court of Nürnberg-Fürth for aggravated assault and {{wrongful}} deprivation of personal liberty of his ex-wife as well as damage to property. The court considered the charges proven but acquitted Mollath {{on the basis of}} finding him criminally insane. A pivotal argument for Mollath's insanity, besides the general impression he made, was that he insisted his wife was involved in a complex system of tax evasion; the court came to call it a paranoid belief system Mollath had developed, which led him to accuse many people of being part of a conspiracy and act irrationally and aggressively, namely puncturing car tires <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that could lead to accidents.|$|E

25|$|A related {{criticism}} of the Nielsen ratings system is its lack of a system for measuring television audiences in environments outside the home, such as college dormitories, transport terminals, bars, jails and other public places where television is frequently viewed, often by large numbers <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> common setting. In 2005, Nielsen announced plans to incorporate viewing by away-from-home college students into its sample. Internet television viewing is another rapidly growing market for which Nielsen ratings fail to account for viewers. iTunes, Hulu, YouTube, {{and some of the}} networks' own websites (such as ABC.com and CBS.com) provide full-length web-based programming, either subscription-based or ad-supported. Though web sites can already track popularity of a site and the referring page, they cannot track viewer demographics. To both track this and expand their market research offerings, Nielsen purchased NetRatings in 2007. However, as noted in a February 2012 New York Times article, the computer and mobile streams of a program are counted separately from the standard television broadcasts, further degrading the overall quality of the sampling data. As a result, there was no way for NBC to tell if there was any overlap between the roughly 111.3 million traditional television viewers and 2.1 million live stream viewers of Super Bowl XLVII.|$|E
