40|$|On-board 4 D {{guidance}} systems, which predict {{and control}} the touchdown time of an aircraft to an accuracy of a few seconds throughout the descent, were developed and demonstrated in several flight test programs. However, in addition to refinements of the <b>on</b> <b>board</b> <b>system,</b> two important issues {{still need to be}} considered. First, in order to make effective use of these on-board systems, it is necessary to understand and develop the interactions of the airborne and air traffic control (ATC) system in the proposed advanced environment. Unless the total system is understood, the advanced on-board system may prove unusable from an ATC standpoint. Second, in planning for a future system in which all aircraft are 4 D equipped, it is necessary to confront the transition situation in which some percentage of traffic must still be handled by conventional means. In terms of 4 D, this means that some traffic must still be given radar vectors and speed clearances (that is, be spaced by conventional distance separation techniques), while the 4 D-equipped aircraft need to be issued time assignments. These apparent differences are reconciled and efficient ATC operation is developed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} five in total candidate PEMS-PM systems at diesel exhaust PM levels spanning from 20 mg/kWh (Euro V) to post DPF. The different emission levels were simulated {{by means of a}} DPF/bypass configuration. The PEMS-PM systems evaluated included Horiba’s <b>On</b> <b>Board</b> <b>System</b> with Transient PM measurement (OBS-TRPM), AVL’s Micro Soot Sensor (MSS) and Gravimetric Filter Box (GFB), Control Sistem’s micro Particulate Sampling System (m-PSS), Sensors Portable Particulate Measurement Device (PPMD) and Dekati’s Mass Monitor (DMM). The work focused on the effect of sampling time on the performance of the PEMS-PM instrumentation. To this end, repeated WHTC tests were performed with PM samples taken over a single WHTC but also over three consecutive test cycles. Teflon filters exhibited superior performance from TX 40 and Quartz filters, showing little dependence on the sampling time {{and at the same time}} resulting in better agreement between the reference instrumentation and the candidate PEMS-PM systems. The study also {{evaluated the}} performance of the real time sensors following some revisions and modifications considered by the manufacturers in response to the findings of the previous (phase 2) campaign. The experimental results verified the improved performance of the revised instrumentation but also revealed some areas for further improvements. JRC. DDG. F. 9 -Sustainable Transport (Ispra...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} related with a {{research}} on vertical motion alleviation of fast ferries. A scaled down {{replica of a}} fast ferry was built, for experimental studies in a towing tank facility. Some submerged moving actuators {{were added to the}} replica: a pair of transom flaps, lateral fins and a T-foil near the bow. Two series of experiments with waves generated in a large basin must be done. One of the series is devoted to modelling, and the second for model-based control studies. Due to the fast motions of the experimental ship, {{it is not possible to}} attach it to a computerized carriage with instrumentation (it is part of the towing tank facility). Instead, the experimental ship must be autonomous, with all monitoring and control systems on board. Since there are six motions of the ship to be considered, the number of on-board sensors and actuators, and the complexity of control, take us to decide the design of a distributed electronic system.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{system based on}} {{piezoelectric}} sensors and on transmitter/receiver antennas, capable to monitor the vibration state of a structure and to communicate such information in remote transmission, is presented. The device is studied with the aim to build a system to monitor the integrity of a structure at distance. This is desirable in such cases where {{it is not possible}} or convenient to have a continuous direct access to the structure, as i. e. for a transportation system or a space platform. The information of the integrity of the structure can be monitored, in such way, from a remote ground station. The bi-directional transmission allows extending the capabilities of the piezoelectric sensors as exciters in order to sense but also to produce ultrasonic waves, widely employed in the field of the non-destructive testing to detect structural damages. The <b>on</b> <b>board</b> <b>system</b> of the device is composed of a PZT piezo patch as sensor, of a filtering circuit to avoid the aliasing phenomena and to isolate the required frequencies, of a microcontroller and a transmission system.

40|$|Máster Universitario en Sistemas Inteligentes y Aplicaciones Numéricas en Ingeniería (SIANI) [EN] This master thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} the A-TIRMA, an au- tonomous sailboat based on an One Meter Class RC vessel. The A-Tirma navigates autonomously with no human intervention except for establishing the route it will follow. One of the distinctive features of sailing robots is that they constitute really interesting operative platforms for monitoring and data sampling in aquatic environments, mainly due to its low power consumption requirements which allows them great operative autonomy. In addition, in the case of A-TIRMA, it is also easily deployable due to its small size and weight. The control system of A-TIRMA consists of two main parts: a base sta- tion and the sailboat. From the base station (a notebook) we can command straightly the sailboat’s sails and rudder remotely in RC (Remote Control) mode using a wireless link. In autonomous mode, we can make the boat to follow autonomously a route, which is a list of waypoints specified on a Google Maps interface. The boat is endowed with an embedded <b>on</b> <b>board</b> <b>system,</b> which, in autonomous mode, bases its operation in an autonomous fuzzy-logic based navigation algorithm for controlling the boat’s sails and rudder, in order to navigate autonomously following the route of waypoints specified from the base station.

40|$|In {{a tightly}} coupled {{environment}} reusing slots {{in the traditional}} sense is not a lucrative option because each erasure node will introduce a few bits delay. For an <b>on</b> <b>board</b> <b>system,</b> where each slot is only a few bits long, such delay is intolerable. We have developed a method for reusing part of the bandwidth available from spatial/spectral bandwidth extension without introducing any buffering delay. Further, we have provided a polynomial time algorithm to optimally reconfigure the bus under the design constraints for any given traffic pattern. We have found that the reconfigured bus substantially outperforms the traditional slotted bus in most practical scenarios. ^ In a dual-bus local area network the need for erasure nodes introduces a few bits of delay for each added erasure node, thus it is not profitable to make all nodes erasure nodes. This fact gives rise to the problem of placing a minimum number of erasure nodes on the network so that the throughput gain is maximum. This thesis gives the first polynomial time algorithm to solve the problem for all traffic conditions. ^ The second part of the thesis considers partitioning and mapping task graphs for distributed shared memory systems (which includes bus based systems). The problem in its general form is known to be NP-complete and it is important to come up with simple but effective and fast heuristics. We have considered the tree task graphs which arise from many important programming techniques such as divide-and-conquer, branch-and-bound, etc. Further, we have proposed a polynomial time algorithm for data allocation in cacheless bus-based multiprocessor systems. ...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{automated}} {{software testing}} has been implemented successfully in many systems, however there does still exist relatively unexplored areas as how automated testing {{can be implemented}} in a real-time embedded system. This problem has been {{the foundation for the}} work in this master thesis, to investigate the possibility to implement an automated software testing process for the testing of an embedded real-time system at IVU Traffic Technologies AG in Aachen, Germany. The system that has been the test object is the <b>on</b> <b>board</b> <b>system</b> i. box. This report contains the result of a literature study in order to present the foundation behind the {{solution to the problem of}} the thesis. Questions answered in the study are: when to automate, how to automate and which traps should one avoid when implementing an automated software testing process in an embedded system. The process of automating the manual process has contained steps as constructing test cases for automated testing, analysing whether an existing tool should be used or a unique test system needs to be developed. The analysis, based on the requirements on the test system, the literature study and an investigation of available test tools, lead to the development of a new test tool. Due to limited devlopement time and characterstics of the i. box, the new tool was built based on post execution evaluation. The tool was therefore divided into two parts, a part that executed the test and a part that evaluated the result. By implementing an automated test tool it has been proved that it is possible to automate the test process at system test level in the i. box...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} five in total candidate PEMS-PM systems at diesel exhaust PM levels spanning from 20 mg/kWh (Euro V) to post CRT. The different emission levels were simulated {{by means of a}} CRT/bypass configuration. The PEMS-PM systems evaluated included Horiba's <b>On</b> <b>Board</b> <b>System</b> with Transient PM measurement (OBS-TRPM), AVL's Micro Soot Sensor (MSS) and Gravimetric Filter Box (GFB), Control Sistem's micro Particulate Sampling System (m-PSS), Sensors Portable Particulate Measurement Device (PPMD) and Dekati's Mass Monitor (DMM). The correlation between the PM results determined with the PEMS instrumentation and that measured with the laboratory sampling systems was found to depend on the filter media employed. This was attributed to adsorption artefacts that become more important as the PM levels decrease. Teflo filters were found to be less susceptible to gas adsorption artefacts, but were difficult to handle yielding some times even negative masses. Even with Teflo filters, however, more than 99 % of the PM at CRT out levels was OC which could not be detected by the real time aerosol instrumentation and therefore is expected to be adsorbed material. Furthermore, background PM levels at all candidate systems utilizing laboratory conditioned dilution air averaged at a level equivalent to 3 mg/kWh which is almost 1 / 3 of the Euro VI level. The background was even higher (equivalent to ~ 5 mg/kWh) for the PEMS system that employed ambient air (internally conditioned) for the dilution. The study also {{evaluated the}} performance of the real time sensors employed in the different candidate systems using both engine exhaust aerosol and Poly(Alpha) -Olephin spherical particles. The results of these experiments revealed a number of issues related to the calibration of the instruments and cross sensitivities to non PM sources. These findings need to be addressed by the manufacturers as they are expected to significantly affect the accuracy of the measurements in PEMS applications. JRC. DDG.
