5|$|Over France, {{the losses}} became quite severe, {{particularly}} over {{the port of}} Brest, France. German defences were strong, owing to Operation Cerberus and Operation Donnerkeil, a joint Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe plan to enable the escape of Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen through the English Channel. Five Spitfires and a Mosquito were lost on PR operations in December 1941. The failure to photograph and pin-point the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships,</b> led to their successful move to Germany in February 1942. It {{was not until the}} day of the German operation that a Coastal Command aircraft caught sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships,</b> and by then it was too late.|$|E
5|$|The Alma-class ironclads were a {{group of}} seven wooden-hulled, armored corvettes built for the French Navy {{in the mid to}} late 1860s. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> {{attempted}} to blockade Prussian ports in the Baltic Sea in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War. Three others patrolled the North Sea and the Atlantic, while the last ship was en route to Japan when the war began and blockaded two small Prussian ships in a Japanese harbor. Afterwards they alternated periods of reserve and active commissions, many of them abroad. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> participated in the French occupation of Tunisia in 1881 while another helped to intimidate the Vietnamese Government into accepting status as a French protectorate and played a small role in the Sino-French War of 1884–85.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the two carriers involves more than 10,000 people from 90 companies, 7,000 {{of them in the}} six shipyards building the sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The green {{external}} livery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> is {{according to}} Tallink promotion material [...] "meant {{to reflect the}} environmentally friendly aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> design".|$|R
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> wooden hull was lost, but <b>the</b> layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> {{could be}} seen from <b>the</b> {{placement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anchors, guns and fasteners.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> forming <b>of</b> contract, it {{will enter}} to the {{inspection}} stage. There {{are two major}} parts in the inspections stage which include the documents inspection and <b>the</b> physical inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> afloat. For <b>the</b> documents inspection, the buyer will check <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> class records and certificate records. <b>The</b> inspection <b>of</b> records will reveal <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> maintenance and compliance with <b>the</b> requirement <b>of</b> class. Furthermore, <b>the</b> buyer also should check the mortgages records and the maritime lien records to prevent any damages or loss subject to <b>the</b> legal issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> which occurred before <b>the</b> delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> For <b>the</b> physical inspection, checks are usually made to <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> and its logbook, unless otherwise agreed.|$|R
5|$|The sagas {{describe}} three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> in Olaf Tryggvason's fleet. According to Heimskringla, the Crane {{was a large}} swift-sailing warship with thirty rowers' benches, high in {{stem and}} stern. It was commissioned by King Olaf and used as his flagship for some time.|$|E
5|$|The scuttling of the German fleet {{took place}} at the Royal Navy's base at Scapa Flow, in Scotland, after the First World War. The High Seas Fleet was interned there {{under the terms of the}} Armistice whilst {{negotiations}} took place over the fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships.</b> Fearing that all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> would be seized and divided amongst the allied powers, the German commander, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, decided to scuttle the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> {{were blown}} {{back to the}} west and wrecked on the Padre Island sandbars. Only San Andrés escaped.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Pennsylvania navy's <b>ship</b> colors {{included}} (1) an ensign; (2) a long, narrow pennant; and (3) a short, narrow pennant. The ensign was a blue flag with 13 stripes--seven red {{stripes and}} six white stripes in the flag's canton (upper-left-hand corner). It was flown from a pole at <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> <b>The</b> long pennant had 13 vertical stripes near the mast {{and the rest}} was solid red. It flew from <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> mainmast, <b>the</b> center pole holding the sails. The short pennant was solid red. It flew from <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> mizzenmast--the pole holding <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> sails nearest <b>the</b> stern (rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship).</b>|$|R
50|$|At Queenscliff, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> docks bow {{into the}} terminal. <b>The</b> bow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> {{consists}} <b>of</b> two sections; one section raises whilst the other lowers forming a ramp that allows vehicles to drive off.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> {{were placed}} in reserve or sent to foreign stations, often as the flagship. During the Third Carlist War of 1872–76 Thétis, Reine Blanche and Jeanne d'Arc spent time in Spanish waters where they could protect French {{citizens}} and interests. In 1875, the latter ship rammed and sank the dispatch vessel Forfait. On 3 July 1877 Thétis rammed Reine Blanche who had to be run ashore to prevent her from sinking.|$|E
5|$|All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> saw {{service in}} World War I, {{although}} {{the diversion of}} coal, which was scarce, to the newer Tegetthoff and Radetzky classes limited {{the service of the}} remaining battleships. Following the defeat of Austria-Hungary in World War I, the empire was dismantled and all of the battleships were handed over to France, Great Britain, the United States, and Italy.|$|E
5|$|By World War I, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> {{had been}} {{withdrawn}} to secondary roles, with Elba having {{been converted into}} a seaplane tender. Puglia was {{the only member of the}} class to take an active role, based out of Durazzo. Etruria was deliberately blown up by the Regia Marina as a deception operation against Austria-Hungary. The remaining ships were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s, though the bow section of Puglia was preserved at the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E

25|$|The Orlop Decks and the Tank Top {{below that}} were on <b>the</b> lowest level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> below <b>the</b> waterline. The orlop decks were used as cargo spaces, while the Tank Top—the inner bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> hull—provided <b>the</b> {{platform}} on which <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators were housed. This area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms, areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing. They were connected with higher levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> by flights <b>of</b> stairs; twin spiral stairways near the bow provided access up to D Deck.|$|R
5|$|During the 1790s, American {{merchant}} vessels {{began to}} fall prey to Barbary Pirates in the Mediterranean, most notably from Algiers. Congress's response was the Naval Act of 1794. The Act provided funds {{for the construction of}} six frigates; however, it included a clause stating that construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> would cease if the United States agreed to peace terms with Algiers.|$|E
5|$|During the night, another storm broke (this time {{probably}} a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind), preventing the Allies from setting off southwards {{to counter the}} Persian detachment sent around the outside of Euboea. However, the storm also hit the Persian detachment of ships, driving them off course and onto the rocky coast of 'the Hollows' of Euboea. This part of the Persian fleet was thus also shipwrecked, losing most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1785 Barbary pirates, {{most notably}} from Algiers, began to seize American {{merchant}} {{vessels in the}} Mediterranean. In 1793 alone, eleven American ships were captured and their crews and stores held for ransom. To combat this problem, proposals were made for warships to protect American shipping, resulting in the Naval Act of 1794. The act provided funds to construct six frigates, but included a clause that if peace terms were agreed to with Algiers, the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> would be halted.|$|E

50|$|In an uncharted star system, a {{group of}} prisoners {{en route to a}} {{celestial}} space mine overpower <b>the</b> <b>ship’s</b> guards and take control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> but during their breakout, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship’s</b> controls are damaged.|$|R
5|$|In Apra Harbor, ten ships or tugs were sunk, as were {{numerous}} smaller vessels. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> that survived {{in the harbor}} was the cutter Basswood of the Coast Guard, which recorded a wind gust of 220km/h (140mph).

5|$|In Nova Scotia, Governor Lawrence had easily {{captured}} Fort Beauséjour, and {{had then}} embarked {{on what has}} since {{become known as the}} Great Expulsion, the forcible removal of more than 12,000 Acadians from Nova Scotia. When some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> carrying the Acadians entered Boston Harbor in early December 1755, Shirley ordered that they not disembark. For three winter months, until March 1756, the Acadians remained on the ships, where half died from the cold weather and malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probable}} {{that in the early}} 1660s Morgan was active with a group of privateers led by Sir Christopher Myngs attacking Spanish cities and settlements in the Caribbean and Central America.

50|$|Seakeeping {{directly}} impacts <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> a vessel. Ship motions {{are considered}} when determining <b>the</b> principal dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> and in developing <b>the</b> general arrangements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> internal spaces. For example, in most vessels the far forward parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> experience <b>the</b> worst <b>ship</b> motions and are commonly unacceptable for berthing passengers or crew. In exceptional cases where ship motions {{pose a threat}} to crew, structure or machinery, or when ship motions interfere with <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> to accomplish its mission, then the design must be modified so that ship motions are reduced.|$|R
