40|$|Tidal energy {{conversion}} devices (TECDs) are in development {{throughout the world}} to help {{reduce the need for}} fossil fuels. These devices will generally be mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> and remain there over a period of years. Most of <b>the</b> previous research <b>on</b> TECDs has focused on their power extraction capability and efficient design. The handful of studies which have focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> effects of <b>the</b> devices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marine environment have not considered small-scale three-dimensional phenomena occurring in the flow near the rotor. These phenomena are likely to disturb the marine environment by altering the dynamics of sediment. The accurate prediction of the rapidly changing flow down-stream of a TECD and its influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> poses a challenge. The nature of the interactions between such a flow and sediment has not been experimentally established. Predictions of these interactions, as is necessary for an assessment of the effects of <b>the</b> devices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed,</b> need to account for the depth-dependence of the flow velocity and its changes during the tidal cycle. The difference between the typical time-scales of the development of the rotor wake and the tidal cycle represents a difficulty for the computational modelling of the interactions between the device and the tidal flow. This dissertation presents an inviscid analysis of the flow down-stream of horizontal- axis, vertical-axis and cross-flow TECDs by means of computer modelling. The Vortic- ity Transport Model, modified to simulate the flow down-stream of a TECD mounted onto <b>the</b> <b>seabed,</b> predicts <b>the</b> shear stress inflicted by <b>the</b> flow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed.</b> <b>The</b> shear stresses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed,</b> generated by small-scale vortical structures in the wake down-stream of the devices, cause sediment to uplift. This process along with the sub- sequent motion of the sediment is simulated by a sediment model implemented into the Vorticity Transport Model. The critical bed shear stress is known as a threshold for initiation of sediment motion, therefore the relative difference between <b>the</b> stress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> and <b>the</b> critical bed shear stress, called the excess bed shear stress, is chosen here as an indicator of the impact of <b>the</b> TECDs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed.</b> <b>The</b> evolution of <b>the</b> instantaneous stresses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> is predicted to vary with the configuration of TECD. The results suggest that the average excess bed shear stress inflicted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> by <b>the</b> horizontal-axis device increases with the inflow velocity during the flood part of the representative tidal cycle and that the increase can be expressed by a simple algebraic expression. It is also predicted that the impact of this device <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> does not monotonically decrease with increasing separation between the rotor and <b>the</b> <b>seabed.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> relationship between the excess bed shear stress and the position of the rotor is established. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that the wake down-stream of the horizontal-axis device is lifted by the flow away from <b>the</b> <b>seabed,</b> which result in a confinement of its impact to the vicinity of the rotor. In contrast with the horizontal-axis configuration, it is concluded that the vertical-axis and cross-flow configurations of the rotor would promote the erosion of <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> further away from the device, at a location where the wake approaches <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> again and that this location depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inflow velocity. The predicted effects of these devices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marine environment need to be con- sidered in advance of their installation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|An ambush predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals itself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> {{floor and}} waits for approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey are targeted visually and, with a quick upward thrust of the head, snatched in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal ambush sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females give birth to an average of six young every spring.|$|E
