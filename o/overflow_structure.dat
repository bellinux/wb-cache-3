40|$|The {{quality of}} a {{drinking}} water source depends largely on upstream contaminant discharges. Sewer overflows can have a large influence on downstream drinking water intakes as they discharge untreated or partially treated wastewaters that may be contaminated with pathogens. This study focuses on the quantification of Escherichia coli discharges from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and the dispersion and diffusion in receiving waters in order to prioritize actions for source water protection. E. coli concentrations from CSOs were estimated from monitoring data at a series of <b>overflow</b> <b>structures</b> and then applied to the 42 active <b>overflow</b> <b>structures</b> between 2009 and 2012 using a simple relationship based upon the population within the drainage network. From these estimates, a transport-dispersion model was calibrated with data from a monitoring program from both <b>overflow</b> <b>structures</b> and downstream drinking water intakes. The model was validated with 15 extreme events such as {{a large number of}} overflows (n > 8) or high concentrations at drinking water intakes. Model results demonstrated the importance of the cumulative effects of CSOs on the degradation of water quality downstream. However, permits are typically issued on a discharge point basis and do not consider cumulative effects. Source water protection plans must consider the cumulative effects of discharges and their concentrations because the simultaneous discharge of multiple overflows can lead to elevated E. coli concentrations at a drinking water intake. In addition, some CSOs have a disproportionate impact on peak concentrations at drinking water intakes. As such, it is recommended that the management of CSOs move away from frequency based permitting at the discharge point to focus on the development of comprehensive strategies to reduce cumulative and peak discharges from CSOs upstream of drinking water intakes.

40|$|Abstract: Starting from 1980, all {{highways}} in ecologically {{sensitive areas}} in Croatia, have specially designed drainage systems. That includes system of closed or open conduits for runoff collection with oil-grit separators {{before the final}} disposal. In more sensitive areas, different BMPs are added after oil-grit separators, to improve overall treatment efficiency. <b>Overflow</b> <b>structures</b> are allowed on big watersheds to avoid large pipe diameters. While <b>overflow</b> <b>structures</b> in urban sewage systems are designed upon German ATV – Rules and Standards, water authorities in Croatia, for {{the same type of}} structure proscribe more stringent criteria, namely critical rain intensity from 15 - 25 l/s/ha depending on ecological sensitivity of the recipient. At the same time, the mentioned criteria are not correlated to local climatic conditions i. e. duration of dray and wet weather, and mean annual rainfall. The question is how much that stricter criteria, which have impact on final cost of highway drainage, contribute to overall drainage efficiency. On the example of two Croatian cities with considerably different climatic characteristics, the runoff volumes and masses of pollution for different overflow criteria are modeled on the same hypothetic section of highway. Using input data from the case studies on pollution buildup and washoff undertaken in USA, results of simulation with USEPA SWMM- 5, are analyzed and compared with overall highway drainage efficiency. As a final conclusion some recommen-dations regarding design criteria are given...|$|R
40|$|A {{concept for}} {{integrated}} modeling of {{urban and rural}} hydrology is introduced. The concept allows for simulations on the catchment scale {{as well as on}} the local scale. It is based on a 2 -layer-approach which facilitates the parallel coupling of a catchment hydrology model with an urban hydrology model, considering the interactions between the two systems. The concept has been implemented in a computer model combining a grid based distributed hydrological catchment model and a hydrological urban stormwater model based on elementary units. The combined model provides a flexible solution for time and spatial scale integration and offers to calculate separate water balances for urban and rural hydrology. Furthermore, it is GIS-based which allows for easy and accurate geo-referencing of urban <b>overflow</b> <b>structures,</b> which are considered as points of interactions between the two hydrologic systems. Due to the two-layer-approach, programs of measures can be incorporated in each system separately. The capabilities of the combined model have been tested on a hypothetical test case and a real world application. It could be shown that the model is capable of accurately quantifying the effects of urbanization in a catchment. The affects of urbanization can be analyzed at the catchment outlet, but can also be traced back to its origins, due to the geo-referencing of urban <b>overflow</b> <b>structures.</b> This is a mayor advantage over conventional hydrological catchment models for the analysis of land use changes...|$|R

40|$|In urban {{drainage}} systems, it {{is usually}} necessary to split the stormwater discharge among different sewer branches because of limited flow capacity of either hydraulic structures or sewer lines. For this purpose sewer sideweirs and leaping weirs are generally used as diversion <b>overflow</b> <b>structures.</b> For supercritical approach flow the former is not recommended because of the occurrence of hydraulic jumps, while the latter requires an outlet located below the approach flow sewer bottom.

A 6. 67 : 1 scale model was tested over a range of hydraulic and geometrical parameters to determine its head-discharge relationship, developing a dimensionless equation relating the diversion discharge to the geometrical properties of the intake under supercritical flow conditions.

Our aim {{was to determine the}} impacts of sewage overflows and potential risks to the public and ecosystem health in the tidal waterways of the coastal suburb of Lota. Expectations for improved sewerage system performance are driven by the belief that sewage overflows cause significant environmental harm. However, the research presented here shows that during a large wet weather event, stormwater, and not the overflow, was the dominant stressor of ecological health. Even during dry weather the impacts of overflow events were likely to be low and restricted to the mixing zone at the point of overflow. However, sewage overflows, in dry and wet weather, did pose an unacceptably high public health hazard to potential swimmers in Lota Creek until the overflow stopped and there was a complete tidal exchange with the estuary. This Brisbane City Council/Brisbane Water and Coastal CRC project has provided a sound scientific basis for quantifying overflow impacts and prioritising management of overflows and stormwater.
