40|$|Abstract Background The {{down-regulation}} of {{the cough}} reflex {{in patients with}} <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> can involve both cortical facilitatory pathways for cough and medullary reflex pathways. In order to study the possible involvement of the supramedullary system in the down-regulation of cough reflex, we evaluated the urge-to-cough in patients with <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> Methods Cough reflex sensitivity and the urge-to-cough to inhaled citric acid were evaluated in patients {{with at least a}} history of <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> and age-matched healthy elderly people. The cough reflex sensitivities were defined as the lowest concentration of citric acid that elicited two or more coughs (C 2) and five or more coughs (C 5). The urge-to-cough scores at the concentration of C 2 and C 5, and at the concentration of two times dilution of C 2 (C 2 / 2) and C 5 (C 5 / 2) were estimated for each subject. Results Both C 2 and C 5 in the control subjects were significantly greater than those for patients with <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} the urge-to-cough at C 2 and C 5 between control subjects and patients with <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> However, the urge-to-cough scores at both C 2 / 2 and C 5 / 2 in patients with <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> were significantly lower than those in control subjects. The number of coughs at C 5 / 2 was significantly greater in the control subjects than those in the patients with <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> whereas the number of coughs at C 2 / 2 did not show a significant difference between the control subjects and the patients with <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> Conclusion The study suggests the involvement of supramedullary dysfunction in the etiology of <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in the elderly. Therefore, restoration of the cough motivation system could be a new strategy to prevent <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in the elderly. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the incidence and long-term results of a rarely discussed medical problem – <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> resulting from the intentional ingestion of acid. Materials and methods: The medical records of 370 patients treated at one tertiary care institution for corrosive acid injury during a 12 -year period were reviewed retrospectively. The study subjects included any patients who were found to have acid ingestion related <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> confirmed by chest film within 24 h of injury. All available data of these patients with or without <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> were analyzed. Results: Of the 370 patients with corrosive acid injury, 15 (4. 2 %) had acid-aspiration pneumonia which was related to their intentional ingestion of a strong acid, hydrochloric acid (pH, 1). The data for 14 patients with <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> and 268 without <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> was complete and available for analysis. Patients with <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> were found to be significantly older (52 : 2 ^ 6 : 2 to 41 : 7 ^ 0 : 9 years old, P 0 : 017), had a higher incidence of nasogastric tube irrigation (35. 7 – 6. 0 %, P 0 : 000), had more conscious disturbance (50. 0 – 17. 5 %, P 0 : 016), and required more endotrachal tube intubation (50. 0 – 3. 0 %, P 0 : 000). <b>Aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> was found to significantly increase the mortality rate in acid injured patients who required emergency abdominal surgery (87. 5 – 32. 0 %, P 0 : 000) and in those who did not (28. 5 – 5. 1 %, P 0 : 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} literature on oral health care interventions in frail older people and {{the effect on the}} incidence of <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> BACKGROUND: Oral health care seems {{to play an important role}} in the prevention of <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in frail older people. METHODS: Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched for eligible intervention studies. Only publications with regard to hospitalized or institutionalized older people, who were not dependent on mechanical ventilation were eligible. Two authors independently assessed the publications for their methodological quality. RESULTS: Five publications were included and reviewed. Two studies showed that improvement of oral health care diminished the risk of developing <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> and the risk of dying from <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> directly. The three studies remaining showed that adequate oral health care decreased the amount of potential respiratory pathogens and suggested a reduction in the risk of <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> by improving the swallowing reflex and cough reflex sensitivity.

Effectiveness of tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC) in <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> is not clear. PURPOSE: To compare clinical efficacy between TAZ/PIPC (1 : 4 compound) and imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) in patients with moderate-to-severe <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, randomized study either TAZ/PIPC 5 g or IPM/CS 1 g was intravenously administered every 12 h to patients with moderate-to-severe community-acquired <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> or nursing home-acquired pneumonia with risk for <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> for average 11 days. The primary outcome was clinical response rate {{at the end of}} treatment (EOT) in validated per-protocol (VPP) population. Secondary outcomes were clinical response during treatment (days 4 and 7) {{and at the end of}} study (EOS) in VPP population, and survival at day 30 in modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population. RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups in primary or secondary outcome. However, significantly faster improvement as measured by axillary temperature (p < 0. 05) and WBC count (p = 0. 01) was observed under TAZ/PIPC treatment. In patients with gram-positive bacterial infection, TAZ/PIPC was more effective at EOT in VPP population (p = 0. 03).

MethodsThe study included 40 long-term hospitalized elderly patients with dysphagia who needed oral intake. According to the voluntary and matching principle, participants were divided into the intervention group (n =  20) and control group (n =  20). We formed a multi-disciplinary team including clinical nurses, rehabilitation therapists and nutritionists. Clinical nurses collaborated with nutritionists and rehabilitation therapists to carry out feeding management. The patients {{in the control group}} were fed with semi-solid food, thick liquid, a partial mushy diet and so on according to their swallowing situations and tastes or preferences. The patients in the intervention group were fed with an all mushy diet. Patients in both groups were able to eat foods on their own or with assistance. ResultsAfter a three-month intervention, the incidence of <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in both groups was decreased, and the difference was statistically significant (P <  0. 05). In the control group, seven patients had <b>aspiration</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> including two cases who died after nasogastric feeding due to aggravated dysphagia.
