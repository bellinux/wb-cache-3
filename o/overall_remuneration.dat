5000|$|Carne was {{appointed}} {{chief executive of}} Network Rail in September 2013, and joined the company in January 2014; he formally succeeded Sir David Higgins—who moved to High Speed 2 as executive chairman—in April 2014, but took control earlier than planned to oversee the repairs {{in the aftermath of}} severe winter storms. Carne's salary on appointment was £675,000—an increase on Higgins', though the <b>overall</b> <b>remuneration</b> package is smaller—which prompted criticism from unions, including the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (one of the main unions for Network Rail staff), ASLEF (the train drivers' union) and the RMT. Network Rail stated that the salary [...] "was determined following an exhaustive and independent process which compared the salaries of chief executives in both {{the public and private sectors}} given Network Rail's unique position as a not-for-dividend, independent company". In an interview, Carne stated that among his first priorities was the reduction of zero-hours contracts (a politically controversial topic at the time of the interview) among Network Rail's contractors. In the same interview, he stated that his immediate focus would be on [...] "safety, reliability, capacity, and cost", while also attempting to reduce spending.|$|E
30|$|An unexplained {{public-private}} pay gap in {{a country}} raises questions about productive efficiency, {{the extent to which}} unwarranted public sector settlements might spill over into the private sector and affect competitiveness, and about public finances. It also raises questions about equity as most analysts would consider that, taking all factors into account, <b>overall</b> <b>remuneration</b> (including retirement and other working provisions) should be similar in the two sectors. Thus, a constant pay gap across income levels would raise questions along the lines just noted.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} Bachelor {{thesis is}} to analyze the {{existing}} knowledge of remuneration system of employee benefits and remuneration management, with focus {{on the importance of}} non-monetary benefits in the scope of <b>overall</b> <b>remuneration.</b> The aim of practical part is to analyze system of employees benefits at two selected companies, to find out how the system is set up, if the system is effective (if there is demonstrable effect on competitiveness in the line of business, loyalty and satisfaction of employees), and how it is or was created. Moreover my aim is, on the basis of finding inadequacies, to propose possible solution for stated area. First part of thesis is drawn up as a summary of current theoretical findings in the area of remuneration (with accent on non-monetary remuneration); second part is focused on practical usage in concrete company environment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a contribution to}} the literature on executive share options by reporting the results of detailed case research conducted by the author in relation to two publicly listed Australian companies from the health / biotechnology sector. These sectors are chosen as the focus for the case studies reported in this article because of the relatively high degree of reliance placed by corporations within this sector of the economy on options as part of <b>overall</b> employee <b>remuneration.</b> The case studies demonstrate the material impact the inclusion of the cost of options would represent in relation to reported earnings were this to become a mandatory financial reporting requirement. The case studies also highlight the poor quality of disclosures being made in relation to options. It is concluded that significant reforms of reporting and disclosure policies would be beneficial. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{findings}} of a study conducted by the University of Surrey for DIME, a project funded by the European Social fund (ESF). The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the owners' or managers' perceptions of Small and Medium Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises (SMTHEs) in UK regarding the impact of multimedia in the following aspects of employment: employment levels; nature and content of work as well as amount of workload; work satisfaction; skill requirements; and work status and <b>remuneration.</b> <b>Overall</b> 233 responses were received, broken down as follows: tourist information centres (n= 151), 3 * hotels (n= 40), and B&B's (n= 42). Research findings revealed that multimedia technologies are increasingly being adopted and used by tourism and hospitality businesses. The adoption is "system-wide" affecting the operations and competitiveness of all players. However, it appears that multimedia use has caused limited changes in the structure of organizations as well as in the employment levels and activitie...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} motives, behavior, and {{characteristics}} shaping mutual fund managers’ willingness to incorporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues into investment decision making. Using survey evidence from fund managers from five different countries, we demonstrate that this predisposition is the stronger, the shorter their average forecasting horizon {{and the higher}} their level of reliance on business risk in portfolio management is. We also find that the propensity to incorporate ESG factors is positively related to an increasing level of risk aversion, an increasing importance of salary change and senior management approval/disapproval as motivating factors as well as length of professional experience in current fund and increasing significance of assessment by superiors in <b>remuneration.</b> <b>Overall,</b> our evidence suggests that ESG diligence among fund managers serves mainly as a method for mitigating risk and is typically motivated by herding; it is much less important {{as a tool for}} additional value creation. The prevalent use of ESG criteria in mitigating risk is in contrast with traditional approach, but it is in line with behavioral finance theory. Additionally, our results also show a strong difference in the length of the forecasting horizon between continental European and Anglo-Saxon fund managers...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{controversy}} which has surrounded options awarded to executives {{as a component of}} their <b>overall</b> <b>remuneration.</b> We argue that many of the claims advanced in favour of the use of options schemes by employer corporations are fl awed. In particular, we suggest that the alleged incentive alignment effects of granting options to executives either do not manifest themselves as strongly in practice as might be expected in theory, or are undermined by other factors, which we set out in this article. Further, we are critical of the view that the current status quo financial reporting treatment of options granted to employees in lieu of cash or other forms of remuneration is appropriate or able to be justified as a matter of principle. We discuss our preferred alternative treatments and advance a case as to why we believe that they would represent a more appropriate means of accounting for options than current prevailing practice. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} Labour {{costs and}} perks {{in an organization}} occupies with analysis of wages and labour costs, which nowadays forms an inseparable part of policy in each organization. The dissertation is divided into 2 main parts. The theoretical part is focused mainly on the theory of wages and labour costs. Then it defines employee benefits, their kinds, classification (or structure) and trends, the large part {{is devoted to the}} sytem of providing constituent employee benefits and follow up tax-deductibility of interest on the side of employees and employers. The practical part is concerned with analysis of the present-day system of remuneration and providing benefits in a selected company. The great attention was paid to height of costs, which a selected company must spend on the provided benefits. The overall level of satisfaction/unsatisfaction with provided benefits was investigated by means of questionnaire survey among employees in a selected company. The structure of up to now provided benefits was evaluated on the basis of information collected during the survey and created a dissertation conclusion. At the same time there was a proposal for integration of new kinds of benefits into the <b>overall</b> <b>remuneration</b> system...|$|E
40|$|As {{private sector}} {{employers}} have {{moved away from}} providing final salary defined benefit (DB) pensions to their employees, attention has increasingly focused on the public sector's continued provision of such pensions {{and the value of}} these pension promises to public sector employees. The estimated underlying liabilities of such plans have increased sharply in recent years, at least in part due to unanticipated increases in longevity. This has led to reforms of all the major public sector pension schemes, the net result of which has been to reduce the level of benefits offered by the schemes (predominantly to new, rather than existing members). This paper examines, {{in the context of the}} Teachers' Pension Scheme (TPS), how much the pension promises are worth and what effect the change in scheme rules has had on them. This paper also addresses a number of other issues that are important when valuing DB pension rights and their relation to <b>overall</b> <b>remuneration.</b> First, how increases in current pay feed through into pension values. Second, how the age profile of earnings affects the profile of pension accrual. Finally, how the value of pension rights in DB schemes compares to that in a stylised defined contribution (DC) scheme. The figures presented in this paper relate specifically to the composition of members and the specific scheme rules of the TPS. However, the issues raised apply equally to other DB schemes, both public and private sector. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There is {{significant}} {{concern about the}} worldwide migration of nursing professionals from low-income countries to rich ones, as nurses are lured to fill {{the large number of}} vacancies in upper-income countries. This study explores the views of nursing students in Uganda to assess their views on practice options and their intentions to migrate. Methods Anonymous questionnaires were distributed to nursing students at the Makerere Nursing School and Aga Khan University Nursing School in Kampala, Uganda, during July 2006, using convenience sampling methods, with 139 participants. Two focus groups were also conducted at one university. Results Most (70 %) of the participants would like to work outside Uganda, and said it was likely that within five years they would be working in the U. S. (59 %) or the U. K. (49 %). About a fourth (27 %) said they could be working in another African country. Only eight percent of all students reported an unlikelihood to migrate within five years of training completion. Survey respondents were more dissatisfied with financial remuneration than with any other factor pushing them towards emigration. Those wanting to work in the settings of urban, private, or U. K. /U. S. practices were less likely to express a sense of professional obligation and/or loyalty to country. Those who have lived in rural areas were less likely to report wanting to emigrate. Students with a desire to work in urban areas or private practice {{were more likely to report}} an intent to emigrate for financial reasons or in pursuit of country stability, while students wanting to work in rural areas or public practice were less likely to want to emigrate <b>overall.</b> Conclusion Improving <b>remuneration</b> for nurses is the top priority policy change sought by nursing students in our study.

40|$|Health worker {{salaries}} in Zambia are low by any standard. In recent times {{there have been}} real reductions in the salaries of health workers. This has resulted in significant attrition {{in the public sector}} as health workers are attracted to the private sector or leave Zambia entirely, leaving a large deficit in public sector health workers. In this study we examine the relationship between health worker incomes and their satisfaction and motivation. Cross-sectional data collection was undertaken using both quantitative and qualitative methods. A refined survey instrument was used for the quantitative data method. Document review (past and current records) was employed for the qualitative method. Data was collected in three regions that represent extremes in <b>overall</b> <b>remuneration</b> and benefits. Lusaka represented the favourable area while Monze and Nyimba represented less favourable areas for study in Zambia. There are hefty disparities between different health workers. There are also enormous salary differentials for the same workers between the public and private sectors. These salary differentials explain the experience of public to private “traffic” of health workers as well as casual private sector work by public sector health workers. In addition, there are negligible efforts by government to reduce the benefits gaps among key public health cadres. The low incomes received by public health workers in Zambia have many negative implications: it begets absenteeism, results in low output, poor quality health care, and the departure of health workers to the private sector and overseas. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background Human {{resources}} for health represent {{an essential component}} of health systems and play a key role to accelerate progress towards universal health coverage. Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa face challenges regarding the availability, distribution and performance of health workers, which could be in part addressed by providing effective financial incentives. Methods Based on an overview of the existing literature, the paper highlights the gaps in the existing research in low-income countries exploring the different components of health workers’ incomes. It then proposes a novel approach to the analysis of financial incentives and delineates a research agenda, which could contribute to shed light on this topic. Findings The article finds that, while there is ample research that investigates separately each of the incomes health workers may earn (for example, salary, fee-for-service payments, informal incomes, “top-ups” and per diems, dual practice and non-health activities), there is a dearth of studies which look at the health workers’ “complex remuneration”, that is, the whole of the financial incentives available. Little research exists which analyses simultaneously all revenues of health workers, quantifies the <b>overall</b> <b>remuneration</b> and explores its complexity, its multiple components and their features, as well as the possible interaction between income components. However, such a comprehensive approach is essential to fully comprehend health workers’ incentives, by investigating the causes (at individual and system level) of the fragmentation in the income structure and the variability in income levels, as well as the consequences of the “complex remuneration” on motivation and performance. This proposition has important policy implications in terms of devising effective incentive packages as it calls for an active consideration of the role that “complex remuneration” plays in determining recruitment, retention and motivation patterns, as well as, more broadly, the performance of health systems. Conclusions This paper argues that research focusing on the health workers’ “complex remuneration” is critical to address some of the most challenging issues affecting human {{resources for}} health. An empirical research agenda is proposed to fill the gap in our understanding...|$|E
40|$|Determining which {{countries}} {{are the most}} financially attractive for businesses to build wind projects {{is a matter of}} serious discussion that lacks succinct commentary. To fill this void this paper employs an empirical study of the wind subsidy support systems used by Germany, France, Spain and Sweden. This paper is {{based on the premise that}} businesses prefer to build where they can find the highest <b>overall</b> <b>remuneration</b> for their production; recognizing also the need for stability in those payments and businesses’ strong preference for larger early returns on their investments. The paper also analyzes the results and gives recommendations on possible improvements to each country’s system and where businesses should invest. In order to reach their 20 - 20 - 20 E. U. goals (European Commission, 2010), {{countries are}} encouraging the creation of new green energy projects, and this encouragement is frequently in the form of subsidies. The subsidy types used by the countries reviewed are feed-in tariffs, premiums and a certificate quota system. Each country’s support history is detailed along with the criteria of their respective systems. The countries systems are then compared using actual income and production data for four criteria at three different production levels – 100 percent, 75 percent and 150 percent of actual – and at two different lengths of time, 7 and 20 years. The first criteria of the comparison is total income, the second for variability of payments, the third for timing of payments and the final is the stability of the system itself. The results of this research show that the German and French systems are superior at all levels for their low variability in payment prices and in making larger payments to businesses earlier. They are also generally superior at lower and actual production levels for total income amounts. However, the Spanish options are superior at high levels of production for income and have middling variability levels. The Swedish system generally has the highest levels of variability for the lowest levels of income. Only the Spanish system is considered to be unstable in its political support of subsidies. Based upon the preceding findings are given to each country to improve their relative weaknesses. Also recommendations are given to businesses based upon the quality of the locations wind resources...|$|E
