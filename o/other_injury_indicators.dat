Methods: A case-control study was carried out in 298 patients with motorcycle trauma along with 151 control patients admitted to the Shohada and Imam Reza university hospitals as the two referral specialty centers in the East Azarbyjan Province of Iran in 2013. The Persian version of the Motorcycle Riding Behavior Questionnaire and the Persian version of Conner’s Adult ADHD Rating Scales (the self-report short version) were used to assess riding behavior and screen for adult ADHD, respectively. The scale has four subscales, comprising subscale A (inattention), subscale B (hyperactivity, impulsivity), subscale C (A + C), and subscale D (ADHD index). The statistical analysis was done using Stata version 11. Results: All subjects were male and aged 13 – 79 years. Approximately 54 % of the participants were married and 13 % had academic education. Approximately 18 % of the motorcycle riders stated that their motorcycle riding was only for fun purposes. More than two thirds of the participants did not have a motorcycle riding license. Variables found to be significantly associated with motorcycle injuries in bivariate analysis included age, marital status, educational level, having a motorcycle riding license, using a helmet while riding, daily amount of riding, riding just for fun, riding behavior score, and ADHD scale scores. It was found in multivariate analysis that if the ADHD index (subscale D) score was used to assess the association of ADHD with motorcycle injuries, a protective role for ADHD was observed. However, the two other subscales showed a different predictive pattern for subscale A versus subscale B, with only subscale B increasing the likelihood of motorcycle traffic injuries. The score based on motorcycle rider behavior was found to be associated with motorcycle injuries. Other variables that were significant in multivariate models were the purpose of riding, educational level, economic status, and marital status. Conclusion: ADHD and riding behavior scores affect the likelihood of motorcycle traffic injuries among motorcycle riders independent of <b>other</b> <b>injury</b> <b>indicators,</b> and include education, purpose of riding, and economic status.

40|$|Background/PurposeThe {{primary goal}} {{of this study was}} to test whether high-altitude {{exposure}} (HAE: 0. 9 % O 2 at 0. 47 ATA for 24 hours) was capable of increasing the systemic inflammatory markers as well as the toxic organ <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> in rats, with a secondary goal to test whether preinduction of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 by hypobaric hypoxia preconditioning (HHP: 18. 3 % O 2 at 0. 66 ATA for 5 h/day on 5 days consecutively for 2 weeks) attenuated the proposed increased serum levels of both the systemic inflammatory markers and the toxic organ <b>injury</b> <b>indicators.</b> MethodsRats were assigned to: (1) non-HHP (21 % O 2 at 1. 0 ATA) +non-HAE (21 % O 2 at 1. 0 ATA) group; (2) non-HHP+HAE group; (3) HHP+non-HAE group; (4) HHP+HAE group; and (5) HHP+HSP 70 antibodies (Ab) +HAE group. For the HSP 70 Ab group, a neutralizing HSP 70 Ab was injected intravenously at 24 hours prior to HAE. All the physiological and biochemical parameters were obtained at the end of HAE or the equivalent time period of non-HAE. Blood samples were obtained for determination of both the systemic inflammatory markers (e. g., serum tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 1 β, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, and liver myeloperoxidase activity) and the toxic organ <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> (e. g., nitric oxide metabolites, 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase). ResultsHHP, in addition to inducing overexpression of tissue HSP 70, significantly attenuated the HAE-induced hypotension, bradycardia, hypoxia, acidosis, and increased tissue levels of both the systemic inflammatory markers and the toxic organ <b>injury</b> <b>indicators.</b> The beneficial effects of HHP in inducing tissue overexpression of HSP 70 as well as in preventing the HAE-induced increased levels of the systemic inflammatory markers and the toxic organ <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> could be significantly reduced by HSP 70 Ab preconditioning.

40|$|PurposeAcute work-related {{trauma is}} {{a leading cause of}} death and {{disability}} among U. S. workers. Existing methods to estimate injury severity have important limitations. This study assessed a severe <b>injury</b> <b>indicator</b> constructed from a list of severe traumatic injury diagnosis codes previously developed for surveillance purposes. Study objectives were to: (1) describe {{the degree to which the}} severe <b>injury</b> <b>indicator</b> predicts work disability and medical cost outcomes; (2) assess whether this indicator adequately substitutes for estimating Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) -based injury severity from workers' compensation (WC) billing data; and (3) assess concordance between indicators constructed from Washington State Trauma Registry (WTR) and WC data. MethodsWC claims for workers injured in Washington State from 1998 - 2008 were linked to WTR records. Competing risks survival analysis was used to model work disability outcomes. Adjusted total medical costs were modeled using linear regression. Information content of the severe <b>injury</b> <b>indicator</b> and AIS-based <b>injury</b> severity measures were compared using Akaike Information Criterion and R 2. ResultsOf 208, 522 eligible WC claims, 5 % were classified as severe. Among WC claims linked to the WTR, there was substantial agreement between WC-based and WTR-based indicators (kappa= 0. 75). Information content of the severe <b>injury</b> <b>indicator</b> was similar to some AIS-based measures. The severe <b>injury</b> <b>indicator</b> was a significant predictor of WTR inclusion, early hospitalization, compensated time loss, total permanent disability, and total medical costs. ConclusionsSevere traumatic injuries can be directly identified when diagnosis codes are available. This method provides a simple and transparent alternative to AIS-based injury severity estimation.

40|$|Background/aims: This paper {{focuses on}} the methods used to develop {{indicators}} for "all injury" incidence for the New Zealand Injury Prevention Strategy (NZIPS), launched in June 2003. Existing and previously proposed New Zealand national non-fatal <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> exhibited threats to validity. Population/setting: The total population of New Zealand. Methods: The authors proposed fatal and new non-fatal <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> for "all injury" based on national mortality and hospitalizations data. All of the candidate indicators were subjected to a systematic assessment of validity, using the International Collaborative Effort on Injury Statistics (ICE) criteria. Based {{on the results of}} that validation, the authors identified four proposed NZIPS indicators. Results: The proposed "all injury" indicators were as follows: age standardized injury mortality rate per 100 000 person-years at risk; number of injury deaths; age standardized serious non-fatal injury rate per 100 000 person-years at risk; and number of cases of serious non-fatal injury. The authors identified no threat-to-validity when assessed against the ICE criteria. The estimated numbers and rates of serious non-fatal injury increased over the period, in contrast to the numbers and rates of fatal injury. Conclusion: The authors have proposed serious non-fatal <b>injury</b> <b>indicators</b> that they judge suffer substantially less bias than traditional non-fatal <b>injury</b> <b>indicators.</b> This approach to indicator development is consistent with the view that before newly proposed indicators are promulgated, they should be subjected to formal validation. The authors are encouraged that the New Zealand Government has accepted these arguments and proposed indicators, and are starting to act on some of their recommendations, including the development of complementary indicators...|$|R

METHODS: Randomized multistage stratified cluster sampling from the island population of China {{was used in the}} population-based case-control study. Then interview, physical examination, laboratory assessments and ultrasonography were done. RESULTS: Daily alcohol intake ≥ 20 g, duration of drinking ≥ 5 years and obesity were closely related to alcohol-related liver injury (P < 0. 05). The odds-ratio (OR) (95 % CI) was 1. 965 (1. 122 - 3. 442), 3. 412 (1. 789 - 6. 507) and 1. 887 (1. 261 - 2. 824), respectively. The prevalence rate of alcohol-related liver injury in ≥ 20 g daily alcohol intake group and < 20 g daily alcohol intake group was 37. 14 % and 12. 06 %, respectively. The prevalence rate of alcohol-related liver injury in ≥ 5 years drinking group and < 5 years drinking group was 34. 44 % and 8. 53 %, respectively.
