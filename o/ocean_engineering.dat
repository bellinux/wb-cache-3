5|$|The Dania Beach Campus, {{also known}} as SeaTech, was founded in 1997 as a state-funded TypeII {{research}} center. The institute is part of Florida Atlantic's Department of <b>Ocean</b> <b>Engineering</b> {{which was founded in}} 1965 as the first <b>ocean</b> <b>engineering</b> undergraduate program in the nation. The campus is located on 8acres (0.03km²) of land between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway. SeaTech is home to university faculty and students engaged in sponsored <b>ocean</b> <b>engineering</b> research and development in the areas of acoustics, marine vehicles, hydrodynamics and physical oceanography, marine materials and nanocomposites. The Dania Beach Campus serves approximately 70students, roughly 1% of the university's total student body.|$|E
5|$|Since {{receiving}} its startup funding, Florida Atlantic has secured {{additional funds}} from other sources, including federal and private research grants. As a result, both centers {{have engaged in}} academic and industry partnerships, combining expertise in <b>ocean</b> <b>engineering,</b> marine biotechnology, functional genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. Researchers, scientists, and students at the centers are designing technologies to explore the sea, harvest renewable energy, discover new medicines, and develop new therapeutics to combat agents of bioterrorism. As {{a result of this}} research, in 2007 the university and Lockheed Martin announced an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and produce a rapidly deployable and autonomous mooring buoy system for military and scientific uses.|$|E

25|$|O. H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory is a {{research}} facility in Corvallis, Oregon, United States. Operated by Oregon State University’s Coastal & <b>Ocean</b> <b>Engineering</b> Program within the Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering.

The Tsunami Wave Basin is the largest tsunami simulator in the world.|$|E
25|$|Airy wave {{theory is}} often used in <b>ocean</b> <b>engineering</b> and coastal engineering. Especially for random waves, {{sometimes}} called wave turbulence, {{the evolution of the}} wave statistics – including the wave spectrum – is predicted well over not too long distances (in terms of wavelengths) and in not too shallow water. Diffraction is one of the wave effects which can be described with Airy wave theory. Further, by using the WKBJ approximation, wave shoaling and refraction can be predicted.|$|E

25|$|Searle {{was born}} January 17, 1924 in Columbus, Ohio. He {{graduated}} from Bexley High School in 1941 {{and received the}} school's Distinguished Alumni Award in 1992. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor occurred during {{his first year at}} Washington and Lee University prompting a transfer to the US Naval Academy where he graduated in 1945 (Class of 1946). In 1945, Searle marched with his Naval Academy Company to accompany the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Union Station to the White House. Searle then went on to graduate work in naval architecture at Massachusetts Institute of Technology attaining a master's degree in 1952. Later that year, Searle was assigned as an Engineering Duty Officer in salvage, diving and <b>ocean</b> <b>engineering.</b>|$|E

25|$|Florida Institute of Technology's Jensen Beach Campus, {{also known}} as School of Marine and Environmental Technology or (SOMET), was a {{specialized}} branch campus located on the former campus of Saint Joseph College of Florida on the Indian River Lagoon in Jensen Beach, Florida, approximately 50 {{miles south of the}} university's main campus. The campus attracted oceanography, underwater technology and other assorted marine biology students. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had more officers that are graduates of FIT in Jensen Beach than from any other campus or college in the country. The SOMET was transferred to the main campus and became the Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences (DMES). The campus closed after the transition in 1986. In 2016, DMES was renamed Department of <b>Ocean</b> <b>Engineering</b> and Sciences (DOES) to communicate the department's focus.|$|E
25|$|As Helmsman Cho sharply {{turned the}} wheel from 135 to 150 degrees, Sewol began to list to port and tilt towards the water. The overall effect {{was that the}} ship turned about 45 degrees to the right, then rotated 22 degrees on the spot for a span of 20 seconds. The cargo falling {{to one side of}} the ship caused Sewol to lose all her {{restoring}} force and allowed water to flow into the ship through the side door of the cargo loading bay and the car entrance located at the stern. This scenario was confirmed by simulations separately run by the expert advisory panel on the joint investigation team, the Korea Research Institute of Ships and <b>Ocean</b> <b>Engineering,</b> and the Advanced Marine Engineering Center of Seoul National University. The chief engineer testified that the tilting lasted for about two to three minutes after the initial tilt. During this time, Oh Yong-seok, an off-duty helmsman who was sleeping in his cabin, was awakened when he was thrown against its port side. As of 8:50a.m., Sewol was leaning 30 degrees to port.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, {{along with}} Massachusetts College of Art and Design {{students}} and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns {{set out to}} gain a better understanding of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell’s design, materials, and technique authentic. “With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,” observed Rick Brown, referring to the latest in a long line of commemoration that perceived the Turtle as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, “It was always a temptation to use silicone to seal the thing," [...] says Rob Duarte, a MassArt student. [...] "Then you realized that someone else had to figure this out with the same limited resources that we were using. That's just an interesting way to learn. You can't do it any other way than by actually doing it.” The outer shell of the replica was hallowed, using controlled fire, from a twelve-foot Sitka Spruce. The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy. Lew Nuckols, a professor of <b>Ocean</b> <b>Engineering</b> at USNA, made ten dives, noting “you feel very isolated from the outside world. If you had any sense of claustrophobia it would not be a very good experience.” ...|$|E
