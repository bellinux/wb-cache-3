5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback, and the Eagles began on <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> their 20-yard line. Three {{consecutive}} incomplete passes later, Boston College punted, ending their sixth three and out of the game. Following the kick, Tech started at its 27-yard line. On first down, the Hokies ran an end-around for five yards, then the quarter came to an end. With one quarter remaining, Virginia Tech led, 24–7.|$|E
5|$|After the missed field goal, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> its own 27-yard line. Running back Kenny Lewis, Jr., {{replacing}} the suspended Branden Ore, {{ran for a}} first down, and Tyrod Taylor connected on an 11-yard pass to Eddie Royal for another first down. Now inside Kansas territory, Taylor attempted another pass. Kansas All-American cornerback Aqib Talib jumped between Taylor's throw and the receiver, intercepting the ball. Talib returned the interception 60yards to the end zone for a Kansas touchdown—the first points of the game. An extra point kick by Scott Webb made the score 70 Kansas with 5:15 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the 1961 film version, the musical was rarely produced, as it {{presented}} casting issues and fears that Asian-Americans would take <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> how they are portrayed. When it was put on the stage, lines and songs that might be offensive were often cut. The piece did not return to Broadway until 2002, when a version with a plot by playwright David Henry Hwang (but retaining most of the original songs) was presented after a successful Los Angeles run. Hwang's story retains the Chinatown setting and the inter-generational and immigrant themes, and emphasizes the romantic relationships. It received mostly poor reviews in New York and closed after six months but had a short tour and has since been produced regionally.|$|E

5|$|Following the missed field goal, Auburn {{took over}} on <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> its six-yard line—the {{point from which}} Tech had missed the kick. Ronnie Brown picked up 13 yards and a first down on three rushes. Carnell Williams then picked up three yards, and Jason Campbell threw a seven-yard pass that gave Auburn another first down. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech pushed Auburn's offense near midfield, and Ronnie Brown {{returned}} to the field, rushing the ball four consecutive times for 16yards and driving the Tigers into Virginia Tech territory. Facing a fourth down and one yard, Auburn elected to give the ball to Brown again. On the one-yard run, however, Brown fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech's Mikal Baagee with 8:38 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Following the turnover, the Eagles' offense {{began work}} at their 46-yard line. Davis {{completed}} a five-yard pass to Robinson, advancing into Tech territory. An incomplete pass followed, but Davis {{was able to}} gain the first down with a pass to Rich Gunnell at the 39-yard line. On the first pass after the first down, Davis and Gunnell connected on a deep pass, but Gunnell fumbled and the ball was recovered {{in the end zone}} by a Virginia Tech defender. The play resulted in a touchback, and Virginia Tech took over on <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> its 20-yard line. Following the turnover, Tech went three and out, punting back to Boston College with 2:11 remaining before halftime.|$|E

Quarterback Brent Meyer was the all-time leader in passing yards and total <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> ISU. He finished the season with the Cyclone record for career touchdowns as well. Meyer was complemented by wide receiver Todd Blythe who led the nation in career yards per catch (19.0) and was fifth on the career touchdown receptions list (25) before the game.

Johnson was hired under a seven-year contract worth more than $11 million. Johnson immediately began installing his unique flexbone option <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> Georgia Tech. By the regular season's end, Johnson had led the Yellow Jackets to a 9–3 record including an ACC Coastal Division Co-Championship and a 45–42 win in Athens, Georgia over arch-rival UGA, Tech's first win against the Bulldogs since 2000.

5|$|After another Falcon punt, the Hokies {{took over}} on <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> their 49-yard line with 4:12 {{remaining}} before halftime. Tech began advancing the ball, and was {{aided by a}} 15-yard penalty against Air Force that pushed the Hokies deep into Falcons territory. Running backs Kevin Jones and Lee Suggs advanced {{the ball on the}} ground with short rushes, and Randall contributed short passes at times, gaining needed first downs when required. Tech advanced the ball inside the Air Force 10-yard line, gaining a first down at the nine-yard line. There, the Air Force defense stiffened. Tech gained four yards on three plays, but was unable to cross the goal line for another touchdown. Tech kicker Warley entered the game to attempt his second field goal try of the game. The 23-yard kick was more successful than his first try, and with 25seconds remaining in the first half, tied the game at 10–10.|$|E

5|$|Alderson's {{situation}} worsened at the Battle of Festubert in May 1915, {{when the}} Canadian Division {{failed to make}} any headway and suffered nearly 2,500 casualties. Another operation a month later, the Second Battle of Givenchy, cost 366 casualties for no appreciable gain. Again, Alderson was not solely at fault in these actions and he remained popular with British Army Headquarters, Prime Minister Borden and with his men, resulting in promotion to command the entire Canadian Expeditionary Force when a second Division arrived late in 1915. Despite this popularity, Sam Hughes continued to hold a grudge against Alderson and opposed him in political circles, taking <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> Alderson's refusal to accept promotions made by Hughes or Carson of untried Canadian officers and instead promoting veteran British officers in their place. The main area of argument {{between the two men}} however was again over the Ross rifle.|$|E
5|$|Having stopped Kansas on fourth down, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> its 22-yard line. With just 5:51 {{remaining}} in the game, the Hokies badly needed to score quickly and get a defensive stop {{in order to have}} a chance to win. The Hokies advanced on the first aspect of that requirement as Sean Glennon converted several first downs through the air. Kansas allowed no play over nineyards until late in the drive, forcing Virginia Tech to use up valuable time. On the last play of the drive, Sean Glennon connected on a 20-yard strike to Justin Harper for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points, but with just three minutes {{remaining in the}} game, Virginia Tech's comeback would only be complete if the Hokies could recover a difficult onside kick.|$|E
5|$|Indiana {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second down at its 25-yard line. After a rushing play was stopped for a loss and Paci was forced {{to throw the ball}} away to avoid a sack, Indiana punted {{for the first time in}} {{the second quarter}}. Tech resumed <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> its 41-yard line. DeShazo completed a pass to the Indiana 47-yard line, then a 25-yard toss to Cornelius Wright, who carried it to the Indiana 22. Swarm carried the ball for a first down inside the Indiana 10-yard line, and two plays later, he carried it across the goal line for Virginia Tech's second touchdown of the game. Following the extra point, Tech took a 147 lead with 11:14 remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|Miami was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{roughing}} the kicker during the field goal attempt, allowing Tech {{to kick off}} from the Miami 45-yard line following the score. Instead of kicking off to Miami, Tech attempted an onside kick, which would allow Tech to retain possession if the ball was recovered by the kicking team after traveling 10 yards from {{the point at which}} it was kicked. The ball did not travel the needed 10 yards, however, and Miami began <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> its 37-yard line, where the ball rolled out of bounds. On Miami's first play after the kick, Kelly attempted a long pass into Tech territory, but the ball was intercepted by Tech's Mike Schamus at the Hokies' 12-yard line. With just 21 seconds remaining in the first half, Tech attempted to gain quick yardage in an effort to close within field goal distance. Though Lawrence picked up 15 yards and a first with a rush, the Hokies were unable to enter the Miami side of the field before time expired. At {{the end of the first}} half, Miami still held a 143 lead.|$|E
5|$|NC State went {{three and}} out after {{receiving}} the ball, and after Tech incurred a running into the kicker penalty on the first punt attempt, NC State punted the ball away. After the kick, Tech took over on <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> its 27-yard line. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Hunter fumbled the ball after a 10-yard rush. NC State recovered the ball, and the Wolfpack offense returned to the field at the Tech 40-yard line. On their first play after the fumble recover, Kramer completed a 12-yard pass to Worthen for a first down. During the next play, Kramer fumbled the ball while attempting to run with it, and Virginia Tech's defense recovered. This allowed the Tech offense {{to return to the}} field and attempt another offensive drive beginning at their 27-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{received}} Miami's post-score kickoff {{needing to}} score quickly {{in order to}} have a chance to have a second opportunity on offense — needed because Tech was now two scores behind. Tech returned the kickoff to the 24-yard line but were penalized 12 yards for an illegal block. Casey passed for an eight-yard gain and ran for three yards for a first down. After that gain, things went against the Hokies. Casey was penalized 15 yards for intentional grounding, and Tech was unable to gain another first down. The Hokies punted, and Miami took over on <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> its 46-yard line. In possession of the lead, Miami began to run out the clock, executing multiple rushing plays in succession in order to force the game clock to continue to count down. Tech's defense forced a stop, but because Miami punted the ball with just 2:20 remaining in the game, there was little chance that Tech would be able to make up the needed two scores.|$|E

5|$|Tech {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 20-yard line with 2:44 remaining in the first quarter. Three quick rushes picked up 22yards and two first downs, pushing {{the ball to the}} Tech 42-yard line. On the next play, however, wide receiver Justin Harper committed a 15-yard pass interference penalty, which negated much of the previous plays' gains. Marcus Vick rushed for five yards, threw two incomplete passes, and was unable to get another first down after the penalty. With time winding down in the quarter, Tech was forced to punt the ball away. The game's first punt traveled 53yards, and Louisville took over on <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> its 40-yard line following a 25-yard punt return as time expired in the quarter. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Louisville led Virginia Tech, 14–3.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Air Force in {{possession}} of the ball, facing fourth down, and needing to advance mere inches to gain a first down. During the Falcons' attempt to gain those inches, however, Tech's Bruce Smith broke through the Air Force offensive line and sacked Bart Weiss for a loss. Having failed to gain a first down, Air Force turned the ball over to Virginia Tech, which began a drive at its 42-yard line. Tech's Eddie Hunter moved the ball forward on three consecutive rushes, earning a first down and driving into Air Force territory. Seeking {{to tie the game}} or gain a lead with a trick play; Tech head coach Bill Dooley ordered a play involving a pass by Hunter instead of quarterback Mark Cox. The pass was intercepted by Air Force defender Scott Thomas, and the Falcons took over on <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> their 38-yard line with 12:58 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{second quarter}} {{began with a}} California punt. Virginia Tech {{recovered}} at its 15-yard line and began the first offensive series of the second quarter. On the first full play of the quarter, Virginia Tech running back Kevin Jones broke free of the California defense for a 42-yard gain. On the next play, Bryan Randall completed an 11-yard pass to receiver Ernest Wilford. Jones returned to action with a nine-yard run, driving the Hokies to the California 22-yard line, but there the Hokie offense stalled. Tech faced a second down and needed just two yards for a first down, but could not gain the required yardage in two attempts. Tech kicker Carter Warley was sent in to attempt a 40-yard field goal, but his kick missed and California took over on <b>offense</b> <b>at</b> its 23-yard line.|$|E
