The steers were housed in groups of nine in a fully enclosed shed and were exposed to high heat load conditions for four days. The cooling systems used were water applied via a hose, via <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinklers,</b> via sprinklers at leg height and via misters. The water used was approximately 31 oC and contained 3 % NaCl. Fans were used to ensure adequate air movement over the cattle. The animal parameters measured were feed intake, respiration rate, panting score and behaviour. Climatic factors were ambient temperature and wet bulb temperature. Ammonia levels were also measured. The hose, <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinklers</b> and misting were successful in reducing heat load on the cattle. The leg wetting system did not work because the dominant cattle blocked access to the sprinklers. The misting system used the most water (5483 L) and the hose the least (845 L). The application of water had minor impacts on wet bulb temperature, but resulted in significant reductions in dry bulb temperatures...|$|R

The outside set of wheels sets the master pace for the rotation (typically once every three days). The inner sets of wheels are mounted at hubs between two segments and use angle sensors to detect when the bend at the joint exceeds a certain threshold, and thus, the wheels should be rotated to keep the segments aligned.

5000|$|In June 2001 the Nordic Empress {{suffered}} extensive {{engine room}} fire damage while sailing 140 {{miles north of}} Bermuda. Subsequent investigation revealed {{the cause of the}} fire was failure of a loose bolt in a fuel line flange assembly that had been improperly repaired. The broken bolt caused the flange assembly to separate, allowing fuel to leak around the engine. Moments after a low fuel pressure alarm sounded in the engine room, the leaking fuel ignited against the hot engine surfaces, causing a large explosion that was visible on the engine room CCTV. The engines were stopped immediately and all fuel pumps switched off. Crew members attempting to enter the engine area to fight to fire with fire hoses were forced to turn back from the intense heat. 6 minutes into the fire, the engine room overhead fire sprinkler system was activated along with the ship's general emergency alarm. The sprinklers appeared to have extinguished the fire after 4 minutes, and crew once again attempted to re-enter the engine area, only to have the residual fuel in the engine area ignite a flash fire that was quickly extinguished with fire hoses. During the subsequent inspection of the engine room and surrounding areas, burning wires were discovered in an adjacent compartment. The space was evacuated before lowering watertight doors and releasing 885 kg of halon and restarting the <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> system. 3 hours after the first fire broke out, the incident was logged as resolved. The ship was able to return to Bermuda under reduced power, and was subsequently taken out of service for 2 weeks for repairs.

50|$|Properly designed, installed, and managed, drip {{irrigation}} may help achieve water conservation by reducing evaporation and deep drainage {{when compared to}} other types of irrigation such as flood or <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinklers</b> since water can be more precisely applied to the plant roots.

Finally, in regions where water supplies are severely limited, there may be no actual water savings, but rather simply an increase in production while using the same amount of water as before. In very arid regions or on sandy soils, the preferred method is to apply the irrigation water as slowly as possible.|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen {{development}} of some new and innovative sprinkler/spray head designs {{for use with}} center pivots and traveling laterals.

30|$|A {{significant}} (P< 0.05) {{positive correlation}} between the epiphytic population size of Xap and disease severity in both the overhead irrigated field (r= 0.64) and the furrow irrigated field (r= 0.44) has been reported (Akhavan et al. 2009 a). The reason for the higher correlation coefficient with the <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation system can {{be due to the}} effect of this type of irrigation on bacterial penetration to interior leaf spaces and subsequent development of disease. Similar results have been reported by other studies on the effect of windblown rain fall (Gilbertson and Maxwell 1992). Significant positive correlations between bacterial populations and disease severity have also been shown in other studies. For example, the epiphytic population of X. campestris pv. vesicatoria, the causal agent of tomato bacterial spot, was positively correlated with plant defoliation as a result of disease development (McGuire et al. 1991). Previously, Lindemann et al. (1984) also showed that the severity of brown spot of bean was correlated more consistently with epiphytic Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae population sizes than with disease incidence. A significant (P< 0.05) negative correlation between disease severity and seed yield per plant for both the furrow irrigated field (r=- 0.59) and the <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigated field (r=- 0.68) has also been reported (Akhavan et al. 2009 a). Furthermore, in both systems, there was a significant (P< 0.05) negative correlation between disease severity and total seed yield, but the coefficient correlation was higher under <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation (r=- 0.83) compared to furrow irrigation (r=- 0.66). This difference is likely due to more severe disease in the field under <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation system. Since the only difference between the two fields was the type of irrigation method, it can be interpreted that the <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> system provided several factors that encouraged epiphytic populations to increase and to establish an endophytic population of Xap. Overhead irrigation can provide an ideal multiplication site, i.e. a thin layer or film of water on the bean leaf surface, while also disseminating the pathogen from diseased to healthy plants. <b>Overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation may also help the epiphytic population of Xap to establish an aggressive endophytic population by facilitating the entry of bacterial cells through leaf openings followed by symptom development.|$|E
30|$|In the field, rainstorms {{can usually}} be related to rises in {{bacterial}} population sizes to the threshold level with subsequent rapid disease development. The effect of rainstorms on Xap epidemics could be result of a sudden decrease of temperature or a rapid inflow of water or raindrop occurrence (Hirano et al. 1996; Jacques et al. 2005).

It has been demonstrated that the type of irrigation had a significant effect on epiphytic populations of Xap. Although the bacterial populations were the same size at the beginning, the mean epiphytic population size in the field with an <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation system was 1.04 * 106 colony forming unit per each squared centimeter of bean leaves (cfu/cm 2) while for a furrow irrigation system, population size was 4.89 * 104 cfu/cm 2 (Akhavan et al. 2009 a).|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} the role of relative humidity rate, host genotype, inoculation method and growth stage in epidemiology of bean common blight, two greenhouse experiments were carried out monitoring epiphytic population size of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli (Xap) and disease severity. The result showed significant differences among genotypes, inoculation methods and growth stages for epiphytic population size and sam effects except genotypes for disease severity. The epiphytic population size was significantly higher on spray inoculated Khomein cultivar of bean during flowering (R 6). However, the relative humidity rates did not significantly affect population dynamics of epiphytic Xap and the disease severity. Two field experiments were also carried out {{to determine the effects}} of irrigation systems (furrow irrigation and <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation), inoculation method, growth stage and their interactions on epiphytic population size of Xap and disease severity.

30|$|It {{has been}} {{revealed}} that irrigation type significantly influenced disease severity. Disease severity means were 5.8 and 2.8 in fields with <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation and furrow irrigation, respectively using the standard {{system for the}} evaluation of bean germplasm with 1 as “no visible disease symptoms” and 9 as “very severe disease symptoms”(Schoonhoven and Pastor-Corrales 1994; Akhavan et al. 2009 a). In addition to dispersing bacterial cells and helping them to reach healthy plants as the key factor, and promoting release of leaf nutrients to the microbial community, <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation can generate a film of water over the leaf surface including stomata, providing the symptomless epiphytic populations with a bridge to enter the plant resulting in disease symptoms development (Carvalho et al. 2011). Previously, it has also been shown that Asiatic citrus canker was more severe when applying overhead irrigation system which also increased the incidence of this disease caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Pruvost et al. 1999). In contrast, Wheeler et al. (2007) showed that overhead irrigation increased disease incidence of cotton bacterial blight by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. malvacearum in a partially resistant cultivar; PM 2200 RR compared with drop hoses, while irrigation method did not influence disease incidence for the susceptible cultivar; PM 2326 RR.|$|E
50|$|To best {{prevent the}} spread of {{pseudomonas}} cichorii the first intervention is to regulate the free water and watering system of leaves. <b>Overhead</b> <b>sprinklers</b> and hose watering should be replaced with soil irrigation. Soil irrigation is useful because it prevents excess water accumulation on plant surfaces by watering the plant from the root system. Soil irrigation also limits the ability of the seed structures to grow and infect leaf surfaces. A second intervention is watering earlier in the day. Watering earlier in the day gives the leaves more time during the day to dry. A third intervention, is to minimize leaf splashing. This lessens the chance that the infected water will spread to another host. Sanitation is also important. Workers and those handling the infected leaves should wash their hands and keep infected plant material from uninfected areas. These infected cuttings and seedlings should not be planted or kept near uninfected fields as the pathogen is able to survive on the host's seeds. Chemical control with appropriately labeled copper or other bactericidal products can be used to help manage the disease but is not always successful in preventing disease spread when conditions are wet.|$|R

We also evaluated combinations of insecticide spray regimes, used in association with sprinkler irrigation runs, for suppressing thrips populations in both fall and spring seasons. The results of the study demonstrated that <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation has the ability to suppress thrips populations in romaine lettuce.

A shift from current production of rice on flooded soils to production of rice on non-flooded soil with water-saving irrigation or to production of more water-efficient crops will have profound effects on carbon, water, and energy exchanges. This study used the eddy covariance technique to examine C uptake and water use efficiencies for water-saving, dry-seeded rice production and production of hybrid maize under <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation {{as an alternative to}} flooded rice during two growing seasons. Maize with its C 4 physiology has greater photosynthetic capacity than rice. In 2011, maize had 1. 4 times higher net C uptake than rice and twice as much grain yield as rice (10. 4 vs 5. 3 Mg ha− 1). In 2012, lower solar radiation due to increased cloudiness and heavy rainfall during critical growth stages (late vegetative to early reproductive) decreased LAI and resulted to about 20 % less net C uptake and maize yield (8. 2 Mg ha− 1), but the rice yield was unchanged (5. 3 Mg ha− 1) presumably because of improved crop management which included effective crop establishment at lower seed rate and efficient N application using fertigation. Canopy light use efficiency, crop water productivity (WPET), and photosynthetic water use efficiency were 1. 8, 1. 9, and 1. 6 times higher for maize than rice, respectively, despite sensitivity of maize to excess water.

Production Methods: Sites for apple production in Arkansas generally have well drained soils and topography that favors air drainage {{to reduce the risk of}} spring frost damage. Higher density plantings are composed of freestanding trees using semi-dwarfing or dwarfing rootstock. Trellis systems are not used in Arkansas but when dwarfing rootstocks are used trees are staked. Drip irrigation is recommended and some growers have adopted the use of <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinklers</b> to provide evaporative cooling during the warmest portions of the growing season. Fertilization is based on monitoring of tissue nutrient content (leaf samples taken between July 15 and July 30) and soil testing. Row middles are planted to permanent sod that reduces erosion, provides support for mechanical traffic during wet conditions, and improves organic matter content of the soil. Sod used is primarily tall fescue, bluegrass, or orchardgrass. Tree row is maintained as a weed-free zone by use of herbicides. Planting occurs in the fall or early spring. The first crop is achieved in the third season with a full crop expected in 5 – 7 years depending on rootstock used and cultural practices. In general, dwarfing rootstocks will have a full crop sooner. Thinning is accomplished by a combination of use of chemical thinning agents and hand thinning.

40|$|The horticultural crops {{considered}} {{in this chapter}} are characterised {{by the fact that}} the plants are grown in a restricted volume, like pots, containers, plastic trays or compressed peat blocks. In the market these crops are recognized as potted plants, bedding plants and container grown nursery stock, mostly for ornamental purposes. Another group is the raising of young vegetable and cut flower plants, due to production holdings. Although extremely diverse, all these plants are grown as single units and this makes the water supply of the plants complicated. Trickle irrigation is generally unsuitable because it is laborious, due to rapid changing crops and plant densities and besides expensive because of the large number of units per area. Exceptions are the plants grown in large containers, like balcony and patio plants, some nursery stock and subtropical trees with a long growing period and a low plant density. <b>Overhead</b> <b>sprinklers</b> induce excessive losses of irrigation water and nutrients, since a considerable amount of the irrigated water falls alongside the pots or drips from the leaf canopy mostly also alongside the pots. Moreover, the water supplied is absorbed per individual plant or plant batch, which strongly enhances the variation in the water and nutrient status of such units. To avoid these problems, potted plants already have been grown for many years on concrete floors or on container benches with sub-irrigation. Nowadays, in all modern greenhouses this is the common growing system. In contrast with vegetable and cut flower nurseries, potted plant nurseries are not always specialised in one crop, but in different plant species.

Water management strategies varied with soil moisture tensions. Irrigation by drip systems was carried out when soil water tensions reached 15 - 30 kPa (high moisture), whereas for SU the trigger soil tension was 30 - 60 kPa (moderate moisture).

The technique involved inoculation of tillers at the boot-leaf stage by injecting a sporidial suspension of Tolyposporium penicillariae into the space around the inflorescence within the flag leaf sheath, followed by covering the tiller "boots" with parchment bags. High humidity was maintained with frequent <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation throughout the period of inculation, flowering, and grain development. Inflorescences were scored for smut reaction 20 - 25 days after inoculation {{with the aid of}} a standard key developed to estimate percent severity. This technique was used successfully in the field during the 1981 rainy season to screen more than 200 pearl millet lines. Resistance was confirmed in a few lines and many resistant plants with selfed seeds were selected...|$|E
40|$|A conference {{paper on}} wheat {{production}} in Zimbabwe {{in the period}} before Zimbabwe's land reform programmeWheat is grown commercially in Zimbabwe as a fully-irrigated winter crop (May-September) in the highveld, middleveld and lowveld on medium-to-heavy textured soils. Approximately 75 % of the commercial wheat farmers {{are located in the}} Hunyani and Mazowe Valleys of the highveld (mean elevation of 1442 m) and the rest are scattered in the middleveld and lowveld, with a significant concentration in the lowveld (mean elevation of 443 m) In Zimbabwe, winter wheat is irrigated by <b>overhead</b> <b>sprinkler</b> systems. Virtually all farmers hand move their irrigation equipment, although about four farmers are experimenting with low-pressure centre pivot systems. The research supporting the preparation the proceedings papers was financed by the U. S. Agency for International Development, Bureau of Science and Technology; Bureau for Africa; and the Southern Africa Regional Programme...|$|E

50|$|In <b>sprinkler</b> or <b>overhead</b> irrigation, {{water is}} piped {{to one or}} more central {{locations}} within the field and distributed by <b>overhead</b> high-pressure <b>sprinklers</b> or guns. A system utilizing sprinklers, sprays, or guns mounted overhead on permanently installed risers {{is often referred to as}} a solid-set irrigation system. Higher pressure sprinklers that rotate are called rotors an are driven by a ball drive, gear drive, or impact mechanism. Rotors can be designed to rotate in a full or partial circle. Guns are similar to rotors, except that they generally operate at very high pressures of 40 to 130 lbf/in² (275 to 900 kPa) and flows of 50 to 1200 US gal/min (3 to 76 L/s), usually with nozzle diameters in the range of 0.5 to 1.9 inches (10 to 50 mm). Guns are used not only for irrigation, but also for industrial applications such as dust suppression and logging.|$|R
40|$|The sandy soils of the Buckner {{series in}} Muscatine and Louisa Counties are used mainly for {{vegetable}} crops. Yields of sweet potatoes, muskmelons and watermelons are good in favorable seasons. Sandy soils suitable for sweet potato production {{are present in}} other parts of Iowa, but those north of Muscatine County are too far north for maximum production. Muskmelons and watermelons can be grown farther north, but the greatest area of commercial production in Iowa is in Muscatine and Louisa Counties. There are about 6, 700 acres of Buckner coarse sand in Muscatine County. This soil dries out rapidly, and irrigation by either furrow or <b>overhead</b> rotary <b>sprinkler</b> system is a common practice with commercial growers in this district. There are several thousand acres of fine sands and sandy loams, in addition to the Buckner coarse sand, in Muscatine, Louisa, Lee and adjacent counties. These soils are also well suited for sweet potato and melon production...|$|R
