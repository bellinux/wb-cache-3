5|$|In 2005 {{and after}} having been vacant for many years, a {{renovation}} began to convert the 10-story building into 96 loft condominiums, while adding two floors to the annex. In July 2008, the residents sued the bar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the building for its noise pollution, resulting in the relocation of the bar in February 2009. Among the current and past owners of the building's loft condominiums are Dave Navarro, Jason Statham, Danny Masterson, and Charlize Theron.|$|E

It {{has been suggested}} that this is when the name Pavillon de Flore came into use, although the earliest known written mention is in 1726. Pavillon de Flore is the name used today, although other names have been used in between.|$|E

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> {{the home}} the rooms remain {{much the same}} as they were when Glidden lived in the house. An {{original}} multi-paneled wooden door remains at the entry from the porch to the central hall. The door, however, was altered, having glass panels installed to admit more light. The staircase is also original and its newel posts resemble those found in the Isaac and Harriet Ellwood House, another Haish designed home, and the Gurler House, whose architect is unknown though it was quite possibly Haish, both in DeKalb.|$|E
5|$|Several {{cultural}} venues {{are located}} in Sandakan. The Sandakan Heritage Museum, situated at the Lebuh Empat Road, is the main museum of Sandakan.

Besides that, a cultural festival known as Sandakan Festival is celebrated once a year in the town, after having been introduced in 2000 by the Sandakan Municipal Council.|$|E
5|$|The Goathouse Refuge in Pittsboro, North Carolina, is {{a nonprofit}} no-kill animal {{sanctuary}} for cats that is run on a volunteer-basis. The refuge is cage-free so the cats can freely roam around {{within the boundaries of}} the property. Founded in 2007 by Italian-born artist Siglinda Scarpa, the refuge can hold up to 300 cats on a 16-acre farm. There is an art gallery located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the house where Scarpa sells her handmade art such as pottery, sculptures, and cookware to help support the refuge.|$|E

5|$|The Music Library is {{a branch}} of Joyner Library located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> A.J. Fletcher Music Center. It houses {{approximately}} 93,000items, including the entire audio recording collection. It is the largest music collection east of Raleigh. The primary users of the library are faculty and students within the School of Music and the School of Theatre and Dance, but anyone can use its resources. It began in the 1958–59 academic year when a small library was created. Today a staff of five oversee the library duties.|$|E
5|$|Theatres and {{cultural}} centres include Le théâtre municipal, Le Centre Culturel Gérard Philipe, Le Conservatoire à rayonnement départemental (CRD), L'auditorium Didier Lockwood, L'École d'Art de Calais, Le Channel, Le Cinéma Alhambra and La Médiathèque municipale. Le théâtre municipal or Calais Theatre {{is located on}} the Boulevard Lafayette and was built in 1903 on a plot of land which was used as a cemetery between 1811 and 1871. The theatre opened in 1905. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the façade are statues which represent the performing arts subjects of Poetry, Comedy, Dance and Music.|$|E
5|$|After the Ashton Canal {{closed in}} the 1960s, {{it was decided to}} turn the Portland Basin {{warehouse}} into a museum. In 1985, {{the first part of the}} Heritage Centre and Museum opened <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.|$|E

5|$|Geisel Library's {{collection}} of over 200,000 books originated in {{a sack of}} books brought by Father Hugo Paff, O.S.B. from Saint Mary's Abbey in Newark, New Jersey; these books {{are still in the}} library and date back to the mid- to late-19th century. The college's first library, shaped around this initial collection, was situated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> Alumni Hall. During {{the early years of the}} college, Benedictines served as librarians on an ad hoc basis, but by 1929, Saint Anselm had its first official librarian, Father Cuthbert Redmond, O.S.B. New books were purchased under Father Edwin Davitt, O.S.B. By 1937, Saint Anselm could boast 8,000 books in several mini-libraries, as well as the main repository, by this time located on the second floor.|$|E
5|$|Rose, Morris & Co {{have been}} {{established}} in Denmark Street since 1919. Originally based at No. 11, they now occupy No. 10 in the former offices of Southern Music Publishing. The company became the first British distributor of Rickenbacker guitars in 1962, which had a surge in popularity after musicians noticed the Beatles' John Lennon playing one. Rose Morris purchased instruments directly from Rickenbacker's factory instead of their sales office, {{in order to keep}} up with demand. The British models carry unique serial numbers such as the 325, the Rose Morris 1996. The Early Music Shop's London branch is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> number 11, above Rose Morris. The shop contains early music instruments including recorders and sheet music.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{rooms were}} {{positioned}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> {{a range of}} buildings that ran around {{the outside of the}} ward, facing onto a courtyard. The four towers that protected the Inner Ward contained service facilities, with the Chapel Tower containing the private royal chapel. Each tower has an additional watchtower turret, probably intended both for security and to allow the prominent display of the royal flag. The arrangement was originally {{similar to that of the}} 13th century Gloriette at Corfe Castle, and provided a combination of privacy for the king while providing extensive personal security. The two sets of apartments were later unified into a single set of rooms, including a great chamber, outer chamber and inner chamber.|$|E

5|$|The south (front) face of {{the eastern}} wing has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet at eaves level. The central bay is set forward to form a stone centrepiece around the arched main {{entrance}}, which is flanked by fluted Ionic columns. Immediately above the entrance are doubled tapering pilasters flanking a three-light window, all surmounted by a large cartouche decorated with strapwork. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the central bay is a triple-mullion window, and above the parapet is a coat of arms. Flanking the centrepiece are two bays with diapered brickwork and single-mullion windows. The two ends of the south face are also set forward; they have canted, triple-mullion bay windows and are surmounted above the parapet by shaped gables with attic windows. All the main windows of this face are double transomed.|$|E
5|$|The {{suite of}} state rooms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the east wing {{contains}} the long gallery, library, drawing room (great chamber), small drawing room and two bedrooms. All date originally from the Jacobean mansion, but {{are likely to}} have been significantly altered by John Crewe and then extensively reworked by Blore in neo-Jacobean style. They were restored to Barry's designs, usually with little attempt to reproduce the Jacobean appearance, probably because records of most of the original designs were lacking. Crace performed much of the decoration work in these rooms. All the state rooms contain elaborate plasterwork and stone chimneypieces, often flanked with Corinthian columns or pilasters.|$|E
5|$|According to the prosecution's theory, {{the assassin}} shot Goebel from the {{secretary}} of state's office <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> a building next to the state capitol. However, much of the testimony against the accused men was conflicting, {{and some of it}} was later proven to be perjured. Most of the state's judges were Democratic supporters of Goebel and juries were packed with partisan Democrats. The appellate courts, however, were largely Republican, and the convictions returned by the lower courts were often overturned, with the cases being remanded for new trials. Howard was tried and convicted in September 1900, January 1902, and April 1903; his final appeal failed, and he was sentenced to life in prison. Powers was also convicted three times—in July 1900, October 1901, and August 1903; a fourth trial in November 1907 ended in a hung jury. In 1908, Powers and Howard were pardoned by Republican governor Augustus E. Willson. Months later, Willson also issued pardons for former governor Taylor and several others still under indictment. Despite the pardon, Taylor seldom returned to Kentucky; he became an insurance executive in Indiana and died there in 1928. Youtsey, the only defendant not to appeal his sentence, was paroled in 1916 and pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.|$|E

5|$|In June 1904, {{during the}} experiments, Zammit {{learned that a}} Maltese family of five members became {{simultaneously}} ill after consuming fresh unpasteurized milk from goats. Zammit decided to purchase healthy goats and tested them, {{and at one point}} also kept them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the Castellania (then known as the public health building or the variants). Zammit was successful in the discovery of the disease. David Bruce, who led the MFC, discouraged the experiments when proposed by Zammit. However, when the experiment concluded in the discovery, Bruce tried to discredit Zammit by taking the merit for himself. Information about the role of Zammit was kept low profile or ignored. The fever was renamed after Bruce, as brucellosis. The MFC managed to find cure and ways to eradicate the fever, but had a hard time since there was lack of cooperation with sellers and consumers of milk, some dismissing or ignoring the finding. It was under control by 1938, with the enforcement of standard procedures of pasteurizing milk. However, slaughtering of infected animals continued throughout the 20th century and there was another rising challenge for the department in 1994 and 1995.|$|E
5|$|The new wing has six dormers (three on a side), and six dormers {{were added}} to the old house in the 1913 {{renovation}} (four on the east side, two on the west). The windows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the new wing matched the old windows, but the windows in the second story of the addition have twelve panes in the upper sash and eight in the lower. As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1850s house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of {{the lower part of the}} L. A small porch was added in the corner where the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of the old house, and all the old porches were restored. In the original house two chimneys were restored and two replaced, and new fireplaces were installed in the living room, library, and dining room. The house has a total of 28 rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{collection has}} more than 7,500works from the 13thcentury to 1848 and is managed by 12curators who oversee the collection's display. Nearly two-thirds are by French artists, and more than 1,200are Northern European. The Italian paintings compose most of the remnants of FrancisI and LouisXIV's collections, others are unreturned artwork from the Napoleon era, and some were bought. The collection began with Francis, who acquired works from Italian masters such as Raphael and Michelangelo and brought Leonardo da Vinci to his court. After the French Revolution, the Royal Collection formed {{the nucleus of the}} Louvre. When the d'Orsay train station was converted into the Musée d'Orsay in 1986, the collection was split, and pieces completed after the 1848 Revolution were moved to the new museum. French and Northern European works are in the Richelieu wing and Cour Carrée; Spanish and Italian paintings are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the Denon wing.|$|E
