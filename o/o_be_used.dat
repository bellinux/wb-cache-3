40|$|Abstract: In power systems, {{using only}} {{conventional}} PSS for local and inter-area oscillation {{does not provide}} sufficient damping. FACTS devices can als <b>o</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in damping of power systems oscillations. However, uncoordinated local control of FACTS devices and PSS may cause destabilizing interactions. Therefore, to enhance local and inter-area oscillation damping and improved power system stability coordination design Power System Stabilizer (PSS) with Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) has been studied in this paper. The coordination design problem of excitation and TCSC-based controllers is formulated as a time domain based optimization problem and a new model modification of PSO algorithm, named (CLAPSO) which combination Cellular Learning Automata and Particle Swarm Optimization is used to search for optimal controller parameters. To study {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed controllers, different loading conditions are considered. The simulation results show that the proposed controllers are effective in damping low frequency oscillations under different loading conditions.

40|$|Economic Accounting is {{relatively}} well developed in Norway {{especially on the}} national level, {{but also on the}} regional level. Satellite accounting is used for focusing certain features of the economy, a. o. for tourism. A satellite account for tourism has been developed on the national level. Because the tourists'activities are regional activities, and because the impacts of tourism are significant not only on the national, but also on the regional level, a regional satellite account for tourism was developed by us during the past two years. Such satellite accounts on the regional level are, to our knowledge, not developed worldwide. The data can a. <b>o.</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for moderating existing input-output models, so they can become more tailor-made for analysing impacts of tourists' economic activities. We propose a paper that focuses on our work - methods for regionalising satellite accounts for tourism, - indicators applied for this regionalisation, - how regional satellite account figures can be adapted into existing input-output models of the Norwegian economy (on the regional level), and - an example, showing how the regional satellite accounts for tourism can be used for simulating the regional impacts of tourism by the use of input-output techniques. ...|$|E

Data can easier be analysed when interaction is supported. In {{the context of this}} paper multidimensional input devices refer to interaction devices with more than 2 degrees of freedom. I will consider a 6 D-ball (the Spaceball from Spatial Systems) and a glove (the DataGlove from VPL, which incorporates a Polhemus 3 Space Isotrack system). These are devices that support full 3 D interaction. The paper is organized in two parts. The first part investigates the suitability of input devices for interaction in 3 D scenes in general. A system is realized that supports the comparison of the "old" devices mouse and dials with the above mentioned "modern" devices. In particular the graphics interactions identifying and transforming an object (translation and rotation) are investigated and the results are presented.

40|$|Inorganic-organic {{hybrid systems}} are {{a class of}} {{materials}} that can combine the properties of each constituent material into novel materials with properties that are enhanced or even obtainable where previously unattainable. At nano length scales, these properties can be enhanced via various nano-effects that enable these materials to be tailorable to specific applications. When ice templating (a technique that induces porosity via a sacrificial ice template) is combined with these nano-hybrid systems, {{a new class of}} porous materials becomes available that can be imbued with targeted properties as required by the specific application. This dissertation focuses on using these techniques to synthesize novel materials with prerequisite properties as well as to fabricate nano-hybrid porous systems to be used as intermediate precursor materials. This dissertation will first describe work focused on the catalyst layer in PEM fuel cells. In these fuels cells, there is a classic materials science problem where {{there is a need for}} a particular material that can accomplish multiple tasks at once. To synthesize a material with all of the prerequisite properties, traditional nanocomposite techniques were combined with ice templating and a dual in situ reduction technique to produce an interconnected porous nano-hybrid scaffold with electrical conductivity (graphene sheets), ionic conductivity (Nafion) and catalytic platinum nanoparticles. Next, the dissertation will focus on ice templating techniques applied to carbon systems to synthesize hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) materials. This new family of carbon materials has a hierarchical porosity across all three length scales (micro -, meso and macro-) and enable the HPCs to have tunable porosities across all three pore length scales. The consequent material is an open, vascular network of interconnected macropores, whose pore walls are made up of mesopores and micropores. This results in a material with easy ingress/egress to the high surface area (up to 2000 + m 2 /g) meso/micropores by way of the interconnect ed macroporous network. Finally, initial results of applications for the HPCs will be explored including electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs), Li-sulfur batteries, and scaffolds for CO 2 capture. In this regard, the HPCs showed an excellent capability t <b>o</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as effective EDLC electrodes with a maximum charge storage capability of 6 W[MIDDLE DOT]h/kg and a ma ximum power density of 14 kW/kg. When used as a carbon support for a Li -S battery cathode, a charge capacity of roughly 600 mAh/gsulfur at a relatively high charge/discharge rate of 1 C was obtained, while maintaining good columbic efficiency (> 85 %). The HPCs also demonstrated an exceptional ability when used as scaffolds for amine based CO 2 capture, achieving a maximum CO 2 capacity of 4. 2 mmol/g...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to provide information}} {{to be used in}} making decisions related {{to the development of a}} new type of campus arboretum a t Charles County Community College, La Plata, Maryland. This arboretum would be based on an ecological approach to the selection of native plant material t <b>o</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> i n the landscape development of the Campus. After analyzing the site and its conditions, it was found that of the 173 acres, approximately 50 % of the land had slopes greater than 10 % and was therefore unsuited to conventional development. Of the remaining 50 % of the land, approximately 25 % is in a flood plain. Therefore, only 25 % of the land is suited to development without major changes in topography or drainage patterns. Three line-transect surveys were conducted on June 20, 1972, to determine the indigenous flora associated with the six major soil types of Aura, Beltsville, Bibb, Croom, Iuka, and Sassafras. A total of 39 native genera, 48 native species, and 1 introduced genus were found indigenous to the Campus. In the lists of recommended plants for these soil types, a total of 95 genera and 166 species were included for use in the landscape development of the Campus to provide an arboretum of native plants. These plants were selected on the basis of those native plants from within a 250 mile radius of the College which were of ornamental value for use in landscaping in the various soil types. The lists are based on those native plants indigenous to the site on the soil types and those native plants recommended by Donald Wyman in his books entitled Trees for American Gardens, Shrubs and Vines for American Gardens, and Ground Cover Plants which have habitats similar to the existing site conditions of the soil types involved. These lists contain information on the habit, height, genus species, common name, flower color and month(s) of interest, fruit color or type and month(s) of interest, autumn color, and landscape comments on the plant involved. From these lists, the College or landscape architect can select the native plants which can be used in the various soil types which exist on the Campus. In addition, setting up the Arboretum as an independent organization has a number of advantages as elaborated in this thesis. Of advantage will be an herbarium, records system, library, and labeling system appropriate to the development of an arboretum of native plants...|$|E
