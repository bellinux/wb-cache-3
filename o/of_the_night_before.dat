25|$|Because {{the astronomical}} year is {{slightly}} shorter than 365.25 days, {{the date of}} Birkat Hachama shifts away from the spring equinox as history proceeds. A simple astronomical calculation shows that 84 cycles of 28 years before 5769, in the Jewish year 3417, the spring equinox was in the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>before</b> the fourth {{day of the week}} as stipulated by the Talmud. Lerman takes this as a hint that the astronomically astute Jewish sages of the time concluded that the Jewish year 3417 was a first year in the cycle of 28 years. Moreover, Lerman suggests that these same Jewish sages would have reasoned that year 3421 was a first year in the 19-year cycle, in accordance with an ancient tradition that the world was created {{in the first week of}} the month of Nissan, and thus the sun was created on the fourth day of Nissan. Since every 19 years the solar and lunar calendars align, and the Spring equinox of 3421 occurred early in the night leading to the fourth day of the Jewish month of Nissan, it follows that 3421 was the first year of a 19-year cycle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} of a three-game road series against the Mets on September 19, the Braves put up seven runs, {{including}} a solo homer by Freeman, and Blair surrendered just two runs off four hits in six innings pitched to earn his first victory of the season in a 7-3 win over the Mets. In the second game, the Braves put up five runs, including a three-run homer in the seventh inning by Garcia, and Johnson earned the save to win series in a 5-4 victory over the Mets. The Mets jumped to a three-run lead in the final game of the series, but the Braves rallied back with four unanswered runs, which included a two-run homer by Anthony Recker in the seventh inning, {{to take the lead in}} the top of the ninth. In an almost exact repeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>before,</b> Braves closer Johnson faced off against Cespedes with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. Cespedes hit the ball to deep right-center and had the distance for a three-run homer, but center fielder Inciarte raced towards the wall, made the jump and caught the ball above the fence to get the final out for a 4-3 Braves victory in their final game of the season against the Mets.|$|E

25|$|In England, {{the celebration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> <b>before</b> Epiphany, Epiphany Eve, {{is known as}} Twelfth Night (The first night of Christmas is December 25–26, and Twelfth Night is January 5–6), and was a {{traditional}} time for mumming and the wassail. The yule log was left burning until this day, and the charcoal left was kept until the next Christmas to kindle next year's yule log, {{as well as to}} protect the house from fire and lightning. In the past, Epiphany was also a day for playing practical jokes, similar to April Fool's Day. Today in England, Twelfth Night is still as popular a day for plays as when Shakespeare's Twelfth Night was first performed in 1601, and annual celebrations involving the Holly Man are held in London. A traditional dish for Epiphany was Twelfth Cake, a rich, dense, typically English fruitcake. As in Europe, whoever found the baked-in bean was king for a day, but unique to English tradition other items were sometimes included in the cake. Whoever found the clove was the villain, the twig, the fool, and the rag, the tart. Anything spicy or hot, like ginger snaps and spiced ale, was considered proper Twelfth Night fare, recalling the costly spices brought by the Wise Men. Another English Epiphany dessert was the jam tart, but made into a six-point star for the occasion to symbolize the Star of Bethlehem, and thus called Epiphany tart. The discerning English cook sometimes tried to use thirteen different coloured jams on the tart on this day for luck, creating a dessert with the appearance of stained glass.|$|E

500|$|Miloš Forman's {{first feature}} film Cerný Petr (Black Peter) was {{released}} in 1964 and was not viewed favorably by Czech governmental authorities until it was selected for competition at that year's Locarno Film Festival, where it won the top prize, thereby gaining the approval of Czechoslovakia's communist bureaucracy and {{making it possible for}} Forman to pursue further projects with relative freedom. Unsure of what the next project should be, Forman recalled an experience he'd had driving around Prague late one evening when he'd encountered a young woman struggling to cross a bridge while carrying a heavy suitcase. [...] He gave her a lift and learned her story: [...] she had come to the big city from Varnsdorf, where she had been seduced by a young engineer, who had given her a phony address in Žižkov and promised to take her away from her dreary life. [...] After confirming that she had been duped, Forman interviewed the girl for much of the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>before</b> putting her on a train back to her home town. Commentators have noted that Forman was particularly sensitized to such situations because when he was 10, his mother had been taken away by the Gestapo, never to be seen again, which led to years of Forman traveling around searching for security with nothing but a suitcase. In Forman's words: [...] "I guess I'll always be moved by the sight of a young person with a suitcase seeking a connection in a strange city." ...|$|E

500|$|Catiline {{was once}} again a {{candidate}} for the consulship for the year of 62 BC. As part of his campaign, Catiline promised reforms to reduce and cancel debts, a proposal which brought him the support of bankrupt aristocrats, debtors, and poor farmers whose agricultural ventures had failed. This proposal, however, also pitched the conservatives, moderates and members of the Senate against him. On the day of the elections, Cicero attended wearing a breastplate under his tunic in an attempt to raise the alarm in the Senate and provoke the fear that Catiline might resort to violence as consul. In the end, Lucius Licinius Murena and Decimus Junius Silanus were elected to the position of consul and Catiline's bid for the position had once again failed. In response, and having lost hope of having a successful political career, Catiline began to conspire against the Senate. Cicero employed spies to keep tabs on Catiline and began to piece together a case against Catiline to be brought to the Senate. In the midst of these developments, Hybrida first tried to remain on the fence, but, was forced to action {{in the face of the}} risk of having himself charged as a co-conspirator. On 6 November 63 BC, Cicero learned of a plot to have himself and other members of the Senate assassinated and Rome set on fire and sacked. While all of this was happening, Catiline and an army of his supporters, under the command of Gaius Manlius, were to march on Rome in response to this attack and bring Rome to its salvation. This did not happen, and Cicero called a meeting of the Senate which Catiline himself attended. At this meeting, Cicero launched an attack against Catiline denouncing him [...] "to his face" [...] while providing the details of the plot that he had learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>before.</b> After this meeting, Catiline fled the city of Rome to join up with Manlius and an army of approximately 10,000 men at Etruria. The Senate upon becoming aware of this issued a senatus consultum ultimum declaring Catiline and his army as enemies of the state. Finally, Cicero arrested five men to be brought to the Senate for an immediate trial, the outcome of which was an order for their executions which was delivered and enacted by the Senate.|$|E

2500|$|The Sulpicians {{strongly}} {{encouraged the}} Mohawk {{to move to}} a new settlement west on the Ottawa River, which came to be called Kanesatake. [...] It was their former hunting ground. [...] In 1716 the French Crown granted a large parcel of land to the Mohawk north of the Ottawa River, and a smaller adjacent grant to the Sulpicians. [...] According to Alanis Obomsawin, the Sulpicians had the grant changed so that all the land was in their name, depriving the Mohawk of their own place. A devoutly religious man, Onasakenrat became an ordained minister in 1880, and worked to translate religious works into the Mohawk language. He translated the Gospels (1880) and several hymns. At the time of his sudden death in 1881, he was working on a translation of the remainder of the Bible, having completed up to the Epistle to the Hebrews.

He was supported by Gennaro Gattuso and Clarence Seedorf defensively, as well as Massimo Ambrosini, allowing Kaká as the attacking midfielder and Rui Costa or Andrea Pirlo as the deep-lying playmaker to be in charge of creating Milan's goalscoring chances, forming a formidable midfield unit in both Italy and Europe. Milan began the season by winning the Supercoppa Italiana against Lazio. He scored seven goals in 36 domestic appearances as Milan finished runner-up in the Scudetto race. Milan also reached the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia that season. Kaká played a pivotal role in Milan's Champions League campaign that season, helping them to reach the final against Liverpool, scoring two goals and providing five assists.
