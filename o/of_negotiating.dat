5|$|An {{important}} event following {{the conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin, the Bavarians' murder of Kurszán, was recorded by the longer version of the Annals of Saint Gall, the Annales Alamannici and the Annals of Einsiedeln. The first places the event in 902, while the others date it to 904. The three chronicles unanimously state that the Bavarians invited the Hungarian leader to a dinner on the pretext <b>of</b> <b>negotiating</b> a peace treaty and treacherously assassinated him. Kristó and other Hungarian historians argue that the dual leadership over the Hungarians ended with Kurszán's death.|$|E
5|$|Following Hungary's {{membership}} of NATO in 1999, {{there were several}} proposals to achieve a NATO-compatible fighter force. Considerable attention went into studying second-hand aircraft options as well as modifying the nation's existing MiG-29 fleet. In 2001, Hungary received several offers of new and used aircraft from various nations, including Sweden, Belgium, Israel, Turkey, and the US. Although the Hungarian government initially intended to procure the F-16, in November 2001 {{it was in the}} process <b>of</b> <b>negotiating</b> a 10-year lease contract for 12 Gripen aircraft, with an option to purchase the aircraft {{at the end of the}} lease period.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Iron Mans release, Marvel Studios {{announced that}} they were developing a sequel, with an intended release date of April 30, 2010. In July 2008, after several months <b>of</b> <b>negotiating,</b> Favreau officially signed on to direct. That same month, Justin Theroux signed to write the script, which {{would be based on}} a story written by Favreau and Downey. Theroux co-wrote Tropic Thunder, which Downey had starred in, and Downey recommended him to Marvel. Genndy Tartakovsky storyboarded the film, and Adi Granov returned to supervise the designs for Iron Man's armor.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{criticism}} <b>of</b> <b>negotiated</b> rulemaking {{is that it}} subverts {{the public}} interest because special interest groups have too much sway.

5|$|Initially, {{there was}} an {{intention}} to procure up to 400 aircraft for the Royal Navy and the RAF, but the development cost for the changes to accommodate the Spey turbofans meant that the per-unit price eventually ended up three times the price of an F-4J. Because the government then had a policy <b>of</b> <b>negotiating</b> fixed-price contracts, these costs could not be evened out by a large production run, which left the total order at 170.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} explore {{postgraduate}} students’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>negotiated</b> curriculum. The statement of problem is whether rigid curriculum is still relevant to postgraduate students’ learning. As the postgraduates are adult learners, they are generally working, family, and have other commitments than typical undergraduate students. This in turn suggests for a negotiated curriculum. Boomer (1992 : 227) defines classrooms in which teachers invite and allow students to help construct the learning journey as “negotiating the curriculum”. Comparatively, “curriculum negotiation involves giving students {{a voice in the}} choice and development of learning opportunities: both the “what” and the “how” of curriculum” (Carr & Kemmis, 1986, p. 171). A total of 30 TESL postgraduate students in UiTM participated in this study. An adapted questionnaire was used to collect the relevant data. Findings revealed that the respondents were aware of the existence <b>of</b> <b>negotiated</b> curriculum. It was also discovered that the main factor for the implementation <b>of</b> <b>negotiated</b> curriculum was hectic schedules of the postgraduate students. The major implication <b>of</b> <b>negotiated</b> curriculum is that it helps postgraduate students in managing their time to study and gives positive effect towards their learning strategies. The findings from this study will benefit students and also instructors at the same time through the implementation <b>of</b> <b>negotiated</b> curriculum in the classroom...|$|R

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his life}} Rupert fell in love with an {{attractive}} Drury Lane actress named Peg Hughes. Rupert became involved with her during the late 1660s, leaving his previous mistress, Frances Bard, although Hughes appears to have held out from reciprocating his attentions with the aim <b>of</b> <b>negotiating</b> a suitable settlement. Hughes rapidly received advancement through his patronage; she became a member of the King's Company by 1669, giving her status and immunity from arrest for debt, and was painted four times by Sir Peter Lely, the foremost court artist of the day.|$|E
5|$|All {{repair work}} on the New Orleans Arena was {{finished}} by March 2006, and a new scoreboard and video displays were added during the process. In June 2006, Shinn stated he {{was pleased with the}} ongoing recovery process in New Orleans and again reaffirmed his desire to permanently return for the 2007–08 season. However, the Hornets also announced that they were in the process <b>of</b> <b>negotiating</b> with Oklahoma City to play the 2007–08 season at the Ford Center as a contingency plan. The Hornets opened the 200607 season at New Orleans with a win over the Boston Celtics. They improved their final record from the previous season by one game, and again finished tenth in the Western Conference, three games out of the playoffs. Their attendance declined slightly compared to the previous season, and they finished 15th overall in attendance.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, SAS {{announced}} {{that it was going to}} reduce its commission to travel agents from 9 to 5%. Braathens followed, reducing from 8 to 5% from 1 January 1998. However, to try to attract more business passengers, the airline retained the 8% commission on their international routes. At the same time, the Government of Norway abandoned its old regime <b>of</b> <b>negotiating</b> prices with the airlines for state-employed civil servants' flights. Instead, they introduced an annual tender for the routes. It was awarded to SAS, who also won all subsequent tenders. For Braathens SAFE, this meant that state-employed civil servants only flew on routes where SAS did not fly. The contract was worth NOK500 million for SAS.|$|E

According to the official history of the ASTP, Lunney's performance during Apollo 13 and during the Soviet negotiations had recommended him to Chris Kraft, who was by then director of Johnson Space Center. In 1973, Lunney became manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, a position which gave him {{responsibility for the}} Apollo spacecraft used during Skylab missions, as well giving him more authority in his role as head of the ASTP.|$|E
5|$|Romney used a {{bully pulpit}} {{approach}} towards promoting his agenda, staging well-organized media events to appeal {{directly to the}} public rather than pushing his proposals in behind-doors sessions with the state legislature. He dealt with a public crisis of confidence in Boston's Big Dig project– that followed a fatal ceiling collapse in 2006– by wresting control of the project from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. After two years <b>of</b> <b>negotiating</b> the state's participation in the landmark Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that instituted a cap-and-trade arrangement for power plant emissions in the Northeast, Romney pulled Massachusetts out of the initiative shortly before its signing in December 2005, citing a lack of cost limits for industry.|$|E
5|$|The process <b>of</b> <b>negotiating</b> {{the actual}} {{arrangements}} {{turned out to}} be difficult and lasted from 1563 to 1569, with the Lithuanian magnates, worried about losing their dominant position, being at times uncooperative. It took Sigismunt II's unilateral declaration of the incorporation into the Polish Crown of substantial disputed border regions, including most of Lithuanian Ukraine, to make the Lithuanian magnates rejoin the process, and participate in the swearing of the act of the Union of Lublin on July 1, 1569. Lithuania for the near future was becoming more secure on the eastern front. It's increasingly Polonized nobility made in the coming centuries great contributions to the Commonwealth's culture, but at the cost of Lithuanian national development.|$|E

The imperial records, written communications between Gian and Định, and {{the account of}} the southern insurgency written by a resistance figure named Nguyen Thong support the contention that Định's guerrillas operated independently of Huế and in violation of its orders. The imperial records hold that Tự Đức immediately ordered the insurgents to disband, fearing that their actions were an obstacle to his plan <b>of</b> <b>negotiating</b> the return of the lost territory. The records assert that Tự Đức ordered his officials to prevent the insurgents from returning to independent Vietnamese land and to arrest those who did so. Messengers were sent from Huế into the south with the intention of discouraging the insurgents, rather than fomenting resistance.|$|E
5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season) and proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard salary cap (at $45 million per team) {{as opposed to a}} soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes. Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout. In May 2011, the NBPA {{filed a complaint with the}} National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing the league <b>of</b> <b>negotiating</b> in bad faith by failing to provide critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal labor laws. The union also considered the option of decertification, which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.|$|E

While Frank is in surgery, Claire helps guide Frank's vice president Donald Blythe through a diplomatic crisis with Russia. While Frank is receiving a liver transplant, she declines {{going to the hospital}} in favor <b>of</b> <b>negotiating</b> a treaty with Petrov, and strong-arms him into accepting the U.S.' terms. When Frank recovers from surgery, he agrees to let Claire be his vice president. He and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill {{for the sole purpose of}} creating an atmosphere divisive enough to pick off the potential running mates. In the ensuing open convention, they publicly endorse Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) for the job, while working behind the scenes to undermine her and ensure that Claire wins enough delegates to be nominated. Meanwhile, she reluctantly honors her mother's request to help her die. She and Frank then use the public sympathy from Elizabeth's death to win the nomination; they are now running mates.|$|E
40|$|This article explores {{literature}} on middle managers and the competing roles they play during implementation of change, and presents theory <b>of</b> <b>negotiated</b> order {{as a framework}} for further understanding these challenges. Theory <b>of</b> <b>negotiated</b> order highlights social order as emerging from the process of negotiation regarding how work is organized on a day-to-day basis. The article builds upon existing middle management studies by focusing on how roles are negotiated and, in particular, explores the negotiation processes through which middle managers move to manage competing roles. The article argues that management scholars seeking to use theory <b>of</b> <b>negotiated</b> order should focus specifically on characteristics of the negotiation context, as well as social and structural contexts in which order is negotiated. It is also argued that empirical research take specific contextual factors into consideration as well as be conducted at three levels in which middle managers negotiate order: new ways of working, negotiation within the self, and negotiation of boundaries in which middle managers can legitimately negotiate. This information could provide insight into why middle managers engage in the decision-making strategies or activities that they do, or why they do not take a certain course of action in implementing change allowing management researchers to better tailor management strategies to specific organizational environments. Although theory <b>of</b> <b>negotiated</b> order promises new insights into middle management challenges during change, the challenges associated with using this approach are also acknowledged and discussed...|$|R

5|$|Three more {{attempts}} {{to revive the}} plan were made after Operation Flash in early May, when Croatia captured a portion of western Slavonia previously controlled by the RSK. The first initiative, that began later that month, failed because the RSK demanded that the Croatian forces pull back from western Slavonia (which Croatia declined to do). The second attempt failed simply because neither party wanted to negotiate. The final round of negotiations where the Z-4 Plan was proposed by international diplomats occurred in early August, when a major Croatian attack against the RSK seemed imminent. Despite last-ditch efforts by Galbraith to persuade Milošević and the RSK leadership to accept the plan, disagreement among the RSK leaders allowed Croatia {{to claim that the}} RSK had no intention <b>of</b> <b>negotiating.</b> The Croatian delegation, which had little interest in the negotiations and wanted to lay the diplomatic groundwork for the imminent military operation, presented its own demands to the RSK (which were also rejected). On 4 August Croatia launched Operation Storm, defeated the RSK and effectively ended the political process which {{led to the creation of}} the Z-4 Plan.|$|E
