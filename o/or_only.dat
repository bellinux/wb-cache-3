5|$|It {{is unknown}} if Majungasaurus {{actively}} hunted {{their own kind}} <b>or</b> <b>only</b> scavenged their carcasses. However, some researchers have noted that modern Komodo monitors sometimes kill each other when competing for access to carcasses. The lizards will then proceed to cannibalize the remains of their rivals, which may suggest similar behavior in Majungasaurus and other theropods.|$|E
5|$|People who are {{asymptomatic}} (for instance, those diagnosed through {{family screening}} <b>or</b> <b>only</b> {{as a result}} of abnormal test results) are generally treated, as the copper accumulation may cause long-term damage in the future.

(2015) {{found that}} among modern archosaurs (the group {{including}} birds, crocodilians, and dinosaurs), the porosity of eggshells {{can be used}} to accurately predict whether the eggs are buried or laid in open nests. They concluded that Macroolithus nests were either open <b>or</b> <b>only</b> partially covered with vegetation. The eggs' blue-green coloration could have acted as a camouflage to hide the nest from predators.|$|E

5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of nausea, vomiting, a pale appearance, and sweating. However, patients often have no specific symptoms <b>or</b> <b>only</b> mild symptoms in the first 24hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in the course of poisoning.|$|E

5|$|A coronet {{of eleven}} pearls denotes a baron's arms in Sweden (the ancient nobility does {{also have the}} right to have the baronet crown by tradition), which also {{typically}} includes two barred helmets, each wearing this coronet, and a third such coronet is placed above the shield, although some baronial arms feature three helmets <b>or</b> <b>only</b> one, and not every baron uses supporters. A Swedish Greve (Count) bears three barred helmets, each crowned with a coronet showing five leaves, and supporters are usually—though not always—present. The arms of Swedish counts also, from the late 17th century, began using manteaux (see the Greater Coat of Arms of Sweden, pictured above) in place of the traditional mantling, although this practice has since been deprecated. Untitled nobility (others granted noble status by letters patent) also bore a barred helm and a coronet showing two pearls between three leaves.|$|E

5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver to current reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, <b>or</b> <b>only</b> one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the war began, the Chartered Company formed the Rhodesian Reserves, an {{amorphous}} entity intended to accommodate the many white men who were keen to put on uniform, as well as to make a start towards organising what might eventually become an expeditionary force. Eminent citizens and elected leaders formed their own platoons, each bringing 24 volunteers; three or four of these 25-man troops made a company. Units representing the Caledonian Society, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Society, the Legion of Frontiersmen and other local organisations mirrored the Pals battalions in Britain. Volunteers could opt to serve overseas, within Rhodesia <b>or</b> <b>only</b> locally; around 1,000 had volunteered in all by 13 August.|$|E
5|$|All these {{distributions}} have no <b>or</b> <b>only</b> {{minor changes}} {{when compared with}} the original FreeBSD base system. The main difference to the original FreeBSD is that they come with pre-installed and pre-configured software for specific use cases. This can be compared with Linux distributions, which are all binary compatible because they use the same kernel and also use the same basic tools, compilers and libraries, while coming with different applications, configurations and branding.|$|E

5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, <b>or</b> <b>only</b> to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|As the Laws were {{formulated}} in England, and were initially administered solely {{by the four}} British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units.

Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, <b>or</b> <b>only</b> after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
