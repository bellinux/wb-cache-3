40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the types of accidents or incidents that are most important to the aviation safety risk. All accidents and incidents from 2001 - 2010 were assigned <b>occurrence</b> <b>categories</b> based on the taxonomy developed by the Commercial Aviation Safety Team/International Civil Aviation Organization (CAST/ICAO) Common Taxonomy Team (CICTT). The most frequently recorded categories were selected within each of five metrics: total accidents, fatal accidents, total injuries, fatal injuries and total incidents. This analysis was done separately for events within Part 121, Scheduled Part 135, Non-Scheduled Part 135 and Part 91. Combining those five sets of categories resulted in groups of between seven and eleven <b>occurrence</b> <b>categories,</b> depending on the flight operation. These groups represent 65 - 85 % of all accidents and 68 - 81 % of incidents...|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{temporal}} variability of fish species abundance, {{the need for}} lists of fish species which are interesting to divers {{is important for the}} tourist industry. Accurate predictions of temporal species composition within fish assemblages have been very difficult to make because the occurrence of a species is governed by variables including recruitment, biological associations, food and habitat specificity, and predator–prey relationships. The present study reduces temporal variability by placing fish into species <b>occurrence</b> <b>categories,</b> and shows that data based on 20 – 25 surveys is needed when using either an AM or a GM method (assuming K =  4) to identify the common species at dive spots. Common fish species are the most temporally stable, and thus are more appropriate for attracting divers.|$|R
40|$|Usually {{aviation}} {{accidents are}} categorized and analyzed within flight conduct rules (Part 121, Part 135, Part 91) because differences in accident rates within flight rules have been demonstrated. Even {{within a particular}} flight rule the flights have different purposes. For many, Part 121 flights are synonymous with scheduled passenger transport, and indeed {{this is the largest}} group of Part 121 accidents. But there are also non-scheduled (charter) passenger transport and cargo flights. The primary purpose of the analysis reported here is to examine the differences in aviation accidents based on the purpose of the flight. Some of the factors examined are the accident severity, aircraft characteristics and accident <b>occurrence</b> <b>categories.</b> Twenty consecutive years of data were available and utilized to complete this analysis...|$|R
40|$|Bird {{sighting}} {{records from}} 1964 through 1978 for 17 northeastern Arkansas counties were compiled {{according to the}} seasonal status, relative abundance and habitat distribution of each species. The five seasonal <b>occurrence</b> <b>categories</b> and their relative species composition were: transient visitant (46. 6 %), summer resident (20. 3 %), winter resident (14. 8 %), permanent resident (17. 2 %) and winter visitant (1. 0 %). The seven seasonal abundance categories and their relative species composition were: very rare (13. 9 %), rare 15. 9 %), uncommon (30. 7 %), fairly common (10. 5 %), common (25. 6 %), very common (1. 7 %) and abundant (1. 7 %). Eleven habitat categories were included: campestrian, abandoned fields, forest edge, lowland woods, upland woods, riparian woods, marshes, mud flats, flooded fields, lakes and ponds, and edificarian.

5|$|Placing the {{elements}} into categories and subcategories based on shared properties is imperfect. There is {{a spectrum of}} properties within each category {{and it is not}} hard to find overlaps at the boundaries, as is the case with most classification schemes. Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or post-transition metal. Radon is classified as a nonmetal and a noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is more characteristic of a metal. Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of {{the elements}} into mineralogical <b>occurrence</b> <b>categories,</b> or crystalline structures. Categorizing the elements in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when Hinrichs wrote that simple boundary lines could be drawn on the periodic table to show elements having like properties, such as the metals and the nonmetals, or the gaseous elements.|$|R
40|$|Civilian {{aircraft}} {{are available in}} a variety of sizes, engine types, construction materials and instrumentation complexity. For the analysis reported here, eleven aircraft categories were developed based mostly on aircraft size and engine type, and these categories were applied to twenty consecutive years of civil aviation accidents. Differences in various factors were examined among these aircraft types, including accident severity, pilot characteristics and accident <b>occurrence</b> <b>categories.</b> In general, regional jets and very light sport aircraft had the lowest rates of adverse outcomes (injuries, fatal accidents, aircraft destruction, major accidents), while aircraft with twin (piston) engines or with a single (piston) engine and retractable landing gear carried the highest incidence of adverse outcomes. The accident categories of abnormal runway contact, runway excursions and non-powerplant system/component failures occur frequently within all but two or three aircraft types. In contrast, ground collisions, loss of control - on ground/water and powerplant system/component failure occur frequently within only one or two aircraft types. Although accidents in larger aircraft tend to have less severe outcomes, adverse outcome rates also differ among accident categories. It may be that the type of accident has as much or more influence on the outcome as the type of aircraft...|$|R

30|$|The climatically {{controlled}} variability {{apparent in}} the longer-term records suggests that the true natural variability of TCs is composed of discrete periods of time with different frequency probabilities. Hence, the period between 1400 and 1650 C.E. along the N.E. USA coast {{must have had a}} higher probability of occurrence of the more extreme events than the centuries before and after. Likewise, the period from approximately 1400 to 1800 C.E. along the N.E. Australian coast also had a higher probability of <b>occurrence</b> of <b>category</b> 4 and 5 TCs making landfall than the present day.

40|$|Poland, as {{a member}} of the EU, is {{represented}} within the ICAO, by the European Aviation Safety Agency. However, this does not relieve our country from the responsibility of developing a state safety programme (SSP). The need to set up such a programme, which has to be specific to every country involved in aviation operation, was introduced by the ICAO’s Annex 19. One of the important points in Annex 19 is: “ 5. 2. 1 Each State shall establish and maintain a safety database to facilitate the effective analysis of information on actual or potential safety deficiencies obtained, including that from its incident reporting systems, and to determine any actions required for the enhancement of safety”. The Polish Civil Aviation Authority, along with other databases, manages the European Coordination Centre for Aviation Incident Reporting Systems (ECCAIRS). The authors (who are specialists dealing with exploitation processes in aviation) have conducted a laborious processing of the data contained in the ECCAIRS database, analysing them based on various criteria: aviation <b>occurrence</b> <b>categories</b> (as defined by the ICAO), phases of flight for different airports in Poland etc. Aircraft with an maximum take-off mass (MTOM) 5, 700 kg (commercial aviation) were considered separately. It was found that the most events are those that relate to power plant (SCF-PP) airframes and related system (SCF-NP) failures, followed by collisions with birds (BIRD), events related to airports (ADRM) and events related to the required separation of aircraft (MAC). For lighter aircraft, the dominant categories are ARC, CTOL, GTOW and LOC-I events. The article presents a proposed method for predicting the number of events, determining the alert levels for the next years and assuming a normal distribution (Gaussian). It is one of the first attempts to use actual data contained in the database of events on airports in Poland. The results of this analysis may support the decisions of supervisory authorities in the areas where security threats are most important...|$|R

The research articles have been collected from the bibliographic database of INSPEC. The keywords are indexed to critically examine its physical structure that is composed of three fundamental kernels, viz. keyphrase, modulator and qualifier. The keyphrase reflects the central concept, which is usually post-coordinated by the modulator to amend the central concept in accordance with the relevant context.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} fifth graders 2 ̆ 7 written responses to literature in dialogue journals. ^ Sixteen picture books from four different genres (fantasy, traditional literature, contemporary realistic fiction, and historical fiction) were read to twenty-three fifth graders. Students were asked to respond to the books in dialogue journals. ^ Pretest and posttest writing instruments, adapted from Diederich 2 ̆ 7 s (1974) analytical scale, were used to determine changes in writing after the dialogue journal process. Four raters scored the pretest and posttest writings, and analysis of variance was utilized to determine differences in the writings by sex and time. A significant interaction was found. Girls scored significantly higher on the pretest than the posttest. T-tests were conducted to determine significant differences between boys and girls both in the pretest and posttest. The girls scored significantly higher than the boys on the pretest. ^ Both the pretest and posttest writings, as well as the dialogue journal entries, were examined in terms of the percentage of T-units (Hunt, 1965) of the Purves - Rippere (1968) categories of response (engagement, perception, interpretation, evaluation, and miscellaneous comments). A T-test was utilized to compare the frequency of <b>occurrence</b> of the <b>categories</b> in the pretest and posttest writings. A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to determine any significant frequency of occurrence of the Purves - Rippere (1968) categories in the dialogue journal entries within the four different genres of books read to the children. Frequencies of occurrence were significantly different for all categories, as determined by a Tukey (1977) test. In order of frequency of <b>occurrence,</b> these <b>categories</b> were engagement, evaluation, perception, interpretation, and miscellaneous statements. This was the order for all genres except fantasy, where miscellaneous comments were fourth in order of occurrence and interpretation was last. ^ It was concluded that the dialogue journals had been effective in eliciting more engagement responses, but students had not shown significant gains in their overall writing, as measured by the pretest and posttest. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{complexity}} of software systems, defects are inevitable. Understanding the types of defects could help developers to adopt measures in current and future software releases. In practice, developers often categorize defects into various types.

In general, {{there are two types of}} defect based fault triggering conditions, Bohrbug and Mandelbug. Bohrbug refers to a bug which can be easily isolated, and its activation and error propagation is simple. Mandelbug refers to a bug whose activation and/or error propagation is complex (e. g., a time lag between the fault activation and the failure <b>occurrence).</b> With these <b>category</b> labels, developers can better perform post-mortem analysis to identify common characteristic of the defects, and design specifi...|$|R
