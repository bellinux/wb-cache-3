5000|$|The Latin American {{branch of}} Christian Communist Liberation Theology, {{according}} to theologians such as Leonardo Boff; {{is rooted in}} the concept that [...] "prudence is the understanding of situations of radical crisis". Among Christian Communists, Historical Materialism is utilised as a methodology of analysis to define the nature of the crisis in question as a product of political-economic dynamics and modalities derived from the workings of what is termed [...] "the late capitalist/imperialist mode of production". According to this subset of Liberation Theology, the challenge for the Christian Communist is then to define what it means (in context of [...] "a concrete analysis of the concrete social reality"), to affirm a [...] "preferential option for the poor and oppressed" [...] as Praxis (active theory), and as commanded by an ethics allegedly [...] "rooted in the beatidic teachings of Jesus". Christian Communist Liberation Theology is not about evangelization per se, but rather about developing an <b>Orthopraxis</b> (ethical action; The condition of coming to the light by doing the works of God), that aims to reconcile the [...] "Beatidic Ethics" [...] of Jesus, as expoused in the Sermon on the Mount; with existing social struggles against what is termed [...] "neo-colonialism" [...] or [...] "Late Capitalism". Both Christian Communism and Liberation Theology stress [...] "orthopraxis" [...] over [...] "orthodoxy". A narrative of the nature of contemporary social struggles is developed via [...] "materialist analysis" [...] utilising historiographic concepts developed by Karl Marx. A concrete example are the Paraguayan Sin Tierra (landless) movement, who engage in direct land seizures and the establishment of socialized agricultural cooperative production in asentamientos. The contemporary Paraguayan Sin Tierra operate in a very similar manner as that of the reformation era Diggers.

50|$|The correct {{practice}} of rituals, or <b>orthopraxis</b> {{was essential to}} currying favor of the gods.

Any civilians in attendance would wear togas with a hood over their heads while the presider was bareheaded, often with a laurel wreath on his head for distinction. In live sacrifices, only domestic religion in ancient Rome were used. These animals were cleaned and often decorated with ribbons or garlands with colors dependent on the god or goddess for whom they were intended. The Romans would also use fruit and grains in public ceremonies as well as libations or drinks. These inanimate sacrifices were not less significant than live animal sacrifices, but rather they all served different purposes and went to different deities.|$|E

On the contrary, <b>orthopraxis</b> is to be considered the result of one being confident and full of spiritual enthusiasm (śraddhā). Resulting from śraddhā, <b>orthopraxis</b> represents something deeper than the Western understanding of it as ‘lifestyle’. One could say that the Gītā’s <b>orthopraxis</b> somehow resembles the Buddhist eightfold path, with the differences between the Buddha and Kṛṣṇa’s teachings representing mostly the different audiences they have addressed and their respective ‘doxas’ – the first addressing the orthodoxy of the āstikas (those who accept the authority of the Vedas), and the second, that of the nāstikas (those who does not accept the authority of the Vedas). The Buddhist eightfold path is usually classified under three main headings: panna or wisdom (1. right view; 2. right understanding), sila or moral activity (3. right speech; 4. right action, and 5. right livelihood), and samādhi or contemplation (6. right effort; 7. mindfulness, and 8. right concentration).|$|E

30|$|Although the two {{paths of}} pravṛtti (engagement) and nivṛtti (disengagement) {{used to be}} seen in Vedic {{tradition}} as separate and opposite, Kṛṣṇa redefines them as the two complementary aspects of the one discipline of <b>orthopraxis</b> rooted in śraddhā that he is presenting to Arjuna.k <b>Orthopraxis</b> is presented as a matter of an ethical choice, rather than a matter of a simple moral decision based on faith and tradition. The Gītā reminds us that the idea of ‘doxa’ is something of provisional and of relative value; something that should be constantly re-evaluated under the light and higher authority of ātman. This is shown in the Gītā through Arjuna’s legitimate and honest process of doubting. As a real psychological subject (Nara), Arjuna is going through many epistemic transitions, and struggles to realize the ideal epistemic subject (ātman), characterized by Kṛṣṇa (Nārāyaṇa). The Mahābhārata often refers to Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna as Nara−Nārāyaṇa, the nourishers of truth. While the Mahābhārata showcases the concrete field called Kurukṣetra, with Arjuna demonstrating his ability in fulfilling his deeds (pravṛtti), the Gītā exhibits his inner struggle to overcome himself and make his mind abide solely in the sacredness of the heart (nivṛtti). The Gītā unifies these two different paths of pravṛtti and nivṛtti.l Arjuna, the warrior in the external process, and Arjuna, the psychological subject seeking real knowledge, are unified by means of the discipline of the realization of ātman, rooted on śraddhā.|$|E

This act of approximating, or appropriating, the merit of a sacred site was not an unconventional departure albeit distinct in cause, process, and function. In India, usually the significance of smaller shrines or sacred sites of relatively lesser importance, in terms of associated myth, presiding deity, or thronging pilgrims, are boasted as ‘x’ (major pilgrim centre) of (locality) ‘y’, for example, ‘Kashi of Southern Andhra’ (Bharati 1970, 98) or there may be nearly a dozen sites across India known as ‘Chhoti Kashi’ (lit. Small Kashi), to extol them and qualify them at par with Kashi (or similar other sites of greater importance). Although Sahajanand Swami was remaking a sacred space in distance, his act was not intended to qualify Vadtal as ‘the Dwarka of Charotar’ or ‘the Dwarka of Swaminarayan Sampradaya’. With his authority, he was actually recreating a new Dwarka aloof of and immune to corruption and rapacity within the ecosystem of the sect which was no lesser than historical Dwarka for his followers. Thus, Dwarka as a place of pilgrimage in the verse of Shikshapatri can be tacitly supplanted by Vadtal as both centres accrue equal, if not greater, religious merit.|$|E

30|$|The Gītā and the Mahābhārata {{show how}} the {{people who suffer from}} egocentrism, being {{oblivious}} to the principles of the heart-philosophy (ātmic understanding), begin to indulge in lawlessness; with the result there is soon confusion {{about the nature of the}} holistic realm in which life itself takes place. Both texts exemplify that, although we are naturally aware of our own existence in the world, we are not always aware of the ātmic realm. One needs to develop the proper śraddhā and live a spiritual life to get ātmic understanding. In the Gītā, throughout its 18 chapters, Kṛṣṇa contrasts śraddhā with Arjuna’s whining behavior by introducing him to the discipline of orthopraxish known as niṣkāmakarmayoga – one should put one’s heart on the performance of one’s mission, without any ulterior motive or interest.i Arjuna’s initial state in the Gītā is to be understood as the true dramatic moment of the whole Mahābhārata – a point where all questioning necessarily leads to some sort of conclusion and practical engagement. Arjuna conveys a metaphysical, social, and political attempt to reach <b>orthopraxis,</b> and the Gītā represents that point of the Mahābhārata where all questions ask for some sort of resolution. The struggle between war and peace represents the moment and opportunity to think again about the meaning of life, law, family ties, righteousness, and above all, the meaning and role of one’s own conscience in the larger social process.|$|E

This revival has fostered the Utsawa Dharma Gita (UDG) competition, or Festival of Sacred Songs, in which representatives from local and regional groups compete to perform textual works drawn from the Hindu scriptures. The UDG is held annually in Bali, and a national level competition, which traces its origins back to the 1970 s, has been held every three years since 2000.

40|$|Introduction. 'The Glory of God is {{a living}} person [...] . a church {{community}} fully alive. ' A modern paraphrase of Irenaeus' famous dictum or a rediscovery of a profound insight? Can we build a continuity with the relevance of modern day paradigms from how Irenaeus saw his world and how we see our world, especially {{as it relates to}} being human and experiencing church? Specifically, in Part I, we will focus on aspects of the historical, dialectical and, doctrinal ways of communicating how Irenaeus viewed personal salvation and the church as related to community and faith-lifestyle notions (what has been called the 'tradition' of the church and the 'rule of faith'). We will seek to incorporate recent insights in the sociology of knowledge that have helped reorientate our perspective on a communal ethic in the early period of Christian ecclesiology. In rediscovering his major theological paradigms of Life, Incarnation, and Deification through a 'church faith and community' prism, Part II will seek to draw out four modern aspects of this historical dialectic of Irenaeus' theology that are central to church as 'community' and integrally related to 'faith as lifestyle. ' Namely, what could be called his sub-paradigmal themes of: 'Creation and cosmos', 'growth education in divinity', the 'Body of Christ and the flesh of selfhood', and finally, the 'ecumenical freedom of unity as church ecclesia'. We will see how all of this is incorporated in a definition of what I call, the hermeneutical praxis, or <b>orthopraxis</b> theology of Irenaeus and his use of the 'rule of faith (truth) ' as generating a communal ecclesiology...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{theology}} of ritual in the Russian Old Rite; in the characteristic worship and piety of the Russian Church prior to the Nikonian reforms in the mid-seventeenth century which led to the Great Schism in the Russian Church. In the context of the lifting of the anathemas against the Old Rite by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1971, this thesis sets out from the premise of the wholly Orthodox and salvific nature of the pre-Nikonian ritual and rite. It focusses on rite as not merely a specific mode of worship, but as a whole way of life, an existential-experiential phenomena, and it examines the notion of the ‘art of Christian living’ {{and the role of the}} rhythm of the ritual order in the synergistic striving for salvation. It argues that the ritualised and ordered <b>Orthopraxis</b> of the Old Rite represents, in principle, a translation of the notion of typikon or ustav into the life of the laity, and constitutes a hierotopic creativity with a distinctly salvific goal on both the collective and personal levels. Herein ritual is examined as an iconic mode which recapitulates, in its own fashion, the theological premises of the icon, furnishing a mode of ritual iconicity which can contribute to theosis - an argument related to the participatory nature of symbols. This thesis therefore relates ritual to iconicity and symbolicity and, more broadly, to the theology of image in its anthropological dimensions. In the context of the notion of iconicity, ritual is seen as a performative mode which facilitates an inspiriting of embodied action, thus ritual is looked at in a pneumatological way. Through these arguments this thesis contributes to contemporary understandings of the Russian Old Rite and Old Belief and, more generally, to the Orthodox theology of ritual...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{assumption}} of this thesis {{is that there}} should be a theology of the laity that is truly positive, ecumenical and catholic. The prime concern, therefore, is less with specific contents and more an exploration of the dimensions such a new theology should incorporate and how it could be achieved. At the beginning we observe that, regarding contents as well as "hermeneutics”, currently most lay theologies are dominated by negatives. Therefore, I suggest we explore participation in the sense of "being the Church" rather than "doing something within the church”. Opening sections look at appropriate coordinates for a biblical foundation for lay theology, while a brief overview of church history explores how and why the current status quo of the laity came about. In view of this, the main parts then focus on how a more positive presentation of lay participation can be achieved. Part two explores Roman Catholic lay theology, discussing relevant official documents from Vatican II up to the present and also "unofficial" positions presented by Hans Küng, Karl Rahner, Leo Karrer, and Medard Kehl. To get at least some ecumenical perspective, this is complemented in Part three by an exploration of lay issues in Anglicanism, including ARCIC I and II. Part four explores the laity in liberative theologies, particularly their approaches to being the Church in the world, <b>orthopraxis,</b> authenticity as well as base communities as new forms of being church. In Part V, building on my earlier discussion and criticisms, I offer an alternative model for developing a positive definition of the laity including the image of the Church as a spoked wheel. My central claim is the inadequacy of present discussions and the need to develop a theology that starts from the vocation of the Church as a whole and stresses the interdependence of clergy and laity with neither subordinate to the other...|$|E

A theanthropocosmic Christo logy that captures the Shona holistic world-view is explored. The acme for a relational Christology is the imago Dei!Christi and the baptismal indicative and imperative. God is revealed in various manifestations of creation. Human identity and dignity is the flipside of God's attributes. Theanthropocosmic Christology as pluralistic, differential and radical brings about a dialectic between the whole and its parts, the uniqueness of the individual, communal ontology and epistemology, the local and the universal, orthodoxy and <b>orthopraxis,</b> Christology and soteriology. God mediates in the contingency of particularity. Emphasis is on life-affirmation rather than sex determination of Jesus as indicated by theologies ofliberation and inculturation. At the interface gender, ethnicity, class and creed, God transcends human limitedness and artificial boundaries in creating catholic space and advocating all-embracing apostolic action. Difference is appreciated for the richness it brings both to the individual and the community. Hegemonic structures and borderless texts are view with suspicion as totalising grand-narratives and exclusivist by using generic language. The kairos in dialogue with the Incarnation is seizing the moment to expand the view and to share the burdens, joys and responsibility in a community of equal discipleship.

The Christology that emerges from Shona women highlights a passionate appropriation that involves the head, gut, womb and heart and underlies the circle symbolism. The circle is the acme of Shona hospitality and togetherness in creative dialogue with the Trinitarian koinonia.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is based on a}} second-level-commentary called Dīpaśikhā (DŚ), "The peak of light", by Śālikanātha Miśra who is assumed to have written his treatises in the latter eighth and early ninth century CE. Śālikanātha belonged to the Prābhākara-school of Pūrvamīmāṃsā, named after its founder Prabhākara Miśra. Together with his rival Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, founder of the Bhāṭṭa-school of Pūrvamīmāṃsā, he stands for the "golden age" of Pūrvamīmāṃsā, when adherents of these sub-schools seem to have had vivid philosophical, exegetical debates amongst each other and with adherents of Buddhist and other schools. This study {{presents}} parts or chapters (adhikaraṇas) from the ninth book (adhyāya) of the DŚ in a first edition and translation. The chapters all deal with the question, whether and how mantras prescribed for specific Vedic rituals have to be changed in a new ritual context. The analysis of the passages reveals the following aspects: • Mantras, as well as “songs” (sāmans) and "embellishments" of ritual details (saṃskāras), may be subject to change after they have been transferred into a new ritual setting. • Only single phrases within mantras can be subject to change, the general proposition of the text remains the same. • The principles and rules expounded by Pūrvamīmāṃsā for structuring the Vedic texts, specifically mantras, help the specialist to determine the proper functional meaning of a (part of a) mantra within the ritual context. • On the basis of the functional meaning he can decide whether and how a phrase has to be modified. • Despite the system’s emphasis on "ritual pragmatics" the statements contained in mantras are not seen as essentially different from "worldly" counterparts. • The human aspect has to be accepted by Pūrvamīmāṃsā in this context, as it is the ritual specialist who determines the modification, ultimately led by his understanding of the meaning of the texts and situation at stake. • Like in other instances, the modification of mantras reflects the constant striving of the system to bring the orthodoxy expounded in Vedic revelation (śruti) to terms with the <b>orthopraxis</b> of an assumed ritual reality. While trying to establish rules to ultimately safeguard the unity and thus authority of the Veda, Pūrvamīmāṃsā here has to admit the human aspect into the system...|$|E
40|$|Keble, Froude and Newman's {{understanding}} of the Church in relationship to State and society is considered against an- eighteenth century background which, thanks partly to the Tractarians, has been painted in colours which portray Godlessness, belief in progress and the perfection of man with a tepid Church and a torpid religion willing onlookers. The Enlightenment was far more complicated than this caricature. Yet {{it is not always}} the accuracy of the picture but the supposed image which matters. In that sense, Keble, Froude and Newman shared the reaction of the Romantic Movement to what was seen as the prevailing Rationalist and Utilitarian spirit witnessed inside the Church by her powerful alliance with governments and political economists and outside by the united attacks from Roman Catholics, Radicals, Nonconformists and philosophers. Chapter 1 studies the political and social implications of The Christian Year, Keble's abhorrence of the 1832 Reform Bill and his sermon "National Apostasy". His views about Poor Law reform and the importance of Tradition are also considered. Froude's articles on "State Interference in Matters Spiritual", his influence upon the political and social outlook of Keble and Newman and the political significance of the posthumously published Remains are the themes of Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, Newman's opposition to Peel and Roman Catholic Emancipation in 1829, his attitude to the 1832 Reform Bill, his views on history in The Arians and the relationship of the Church to society are studied. His criticism of Peel in 1841, his views on change, development and progress between 1841 and 1845 and his final view as an Anglican of the Church as an imperial power are also considered. For Keble, Froude and Newman, the Church's mission to society was always spiritual with no thought of accommodation {{to the needs of the}} age. Saints are more important than reformers. The three figures studied upheld Tory paternalism in their concepts of the interrelationship between rich and poor and their detestation of democracy. Their {{understanding of}} the Church's relationship with the State, however, was different in that Keble was a critical orthodox thinker, Froude a radical catalyst and Newman a theoretician of profound development. They completely rejected the progressive spirit of Peelite Conservatism and brought to Toryism a powerful moral and spiritual temper, seen in Keble's perseverance in adversity, Froude's search for an alternative in Feudal times and Newman's advocacy of a transcendental, eternal and triumphant Orthodoxy and <b>Orthopraxis...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} is the Roman Catholic Church's {{need for a}} bit more aggiornamento in the ecclesiology of parochial ministry. The persistent priest shortage has been met with provisional solutions, harboring hopes that increased ordinations of new presbyters would replenish the altars now empty. The restoration of the deacon in the United States has resulted in ordination of nearly eighteen thousand older Caucasian men to a service more attuned to the subordinated liturgical diaconate that fell into extinction a millennium ago. Instead, I believe that {{the model of the}} first deacons called to serve by the apostles to steward the temporal administration of the church shows this order's true calling, as personified by the great service of their medieval archdeacon successors. The {{challenge is}} to draw from this history a theology intended for the diaconate, seek out its canonical limitations and establish a new ecclesiology ready for implementation in praxis today. In this work I will first explore today's challenges to ministry in the Roman Catholic Church in the United States and the circumstances surrounding the priest shortage. A brief quantitative analysis of the church and its ordained ministers will be contrasted to the sociological trends they paralleled. Then the historical church legislation and the leaders that influenced it will be examined to ferret out theological and canonical possibilities and limitations for the restored diaconate's service. Analyzing the ordination, approved diaconate functions, and possible roles in a parish where a priest is not serving as pastor will be addressed by investigating Vatican II Conciliar documents, the codes of canon law, and guidelines from both church wide universal law and the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops. In examining this history of the origin of the diaconate, its greatest success came in serving the temporal works of the church. The diaconate in theological and canonical terms suffers no divine legal blockades from being populated by a truer more experientially matched cross section of God's people in the pews. The possibilities for the role of the deacon in the future are married to the seriousness of the commitment to the permanence of its restoration; it is here that I propose the church must seek the theological possibilities for a more fully evolved sphere of ministry for the deacon and a canonical approach to a new ecclesiology implementing an ecclesiastical role for the deacon in the parish reporting to his bishop. The prescriptive elements will then seek out these supportive structures in order to insure beneficial <b>orthopraxis</b> in diaconal ministry. My conclusion is that the deacon can once again, as a phoenix rise or fall to ashes, raised by the ecclesiology of the Apostle's first calling of the seven to serve or left to fall as a subordinated solely liturgical order.

40|$|ABSTRACT Lori Anne Brown Duke Divinity School, 2015 Primary Advisor: Esther Acolatse Assistant Professor of the Practice of Pastoral Theology and World Christianity Secondary Advisor: Dean Sujin Pak Assistant Research Professor of the History of Christianity; Associate Dean for Academic Programs The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{challenges}} that Christian chaplains experience to their authority in secular medical institutions and to explore possible recommendations that can help alleviate them. More specifically, by means of a questionnaire this examination intends to explore if these challenges are both or either personal or institutionally related. Therefore, this examination should be a resource that encourages the Christian chaplain to be an informed interlocutor pertaining to the issues of what his or her God-given authority means. Lastly, this thesis will demonstrate why it is essential for chaplains to know, understand, accept, and embrace the God-given authority bestowed upon them to minister effectively and competently in secular medical institutions. Key Terms For the {{purpose of this}} study, seven terms require annotation. First, the term “Christian chaplains” refers to individuals who have been baptized, profess Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, who ascribe to the orthodoxy and <b>orthopraxis</b> of the Christian faith, and who minister in secular medical institutions. Second, the term “secular medical institution” denotes a public, non-religious institution that provides medical care for people. Thirdly, the term “living human document,” which was coined by Anton Boisen, refers to those to whom Christian chaplains minister. This group includes patients, their families and friends, and the chaplain’s colleagues. Fourth, the term “voices of suffering” refers to the patients who share their narratives while seeking pastoral care. Fifth, the term “bearing witness” refers to the belief that as Christians we are called to develop the skills to bear witness in both word and deed to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Sixth, the term “narratives” refers to the personal stories that patients share. The seventh term “holistic care” is a concept in medical practice that upholds and respects all aspects of a person’s needs: physical, emotional, and spiritual. I employed three methods in this thesis. The first method was exploratory research to review and study literature to support my argument. The second was to use a method of analogy. In this method, the anecdotal evidence was aggregated in correlation with personal related experiences to help Christian chaplains to learn how to minister effectively in the challenging contexts of the secular medical institution. Moreover, this was done in order to examine how the Christian chaplain can learn to walk competently and effectively with authority between the worlds of religion and medicine. Third, I used a confidential questionnaire to gather additional information from seven Christian chaplains who have ministered or are currently ministering in this context to support the argument of this thesis, as well as to offer recommendations that can help alleviate some of the challenges they experience regarding their authority. The basic conclusion drawn from the examination and methods employed is that Christian chaplains do experience various types of challenges to their authority than can impact their ministry. However, the conclusion demonstrates that as a result to their commitment to the call of chaplaincy, chaplains recognize that irrespective of the challenges they experience to their authority they are called to compassionately and effectively serve the sick and suffering. Moreover, {{as a result of their}} commitment to the call of health care chaplaincy, the chaplains have provided their insight that indicates why some of these challenges exist. Lastly, as a result of the questionnaire the participants provide some practical recommendations that can be implemented into CPE programs, which could possibly help alleviate some of types of the challenges they encounter to their pastoral authority.
