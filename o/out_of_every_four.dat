5|$|Gulfton {{residents}} are zoned to Margaret Long Wisdom High School (formerly Robert E. Lee High School), {{which opened in}} 1962 to relieve Lamar High School, with Lamar and Westside high schools as options. Most Gulfton high school-aged residents attend Wisdom High School. When it opened, Wisdom High School had mainly affluent white students; its demographics shifted to a mostly Hispanic and immigrant student body. In September 1991 Wisdom was one of 32 HISD schools that had capped enrollments, and excess students had to attend other schools. When Westside opened in 2000, residents of the Wisdom attendance boundary gained the option to attend Westside instead of Wisdom, with no free transportation provided. By 2004 three <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>four</b> Wisdom students were born to non-English-speaking households.|$|E

The American Association of Suicidology estimates that between 5, 000 and 10, 000 clinicians will have this experience annually. Yet, for even the most experienced clinicians, the suicide of a patient can have a long-lasting emotional impact. Personal and professional reactions may be both frightening and humbling for clinician survivors of suicide. (J Am Psychiatr Nurses Assoc [2003]. 9, 159 - 162.)

In this paper, we consider the challenges faced by the developing countries and the way they are overcoming them.

In the face of poor infra structural facilities that is lack of communication devises and personal computers, poor or no electricity in most of the rural areas, high call rates, costly line rentals and installation expenses of telephone lines for most of the population to access the Internet, unfavorable economic and political superstructures(high tax rates, un-liberalized import and export laws, monopoly in the ICT sectors by the governments), no laws and regulations to foster economic development that can and will sustain technology use and general ignorance among the users (Challenges) of the newly emerging information technology, it is interesting to know that a lot of developments are taken place through awareness, policy changes that have boost the confidence of the investors in the ICT sector, training and education of the citizens to use and maintain the communication devises (way forward) in the developing world. Internet offer several e-services. Users gain access to traditional e-mail and Web, e-government, tele-medicine, e-commerce applications such as e-business, e-employment, tele-conferencing/video conference, tele- shopping and advertisements, Banking transactions, investment opportunities just to mention a few.
