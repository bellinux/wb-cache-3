50|$|During World War II the Swedish {{government}} {{maintained a}} neutral (alternatively, defensive) stance and thus saw no priority in adding <b>offensive</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{to the air}} force. Despite this, a fairly large number of bombers and ground-attack aircraft served in the Swedish air force during World War II and after, possibly for intimidation purposes - in fact, after 1940, Sweden had more bombers than fighter aircraft.

AEW&C systems communicate with friendly aircraft, vectoring fighters towards bogeys, providing data on threats and targets, help extend their sensor range and make <b>offensive</b> <b>aircraft</b> more difficult to track, since they no longer need to keep their own radar active to detect threats.|$|E
50|$|In late 1944 the German army {{launched}} the Ardennes Offensive, {{an attempt to}} split the Allied army, recapture Antwerp and force a negotiated peace. Despite early success, caused in part by severe Allied supply shortages, particularly of fuel, the operation eventually petered out. This was the last serious attempt by the German army to regain the initiative on land, although the Luftwaffe launched one final <b>offensive</b> with 800 <b>aircraft</b> against Allied airfields in Belgium, the Netherlands and France early in 1945.|$|R

2500|$|On 1 April 1931, Rear Admiral Joseph M. Reeves took {{command of}} Carrier Division 2 (CarDiv 2), {{becoming}} the first carrier division commander in the U.S. Navy. [...] Reeves was also designated as Commander Aircraft U.S. Fleet. Carrier Division 2 initially consisted of the U.S. Navy's first true fast aircraft carriers, [...] and , as well as former minesweeper [...] which acted as an aircraft tender and guardship for the two carriers. Under Reeves' leadership, both carriers had previously distinguished themselves in two major naval exercises, the 1929 Fleet Problem IX and the 1930 Fleet Problem X, demonstrating the potential of aircraft carriers and their embarked air groups in naval <b>offensive</b> operations. <b>Aircraft</b> carriers from Carrier Division 2 became the first to embark U.S. Marine Corps aviation units when, on 2 November 1931, squadron VS-14M joined the Saratoga and squadron VS-15M joined the Lexington.|$|R
50|$|The Middle East Command hastily {{assembled}} a formation known as Iraqforce — {{which included the}} Indian 10th Infantry Division and the Arab Legion — and it arrived on April 18. There were two main British military bases in Iraq, at Basra and at Habbaniya, north east of Baghdad. On April 30, the Iraqi Army surrounded and besieged the isolated and poorly defended Royal Air Force base at Habbaniya. Although the base had no <b>offensive</b> <b>aircraft,</b> RAF personnel converted training aircraft to carry weapons, and attacked the Iraqi forces.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} <b>offensive</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{consisted of}} four RAF squadrons of Bristol Blenheim I and IV light bombers (27, 34, 60, 62 Squadrons), two RAAF squadrons (1 and 8) of Lockheed Hudsons, and two RAF squadrons of Vickers Vildebeest torpedo bombers (36 and 100). The Vildebeests were considered obsolete for the European theatre of operations. No 36 Squadron had some Fairey Albacore bi-planes. There were also two PBY Catalina flying boats of No. 205 Squadron RAF and three Catalinas from the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force at Singapore.|$|E
50|$|The {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, by the Japanese Imperial Navy using fast <b>offensive</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier forces wrought {{destruction}} on the American battleships there at anchor. This dramatically changed the strategic and tactical (doctrinal) {{emphasis of the}} U.S. Navy {{for the rest of}} World War II. Until the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battleship was widely accepted and held as the supreme weapon of naval power. The attack from aircraft launched by carriers made it clear that air power had instantly superseded the battleship as the primary asset of naval power. In the days after the Pearl Harbor attack, the U.S. Navy attempted to immediately reinforce Wake Island, and in another mission sent Vice Admiral William Halsey Jr. on counterattack forays on various enemy held islands.|$|E
500|$|The <b>aircraft's</b> <b>offensive</b> {{capabilities}} were sarcastically {{referred to}} as a [...] "Triple Threat" [...] — it could bomb you, strafe you, or fall on you. Positive aspects, such as the F-105's responsive controls, strong performance at high speed and low altitude, and its outfit of electronics won over some pilots. For some, [...] "Thud" [...] was a term of endearment; retroactively the RF-84F Thunderflash became known as [...] "Thud's Mother". F-105 pilot Colonel Jack Broughton said of the nickname: [...] "The Thud has justified herself, and the name that was originally spoken with a sneer has become one of utmost respect through the air fraternity".|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the British Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters had eight machine guns against {{typically}} four on the Messerschmitt Bf 109, giving them far greater firepower. The early marks of Spitfire and Hurricane had machine guns that were, however, of the [...]30 calibre (7.62mm) class, with less hitting power than heavier calibre weapons firing non-explosive bullets - the Germans' MG 131 machine gun, the Japanese Ho-103 machine gun, the Soviets' Berezin UB and particularly the [...] "light-barrel" [...] AN/M2 version of the American Browning M2 machine gun, all of the [...]50 calibre (12.7mm) size, became very widely used as primary <b>offensive</b> and defensive <b>aircraft</b> armament by the end of World War II.|$|R

The FAA aircraft were to form the nucleus {{of what was to}} become 830 Naval Air Squadron, providing Malta with its first <b>offensive</b> strike <b>aircraft.</b> Before June was out, they raided Sicily and sank one Italian destroyer, damaged a cruiser and destroyed oil storage tanks in the port of Augusta.By the start of July, the Gladiators had been reinforced by Hawker Hurricanes and the defences organised into No. 261 Squadron RAF in August. Twelve aircraft were delivered by [...] in August, the first of several batches ferried to the island by the carrier. A further attempt to fly 12 Hurricanes into Malta on 17 November, led by a FAA Blackburn Skua, (Operation White) ended in disaster with the loss of eight Hurricanes; they took off too far west of the island due to the presence of the Italian fleet and ran out of fuel, and several pilots were lost. A further two Hurricanes crashed, with one of the pilots rescued by a Short Sunderland flying boat. The arrival of more fighters was welcome. After eight weeks, the original force of Hurricane units was grounded owing to a lack of spare parts.|$|R

500|$|The Nationalists were {{supported}} by German and Italian units and equipment during the Battle of Madrid. However, the military situation in Madrid remained poor for the Nationalists, and both German and Italian aircraft (under Franco's direction) began bombing raids on {{the city as a}} whole. The Germans were keen to observe the effects of civilian bombings and the deliberate burning of the city. <b>Offensives</b> involving German <b>aircraft,</b> as well as the bombings, were unsuccessful. Increasing Republican air superiority became apparent, particularly the strength of the Soviet Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 aircraft. Historian Hugh Thomas described their armaments as [...] "primitive". Faupel, in November–December, urged the creation of a single German unit of 15,000–30,000, believing it would be enough to turn the tide of the war to the Nationalists. Hans-Heinrich Dieckhoff argued this would be insufficient, and that larger measures could provoke the wrath of the Spanish. Between late 1936 and early 1937, new aircraft were sent to the Condor Legion. Older aircraft were passed onto the Nationalists. By the end of 1936, 7,000 Germans were in Spain. The British estimated that between January 1937 and August 1938, 320,000 rifles and 550,000 revolvers were transferred to the Nationalists from Germany.|$|R
