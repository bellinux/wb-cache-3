Before 2007, the law in regard to rape and certain other sexual offenses stated that, if after the assault the victim and the perpetrator got married or entered into an informal cohabitation, then the punishment could be waived; if the assault took place between married or cohabiting partners, and following the act, the victim continued to live together with the perpetrator, then the punishment could also be waived. These provisions were repealed by Act No. 61/2007. Other legal changes which were made included the broadening of the definition of rape and other sexual offenses, and the raising of the age of consent to 15, from 14.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{examines}} the long-held belief that banking and commerce {{need to be}} kept separate to ensure a stable banking system. Specifically, the Article criticizes the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHCA”), which prohibits nonbanking entities from owning banks. The recent banking collapse has caused and exacerbated several problematic trends in U. S. banking, especially the conglomeration of banking entities and the homogenization of assets. The inflexible and <b>outdated</b> <b>provisions</b> of the BHCA are {{a major cause of}} these trends. Since the enactment of the BHCA, the landscape of U. S. banking has changed dramatically, but the strict separation of banking and commerce embodied in the BHCA does not reflect these changes. This Article argues that allowing commercial firms to own banks could lead to a more diversified and less risk-prone financial structure, and gives examples of possible changes and potential ownership structures that could reduce risks in the financial system...|$|R
50|$|The {{late 1990s}} {{and the early}} 21st century saw major {{modifications}} to the criminal code, {{in an effort to}} modify what was seen as <b>outdated</b> <b>provisions,</b> especially as Romania prepared to enter the EU. As such, homosexuality was decriminalized, the text of several criminal offences was modified by making it gender-neutral, the age of consent was lifted to 15 (applicable to both girls and boys), punishments for several sexual crimes were increased, and the stipulation that a rapist could avoid punishment after rape if he married his victim was abolished. Changes were made through Law no. 140/1996, Law No. 197/2000, Emergency Ordinance no. 89/2001, and Emergency Ordinance no. 143/2002. Nevertheless, the rapid adoption of numerous laws led to poorly drafted and contradictory texts, which have caused difficulty among the jurisprudence and doctrine, and several cases ended to the High Court of Cassation and Justice in order to clarify the interpretation of the law. Finally, a new criminal code entered into force on 1 February 2014.|$|R

40|$|Some {{statutes}} {{in operation}} today were passed {{a long time}} ago. Inevitably, through the passage of time, social norms {{at the time of}} enactment may now be unrecognizable. Two recent cases show contrasting approaches towards the interpretation of <b>outdated</b> statutory <b>provisions.</b> The first approach is seen in the Singapore High Court case of WX v. WW. That case concerned the interpretation of section 114 of the Evidence Act, a decidedly ancient statutory provision. The second approach was adopted by the Singapore Court of Appeal in AAG v. Estate of AAH, deceased. In that case, the Court of Appeal had to interpret sections 2 and 3 (1) of the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act, which was enacted some 45 years ago. All things considered, legislative reform of section 114 of the EA {{is the best way to}} minimize the trouble here.

40|$|The present-day {{law on the}} {{carriage}} of goods by sea suffers from a lack of uniformity and from being not able to adequately address the current developments in the industry of international shipping. The leading liability regime which is in force, the Hague-Visby Rules, consists of rather <b>outdated</b> <b>provisions</b> that Courts need to interpret accordingly in order to achieve the intended objects of the Rules: {{to strike a balance between}} the interests of carriers and shippers, and also to ensure that this balance is applied uniformly. The current thesis focuses precisely on the area of the obligations of the carrier over the cargo. The research aims at studying how the specific provisions regulating the carrier’s cargo-related obligations manifest themselves, particularly in English law. However, the research points also to how other jurisdictions address the problems discussed in the present thesis. These are, in particular, the bundle of obligations set forth in Article III rule 2 of the Hague-Visby Rules as well as how the same are applied in the context of specific issues such as the incorporation of a FIOS(T) clause in the contract of carriage; the stowage on deck, and {{the carriage}} of containerized cargo. Since the analysis extensively covers also the position under the Rotterdam Rules, the end results can lead to more comprehensive conclusions with regard to the need of a reform unifying the fragmented rules on carriage of goods by sea and, in particular, the provision governing the carrier’s obligation over the cargo...|$|R
40|$|This report {{seeks to}} {{identify}} the main obstacles that existing rules create for international cooperation {{in the event of}} disasters in Italy: It does so by looking to the Guidelines for the Domestic Facilitation and Regulation of International Disaster Relief and Initial Recovery Assistance (hereinafter the IDRL Guidelines) and to the EU Host Nation Support Guidelines (HNSG). The analysis seeks to point out solutions (mostly legislative ones) that may contribute to enhancing international cooperation in response to disasters occurring in Italy. The report finds that Italy has developed advanced and flexible disaster response mechanisms. Furthermore, Italy’s participation in international cooperation arrangements, notably the European Union (EU) Civil Protection Mechanism, reinforces the country’s capacities and preparedness. As of today, the country has seldom relied on external assistance, and when it did, international cooperation did not prove problematic. Indeed, it would seem that Italian law is generally in line with the prescriptions of the IDRL Guidelines and the HNSG, especially as concerns assistance originating from other EU countries. However, the investigation has also indicated three main problems {{that need to be addressed}} in order to ensure effective and accountable assistance in the future. In the first place, the institutional framework is fragmented: Numerous organs with different resources and powers intervene in disaster response. In the second place, it is not always easy to say what rules apply: There is a multiplicity of instruments that regulate disaster response, and their identification and interpretation is often complex. And, in the third place, some of the rules may hinder incoming aid: There are cases in which the law may prevent the provision of assistance or may discourage it by imposing onerous procedures and financial obligations. These problems can be addressed by fixing the flaws identified in the report, that is, by clarifying existing law, repealing <b>outdated</b> <b>provisions,</b> and introducing specific norms designed to regulate and facilitate international cooperation. To this end, the report offers recommendations for the competent authorities. International Federation of Red Cross and Red Cross Societie...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give a broad {{analysis}} of changes in the field of consumer protection law in the European Union over three decades. In 2004, the European Commission launched a project of reviewing consumer law in order to strengthen consumers’ confidence in the internal market and to encourage businesses to conduct cross-border trading. The EU consumer protection regulatory framework is based on directives including a minimum harmonization clause. This clause allows Member States to maintain or adopt stricter consumer protection rules and leads to fragmentation in their national laws. For instance, it was found that the notion and definition of a consumer has been designed for use by a specific directive, depending on which area is covered by the regulation of the personal scope. The definition of the so-called weaker party in a contractual relationship is understood in a narrow way, which is highlighted in the established line of the European Court of Justice case law. A brief outline of the history of the shaping of consumer protection policy in the European Union is presented to demonstrate how the problem of amending consumer protection law has evolved in the EU as well as increased in importance; this has been demonstrated in several programs and resolutions of the European Parliament and communications of the European Commission, which discuss the need to reform consumer contract law. The Proposal for a Horizontal Directive on Consumer Rights is the result of a review of consumer law acquis communautaire, referred to as the Consumer Acquis, and aims at introducing a full harmonization clause where feasible. Until recently, the norms governing the determination of the law applicable to consumer contracts have been defined by the Rome Convention of 1980 on the law applicable to contract relations. Due to its overly casuistic nature and <b>outdated</b> <b>provisions</b> relating to consumer contracts, it was decided to amend the Convention, which was changed into the Rome I Regulation...|$|R

40|$|Breking in die Karoo kan onmeetbare omgewingskade aanrig. Waar skade gely kan word, volg versekering. Beide saakversekering en aanspreeklikheidsversekering kan ter sprake kom. Versekering teen omgewingskade wat deur besoedeling aangerig word, bied unieke uitdagings. Jare kan verloop tussen die skadeveroorsakende gebeurtenis of handeling, die manifestasie van skade, en die tydstip wanneer die versekerde ŉ versekeringseis teen sy versekeraar kan instel. Versekeringsvestigingsfeite volg die stadiums van besoedeling en die gevolge daarvan. Versekeringseise kan op ŉ gebeurtenisbasis vestig wanneer die skadeveroorsakende handeling of gebeurtenis plaasvind. Waar die skade ver in die toekoms manifesteer, sal die versekeraar wat op ŉ gebeurtenisbasis verseker het, steeds dekking moet verleen. By die ingetredeverlies-basis sal die versekeraar wat ten tye van ontdekking of manifestasie van die skade dekking verleen het, aanspreeklik wees. Waar dekking op ŉ eisebasis verleen word, sal dekking geaktiveer word wanneer die versekerde sy skade geassesseer het en in staat is om ŉ versekeringseis in te dien, ongeag wanneer die skade veroorsaak is of manifesteer. In hierdie geval erf die versekeraar historiese eise wat tot retroaktiwiteit lei. Waar ŉ versekerde sy dekking verskuif van ŉ eisebasis na ŉ gebeurtenisbasis, en skade manifesteer eers in die toekoms, kan daar geen dekking wees nie. Probleme ontstaan met die toedeling van skade waar meerdere versekeraars op verskillende basisse dekking teen dieselfde risiko verleen, of by aanspreeklikheidsversekering ten opsigte van kousaliteit en bydraende nalatigheid waar meerdere daders vir die skade aanspreeklik is. Aan hierdie {{probleme}} is die afgelope twee dekades in die VSA en die EU-lande indringend aandag gegee. Die ontwikkeling van Suid-Afrikaanse versekerings- en omgewingsreg het egter nie hiermee tred gehou nie. Hierdie artikel bespreek die aard van die versekeringsvestigingsfeite en die problematiek van die praktiese toepassing daarvan, en ondersoek moontlike oplossings vir die komplikasies wat deur meervoudige of kumulatiewe kousaliteit en meervoudige dekking veroorsaak word. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, {{can cause}} immeasurable {{damage to the}} fragile Karoo ecosystem and water resources. The old adage that where damage goes, insurance is certain to follow, most certainly applies. Insurance against environmental damage such as that which will result from fracking poses unique challenges, for both property and liability insurance. Years often pass between the polluting conduct, the eventual manifestation of the damage and the eventual submission of a claim by an insured against his insurer. Experience in the United States of America has shown that fracking causes harmful substances to leach into the soil and into groundwater resources. A migration of these substances in the polluted water could, over time, contaminate areas far beyond those in close proximity of the actual fracking activities. These types of damage traditionally manifest only in the future, and potential civil liability claims and ensuing liability and property insurance claims could drag on for many years. This will undoubtedly be {{the situation in the}} Karoo. The purpose of this contribution is to sensitise potential insurers and their insureds of the risks and complexities of insurance claims against long-term environmental damage. These issues, specifically regarding environmental liability and damage claims, have been addressed extensively in the United States and in the EU during the past two decades, yet this has not been the case in South Africa. Jurisprudence on insurance claims in this field is meagre. The development of the law of delict, insurance law and environmental law has not kept up with development in other jurisdictions. This article examines the effect of insurance trigger theories and the practical effect thereof on insurance claims for environmental damage, which will surely follow in future. Issues pertaining to multiple covers, cumulative cover and the danger of a complete absence of cover are discussed. In the case of property insurance, different insurance trigger events that activate insurance cover follow the different phases of polluting events or conduct and the resulting detrimental consequences. Insurance claims for loss or damage can vest on an act-committed basis, where the insurer who provided cover at the time the polluting act occurred, incurs liability to pay out under the policy. The insurer remains liable even where the eventual loss manifests only in the future. In this case an insured has a claim against a historical insurer, which can prove to be prejudicial if the insurance company no longer exists, policy limits are insufficient and policy <b>provisions</b> <b>outdated.</b> Where a policy is issued with a loss-occurrence or loss-manifestation trigger, the loss may be claimed when the loss or damage caused by the pollution becomes evident, irrespective of when it was caused. In the case of insurance with a claims-made trigger, the policy that is in force at the time the insured has suffered and assessed his loss and is able to submit an insurance claim, provides cover. It is irrelevant when the polluting event occurred in the past or when the loss became evident. Insurance issued on a claims-made basis leads to retroactivity where an insurer inherits older historical claims, which can be prejudicial for insurers. Where an insured changes insurers and changes from a claims-made to a loss-occurrence trigger, and a loss occurs yet manifests only in future, the insured may not enjoy coverage at all. Other complications arise where more than one insurer provides cover against the same risk but on different triggers, or where various polluters contribute to environmental harm and there is a multiplicity of liability insurance policies that provide coverage. The allocation of liability between the different insurers poses a challenge for which clear-cut solutions in law are not always available. It becomes apparent that the loss-occurrence has in the past been a popular trigger, whereas insurers currently seem to prefer the claims-made trigger as a more practical alternative. No mandatory or general trigger theory is prescribed in South African law. The trigger that applies for a specific cover will depend on the intentions of the parties and the policy provisions. The trigger for each policy will be determined by the individual policy provisions, unless a specific mandatory trigger is prescribed by statute. It is trite law that a liability insurance claim will succeed only where legal liability, whether statutory, delictual or contractual, exists. For liability insurance, a claim could vest when the loss or damage manifests, or only later, when a liability claim vests with the prejudiced party. Another trigger could be where legal liability for the loss is confirmed by a court, tribunal or acknowledgement of debt agreement. The last moment would be that the insurance claim vests only once the legal liability claim has been paid out by the insured wrongdoer to the prejudiced party. It would take years to recoup losses under a liability policy where the cover under the policy is triggered by either one of these last two trigger moments. It appears that, in the absence of express policy provisions to the contrary, some countries, such as the United Kingdom and countries in the EU, acknowledge the initial manifestation of the loss or damage as the trigger where liability for progressive environmental damage is concerned. This position may be criticised because insurance cover is triggered before the actual legal liability for the loss that so manifests has been confirmed. No mandatory or general trigger theory is prescribed in South African law. Although the court in the case of Truck and General Insurance Co Ltd v Verulam Fuel Distributors CC acknowledged the moment at which the liability claim vests as the applicable trigger, the court qualified its finding that any of the other triggers could apply, depending on the policy provisions as agreed to by the parties. The viewpoint of Merkin that the preferable trigger should be where the legal liability claim is confirmed by court or tribunal or by acknowledgement of debt, can be supported. As with property insurance, multiple covers create problems regarding the allocation of liability of the different insurers. Multiple causation and contributory negligence also complicate liability insurance claims, which often requires ombudsmen, arbitrators and courts to follow innovative approaches to provide acceptable solutions. Insureds should, furthermore, note the danger of prescription, as a claim prescribes within three years from the trigger date. Because of the extent of these claims, it is important for insureds and their risk managers, insurers, agents and brokers {{to be aware of the}} risks they face in anticipation of claims relating to property damage caused by fracking. Risk managers are urged to launch due diligence investigations on the insurance cover available before disputes arise or losses and liabilities occur which may not be covered as anticipated. For the optimal management of risk, buy-back of additional cover by the insured may be required. To pre-empt problems in future, a call could be made for the introduction by authorities of mechanisms to regulate the liability for and the insurability of claims pertaining to environmental damage and the remediation thereof. The acknowledgement of a prejudiced third party’s direct claim against the wrongdoer’s liability insurer could also benefit innocent parties and speed up the process of effective indemnification. The introduction of mandatory insurance triggers, as well as mechanisms for the allocation of liability in the event of complications that arise from multiple causation and overlapping cover, can be supported for the sake of legal certainty. Finally, a call could be made from the outset to prevent damage to ecosystems that cannot be restored after the fact. [URL]...|$|R
