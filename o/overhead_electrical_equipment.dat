50|$|A fatal railway {{accident}} {{occurred on}} 23 February 2007, {{just to the}} south of Grayrigg. The derailment to a London (Euston) to Glasgow Virgin Pendolino express was caused by a faulty set of points controlled from the nearby Lambrigg ground frame. The points which caused the derailment, and points on the opposite line, were removed from the track following the derailment. The track is now welded continuously for 2.2 miles here, including the section over the Docker Viaduct. The <b>overhead</b> <b>electrical</b> line <b>equipment</b> had to be replaced, double-line catenary from a single stand being used.|$|R
