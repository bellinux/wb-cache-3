A {{battleship}} that cost two million pounds--and that fool Rigby said it didn't matter! Eleven hundred men went down. [...] . I remember now. We were sweeping up the North Sea like a net, with the North Atlantic fleet waiting at the Faroes for 'em--and not one of 'em had three days' coal! Now, was that a dream? No! I told {{a lot of people}} as much--a meeting was it?--to reassure them. They were warlike but extremely frightened. Queer people--paunchy and bald like gnomes, most of them. Where? Of course! We had it all over--a big dinner--oysters!--Colchester. I'd been there, just to show all this raid scare was nonsense. And I was coming back here. [...] .

5000|$|Bangkok police chief, Police Lt Gen Sriwarah Rangsipramkul, off-duty, in {{civilian}} clothes, and driving a private vehicle, {{was stopped by}} police at a drunk driving checkpoint in Bangkok in July 2015. He was asked to take a breathalyzer test. [...] "I rolled down my window and told them I hadn't drunk any alcohol, but the police volunteers said, 'you {{have to take the}} breathalyzer test,'" [...] Sriwarah recounted. [...] "I told them no five times, but the volunteers wouldn't give in." [...] This enraged the police chief who observed that, [...] "If those volunteers were quality people, and had some wits, they would have realized that I didn't smell of any alcohol. Eventually, I had to tell them who I was and get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>car</b> and criticize them." [...] Sriwarah said he later encountered a second checkpoint in front of the Criminal Court where a second group of police volunteers again insisted he take a breathalyzer test. He said the incident prompted him to order police officers [...] "to only select quality volunteers for traffic works, so that the people won't be affected." [...] In Thailand, refusing to take breathalyzer test carries a maximum penalty of one year imprisonment. The day following the incidents, Pol Maj Gen Thanapon Techatanon, a senior officer at Traffic Police Division, said he has ordered all traffic officers to familiarize themselves with their superiors to avoid similar incidents in the future. [...] "I have instructed all volunteers and police officers to memorize faces, names, and license plates of their commanders well, so that this mistake will not happen again," [...] Thanapon said.|$|E
