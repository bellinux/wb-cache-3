40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the absence of}} WCO effects in clitic constructions in Greek and Romanian. It focuses on wh-interrogatives and QPs and argues that, although the mechanism that causes standard WCO effects is uniform, the <b>obviation</b> <b>of</b> the WCO effect is not. Doubled wh-operators in Romanian and doubled QPs in Greek, on the one hand, and doubled wh-operators in Greek, on the other, show systematic differences; the former, but not the latter, show island sensitivity, obviate WCO effects only in a very local domain and exhibit a specificity requirement. These differences are best captured if we see the <b>obviation</b> <b>of</b> WCO effects in the former case as {{a side effect of}} clitic doubling and the absence of WCO effects in the latter case as an nstance of resumption. The proposal has consequences for an analysis of both clitic oubling and resumption and provides additional evidence in favour of a theory of binding in terms of logical syntax representations...|$|R

40|$|The {{strictly}} derivational {{approach to}} binding relations {{put forth by}} Epstein, Groat, Kawashima, and Kitahara (1998) apparently has difficulties in accounting {{for the fact that}} in certain classes of wh-movement and Antecedent-Contained Deletion (ACD) constructions, pronouns may occur in the positions from which they (apparently) c-command their antecedent R-expressions, without giving rise to a violation of the Binding Condition (C). The paper claims that this <b>obviation</b> <b>of</b> Condition (C) effects does not actually undermine the strictly derivational approach, arguing that it follows from the derivational properties of the constructions in question, given the Generalized Copy Theory (GCT), which states that not only Move but also Merge contains the sub-operation of Copy. The GCT allows the constructions to be created by multiple introduction (i. e., “recycling”) of given constituents: the original wh-element and its “antecedent ” wh-element in wh-movement and the “elided ” VP and its antecedent VP in ACD. This recycling is shown to {{play a critical role in}} the <b>obviation</b> <b>of</b> Condition (C) effects in these constructions...|$|R

40|$|Patients {{with acute}} heart failure (AHF) require urgent {{in-hospital}} treatment for relief of symptoms. The {{main reason for}} hospitalization is congestion, rather than low cardiac output. Although congestion {{is associated with a}} poor prognosis, many patients are discharged with persistent signs and symptoms <b>of</b> <b>congestion</b> and/or a high left ventricular filling pressure. Available data suggest that a pre-discharge clinical assessment <b>of</b> <b>congestion</b> is often not performed, and even when it is performed, it is not done systematically because no method to assess congestion prior to discharge has been validated. Grading congestion would be helpful for initiating and following response to therapy. We have reviewed a variety of strategies to assess congestion which should be considered in the care of patients admitted with HF. We propose a combination of available measurements <b>of</b> <b>congestion.</b> Key elements in the measurement <b>of</b> <b>congestion</b> include bedside assessment, laboratory analysis, and dynamic manoeuvres. These strategies expand by suggesting a routine assessment <b>of</b> <b>congestion</b> and a pre-discharge scoring system. A point system is used to quantify the degree <b>of</b> <b>congestion.</b> This score offers a new instrument to direct both current and investigational therapies designed to optimize volume status during and after hospitalization. In conclusion, this document reviews the available methods <b>of</b> evaluating <b>congestion,</b> provides suggestions on how to properly perform these measurements, and proposes a method to quantify the amount <b>of</b> <b>congestion</b> presen...|$|R

We detected several alternatively processed transcripts that could account for some of the revertant dystrophins and could not detect genomic deletion from the region commonly skipped in revertant dystrophin.
