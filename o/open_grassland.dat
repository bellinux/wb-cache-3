5|$|By {{the late}} Miocene, around 10 Mya, the bovids rapidly diversified, {{leading to the}} {{creation}} of 70 new genera. This late Miocene radiation was partly because many bovids became adapted to more <b>open,</b> <b>grassland</b> habitats. The Aepycerotinae first appeared in the late Miocene, and {{no significant difference in the}} sizes of the primitive and modern impala has been noted. Fossils of obivines, a tribe of Caprinae, in Africa date back to the late Miocene. The earliest Hippotragine fossils date back to the late Miocene, and were excavated from sites such as Lothagam and Awash Valley. The first African fossils of Reduncinae date back to 6-7 Mya. Reduncinae and Peleinae probably diverged in the mid-Miocene.|$|E
5|$|During the day, tammars {{stay close}} to scrub for shade and move out to more <b>open</b> <b>grassland</b> by nightfall. Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. They are known to both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they {{commonly}} drop leaves when chewing on them. When eating large leaves, tammars handle them with their forelimbs. This species spends more time chewing its food than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants.|$|E

5|$|Whilst the Mont Blanc massif {{does not}} contain any species that are endemic to it, there are many rare and legally {{protected}} species found within its four major habitat zones. These are the: montane forests, sub-alpine, alpine and nival zones. The major habitats are coniferous forests, moors, rock and talus slopes, plus glacial moraines. The biological richness is further influenced by the {{different aspects of the}} faces, by the geology, and by the influence of man on the lower and middle slopes where forest clearance has created <b>open</b> <b>grassland.</b> The native forest habitats are essential for the survival of many species, with the key conifer species including larch, pine, stone pine and red pine.|$|E
5|$|Roxy Ann Peak's high {{biodiversity}} {{is due to}} {{its wide}} range of elevations and its location between the Cascade, Klamath, and Eastern Cascade ecoregions. The lower slopes of the peak support chaparral, oak savanna, and <b>open</b> <b>grassland.</b> Scattered California black oak, Oregon white oak, and Pacific madrone trees grow in these areas, as do sclerophyllous shrubs such as birchleaf mountain mahogany, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, buckbrush, antelope bitterbrush, and Pacific poison oak. Common grasses include blue wildrye and prairie Junegrass. Wildflowers including Southern Oregon buttercup, common yarrow, and Tolmie star-tulip also grow in these regions. At higher elevations, the vegetation transitions to mixed coniferous forest, dominated by Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, western juniper, and Pacific madrone trees. Shrubs such as common snowberry, bearbrush, greenleaf manzanita, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, deerbrush, and Pacific poison oak make up the understory of the forest, along with herbaceous plants such as creeping snowberry and Idaho fescue.|$|E
5|$|The wildebeests, {{also called}} gnus, are a genus of antelopes, {{scientific}} name Connochaetes. They {{belong to the}} family Bovidae, which includes antelopes, cattle, goats, sheep and other even-toed horned ungulates. Connochaetes includes two species, both native to Africa: the black wildebeest, or white-tailed gnu (C. gnou); and the blue wildebeest, or brindled gnu (C. taurinus). Fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago, resulting in a northern and a southern species. The blue wildebeest remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species, while the black wildebeest changed more in order to adapt to its <b>open</b> <b>grassland</b> habitat in the south. The most obvious way of telling the two species apart are the differences in their colouring {{and in the way}} their horns are oriented.|$|E

5|$|Tigers can {{occupy a}} wide range of habitat types, but will usually require {{sufficient}} cover, proximity to water, and an abundance of prey. Compared to the lion, the tiger prefers denser vegetation, for which its camouflage colouring is ideally suited, and where a single predator is not at a disadvantage compared with the multiple felines in a pride. A further habitat requirement is the placement of suitably secluded den locations, which may consist of caves, large hollow trees, or dense vegetation. Bengal tigers in particular live in many types of forests, including wet, evergreen, and the semievergreen of Assam and eastern Bengal; the swampy mangrove forest of the Ganges Delta; the deciduous forest of Nepal, and the thorn forests of the Western Ghats. In various parts of their range they inhabit or have inhabited additionally partially <b>open</b> <b>grassland</b> and savanna as well as taiga forests and rocky habitats.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Mustela, the least weasel is a {{relatively}} unspecialised form, as evidenced by its pedomorphic skull, which occurs even in large subspecies. Its direct ancestor was Mustela praenivalis, which lived in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene and Villafranchian. M. praenivalis itself was probably preceded by M. pliocaenica of the Pliocene. The modern species probably arose during the Late Pleistocene. The least weasel {{is the product of}} a process begun 5–7 million years ago, when northern forests were replaced by <b>open</b> <b>grassland,</b> thus prompting an explosive evolution of small, burrowing rodents. The weasel's ancestors were larger than the current form, and underwent a reduction in size to exploit the new food source. The least weasel throve during the Ice Age, as its small size and long body allowed it to easily operate beneath snow, as well as hunt in burrows. It probably crossed to North America through the Bering land bridge 200,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Because its {{coloration}} {{is similar}} to Bendire's thrasher, the two birds are easily mistaken for one another. The bill of the curve-billed is all black, while that of Bendire's is paler down to the lower mandible, showing a dark grey with a basal area that does not feature a stark contrast. The upper and lower mandibles of the curve-billed are curved, while the upper is curved and lower is essentially straight for the Bendires'. Although geographic variances for the curve-billed can make discerning breast patterns difficult, the curve-billed {{has a tendency to}} display larger and rounder spots overall on its breast, in contrast to the Bendires' smaller, more pronounced markings shaped like arrowheads. However, curve-billed thrashers can also present this feature. Bendires' typically have yellow eyes while curve-billed eyes are typically orange, but Bendires' can have variations that appear yellow-orange while some curve-billed eyes are red-orange, yellow-orange, or yellow. The curve-billed is heavier and is more likely to inhabit suburban regions; Bendires' are likely to avoid dense vegetation such as mesquite and prefers <b>open</b> <b>grassland</b> with scattered yucca or around hedgegrows in agricultural areas. The song call of Bendire's is said to be more melodic and continuous with a chuck, while the curve-billed is known for its whit-wheet calls.|$|E

5|$|The {{community}} that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised {{the area around}} 3900 BC, and {{the evidence suggests that}} they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled. Before this human incursion, the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation. During the winter, the flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and farming community with abundant fish and wildfowl; in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, <b>open</b> <b>grassland</b> for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood, and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit, and seeds. The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them to mount the enormous communal activity required for the task of stockpiling the timber and building the trackway, presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a dry period. The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced woodworking skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers. They also appear to have been managing the surrounding woodland for at least 120 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{people of}} the Fanno Creek watershed were the Atfalati or Tualaty tribe of the Kalapuya, said to have displaced even earlier inhabitants, the Multnomahs, prior to European contact. The valleys of the Willamette River and its major tributaries such as the Tualatin River consisted of <b>open</b> <b>grassland</b> maintained by annual burning, with scattered groves of trees along the rivers and creeks. The Kalapuya moved {{from place to place}} in good weather to fish, to hunt small animals, birds, waterfowl, deer, and elk, and to gather nuts, seeds, roots, and berries. Important foods included camas and wapato. In addition to fishing for eels, suckers, and trout, the Atfalati traded for salmon from Chinookan tribes near Willamette Falls. During the winter, the Kalapuya lived in longhouses in settled villages. Their population was greatly reduced after contact in the late 18thcentury with Europeans, who carried malaria, smallpox, measles, and other diseases. Added pressure came from white settlers who seized and fenced native land, regarded it as private property, and sometimes punished natives for trespassing. Of the original population of 1,000 to 2,000Atfalati reported in 1780, only 65 remained in 1851. In 1855, the U.S. government sent the survivors to the Grande Ronde reservation further west.|$|E
5|$|SH74 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-70 in El Rancho. Ramps from I-70 westbound branch off the freeway's exit 252 {{from the north}} side and cross the highway southwestward. Access to SH74 from I-70 eastbound is provided via U.S. Highway 40 (US40) a slight distance to the west. From I-70, the roadway heads southwesterly through El Rancho, meeting an intersection with US40 (Swede Gulch Road). The route heads westward before turning southwestward into a coniferous forest setting as a four-lane divided highway. The roadway turns westward where it meets County Road 23 (CR 23, Kerr Gulch Road). Evergreen Parkway passes Fillius Park to the north {{in the community of}} Hidden Valley, where the terrain is mountainous. After intersecting Bergen Parkway, which heads southwesterly toward Bergen Park, SH74 turns to the south. The parkway meets Squaw Pass Road and crosses the Troublesome Creek before traveling along the west side of Buchanan Park.
