Here, chemical analysis of Early Indian glasses would help Brill not just to determine the ingredients and techniques of production, but ‘to make certain broad generalizations as to regions or periods of manufacture’, and therefore to follow an object’s movement along the trade route (1987, 1). For the XIVth Congress, Brill conducted atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and <b>optical</b> <b>emission</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (<b>OES)</b> on samples of 38 glasses from India, and the success of his method was made clear when he was able to separate 21 samples away from those made in the Middle East and Europe (Brill 1987). Here the glasses were shown to have mixed alkali compositions, a feature that is ‘rare among glasses from more westerly sources’, and therefore Brill concluded that they had definitely been manufactured in India (1987, 4). Brill also collaborated with Mckinnon to conduct chemical analyses of some glass samples from Sumatra, Indonesia, the results of which would be the ‘first data of their kind from this island’ (1987, 1). The results of the study, which also used samples from Java, another important location for the Silk Road, were hoped by McKinnon and Brill to ‘stimulate a greater awareness of glass in the economy ... of ancient Sumatra and further new lines of research in the archaeology of the region’ (1987, 1).|$|E
