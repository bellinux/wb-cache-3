Marchant's main tactical responsibility was to look to the outside for impending attacks while Browne patrolled the inside.

The shows, which vary from twenty to thirty minutes in length, are performed adjacent to the Trail Dust Town depot, {{in an area that}} seats around 125 patrons. Most shows feature falls from the top of two story buildings, dynamite explosion effects and lots of [...] "rough and tumble" [...] choreographed fights.|$|R
5|$|Like other rails, the Crex {{species have}} {{a wide range of}} vocalisations. The males of both crakes have a loud {{territorial}} and advertising call consisting of a series of grating notes repeated two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> second for several minutes. The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, with its head and neck almost vertical and bill wide open. Calling is most frequent early in the breeding season, mainly at night for the corn crake, but in the day for its African cousin. The corn crake's call may be repeated more than 20,000 times a night, with a peak between midnight and 3am.|$|E
5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre {{is a thing}} of the past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number of cows milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|E

Taking amoxicillin once a day may {{be as effective as}} twice <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day. While less than 7 days of antibiotics have less side effects, more than seven days appear to be more effective. If there is no improvement after 2–3days of treatment a change in therapy may be considered.|$|E
25|$|Earth scrap is {{material}} that gathers {{around the base}} of the tree. It arises from latex overflowing from the cut and running down the bark, from rain flooding a collection cup containing latex, and from spillage from tappers’ buckets during collection.

Earth scrap is collected by field workers two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> year and may be cleaned in a scrap-washer to recover the rubber, or sold off to a contractor who cleans it and recovers the rubber. It is of low quality.|$|E

The regions elect their own officers and representatives to the General Executive Board (the national board of UE), including a full-time regional president. The regions coordinate work among the locals in their area, including solidarity, political action and union education. Several times a year the regions organize training workshops and other educational events through sub-regions – smaller geographic subdivisions.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after this}} agonizing pedicure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The {{bindings}} were pulled even tighter {{each time the}} girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated {{as often as possible}} (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.|$|E
25|$|After being flayed, {{the skin}} is soaked in water for about a day. This removes blood and grime from the skin and prepares it for a {{dehairing}} liquor. The dehairing liquor was originally made of rotted, or fermented, vegetable matter, like beer or other liquors, but by the Middle Ages an unhairing bath included lime. Today, the lime solution is occasionally sharpened {{by the use of}} sodium sulfide. The liquor bath would have been in wooden or stone vats and the hides stirred with a long wooden pole to avoid human contact with the alkaline solution. Sometimes the skins would stay in the unhairing bath for eight or more days depending how concentrated and how warm the solution was kept—unhairing could take up to twice as long in winter. The vat was stirred two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day to ensure the solution's deep and uniform penetration. Replacing the lime water bath also sped the process up. However, if the skins were soaked in the liquor too long, they would be weakened and not able to stand the stretching required for parchment.|$|E
