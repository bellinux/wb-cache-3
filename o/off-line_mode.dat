They are only distributed in the U.S. Payment occurs in a similar fashion to mag-stripe, without a PIN and often in <b>off-line</b> <b>mode</b> (depending on parameters of the terminal). The security level of such a transaction is better than a mag-stripe card, as the chip cryptographically generates a code which can be verified by the card issuer's systems.|$|E

This and other characteristics of IMAP operation allow multiple clients {{to manage the}} same mailbox. Most e-mail clients support IMAP in addition to Post Office Protocol (POP) to retrieve messages; however, fewer e-mail services support IMAP. IMAP offers access to the mail storage.

30|$|As {{we demand}} {{the ability of}} on-line response, we use our KWS system derived from the {{continuous}} Czech speech recognition system described previously. It {{can be used in}} both on-line and <b>off-line</b> <b>modes.</b> Another advantage is that this KWS uses the same parametrization and acoustic model as the continuous speech recognizer. The difference is in the language model and the vocabulary. It employs phoneme-based n-grams to model speech and build the filler model. Such defined fillers compete with keywords from the vocabulary and with the non-speech events and noises. The performance is controlled by language model parameters and penalties so we can tune the ratio between false alarms and missing detections.|$|R

Standard Chartered Bank was the largest user of Bankmaster - the company formed a spin-off joint venture with Kindle specifically to support its own deployments. State Bank of India deployed the branch platform, Branchpower to 2000 branches throughout India. The system allowed branches to operate in an <b>off-line</b> <b>mode</b> - this made it popular with retail banks in countries where the communications infrastructure was poor. The Bank of England and eight other central banks (mainly in Africa) used the treasury modules of Bankmaster.|$|E
50|$|The {{motivation}} for pre-estimate aggregation {{may be that}} no ground truth data are available. This may occur in situations where diagnostics {{does a good job}} in detecting faults that are resolved (through maintenance) before system failure occurs. Therefore, there are hardly any run-to-failure data. However, there is incentive to know better when a system would fail to better leverage the remaining useful life {{while at the same time}} avoiding unscheduled maintenance (unscheduled maintenance is typically more costly than scheduled maintenance and results in system downtime). Garga et al. REF describe conceptually a pre-estimate aggregation hybrid approach where domain knowledge is used to change the structure of a neural network, thus resulting in a more parsimonius representation of the network. Another way to accomplish the pre-estimate aggregation is by a combined off-line process and on-line process: In the <b>off-line</b> <b>mode,</b> one can use a physics-based simulation model to understand the relationships of sensor response to fault state; In the on-line mode, one can use data to identify current damage state, then track the data to characterize damage propagation, and finally apply an individualized data-driven propagation model for remaining life prediction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Monadic Constraint Programming {{framework}} leverages Haskell’s rich static type {{system and}} powerful abstraction mechanisms to implement an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) for constraint programming. In this paper we {{show how the}} same constraint model expressed in the EDSL can be processed in various modes by external constraint solvers. We distinguish between on-line and off-line use of solvers. In <b>off-line</b> <b>mode,</b> the model is not solved; instead it is compiled to lower-level code that will search for solutions when compiled and run. For on-line use, the search can be handled by either the framework or in the external solver. <b>Off-line</b> <b>mode</b> requires recompilation after each change to the model. To avoid repeated recompilation, we separate model from data by means of parameters that need not be known at compile time. Parametrization poses several challenges, which we resolve by embedding the EDSL more deeply. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{prognostic}} tool disclosed here decomposes {{the problem}} of estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of a component or sub-system into two separate regression problems: the feature-to-damage mapping and the operational conditions-to-damage-rate mapping. These maps are initially generated in <b>off-line</b> <b>mode.</b> One or more regression algorithms are used to generate each of these maps from measurements (and features derived from these), operational conditions, and ground truth information. This decomposition technique allows for the explicit quantification and management of different sources of uncertainty present in the process. Next, the maps are used in an on-line mode where run-time data (sensor measurements and operational conditions) are {{used in conjunction with}} the maps generated in <b>off-line</b> <b>mode</b> to estimate both current damage state as well as future damage accumulation. Remaining life is computed by subtracting the instance when the extrapolated damage reaches the failure threshold from the instance when the prediction is made...|$|E
40|$|The {{trend of}} making more {{profits for the}} owners, {{deregulation}} of the utility market and need for obtaining permission from regulatory agencies have forced electric power utilities to operate their systems close to the security limits of their generation, transmission and distribution systems. The result is that power systems are now exposed to substantial risks of experiencing voltage collapse. This phenomenon is complex and is localized in nature but has widespread adverse consequences. The worst scenario of voltage collapse is partial or total outage of the power system resulting in loss of industrial productivity {{of the country and}} major financial loss to the utility. On-line monitoring of voltage stability is, therefore becoming a vital practice that is being increasingly adopted by electric power utilities. The phenomenon of voltage collapse has been studied for quite some time, and techniques for identifying voltage collapse situations have been suggested. Most suggested techniques examine steady-state and dynamic behaviors of the power system in <b>off-line</b> <b>modes.</b> Very few on-line protection and control schemes have been proposed and implemented. In this thesis, a new technique for preventing voltage collapse is presented. The developed technique uses subset of measurements from local bus as well as neighbouring buses and considers not only the present state of the system but also future load and topology changes in the system. The technique improves the robustness of the local-based methods and can be implemented in on-line as well as <b>off-line</b> <b>modes.</b> The technique monitors voltages and currents and calculates from those measurements time to voltage collapse. As the system approaches voltage collapse, control actions are implemented to relieve the system to prevent major disturbances. The developed technique was tested by simulating a variety of operating states and generating voltage collapse situations on the IEEE 30 -Bus test system. Some results from the simulation studies are reported in this thesis. The results obtained from the simulations indicates that the proposed technique is able to estimate the time to voltage collapse and can implement control actions as well as alert operators...|$|R

40|$|Multimodal {{interfaces}} {{are used}} to interact with devices and automata using different channels of communication. In this context, the sketch modality {{plays a key role}} since it allows users to convey concepts and/or commands using freehand drawing (graphical domain) and/or handwriting (textual domain). The acquisition of the sketch modality can be performed using touch (e. g., touchscreen) or touchless (e. g., RGB-D camera) tools supporting the development of versatile and powerful interactive interfaces. Domain separation and sketch recognition are two fundamental issues of these interfaces. This paper presents SketchSPORE a novel framework designed both to automatically distinguish graphical from textual elements within the same sketch and to recognize freehand drawing as well as handwriting. The recognition processes support both on-line and <b>off-line</b> <b>modes,</b> moreover their processing can be suitably stored within an XML file to provide a means to maintain the compatibility between the framework and service and/or application targets.

Two reinforcement learning modes are considered: the on-line mode in which the interaction occurs with the real power system and the <b>off-line</b> <b>mode</b> in which the interaction occurs with a simulation model of the real power system. We present two case studies made on a 4 -machine power system model. The first one concerns the design by means of RL algorithms used in <b>off-line</b> <b>mode</b> of a dynamic brake controller.

40|$|An {{approach}} to fault detection (FD) in industrial measurement systems is proposed {{in this paper}} which includes an identification strategy for early detection of {{the appearance of a}} fault. This approach is model based, i. e. nominal models are used which represent the fault-free state of the on-line measured process. This approach is also suitable for off-line FD. The framework that combines FD with isolation and correction (FDIC) is outlined in this paper. The proposed approach is characterized by automatic threshold determination, ability to analyse local properties of the models, and aggregation of different fault detection statements. The nominal models are built using data-driven and hybrid approaches, combining first principle models with on-line data-driven techniques. At the same time the models are transparent and interpretable. This novel approach is then verified on a number of real and simulated data sets of car engine test benches (both gasoline—Alfa Romeo JTS, and diesel—Caterpillar). It is demonstrated that the approach can work effectively in real industrial measurement systems with data of large dimensions in both on-line and <b>off-line</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{critically}} {{reviews and}} intercompares land surface schemes (LSSs) {{as used in}} atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) to simulate soil moisture and its response to a warmer climate, and potential evapotranspiration approaches as used in operational soil moisture monitoring and in predicting the response of soil moisture to a warmer climate. AGCM predictions of overall soil moisture change are in broad agreement but disagree sharply in some regions. Intercomparison projects have sought to evaluate the LSSs used by AGCMs for both accuracy and consistency. These {{studies have found that}} different LSSs can produce very different simulations even when supplied with identical atmospheric forcing. As well, LSSs that produce similar surface results from present-day or control climates often diverge when forced with climatic change data. Furthermore, no single LSS has been identified that produces an adequate simulation of all of temperature, moisture, evapotranspiration and runoff. AGCM LSSs must resolve the surface energy balance (SEB) in order to compute realistic heat fluxes between with the atmospheric model. LSSs have been used with AGCMs in both on-line (fully coupled) and <b>off-line</b> <b>modes.</b> In <b>off-line</b> climatic change experiments, AGCM predictions of atmospheri...|$|R

Being able to identify an individual's vocalizations is important for classification and census, and relating this to a caller's geographic position can help give insight into behavior. Previous work using distributed acoustic sensing platforms has shown on-line automated event detectors {{can be used to}} detect and record only events of interest for off-line source localization. However, this approach risks the loss of useful data if the automated event detectors are badly configured. In this work, we describe the design of VoxNet, an end-to-end system which provides hardware and software support to gather and process audio data in both on-line and <b>off-line</b> <b>modes.</b> VoxNet allows the user to dynamically reconfigure the network in-field, analysing data using dynamically adjustable visualizers.
