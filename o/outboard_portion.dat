50|$|The {{airframe}} {{is mainly}} of metal construction. being primarily of 2024-T3 aluminum alloy with riveted skin. Components such as wingtips and fairings {{are made from}} glass-reinforced plastic. The fuselage is a semi-monocoque with vertical bulkheads and frames joined by longerons running {{the length of the}} fuselage. The wings are of a strut-braced design and have a 1 degree dihedral angle. The tapered (<b>outboard)</b> <b>portion</b> of each wing has one degree of washout (the chord of the tip section has one degree lower angle of attack than the chord {{at the end of the}} constant-width section). This allows greater aileron effectiveness during a stall.|$|E
50|$|Partial-span slots {{are usually}} found {{only on the}} <b>outboard</b> <b>portion</b> of the wing where they ensure airflow over {{that portion of the}} wing will remain unstalled at higher angles of attack than the inboard {{portions}} of the wing. This ensures the wing root stalls first and contributes to docile stall behaviour and maintaining aileron control throughout the stall. Using slots in this manner produces a similar result to employing washout on a wing, but through a different means. Examples of aircraft with partial-span, fixed slots are the Stinson 108, Bristol Beaufort, Lockheed Hudson, and Dornier Do 28D-2 Skyservant.|$|E

50|$|The {{first known}} attempt {{to address these}} {{problems}} {{took place on the}} platform where they were first noticed, the Douglas Skyrocket.

However, this was found to have almost no effect in practice. Nevertheless, a similar solution was attempted on the Boeing B-47 Stratojet where it proved considerably more effective.

50|$|On the {{earliest}} Pioneer Era aircraft, {{such as the}} Wright Flyer and the later, 1909-origin Blériot XI and Etrich Taube, lateral control was effected by twisting the <b>outboard</b> <b>portion</b> of the wing so as to increase or decrease lift by changing the angle of attack. This had the disadvantages of stressing the structure, being heavy on the controls, and of risking stalling the side with the increased angle of attack during a maneuver. By 1916, most designers had abandoned wing warping in favor of ailerons. Researchers at NASA and elsewhere have been taking {{a second look at}} wing warping again, although under new names. The NASA version is the X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing while the United States Air Force tested the Adaptive Compliant Wing. It is probably significant that none of the aircraft designed after those experiments implemented this type of control.|$|E
5000|$|The Chinese [...] "yuloh" [...] (from [...] ) is a large, heavy {{sculling}} oar with {{a socket}} {{on the underside}} of its shaft which fits over a stern-mounted pin, creating a pivot which allows the oar to swivel and rock from side to side. The weight of the oar, often supplemented by a rope lashing, holds the oar in place on the pivot. The weight of the <b>outboard</b> <b>portion</b> of the oar is counterbalanced by a rope running from the underside of the handle to the deck of the boat. The sculler mainly moves the oar by pushing and pulling on this rope, which causes the oar to rock on its pivot, automatically angling the blade to create forward thrust. This system allows multiple rowers to operate one oar, allowing large, heavy boats to be rowed if necessary. The efficiency of this system gave rise to the Chinese saying [...] "a scull equals three oars".|$|E

500|$|When A-10 {{full rate}} {{production}} was first authorized the planned service life was 6,000 hours.

40|$|Resolution of the ‘Paleomagnetic dilemma’, the {{discrepancy}} between large paleomagnetically determined dextral displacement of <b>outboard</b> <b>portions</b> of the northern Cordillera, and much smaller osets implied by mapping and stratigraphic correlations, is fundamental to understanding the tectonic evolution of the Cordillera. This paper presents structural orientation data from the middle Cretaceous Dawson Range batholith of west central Yukon and its wallrocks, and suggests {{that some of the}} ‘missing’ displacement may be found in intrusions. The elongate northwest-trending batholith has a margin-parallel foliation, a sub-horizontal stretching lineation, and records syn-intrusive dextral shearing. In country rocks adjacent to the batholith, north-trending lineations are deflected clockwise into near parallelism with the batholith’s margins; lineations from wallrock screens within the batholith are all aligned parallel with the batholith’s long axis. The Big Creek strike-slip fault forms the north-margin of the batholith and accommodated a minimum of 20 km of dextral slip. These observations imply that the batholith invaded an active dextral shear zone, accommodated shearing while crystallizing, and focused post-crystallization fault development. The batholith is conservatively estimated to have accommodated 45 km of syn-intrusive shearing. Collectively, middle Cretaceous intrusions of the northern Cordillera may account for> 400 km of previously unrecognized dextral displacement. # 199...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, both flap-wise and edge-wise natural {{frequencies}} of vibration of a variable blade length wind turbine are calculated.

40|$|The {{attachment}} joints {{are inevitable}} in any large structure like an airframe. Splicing is normally used {{to retain a}} clean aerodynamic surface of the wing skin. The wings {{are the most important}} lift-producing part of the aircraft. Wings vary in design depending upon the aircraft type and its purpose. The wing box has two crucial joints, the skin splice joint and spar splice joint. Top and bottom skins of inboard and <b>outboard</b> <b>portions</b> are joined together by means of skin splicing. Front and rear spars of inboard and outboard are joined together by means of spar splicing. The skins resist much of the bending moment in the wing and the spars resist the shear force. In this study the chord-wise splicing of wing skin is considered for a detailed analysis. The splicing is considered as a multi row riveted joint under the action of tensile in plane load due to wing bending. Stress analysis of the joint is carried out to compute the stresses at rivet holes due to by-pass load and bearing load. The stresses are estimated using the finite element approach with the help of PATRAN/NASTRAN. In a structure like airframe, a fatigue crack will appear at the location of high tensile stress. Further these locations are invariably the sites of high stress concentration. Life prediction requires a model for fatigue damage accumulation, constant amplitude S-N (stress life) data for various stress ratios and local stress history at the stress concentration The response of the splice joint will be evaluated. The splice joint is one of the critical locations for fatigue crack to initiate. In this study prediction of fatigue life for crack initiation will be carried out at maximum stress location...|$|R

The purpose of the aft-swept region is to provide a partial balance to pitching moments produced by the <b>outboard</b> forward-swept <b>portion</b> of the blade.

40|$|Pressure {{distributions}} on {{the wings}} of the F/A- 18 A High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) were obtained using both flush-mounted pressure orifices and surface-mounted pressure tubing.

Angle of attack strongly influenced the wing pressure distribution, as demonstrated by a distinct flow separation pattern that occurred between the range from 15 deg to 30 deg. Influence by the leading edge extension fence was evident on the inboard wing pressure distribution, but little influence was seen on the <b>outboard</b> <b>portion</b> of the wing. Angle-of-sideslip influence on wing pressure distribution was strongest at low angle of attack.

The CX- 100 blade was designed to investigate {{the use of a}} carbon spar cap to reduce weight and increase stiffness while being incorporated using conventional manufacturing techniques. The TX- 100 blade used carbon in the <b>outboard</b> <b>portion</b> of the skin to produce twist-bend coupling to passively alleviate aerodynamic loads. In the fatigue tests, the CX- 100 blade was loaded by a single hydraulic cylinder while the TX- 100 blade was loaded via a hydraulically-actuated resonant loading system called the Universal Resonant Exciter. The blades were outfitted with approximately 30 strain gages as well as displacement and load sensors. Both blades survived to cycle counts sufficient to demonstrate a 20 -year operational life. The CX- 100 blade failed at approximately 1. 6 million cycles because of a buckle and crack that formed and grew just outboard of max-chord.

50|$|A {{common problem}} with {{one-dimensional}} pinches {{is the end}} losses. Most of the motion of particles is along the magnetic field. With the θ-pinch and the screw-pinch, this leads particles out {{of the end of}} the machine very quickly, leading to a loss of mass and energy. On top of this problem, the Z-pinch has major stability problems. Though particles can be reflected to some extent with magnetic mirrors, even these allow many particles to pass. A common method of beating these end losses, is to bend the cylinder around into a torus. Unfortunately this breaks θ symmetry, as paths on the inner portion (inboard side) of the torus are shorter than similar paths on the outer <b>portion</b> (<b>outboard</b> side). Thus, a new theory is needed. This gives rise to the famous Grad-Shafranov equation. Numerical solutions to the Grad-Shafranov equation have also yielded some equilibria, most notably that of the reversed field pinch.|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} consolidates the {{aerodynamic}} sizing of an innovative tip brake. The innovativeness {{in the design}} {{lies in the fact}} that the tip brake, in the braking position, not only provides a braking surface to retard the rotor, but also spoiles the flow over the <b>outboard</b> <b>portion</b> of the wind turbine rotor lifting aerofoil blade. At the same time, in its non-braking position, when the flaps are inline with the main blade, it acts as leading edge flaps and trailing edge slats and thereby augments the power to consequently improve the performance of the rotor. The present report consolidates the aerodynamic design and analysis of the primary tip brake and spoiler flaps that has been worked out for the braking mode. The augmentation due to the presence of the flaps in the non braking mode has also been worked out. The loads during the braking (aerodynamic pressure / loads acting on the surface of the tip brake) have been quantified. The sizing was done for three configurations of the aerodynamic brake with different primary tip brake width (0. 6 m, 1 m, 1. 25 m and 1. 5 m). Finally, after intra-divisional discussions, the final configuration with primary tip brake width of 1. 5 m was chosen for further structural design...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: An active {{trailing}} edge flap system, actuated utilizing Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs), is developed in this study. PAMs were chosen as the actuation method because of several attractive properties, including: high specific work and power output, an expendable operating fluid (air), and robustness. Because of their performance, PAM are a potential enabling technology {{for a variety of}} next-generation aerospace systems. The actuation system developed here is sized for a full-scale active rotor system for a Bell 407 scale helicopter. This system is designed to produce large Trailing Edge Flap (TEF) deflections (20) at the main rotor rotation frequency (1 rev 1) to create large amplitude thrust variations that enable primary control of the helicopter. Additionally, the TEF actuation system is designed to produce smaller magnitude deflections at higher frequencies, up to 5 rev 1 (Nþ 1 rev 1), to provide vibration mitigation capabilities. The PAMs are mounted antagonistically in the root of each blade.

40|$|One of {{the major}} hindrances to {{expansion}} of the rotorcraft market is the high-amplitude noise they produce, especially during low-speed descent, where blade-vortex interactions frequently occur. In an attempt to reduce the noise levels caused by blade-vortex interactions, the flip-tip rotor blade concept was devised. The flip-tip rotor increases the miss distance between the shed vortices and the rotor blades, reducing BVI noise. The distance is increased by rotating an <b>outboard</b> <b>portion</b> of the rotor tip either up or down depending on the flight condition. The proposed plan for the grant consisted of a computational simulation of the rotor aerodynamics and its wake geometry to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} concept, coupled with a series of wind tunnel experiments exploring the value of the device and validating the computer model. The computational model did in fact show that the miss distance could be increased, giving a measure of the effectiveness of the flip-tip rotor. However, the wind experiments were not able to be conducted. Increased outside demand for the 7 'x lO' wind tunnel at NASA Ames and low priority at Ames for this project forced numerous postponements of the tests, eventually pushing the tests beyond the life of the grant.

40|$|This report {{details the}} work {{completed}} under the TX- 100 blade manufacturing {{portion of the}} Carbon-Hybrid Blade Developments: Standard and Twist-Coupled Prototype project. The TX- 100 blade is a 9 meter prototype blade designed with bend-twist coupling to augment the mitigation of peak loads during normal turbine operation. This structural coupling was achieved by locating off axis carbon fiber in the <b>outboard</b> <b>portion</b> of the blade skins. The report will present the tooling selection, blade production, blade instrumentation, blade shipping and adapter plate design and fabrication. The baseline blade used for this project was the ERS- 100 (Revision D) wind turbine blade. The molds used {{for the production of}} the TX- 100 were originally built for the production of the CX- 100 blade. The same high pressure and low pressure skin molds were used to manufacture the TX- 100 skins. In order to compensate for the difference in skin thickness between the CX- 100 and the TX- 100, however, a new TX- 100 shear web plug and mold were required. Both the blade assembly fixture and the root stud insertion fixture used for the CX- 100 blades could be utilized for the TX- 100 blades. A production run of seven TX- 100 prototype blades was undertaken at TPI Composites during the month of October, 2004. Of those seven blades, four were instrumented with strain gauges before final assembly. After production at the TPI Composites facility in Rhode Island, the blades were shipped to various test sites: two blades to the National Wind Technology Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, two blades to Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico and three blades to the United States Department of Agriculture turbine field test facility in Bushland, Texas. An adapter plate was designed to allow the TX- 100 blades to be installed on existing Micon 65 / 13 M turbines at the USDA site.

40|$|During {{maintenance}} troubleshooting for fluctuating hydraulic pressures, {{a technician}} {{found that a}} right hand aileron return line, on the flight hydraulic side, was ruptured (Fig. 1, 2). This tubing {{is part of the}} Hydraulic Flight Control Aileron Return Reducer to Aileron Manifold and is suspected to be original to the T- 38 Talon trainer aircraft. Ailerons are small hinged sections on the <b>outboard</b> <b>portion</b> of a wing used to generate rolling motion thereby banking the aircraft. The ailerons work by changing the effective shape of the airfoil of the outer portion of the wing [1].

WW-T- 787 requires the tube shall be seamless and uniform in quality and temper [2]. The test pressure for this line is 3000 psi, and the operational pressure for this line is estimated to be between 45 psi and 1500 psi based on dynamic loading during flight. Examination of the fracture surface found evidence of arrest bands originating on the inner diameter (Fig 3). Ductile dimples are observed on the tube fractures (Fig. 4). The etched cross-section revealed thinning and work-hardening in the burst region (Fig. 5). The wall thickness just outside the work-hardened fracture region measured 0. 035 ". Barlow's Formula: P = 2 St/D, where P is burst pressure, S is allowable stress, t is wall thickness and D is the outer diameter of tube. Using the ultimate tensile strength of 28 ksi and a measured wall thickness of 0. 035 inches at burst, P = 5. 2 ksi (burst pressure). Using the yield of 13 ksi (YS) for aluminum 5052 - 0, plastic deformation will happen at P = 2. 4 ksi suggesting plastic deformation occurred at a proof pressure of 3. 0 ksi. Conclusion: The burst resulted from high stress, low-cycle fatigue. Evidence of arrest bands originating on the inner diameter. Fracture is predominately shear dimples, characteristic of high load ductile fractures (Fig 6). Section wall reduction in the burst region. Plastic deformation and thinning of the out-of-specification tube wall likely happened during the initial proof testing years ago. Metallography of tubing away from rupture site confirmed tubing was seamless. Based on the tube microstructure, {{it is likely that the}} initial wall thickness was about 30 % thinner than the requirement of 0. 049 inches. Fracture initiated on the ID and progressed to the OD (shear lip). The tube is made of the correct material of 5052 - 0 aluminum as verified using Optical Emission Spectroscopy (Table 2). The tubing hardness tested 77 HV 100 (77 HRE). This hardness is slightly above the requirement for 70 HRE maximum for aluminum 5052 - 0 in AMS 2658 C [3]...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of engine}} {{placement}} on flutter {{characteristics of a}} very flexible high-aspect-ratio wing are investigated using the code NATASHA (Nonlinear Aeroelastic Trim And Stability of HALE Aircraft). The analysis was validated against published results for divergence and flutter of swept wings and found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental results of the classical wing of Goland. Moreover, modal frequencies and damping obtained for the Goland wing were found in excellent agreement with published results based on a new continuum-based unsteady aerodynamic formulation. Gravity for this class of wings {{plays an important role}} in flutter characteristics. In the absence of aerodynamic and gravitational forces and without an engine, the kinetic energy of the first two modes are calculated. Maximum and minimum flutter speed locations coincide with the area of minimum and maximum kinetic energy of the second bending and torsion modes. Time-dependent dynamic behavior of a turboshaft engine (JetCat SP 5) is simulated with a transient engine model and the nonlinear aeroelastic response of the wing to the engine's time-dependent thrust and dynamic excitation is presented. Below the flutter speed, at the wing tip and behind the elastic axis, the impulse engine excitation leads to a stable limit cycle oscillation; and for the ramp kind of excitation, beyond the flutter speed, at 75 % span, behind the elastic axis, it produces chaotic oscillation of the wing. Both the excitations above the flutter speed are stabilized, on the inboard portion of the wing. Effects of engine placement and sweep on flutter characteristics of a backswept flying wing resembling the Horten IV are explored using NATASHA. This aircraft exhibits a non-oscillatory yawing instability, expected in aircraft with neither a vertical tail nor yaw control. More important, however, is the presence of a low frequency “body-freedom flutter” mode. The aircraft center of gravity was held fixed during the study, which allowed aircraft controls to trim similarly for each engine location, and minimized flutter speed variations along the inboard span. Maximum flutter speed occurred for engine placement just outboard of 60 % span with engine center of gravity forward of the elastic axis. The body-freedom flutter mode was largely unaffected by the engine placement except for cases in which the engine is placed at the wing tip and near the elastic axis. In the absence of engines, aerodynamics, and gravity, a region of minimum kinetic energy density for the first symmetric free-free bending mode is also near the 60 % span. A possible relationship between the favorable flutter characteristics obtained by placing the engines at that point and the region of minimum kinetic energy is briefly explored. Effects of multiple engine placement on a similar type of aircraft are studied. The results showed that multiple engine placement increases flutter speed particularly when the engines are placed in the <b>outboard</b> <b>portion</b> of the wing (60 % to 70 % span), forward of the elastic axis, while the lift to drag ratio is affected negligibly. The behavior of the sub- and supercritical eigenvalues is studied for two cases of engine placement. NATASHA captures a hump body-freedom flutter with low frequency for the clean wing case, which disappears as the engines are placed on the wings. In neither case is there any apparent coalescence between the unstable modes. NATASHA captures other non-oscillatory unstable roots with very small amplitude, apparently originating with flight dynamics. For the clean-wing case, in the absence of aerodynamic and gravitational forces, the regions of minimum kinetic energy density for the first and third bending modes are located around 60 % span. For the second mode, this kinetic energy density has local minima around the 20 % and 80 % span. The regions of minimum kinetic energy of these modes are in agreement with calculations that show a noticeable increase in flutter speed at these regions if engines are placed forward of the elastic axis. High Altitude, Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft can achieve sustained, uninterrupted flight time if they use solar power. Wing morphing of solar powered HALE aircraft can significantly increase solar energy absorbency. An example of the kind of morphing considered in this thesis requires the wings to fold so as to orient a solar panel to be hit more directly by the sun's rays at specific times of the day. In this study solar powered HALE flying wing aircraft are modeled with three beams with lockable hinge connections. Such aircraft are shown to be capable of morphing passively, following the sun by means of aerodynamic forces and engine thrusts. The analysis underlying NATASHA was extended to include the ability to simulate morphing of the aircraft into a “Z” configuration. Because of the “long endurance” feature of HALE aircraft, such morphing needs to be done without relying on actuators and at as near zero energy cost as possible. The emphasis of this study is to substantially demonstrate the processes required to passively morph a flying wing into a Z-shaped configuration and back again. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} report {{encompasses the}} Cal Poly Human Powered Helicopter team’s efforts during the 2010 - 2011 academic year. The intention {{of this project}} is to further the knowledge of human powered helicopter design and to validate an ideal configuration through experimental tests and analysis. A. Background The Sikorsky Prize offered by the American Helicopter Society has been the catalyst for many attempts at Human Powered Helicopter (HPH) flight. The requirement to win the prize is a continuous, human powered flight of more than 60 seconds that stays within a 10 meter square box and reaches an altitude greater than 3 meters {{at some point during}} the flight. As of 2011, there have been over thirty different attempts. Most of these attempts have not flown or produced anything significant due to serious design issues, fabrication and execution problems, failure to record and publish information, or lack of funding, among other problems. In addition, a large number of the projects are no longer underway because of failure to fly. In fact, only three HPHs have ever achieved flight: the Da Vinci III constructed by students at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), the Yuri I, constructed by students at Nihon University in Japan, and most recently the Gamera, constructed by students at the University of Maryland. All of these successes came after many years of experimentation and the combined efforts of numerous individuals. B. Design Considerations Some of the main design challenges for human powered flight include maintaining a very low vehicle weight while achieving the highest power output from the limited energy that a human can produce. From previous research and experiments performed at Cal Poly, it was concluded that the limiting element in using human power is the body’s respiratory system [...] the series of organs involved in re-oxygenating blood as it circulates the body. As with any engine, an athlete’s body can only perform within the limits of its respiratory system before reaching exhaustion. For example, simultaneous use of arms and legs to provide power to a helicopter is of little advantage if the body is already processing oxygen at a maximum rate. However, the phenomenon of ground effect is known to reduce the power required for hover during flight at very low altitudes. Unfortunately typical helicopter theory, especially related to low altitude hover, does not entirely apply to the HPH because rotor shape and operational RPM are so drastically different. The HPH relies on rotors that resemble rotating conventional aircraft wings with longer chord, greater camber and twist, and operate at much slower RPM than conventional helicopter rotors. Because the majority of publicly available data relates to traditional helicopter analysis, there is a considerable absence of published experimental data needed to make critical design decisions for an HPH. Therefore, the experiments performed by the Cal Poly HPH Team were done to simulate possible HPH rotor configurations and situations in order to better understand the dynamics of HPH flight. C. Ground Effect In studying the past HPH designs, our team realized that the most obvious problem is overcoming the limitations of human power. The best attempt at fighting this was Naito’s Yuri I, a craft that utilized ground effect by running rotors very close to the ground. The success of the Yuri inspired us to study Dr. Naito’s research, and try to understand what made his helicopter so successful. After reviewing Dr. Naito’s research, we identified our areas of work. We came to understand ground effect (GE) as an increase in blade efficiency for rotors operated at less than one radius above the ground. The improved efficiency, or lift to drag ratio, is due to two things: 1. Reduced downward velocity of induced airflow, leading to: a. Less induced drag and a more vertical lift vector b. Decreased pitch angle and less power needed for hover 2. Reduced tip vortices, resulting in: a. Improved efficiency of <b>outboard</b> <b>portion</b> of blade b. Reduced system turbulence from ingestion of recirculating vortex swirls As a result of low altitude hover, the downwash from the wing or rotor blade is deflected by the ground. This deflection reduces the vortices on the tips of the wings and rotors. Because these vortices cause a slight downward and backward drag force on the lifting surface, their depletion allows increases in lift. In a helicopter, this lift is being achieved by power applied to a rotor. Therefore, ground effect should theoretically allow for increased thrust (or lift) from the rotor without a corresponding increase in power input. Ground effect is especially noticeable in the HPHs that have actually flown. The Da Vinci III, Yuri I and Gamera were only able to fly in deep ground effect; in fact the Yuri and the Gamera rotors were only inches above the ground. The Da Vinci rotors were over four feet high, but the rotor length was very large. Ground effect’s influence on HPHs is undeniable, and better designs for HPHs can be achieved by understanding this phenomenon. In Figure 1 below, the in-ground-effect rotor on the left has smaller tip vortices and decreased pitch angle than the rotor out of ground effect seen on the right. The benefits of GE begin around one rotor radius above ground, and then increase exponentially the lower the rotors fly. To reap the greatest benefits, our HPH should fly as close to the ground as possible. D. Intermeshing Rotors The Yuri I had four rotors, and was the most stable and successful flying HPH. However, the large structure needed to keep the four rotors from colliding with each other had to be made very, very light. This meant the structure was not very robust and collapsed after a minor impact between rotors. If the structure size requirements could be reduced, the remaining structure could be made much more robust and could withstand forces from a control system, without an increase in craft weight (compared to previously flown helicopters). In addition, if the rotors could be brought together, it would also decrease the amount of material in the drivetrain as well as reduce complexity and weight. To accomplish this, the rotor blades would have to intermesh or spin inside of each other like gears that do not touch, otherwise obvious disaster would occur. The question is then whether a drive train could be designed to ensure that the rotor blades don’t hit and if intermeshing rotors come with any thrust or instability penalties that would have to be considered before using them on a full size helicopter...|$|E
