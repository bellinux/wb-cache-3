5|$|Most {{people can}} only judge of things by the {{experiences}} of <b>ordinary</b> <b>life,</b> but phenomena {{outside the scope of}} this are really quite numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective ideas.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{highlights}} {{the social context}} and everyday life of his characters. He {{has been compared to}} William Faulkner who also created a similar fictional town and likewise explored with humour and compassion the energy of <b>ordinary</b> <b>life.</b> Narayan's short stories have been compared with those of Guy de Maupassant because of his ability to compress a narrative. However he has also been criticised for the simplicity of his prose.|$|E
5|$|These {{thoughts}} are employed on various important situations and {{incidents in the}} <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> of females, and are, in general, dictated with great judgment. Mrs. Wollstonecraft appears to have reflected maturely on her subject;… while her manner gives authority, her good sense adds irresistible weight to almost all her precepts and remarks. We should therefore recommend these Thoughts as worthy the attention {{of those who are}} more immediately concerned in the education of young ladies.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's writing {{style was}} often {{compared}} to that of William Faulkner since both their works brought out the humour and energy of <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> while displaying compassionate humanism. The similarities also extended to their juxtaposing of the demands of society against the confusions of individuality. Although their approach to subjects was similar, their methods were different; Faulkner was rhetorical and illustrated his points with immense prose while Narayan was very simple and realistic, capturing the elements all the same.|$|E
5|$|The story draws {{heavily on}} the {{tradition}} of the romance, a fictitious narrative set far away from <b>ordinary</b> <b>life.</b> Romances were typically based around themes such as the supernatural, wandering, exploration and discovery. They were often set in coastal regions, and typically featured exotic, fantastical locations and themes of transgression and redemption, loss and retrieval, exile and reunion. As a result, while The Tempest was originally listed as a comedy in the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays, subsequent editors have chosen to give it the more specific label of Shakespearean romance. Like the other romances, the play was influenced by the then-new genre of tragicomedy, introduced by John Fletcher {{in the first decade of}} the 17th century and developed in the Beaumont and Fletcher collaborations, as well as by the explosion of development of the courtly masque form by such as Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Gwen becomes {{consumed}} {{with the issue}} of the missing individuals and this takes its toll on her relationship with her husband Rhys (Kai Owen). They argue, and he states that if Gwen is working to safeguard <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> then she has not been successful. Returning to Torchwood's headquarters, Gwen interrupts Jack and fellow Torchwood employee Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) during a sexual encounter. After apologising, she tells Jack that she wants to continue the investigation. Jack refuses to help, but Ianto later gives Gwen a GPS device with coordinates to a hidden location, leading Gwen to a facility on Flat Holm, a sort of care home for seventeen individuals taken by the riftwho have returned. Gwen finds Jack there, and demands access to Jonah. An older Jonah (Robert Pugh) is shown to have been physically deformed whilst on a burning planet {{in the midst of a}} burning solar system. Jack reveals that he set up the facility when he first took command of Torchwood, in order to care for the victims of the rift, who had previously been locked away in the Torchwood vaults.|$|E

25|$|Some men {{and women}} in the story have the natural ability to access a form of magic called the One Power; through a process called channeling. The One Power {{consists}} of male and female halves called saidin (accessible by men) and saidar (accessible by women). The One Power is further divided into the 'Five Powers': Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and Spirit. In addition to granting access to the One Power, the ability to channel greatly extends longevity and masks the effects of aging. Channeling itself is described as a euphoric, drug-like experience of life involving the enhancement of all senses, making <b>ordinary</b> <b>life</b> seem dull and grey. A contrary power, dubbed the True Power, is associated with Shai'tan.|$|E
