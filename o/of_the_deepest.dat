5|$|In August 1990, during Operation Desert Shield, paratroopers {{from the}} unit {{protected}} the XVIII Airborne Corps' left flank during the subsequent Operation Desert Storm. It then advanced {{on the western}} flank of the invasion force along with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division, and other units of the XVIII Airborne Corps, striking some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deepest</b> incursions into Iraq of the war. The Division eventually advanced to Tallil {{while the majority of}} the attacking force moved into Kuwait. The formation earned its first campaign streamers for this action.|$|E
5|$|Most {{fish are}} ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), {{allowing}} their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, {{though some of}} the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deepest</b> oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deepest</b> {{problems}} in modern physics {{is the problem}} of quantum gravity. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is formulated within the framework of classical physics. However, nongravitational forces are described within the framework of quantum mechanics, a radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based on probability. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity.|$|E

5|$|Human {{occupation}} continued {{throughout the}} Iron Age. A stone enclosure was constructed around 300 BC with timber revetting, and ploughing ceased within the hilltop site. Excavations {{have shown the}} signs of four and six post rectangular buildings which were gradually replaced with roundhouses. Large ramparts and elaborate timber defences were constructed and refortified over the following centuries. Excavation revealed round and rectangular house foundations, metalworking, and a possible sequence of small rectangular temples or shrines, indicating permanent oppidum-like occupation. Excavations were undertaken by local clergyman James Bennett in 1890 and Harold St George Gray in 1913, followed by major work led by archaeologist Leslie Alcock from 1966â€“1970. He identified a long sequence of occupation on the site {{and many of the}} finds are displayed in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. The finds from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, exploring the ramparts and southwestern gate structure, represent one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deepest</b> and most complex Iron Age stratigraphic sequences excavated in southern Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Tropical Storm Nicholas {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that moved off the coast of Africa on October 9. It moved westward, and developed a broad area of low pressure along the wave on October 10. Convection organized around the low early on October 12 while located 800miles (1300km) southwest of the Cape Verde islands. As upper level winds became more favorable, the system became better organized, though the circulation center initially remained located {{to the west of the}} area of heavy showers. The surface circulation of the large circulation envelope moved towards a position near the western edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deepest</b> convection, and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Nineteen late on October 13 while located 1,030miles (1,660km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.|$|E
5|$|Banding {{features}} and outflow continued to develop as {{a ring of}} convection formed around the center of Fabian, and on August 30, the storm intensified into a hurricane while gradually slowing its motion to the west-northwest. As banding {{features and}} outflow became better defined, an eye developed in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deepest</b> convection. Fabian quickly strengthened and attained major hurricane status late that day. Deep convection became very concentric around the 11.5mile (18.5km) wide eye, and the hurricane reached winds of 125mph (205km/h) early on August 31. At this time, the deepest convection near the eye degraded in appearance, and Fabian temporarily stopped its strengthening trend. Later that day, the eye became distinct again within a perfectly round area of deep convection. Outflow continued to expand in all directions, and Fabian intensified into a Category 4 hurricane late on August 31. Thunderstorm activity near the eyewall became more intense, and the cloud tops in the eyewall became much cooler; simultaneously, outflow away from the eye became much more symmetrical, both signs of an intensifying tropical cyclone. Fabian reached its peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h) on September 1 while located 345miles (555km) east of the northern Lesser Antilles.|$|E

5|$|The character's {{change in}} Part II (Naruto Shippuden) has been praised for {{being one of}} the most {{developed}} ones in the series by Anime News Network's Casey Brienza, as she has become stronger than her Part I (Naruto) counterpart which, was considerably weaker than Naruto and Sasuke. This allows her to take a more active and appealing role in the series. Major praise has been given to her encounters with Sasori and Sasuke owing to her fighting skills and mature reactions, respectively. Sakura's love confession to Naruto in later parts of the series has been commented to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deepest</b> lines and part of the story arc, for bringing confusion into the mix in regards to whether or not, her love confession claim is as serious as her intention to stop Naruto's suffering. It also came as a surprise as fans wondered what were Sakura's real intention regarding Sasuke who had become a dangerous criminal during such a time in the series. Jason Thompson believes Sakura's feelings were well-handled by Kishimoto. While disliking the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series as she felt it was initially a crush on Sakura's part, Amy McNulty believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden helps to expand the bond between these two as well as their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Sarah Nelkin from Anime Now praised Sakura's development across the series, mostly in late parts of the series due to how she turns into a stronger person as she grows up most notably when she becomes an adult.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the depth}} in the silicon wafer {{of each of}} the three layer Foveon X3 sensors is less than five micrometres, it has {{negligible}} effect on focusing or chromatic aberration.
