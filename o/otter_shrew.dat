This priority has been analyzed using two different methods, including Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) and Evolutionary Distinctiveness (ED).|$|E
5000|$|The Nimba <b>otter</b> <b>shrew</b> (Micropotamogale lamottei) is a dwarf <b>otter</b> <b>shrew</b> and {{belongs to}} the mammal family Tenrecidae. Tenrecs have been found {{throughout}} mainland Africa and Madagascar; however, its subfamily Potamogalinae are the shrew-like creatures found in sub-Saharan Africa. This species {{belongs to the}} genus Micropotamogale, literally meaning [...] "dwarf shrew". It is native to the Mount Nimba area which rests along the border of Liberia, Guinea, and Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) in West Africa.|$|E
50|$|Giant <b>otter</b> <b>shrews</b> fare {{very poorly}} in captivity. Captive {{specimens}} {{have been recorded}} to deteriorate in health very quickly, living only 1- 14 days.|$|R
50|$|While its {{habits are}} similar to the related <b>otter</b> <b>shrews</b> of Mainland East Africa, family Potamogalinae, their aquatic lifestyles evolved {{independently}} from one another.|$|R
50|$|A shrew or shrew mouse (family Soricidae) {{is a small}} mole-like mammal {{classified}} in {{the order}} Eulipotyphla. True shrews {{are not to be}} confused with West Indies <b>shrews,</b> treeshrews, <b>otter</b> <b>shrews,</b> or elephant shrews, which belong to different families or orders.|$|R
50|$|The giant <b>otter</b> <b>shrew</b> builds burrows among {{riverbank}} crevices. It chooses dry {{leaves with}} which to line its nest. This is also where breeding takes place. The burrows are frequently changed. When foraging, otter shrews take frequent grooming breaks. When traveling upstream the <b>otter</b> <b>shrew</b> travels on the bank and then swims downstream. The night foraging routine is regular and predictable, and covers up to 800 meters a night. P. velox regularly visits discrete piles of feces that are sheltered and probably used to mark boundaries of territory.|$|E
50|$|The Ruwenzori <b>otter</b> <b>shrew</b> (Micropotamogale ruwenzorii) is {{a species}} of semiaquatic mammal in the family Tenrecidae. It is found in Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. Its natural habitat is rivers. It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss.|$|E
5000|$|The IUCN had {{listed the}} Nimba <b>otter</b> <b>shrew</b> as {{endangered}} in 1990, but in 2016 the status {{was changed to}} near threatened. The species is confined to an area less than 5,000 square km on Mount Nimba, which is currently fragmented due to mining and wetland rice agriculture. The mining operations also produce runoff into the creeks and streambeds that is highly toxic. [...] The current population is decreasing {{at a rate of}} 1 per 10 square km (almost 500 otter shrews per year). [...] Although an exact number is unknown at this time, there is believed to be less than several hundred in captivity and 2500-3500 in the wild. At this rate the Nimba <b>otter</b> <b>shrew</b> will be extinct between 2017 and 2020.|$|E
50|$|Giant <b>otter</b> <b>shrews</b> breed {{during the}} wet/rainy season. They {{give birth to}} one or two young per litter, once or twice a year. Males move long {{distances}} via water in search of mates and it is thought that males rut (or fight) during the wet season.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{formerly}} a {{sand and gravel}} quarry, and was converted to a park in the 1980s. is bordered on its southern and eastern side by the River Great Ouse.

50|$|Tenrecidae: Three {{species of}} tenrec (the <b>otter</b> <b>shrews)</b> are {{found on the}} African mainland. The {{majority}} of tenrecs, around 30 species, are found in Madagascar. They have radiated into many different niches. For example, web-footed tenrecs (Limnogale mergulus) resemble river otters in appearance and behaviour. The lesser hedgehog tenrec (Echinops telfairi) resembles its namesake the hedgehog.|$|R
50|$|The endemic {{aquatic animals}} in the Nimba Range {{includes}} frogs, fish, the Nimba Stream Crab (Liberonautes nimba), and the endangered Nimba <b>otter</b> <b>shrew</b> (Micropotamogale lamottei).

50|$|Contrary to {{its name}} the giant <b>otter</b> <b>shrew</b> is not a true shrew (Soricidae) but a tenrec (Tenrecidae). The common name refers to their {{resemblance}} to otters with their flat face and stiff whiskers, and the tenrecs' overall superficial similarity to true shrews. They are nocturnal carnivores that feed on aquatic animals.|$|E
50|$|Giant <b>otter</b> <b>shrews</b> {{are native}} to central Africa, from the {{southern}} regions of Nigeria (central Rainforest Zone), and then eastward through Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Central African Republic, Chad, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan to the northern regions of Angola and Zambia. There is a small population that lives between Uganda and Kenya and the preserved rainforest of Kakamega, Kenya.|$|R
50|$|Tenrecs have a {{gestation}} period of 50 to 64 days, and {{give birth to}} a number of relatively undeveloped young. While the <b>otter</b> <b>shrews</b> have just two young per litter, the tailless tenrec can have as many as 32, and females possess up to 29 teats, more than any other mammal. At least some tenrec species are social, living in multigenerational family groups with over a dozen individuals.|$|R

50|$|The giant <b>otter</b> <b>shrew</b> (Potamogale velox) is a semiaquatic, {{carnivorous}} tenrec. It {{is found}} in the main rainforest block of central Africa from Nigeria to Zambia, with a few isolated populations in Kenya and Uganda. It {{is found in}} streams, wetlands and slow flowing larger rivers. It is monotypic in the genus Potamogale.|$|E
50|$|The giant <b>otter</b> <b>shrew</b> is a mammal superficially {{similar to}} an otter in appearance.It is {{characterized}} by a long, flat tail, which it uses for swimming by sideways undulation like a fish.

5000|$|Potamogalinae is the {{subfamily}} of [...] "otter shrews", a {{group of}} semiaquatic riverine mammals in the family Tenrecidae indigenous to Subsaharan Africa. All <b>otter</b> <b>shrews</b> are carnivorous, preying on any aquatic animal they can find with their sensitive whiskers. As their common name suggests, they bear a strong, but superficial resemblance to true otters {{to which they are}} not closely related, nor are they closely related to true shrews. They move through the water by undulating their tail in a side-to-side motion similar to the motions made by a crocodile swimming.|$|R
5000|$|Widanelfarasia is an extinct genus of placental mammals {{known from}} the Late Eocene Jebel Qatrani Formation of Egypt. Two species are known: W. bowni and the smaller W. rasmusseni. Described in 2000 by E. R. Seiffert and Elwyn L. Simons, Widanelfarasia was {{initially}} classified as uncertain position (incertae sedis) within placentals, but was later placed within the afrosoricidan suborder Tenrecomorpha (tenrecs and <b>otter</b> <b>shrews).</b> The genus name derives from Widan el-Faras (Arabic for [...] "Ears of the Mare"), two prominent hills {{in the area where}} the fossils were recovered.|$|R

40|$|Mammals of the insectivoran grade {{have always}} roused {{considerable}} interest, {{mainly because of}} their presumed similarity to the fi rst ancestors of this group. While the morphology of adult specimens {{is relatively easy to}} access and thus well investigated embryos are rare and much less studied, in spite of their multiplicity of attributes. In order to provide additional morphological characters the ontogeny of the skull of Hemicentetes semispinosus was investigated using three serial sections through the heads of embryos and neonates respectively. The chondrocranium with cartilage replacing bones and dermal bones of the youngest embryo as well as the larger arteries in the posterior region of the heads of Hemicentetes semispinosus and Potamogale velox were graphically reconstructed. The findings of 70 skull and cranial artery characters were compared mainly with data from literature on several insectivore species. Already published hypotheses on phylogenetic relationships could be partially corroborated. Investigations of more primitive tenrecs and <b>otter</b> <b>shrews</b> on one hand and on e. g. golden moles and elephant shrews on the other hand are required in order to further evaluate differences and possible synapomorphies...|$|R
