5|$|During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Egyptian pagan {{culture was}} in decline after the rise <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> <b>and</b> later Islam, but {{interest}} in Egyptian antiquity {{continued in the}} writings of medieval scholars such as Dhul-Nun al-Misri and al-Maqrizi. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.|$|E
5|$|In any event, the Lithuanians {{were not}} {{prepared}} to accept Christianity, and Mindaugas's baptism had little impact on further developments. The {{majority of the population}} and the nobility remained pagan; his subjects were not required to convert. The cathedral he had built in Vilnius was superseded by a pagan temple, and all the diplomatic achievements made after his coronation were lost, although the practice <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> <b>and</b> intermarriage were well tolerated.|$|E
5|$|Several {{periods of}} Protestant Christian revival nurtured a {{proliferation}} of new religious movements in the United States. In {{the latter half of}} the 19th century these included what came to be known as the metaphysical family: groups such as Christian Science, Divine Science, the Unity School <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> <b>and</b> (later) the United Church of Religious Science. From the 1890s the liberal section of the movement became known as New Thought, in part to distinguish it from the more authoritarian Christian Science.|$|E

5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually {{nothing to do with}} the founding <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> <b>and</b> the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.|$|E
5|$|While Jesus {{is portrayed}} as an impassioned person for his love for all (even for shopping), Buddha tends to be calm and thrifty, and also likes manga.

5|$|As {{a medieval}} Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, {{but as an}} educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or {{completely}} dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> <b>and</b> followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, Edward I of England {{conquered the}} principality of Wales and divided the area into counties. One of {{thirteen}} traditional counties in Wales, Cardiganshire {{was also a}} vice-county. Cardiganshire was split into the five hundreds of Genau'r-Glyn, Ilar, Moyddyn, Penarth and Troedyraur. In the 18th century there was an evangelical revival <b>of</b> <b>Christianity,</b> <b>and</b> non-conformism became established in the county as charismatic preachers like Daniel Rowland of Llangeitho attracted large congregations. Every community built its own chapel or meeting house, and Cardiganshire {{became one of the}} centres of Methodism in Wales with the Aeron Valley being at the centre of the revival.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January AjKowoj, {{the king}} of the Kowoj, arrived at Nojpetén and spoke with Avendaño, arguing against the {{acceptance}} <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> <b>and</b> Spanish rule. The discussions between Avendaño, Kan Ek' and AjKowoj exposed deep divisions among the Itza. Kan Ek' learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans, and the Itza king advised them to return to Mérida via Tipuj. The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships, including the death of one of Avendaño's companions, but after a month wandering in the forest found their way back to Chuntuki, and from there returned to Mérida.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} have specifically compared baptism with the Isiac initiation described by Apuleius. Before the early fourth century CE, baptism was {{the culmination of}} a long process, in which the convert to Christianity fasted for the forty days of Lent before being immersed at Easter in a cistern or natural body of water. Like the mysteries of Isis, then, early Christian baptism involved a days-long fast and a washing ritual. Both fasting and washing were common types of ritual purification found in the religions of the Mediterranean, and Christian baptism was specifically derived from the baptism of Jesus and Jewish immersion rituals. Therefore, according to Hugh Bowden, these similarities come from the shared religious background <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> <b>and</b> the Isis cult, not from the influence of one tradition upon the other.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Crusades in general, and {{particularly}} that of the First Crusade, is widely debated among historians. The confusion is partially due to the numerous armies in the first crusade, and their lack of direct unity. The similar ideologies held the armies to similar goals, but the connections were rarely strong, and the unity broke down often. The Crusades are most commonly linked to {{the political and social}} situation in 11th-century Europe, the rise of a reform movement within the papacy, and the political and religious confrontation <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> <b>and</b> Islam in Europe and the Middle East. Christianity had spread throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East in Late Antiquity, but by the early 8th century Christian rule had become limited to Europe and Anatolia after the Muslim conquests.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} self-decapitation and the severed head is {{recurring}} in Indian mythology. Legends from the Simhasana Dvatrimsika and the Kathasaritsagara speak {{of how the}} hero offers blood from his throat as an offering to a goddess. Rajasthani folk tales and songs tell about of warrior-heroes (jhumjharji or bhomiya) who cuts off his head before the war or is decapitated in action, but battles on – without his head – slaying foes until he avenges his beheading and dies. The decapitated body and head motif {{is not unique to}} Hinduism and Buddhism and appears across the world, including the Cephalophore saints <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> <b>and</b> in Celtic culture.|$|E

5|$|Morris {{was born}} at Elm House in Walthamstow, Essex, on 24 March 1834. Raised into a wealthy middle-class family, he was named after his father, a {{financier}} {{who worked as a}} partner in the Sanderson & Co. firm, bill brokers in the City of London. His mother was Emma Morris (née Shelton), who descended from a wealthy bourgeois family from Worcester. Morris was the third of his parents' surviving children; their first child, Charles, had been born in 1827 but died four days later. Charles had been followed by the birth of two girls, Emma in 1829 and Henrietta in 1833, before William's birth. These children were followed by the birth of siblings Stanley in 1837, Rendall in 1839, Arthur in 1840, Isabella in 1842, Edgar in 1844, and Alice in 1846. The Morris family were followers of the evangelical Protestant form <b>of</b> <b>Christianity,</b> <b>and</b> William was baptised four months after his birth at St. Mary's Church, Walthamstow.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January AjKowoj, {{the king}} of the Kowoj, arrived at Nojpetén and spoke with Avendaño, arguing against the {{acceptance}} <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> <b>and</b> Spanish rule. The discussions between Avendaño, Kan Ek' and AjKowoj exposed deep divisions among the Itza – and the apparent treachery of the Itza king in offering his kingdom to the Spanish undermined Kan Ek's power over his own people. Kan Ek' learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their Chak'an Itza allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans, and the Itza king advised them to return to Mérida via Tipuj. The Itza king's efforts to save his Spanish guests effectively ended his power to rule; from that point on anti-Spanish sentiment governed Itza responses to the Spanish. The Franciscans were guided to Yalain where they were well received but while they were there the Yalain heard rumours of battle and a Spanish advance towards Lake Petén Itzá. The Franciscans were shown a path that led to Tipuj but their Yalain guides soon abandoned them. The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships, including the death of one of Avendaño's companions, but after a month wandering in the forest found their way back to Chuntuki and from there made their way back to Mérida.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{acceptance}} from major religious hierarchies, early religious objections to Darwin's theory are still used {{in opposition to}} evolution. The ideas that species change over time through natural processes and that different species share common ancestors seemed to contradict the Genesis account of Creation. Believers in Biblical infallibility attacked Darwinism as heretical. The natural theology of the early 19th century was typified by William Paley's watchmaker analogy, an argument from design still used by the creationist movement. Natural theology included a range of ideas and arguments from the outset, and when Darwin's theory was published, ideas of theistic evolution were presented in which evolution is accepted as a secondary cause open to scientific investigation, while still holding belief in God as a first cause with a non-specified role in guiding evolution and creating humans. This position has been adopted by denominations <b>of</b> <b>Christianity</b> <b>and</b> Judaism in line with modernist theology which views the Bible and Torah as allegorical, thus removing the conflict between evolution and religion.|$|E

5|$|The {{letter to}} Æthelburg {{makes it clear}} that she was already married at the time the news of Eadbald's {{conversion}} reached Rome. This is quite inconsistent with the earlier date Bede gives for Eadbald's acceptance <b>of</b> <b>Christianity,</b> <b>and</b> it has been suggested in Bede's defence that Æthelburg married Edwin substantially earlier and stayed in Kent until 625 before travelling to Rome, and that the letter was written while she was in Kent. However, it would appear from Boniface's letter that Boniface thought of Æthelburg as being at her husband's side. It also appears that the letter to Justus was written after the letters to Edwin and Æthelburg, rather than before, as Bede has it; Boniface's letter to Edwin and Æthelburg indicates he had the news from messengers, but when he wrote to Justus he had heard from the king himself.|$|E
