50|$|The H. C. Fry Glass Company made {{complete}} dinner {{sets and}} tea sets. The company {{also made a}} large variety of heat-resistant <b>oven</b> <b>glassware</b> from 1916 under a license from the Corning Glass Works.|$|E
40|$|General. All {{reactions}} {{were carried out}} in <b>oven</b> dried <b>glassware</b> under an atmosphere of argon or nitrogen. For flash chromatography technical grade solvents were used, which were distilled prior to use. Solvents for {{reactions were}} analytical grade purchased from Merck or Baker and used without further purifications except for THF and Et 2 O, which were passed through two 4 x 36 inch columns of anhydrous neutral A- 2 alumina (8 x 14 mesh; Macherey und Nagel; activated under a flow of N 2 at 300 º over night) to remove water. All chemicals were purchased from Acros, Aldrich, Fluka, Merck or Lancaster and used as such unless stated otherwise. Chromatographic purification was performed as flash chromatography using Brunschwig silica 32 - 63, 60 Å, using pentanes/diethylether or hexanes/ethyl acetate as eluent with 0. 3 - 0. 5 bar pressure...|$|R
30|$|All air {{and water}} {{sensitive}} reactions were carried out in <b>oven</b> dried <b>glassware</b> under nitrogen atmosphere using standard manifold techniques. All the chemicals were purchased from Acros organics and Sigma-Aldrich, and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Compounds that are not described in the experimental part were synthesized according to the literature procedures. Solvents were freshly distilled by standard procedures prior to use. Flash chromatography was performed on silica gel (Merck, 100 – 200 mesh) with the indicated eluant. All 1 H and 13 C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 600  MHz spectrometer. For 1 H NMR, tetramethylsilane (TMS) served as internal standard (δ =  0) and data are reported as follows: chemical shift, integration, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet) and coupling constant(s) in Hz. For 13 C NMR, TMS (δ =  0) or CDCl 3 (δ =  77.26) was used as internal standard and spectra were obtained with complete proton decoupling.|$|R
30|$|Melting {{points were}} {{determined}} in open capillaries. 1 H-Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on Bruker AV 300 and 400  MHz instruments, in CDCl 3 using TMS as an internal standard. Chemical shifts {{are given in}} (δ) ppm and coupling constants (J) are given in Hz. Combinations of the following abbreviations are used to describe NMR spectra: s = singlet; d = doublet; t = triplet; q = quartet; m = multiplet. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on aluminium sheets coated with silica gel 60 F 254 (Merck, 1.05554) and the spots were visualized with UV light at 254  nm or alternatively by staining with aqueous basic potassium permanganate. Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel (Merck, 60 A, 100 – 200 mesh). Chromatographic purity by HPLC was determined by using area normalization method and the condition specified in each case: column, mobile phase, flow rate, detection wavelength, and retention times. Commercially available reagents were used as supplied {{and some of them}} were distilled before use. All reactions were performed in <b>oven</b> dried <b>glassware.</b> All solvents were removed by evaporation under reduced pressure.|$|R
40|$|General Information Unless {{otherwise}} noted, all solvents were degassed by purging with {{nitrogen and}} dried over activated alumina. All reactions were performed under argon or nitrogen with either flame or <b>oven</b> dried <b>glassware.</b> 1 H and 13 C MNR were recorded on Bruker DRX- 400 or 500 MHz spectrometers. Proton chemical shifts are internally referenced to the residual solvent proton resonance (CDCl 3 δ 7. 26, d 6 -DMSO δ 2. 50, d 5 -Pydidine δ 8. 74). Carbon chemical shifts are internally referenced to the deuterated solvent signal (CDCl 3 δ 77. 23, d 6 -DMSO δ 38. 51, d 5 -Pydidine δ 150. 35). Infrared spectra were obtained on a Nicolet 20 SXB FT-IR spectrometer. Chemical ionization high resolution mass spectra were recorded at Old Dominion University. Electrospray ionization mass spectra were recorded on a Varian Saturn 2000 mass spectrometer. Analytical {{thin layer chromatography}} was run on Whatman 0. 25 mm K 6 F silica gel 60 Å plates.

40|$|The {{preparation}} and characterization of solid Co(II) pyrimidinolates can be simplified {{for a typical}} multifaceted undergraduate laboratory experiment. Such experiment is the first integrated set of accessible laboratory experiments coupling two important aspects. The experiment involves {{the preparation of the}} hydrated Co(II) complexes. It was showed that a portion of the project can be successfully performed even at high-school level, provided that simple <b>glassware,</b> <b>oven</b> and a UV-vis spectrophotometer are available. Performing the synthesis of the complexes and their minimal characterization by complexometry, thermal treatment and colorimetric analysis should take no more than 12 hours of experimental work. The experiment raised some interests in students...|$|R

(−) -Sparteine was distilled from CaH 2 before use. N-(diphenylmethylene) - 4 -toluenesulfonamide,[1] N-isopropyl(1 -phenylethyl) amine hydrochloride[2] and 1, 2 -bis[(S- 1 -phenylethylamino]ethane dihydrochloride[3] were prepared {{as described in the}} literature.

Thin layer chromatography was carried out using Merck F 254 alumina-backed silica plates. For Kugelrohr distillation, the temperatures quoted correspond to the oven temperatures. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Innova 400 (400 or 100 MHz) or Mercury 300 (300 and 75 MHz) instruments.
