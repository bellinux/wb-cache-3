The day after sending it, on 15 September, Lody travelled to London to reconnoitre the city's war preparations. Travelling light, he stayed for two nights at the Ivanhoe Hotel in Bloomsbury (now the Bloomsbury Street Hotel) and set to work finding information about the security measures at public buildings. He said later that he had not actually observed the buildings himself but had obtained cuttings from newspapers, which he intended to send to Berlin. He also wrote a report on 16 September, but claimed that he had never sent it– it was never found by the British– as he felt that it was poorly written.|$|E

Marsh revealed that he felt some of the criticisms were right, while others were silly.

His un-coded communications were detected by British censors when he sent his first reports to an address in Stockholm that the British knew was a postbox for German agents. The British counter-espionage agency MI5, then known as , allowed him to continue his activities in the hope <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> more information about the German spy network. His first two messages were allowed to reach the Germans but later messages were stopped, as they contained sensitive military information. At the start of October 1914, concern over the increasingly sensitive nature of his messages prompted [...] to order Lody's arrest. He had left a trail of clues that enabled the police to track him to a hotel in Killarney, Ireland, in less than a day.|$|E

The News on the March sequence gives an overview of Kane's entire life (and the film's entire story) {{at the beginning of}} the film, leaving the audience without the typical suspense of wondering how it will end. Instead the film's repetitions of events compels the audience to analyze and wonder why Kane's life happened the way that it did, under the pretext <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> what [...] "Rosebud" [...] means.

500|$|The {{introduction}} of the Macchi permitted a brief flirtation with [...] "all-through jet training" [...] starting in 1969, as it was expected to reduce the time necessary to turn out high-quality pilots, and CFS had begun preparing to train instructors for this purpose in 1967. All-through jet training was dropped in 1971, subsequently being labelled [...] "an expensive way <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> that some pupils lacked the aptitude to become military pilots". Winjeels continued to operate at CFS until replaced by the CT-4 Airtrainer in August 1975. For the next fifteen years, the main types used for instructor training were the CT-4 and the Macchi. CFS also flew Dakotas for twin-engined instructor courses until March 1980; they were further used to train pilots of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. The school was presented with the Queen's Colour by Governor-General Sir Zelman Cowen in September 1978. In December 1987, CFS took delivery of its first Pilatus PC-9 turboprop trainer, to replace the Macchi for advanced flying instructor training. [...] The Roulettes converted to the PC-9 in 1989–90. The CT-4 was phased out at the school in favour of the PC-9 in December 1991.|$|E
500|$|John Kinnaird later {{commented on}} Hazlitt's words terming Iago [...] "an amateur of tragedy in real life", {{pointing}} out that Bradley and others after him developed the idea that Hazlitt saw Iago as an artist in his own right, [...] "a dramatic artist manqué". [...] "But the form Iago's will to 'mischief' takes is not primarily aesthetic or creative but practical and critical. Soldier that he is, he has a 'craving after action {{of the most difficult}} and dangerous kind,' and he has none of the artist's sympathy with pleasure; his 'licentious' bent is always 'saturnine,' and stems from 'a desire <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> the worst side of every thing, and of proving himself an over-match for appearances' [...] ". David Bromwich later warned against carrying too far the idea that Iago is an artist figure within the play, a representation of Shakespeare himself, as Iago's [...] "genius is [...] the opposite of Shakespeare's. It presents all things in a distorting medium [...] Iago's peculiar genius is" [...] as Hazlitt represented it, [...] "the exuberance of one part of Shakespeare's mind—not an allegorical representation of the whole of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Keenan and Jones {{met through}} {{a mutual friend}} in 1989. After Keenan played a tape {{recording}} for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band. They started jamming together and were {{on the lookout for}} a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing in their sessions because he [...] "felt kinda sorry for them," [...] as other invited musicians were not showing up. Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour. Early on, the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the pseudophilosophy [...] "lachrymology". Although [...] "lachrymology" [...] was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions differently: [...] "Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> whatever it is you need to find out, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve." ...|$|E

In this paper we propose axioms for all reasonable quantitative measures of causality to obey. The axioms apply to a broad family of operational probabilistic theories with and without definite causal structure. For quantum models, we study causality measures based on one-shot quantum capacities in detail. These measures are used to define the notions of quantum signalling and quantum causality measures in order to quantify quantum causality. Comment: 26 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
500|$|The {{demand for}} trained aircrew, which had lessened in the mid-1950s, rose again the {{following}} decade {{as a result}} of the RAAF embarking on a major re-equipment program, and Australia's increasing involvement in the Vietnam War. The RAAF also had an ongoing commitment to providing flying training to students from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy. By adding instructors and increasing the ratio of pupils to instructors, the number of Air Force graduates was progressively raised from 38 in 1963, to 100 in 1968. Also in 1968, Macchi MB-326H jet trainers began replacing the Vampires of No.1 AFTS. The introduction of the Macchi led to a brief flirtation with [...] "all-through" [...] jet training in the Air Force, consisting of 210 hours on this one type of aircraft. The experiment was dropped after two courses as being, in the words of the official historian of the post-war RAAF, [...] "an expensive way <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> that some pupils lacked the aptitude to become military pilots"; by 1971 students were receiving 60 hours of basic training on Winjeels at Point Cook, and the Maachi course at Pearce was reduced to 150 hours. On 31December 1968, No.1 AFTS was disbanded at Pearce, re-forming on 1January 1969 as No.2 Flying Training School [...] At the same time, No.1 BFTS was disbanded at Point Cook and re-formed as No.1 FTS.|$|E

500|$|Children {{use words}} {{differently}} for objects, spatial relations and actions. Children ages {{one to three}} often rely on general purpose deictic words such as [...] "here", [...] "that" [...] or [...] "look" [...] accompanied by a gesture, which is most often pointing, to pick out specific objects. Children also stretch already known or partly known words to cover other objects that appear similar to the original. This can result in word overextension or misuses of words. Word overextension is governed by the perceptual similarities children notice among the different referents. Misuses of words indirectly provide ways <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>out</b> which meanings children have attached to particular words. When children {{come into contact with}} spatial relations, they talk about the location of one object with respect to another. They name the object located and use a deictic term, such as here or [...] "there" [...] for location, or they name both the object located and its location. They can also use a general purpose locative marker, which is a preposition, postposition or suffix depending on the language that is linked in some way to the word for location. Children's earliest words for actions usually encode both the action and its result. Children use a small number of general purpose verbs, such as [...] "do" [...] and [...] "make" [...] for a large variety of actions because their resources are limited. Children acquiring a second language seem to use the same production strategies for talking about actions. Sometimes children use a highly specific verb instead of a general purpose verb. In both cases children stretch their resources to communicate what they want to say.|$|E
