40|$|This {{article is}} a {{continuation}} of the article Insecticide residues cross-contamination of oilseeds during storage published in OCL vol. 14, nÂ° 6, November-December 2007. The last article presented the results obtained by an investigation on stored sunflower seeds, and this new work presents results on stored rapeseed. Pesticide residues are found in oilseeds and crude oils: they are mainly organophosphate insecticides (pirimiphos-methyl, malathion) used in empty storage facilities and for application to stored cereal grains. French regulation does not allow use of these insecticides on stored oilseeds. These residues arise from cross-contamination from storage bins and facilities, and not from illegal use. This uptake of insecticide residues from their storage environment by oilseeds can lead to levels that can exceed regulatory limits. An investigation in 13 grain storage companies allowed us to follow the course of 21 rapeseed batches, from their receipt at the storage facilities to <b>outloading.</b> Samples from each of these batches, made at <b>outloading,</b> were analysed by ITERG, looking for insecticide residues. Traceability of rapeseed established by storers allowed us to identify cross-contamination sources. Results are slightly different from those obtained the previous year on sunflower seeds. Substances discovered were mostly pirimiphos-methyl, and malathion, plus chlorpyriphos-methyl (two cases) and deltamethrin (one case). Pirimiphos-methyl was most commonly detected, and caused most cases of non-accordance with regulatory levels. Main cross-contamination hazard resulted from treatment of cereals at their receipt during the same period than rapeseed receipt, especially when these cereals treatments were frequent on that silo. Other situations led to cross-contaminations, but generally of lower levels: <b>outloading</b> of rapeseed after <b>outloading</b> of treated cereals, rapeseed stored in bin that contained previously treated cereals, empty bins and handling equipment treated before receipt of rapeseed...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide {{residues}} {{are found}} in oilseeds (rapeseed and sunflower) and crude oils: they are mainly organophosphate insecticides (pirimiophos-methyl, malathion when authorized) used in empty storage facilities and for direct application to stored cereal grain. Even if some secondary pests {{are found in}} stored oilseeds, French regulations do not allow use of these insecticides on stored oilseeds. These residues arise from cross-contamination from storage bins and grain handling equipment of grain stores, and not from illegal use. This uptake of insecticide residues from their storage environment by oilseeds may lead to residue contents that exceed regulatory limits. A three-year investigation in grain storage companies allowed us to follow the course of sunflower batches and rapeseed batches during storage seasons 2006 - 2007, 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009, from reception at the storage facility to <b>outloading.</b> Each of these batches was sampled at <b>outloading,</b> and was analyzed for insecticide residues. Traceability of oilseeds established by grain-store managers allowed us to identify cross-contamination sources. The insecticides that were most commonly detected were pirimiophos-methyl, malathion, and dichlorvos (in sunflower 2006 - 2007), plus chlorpyriphos-methyl and deltamethrin. Pirimiophos-methyl was the most commonly detected active substance, and caused the most cases of non-accordance with regulatory levels in rapeseed. Cross-contamination could have occurred when cereal grains were treated upon receipt, when rapeseed was also delivered, especially when treatments were done systematically to the cereal grains. For sunflower, the main cross-contamination hazard resulted from treatment of cereals at the period of receipt or at their <b>outloading,</b> just before sunflower seeds batches were outloaded. Another situation led to cross-contamination, but generally at a lower extent: oilseeds stored in bins that contained previously treated cereals, or loaded in empty bins with handling equipment treated before the receipt of oilseeds...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of spinosad as a grain protectant for the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica, {{was investigated in}} a silo-scale trial on wheat stored in Victoria, Australia. Rhyzopertha dominica is a serious pest of stored grain, and its resistance to protectants and the fumigant phosphine is becoming more common. This trial follows earlier laboratory research showing that spinosad may be a useful pest management option for this species. Wheat (300 t) from the 2005 harvest was treated with spinosad 0. 96 mg/kg plus chlorpyrifos-methyl 10 mg/kg in March 2006, and samples were collected at intervals during 7. 5 month storage to determine efficacy and residues in wheat and milling fractions. Chlorpyrifos-methyl is already registered in Australia for control of several other pest species, and its low potency against R. dominica was confirmed in laboratory-treated wheat. Grain moisture content was stable at about 10 %, but grain temperature ranged from 29. 3 Â°C in March to 14. 0 Â°C in August. Bioassays of all treated wheat samples over 7. 5 months resulted in 100 % adult mortality after 2 weeks exposure and no live progeny were produced. In addition, no live grain insects were detected during <b>outload</b> sampling after a 9 month storage. Spinosad and chlorpyrifos-methyl residues tended to decline during storage, and residues {{were higher in the}} bran layer than in either wholemeal or white flour. This field trial confirmed that spinosad was effective as a grain protectant targeting R. dominica...|$|R
40|$|Wheat (Australian Standard White) with a {{moisture}} content of 10. 2 % was fumigated with carbonyl sulphide (COS) at a calculated application rate of 24. 14 g m- 3, {{in a sealed}} concrete vertical silo (3512 m 3, 2500 t wheat) located at Nevertire, NSW, Australia. The COS was applied as a liquid via {{the top of the}} silo and released 2 m below the grain surface. The application of 84. 5 kg of COS was completed within 30 min. With 2 h of recirculation using a 0. 4 kW fan, the in-silo concentrations of COS achieved equilibrium with a concentration variation less than 5 % of the mean. After a two-day exposure period, the COS concentration in the silo remained at 29 g m- 3. The concentrationÃtime product (Ct) was then 1900 g h m- 3, and this achieved complete kill of all life stages of mixed-age cultures of Sitophilus oryzae, Rhyzopertha dominica, Tribolium castaneum and Trogoderma variabile. After 2 -days exposure, the silo was aired overnight with an aeration fan (25 kW) resulting in a COS in-silo concentration of below 4 ppm. This is 2. 5 times lower than the Australian Experimental Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 10 ppm. Residues of COS in the wheat declined to below the Australian Experimental Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) of 0. 2 mg kg- 1 after overnight aeration. The COS was not detected in any <b>outloading</b> samples at concentrations above the detection limit (0. 05 mg kg- 1). The workspace and environmental levels of COS were monitored during application, fumigation, aeration and <b>outloading.</b> The levels of COS and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) were less than the detection limit of 0. 1 ppm, which was 100 times lower than the TLV of 10 ppm. The treatment with COS had no affect on the wheat germination and seed colour when compared with untreated controls. Oil quality tests showed that COS had no effect on total lipid (made from treated wheat) content or the lipid colour...|$|E

40|$|New {{fumigants}} {{are needed}} to control grain insects because methyl bromide is being phased out as an ozone-depleting substance under the Montreal Protocol and because resistance to phosphine is increasing. Alternative fumigants also provide one strategy to manage resistance. To assess the effect of candidate fumigants on barley quality, malting and brewing trials were conducted with malting barley (Schooner), 9. 4 % moisture content, fumigated with carbonyl sulphide (COS), ethyl formate (EF) and carbon disulphide (CS 2) at concentrations of 20, 90 and 36 mg/L respectively for 7 days at 20 Â°C in riveted steel silos containing 33 t of barley. The appropriate industry body, the Malting and Brewing Industry Barley Technical Committee (MBIBTC) set the quality parameters to be evaluated and allocated work to the appropriate quality laboratories. Germination of fumigated barley was not affected by the fumigants. Residues of COS, EF and CS 2 in <b>outloading</b> barley samples were 0. 085 Â± 0. 0052, 0. 4 Â± 0. 1 and 2. 22 Â± 0. 07 mg/kg respectively, which were below the experimental permits of maximum residue levels (MRL). Residues of COS, EF and CS 2 in malt, wort and beer were indistinguishable from those in unfumigated (or non-fumigated) barley. Ethyl formate and CS 2 affected wort in increasing the apparent attenuation limit (AAL) and CS 2 affected barley colour. Sulphur volatiles in the trial beer made from EF and CS 2 (unlike COS) fumigated barley decreased significantly. Beer from COS, EF and CS 2 fumigated barley had a somewhat higher 24 -hour chill haze level (0. 62 â 0. 84) than beer from the untreated barley (0. 53). The total alcohols and isoamyl acetate increased in beer made from EF fumigated barley. Carbonyl sulphide, EF and CS 2, however, {{had no effect on}} beer flavour or quality...|$|E
