They burned Rocheport to the ground on October 2; the town was under close scrutiny by Union forces, owing to the number of Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk maintained that the fire was accidental.

5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> many governments {{across the world}} passed {{legislation}} to combat terrorism. In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted. The first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in Germany. The second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence and law enforcement. Canada passed the Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, that nation's first anti-terrorism law. The United Kingdom passed the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. New Zealand enacted the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002.|$|E

After {{receiving}} news on the Chinese attack against the 25th Division across the Kuryong River, Paik had also directed his division to defend against the upcoming Chinese counteroffensive. As the morning came on November 27, the Chinese troops around Taechon did not stop their assault even under punishing UN air strikes, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> spilled into US 24th Infantry Division's area.

The British troops moved forward into BÃ©nouville and cleared the Germans in house to house fighting. By midday, most of the missing men from the 7th Parachute Battalion had arrived at the bridges. Despite the ferocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> the battalion and the coup-de-main force were able to hold the bridges until 19:00, when the leading elements of the British 3rd Infantry Division arrived and began to relieve the airborne troops, a process that was completed around 01:00 7 June.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The DECT Standard Cipher (DSC) is a {{proprietary}} stream cipher used for enciphering payload of DECT transmissions such as cordless telephone calls. The algorithm was kept secret, but {{a team of}} cryptologists reverse-engineered it and published a {{way to reduce the}} key space when enough known keystreams are available [4]. <b>The</b> <b>attack</b> consists <b>of</b> two phases: At first, the keystreams are analyzed to build up an underdetermined linear equation system. In the second phase, a bruteforce attack is performed where the equation system limits <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> potentially valid keys. In this paper, we present an improved variant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> as well as an optimized FPGA implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second phase, which can be used with our improved variant or with <b>the</b> original <b>attack.</b> Our improvement to <b>the</b> first phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> is able to more than double <b>the</b> success probability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> depending <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> available keystreams.
