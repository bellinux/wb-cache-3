5|$|After {{the closing}} in 1991 the {{foundation}} Stiftelsen Rjukanbanen {{was established to}} ensure that the railway remained in an <b>operational</b> <b>condition,</b> and kept the two railway ferries and some of the rolling stock in <b>operational</b> <b>condition.</b> Norsk Transport retained for a period maintenance of the Rjukan Line, while the Tinnoset Line remained part of the rail network maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The foundation operated ad-hoc charter services on both the Tinnoset Line and the Rjukan Line, as well as with both railway ferries. By 2004 the foundation had run out of money, and closed down.|$|E

5|$|Because {{it was a}} {{self-contained}} section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and the branch line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes set on the Tube even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate signage, as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are maintained in <b>operational</b> <b>condition,</b> and a train of ex-Northern line 1972 tube stock is permanently stabled on the branch. This train can be driven {{up and down the}} branch for filming. The physical connection with the Piccadilly line northbound tracks remains, but requires manual operation.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December 1997, NSB's board {{decided to}} {{purchase}} eleven of the locomotives, excluding number 664. This {{was based on}} an agreement whereby NSB would receive compensation for the incurred losses owing to late delivery and under-performance. Siemens guaranteed that ten of eleven locomotives would be operational at any time. All units were again grounded in January 1998, following two fires. Siemens had between 15 and 20 employees stationed in Trondheim to fix the issues. Regularity on the Nordland Line plummeted from 67 to 46 percent with the introduction of Di6. NSB was forced to keep 15 Di3s, which were up to 42 years old, in <b>operational</b> <b>condition</b> to keep services running. The extra costs of keeping the Di3s running were about NOK50 million per year. These costs would continue until NSB could take delivery of new locomotives, which could take up to three years from the time of order. One contributing factor was a 25percent extra wage for engineers for having above-regulation noise levels in the Di3 cabs. Two Di3s were often run along with a Di6 in a train as backup; should the Di6 fail, the Di3 would continue hauling the train.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} enabler {{towards the}} successful deployment {{of any new}} element/feature to the cellular network is the investigation and characterization of the <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> where its introduction will enhance performance. Even though there has been significant research activity on the potential of device-to-device (D 2 D) communications, there are currently no clear indications of whether D 2 D communications are actually able to provide benefits {{for a wide range}} of <b>operational</b> <b>conditions,</b> thus justifying their introduction to the system. This paper attempts to fill this gap by taking a stochastic geometry approach on characterizing the set (region) of <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> for which D 2 D communications enhance performance in terms of average user rate. For the practically interesting case of a heavy loaded network, the operational region is provided in closed form as a function of a variety of parameters such as maximum D 2 D link distances and user densities, reflecting a wide range of <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> (points). It is shown that under the appropriate deployment scheme, D 2 D communications can indeed be beneficial not only for the usually considered regime of "proximal communications" but to a wide range of <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> that include D 2 D link distances comparable to the distance to the cellular access point and considerably large user densities.

40|$|The spline {{section of}} {{helicopter}} gearbox structure {{is susceptible to}} fatigue crack, and non-redundant characteristic leads {{to the need for}} early flaw detection strategies. Acoustic Emission (AE) method relies on propagating elastic waves due to release of energy from active flaws. The initiation of damage is identified using the features of AE waveforms such as energy, amplitude and frequency centroid. The characteristics of the AE features are influenced by sensor type, sensor location and gearbox <b>operational</b> <b>conditions.</b> In this study, the AE data was collected from a helicopter gearbox with a notched spline section and realistic <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> using two different AE sensors located at two different positions. The data collection was conducted over one year under various <b>operational</b> <b>conditions.</b> The AE features were extracted from long duration waveforms (100 milliseconds) at every pre-defined time step (every 5 seconds). The frequency domain features of frequency centroid and energy distribution in various frequency bands were compared with gearbox <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> such as torque, lift, gyroscopic moment, and temperature. The influences of sensor location, sensor type and <b>operational</b> <b>conditions</b> on the AE features are presented in order to decouple their influences from the AE features due to damage. The comparison between the predicted crack growth time using the AE data and the observed crack initiation shows that the AE method using frequency domain features of streamed waveforms has great potential to identify the crack initiation when the sensor type and location are preserved. 1...|$|R
