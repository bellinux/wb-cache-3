25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen,</b> the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E

He offers a prize to whoever can make it to a gallows and tie a band around a hanged man's ankle. Each {{challenger}} is thwarted by demons and runs back to the king's hall in fear. However, Nera succeeds, and the dead man then asks for a drink. Nera carries him {{on his back and}} they stop at three houses. They enter the third, where the dead man drinks and spits it on the householders, killing them. Returning, Nera sees a fairy host burning the king's hall and slaughtering those inside. He follows the host through a portal into the Otherworld. Nera learns that what he saw was only a vision <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> the next Samhain unless something is done. He is able to return to the hall and warns the king.|$|E

40|$|Temporal projection, {{the process}} <b>of</b> {{predicting}} <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> when a robot executes its plan, {{is essential for}} autonomous service robots to successfully plan their missions. This paper describes a causal model of the behavior exhibited by a mobile robot when running concurrent reactive plans. The model represents aspects of robot behavior that cannot be represented by most action models used in AI planning: it represents the temporal structure of continuous control processes, several modes of their interferences, and various kinds of uncertainty. This enhanced expressiveness enables robot action planning systems to predict, and therefore forestall, various kinds of behavior aws including missed deadlines whilst exploiting incidental opportunities. The proposed causal model is experimentally validated. 1 1 Introduction Temporal projection, the process <b>of</b> predicting <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> when a robot executes its plan, is essential for autonomous service robots to successfully plan their [...] ...|$|R

He later attends Ken and Emma's delayed wedding, only to find that Ken has ended the relationship as a result of Emma's feelings for Will. She announces her intention to leave McKinley High School, explaining that it will be too painful for her to carry on working with Will and Ken. Back at school, Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) suspends cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) for leaking the glee club's set list, and has Will reinstated as the director of New Directions. The glee club members show Will their trophy and perform [...] "My Life Would Suck Without You" [...] for him. As Emma prepares to leave the school, Will chases after her and stops her with a kiss.

500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E

Before Marty has a chance to get out of the car, Morgan says action, and two criminals come onto the screen on a motorbike. Trevor jumps off and breaks into the jewellery store. The other remains outside until a police car comes drifting from the right hand side of the arena. When the other thief comes out to find the motorbike gone, he runs over to the rally car and opens the door to find Marty sitting inside. The thief then proceeds to throw Marty out of the car before jumping in himself and driving the car in donuts around Marty. Annoyed, Morgan cuts the scene and sends Marty to catering to get some coffee and donuts.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} component of Keynes' theory was that the three plates from the 1794 print reprinted in 1795, formed a part of Series b, not Series a. However, if they are included with Series a (such as in Bindman's The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake), they come at the end; plates numbered I & II to refute the theories of the previous plates, followed by the 'Therefore' plate to bring the work to a close. As such, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that the 1794 print represents a twelve plate abridgement (the twelve plates are a1, a2/b2, a3-9, b3-4 and b12). They argue that [...] "the b-series plates provide a brief but bold refutation of the empirical and materialist principles offered on the preceding pages and indicate the irony with which Blake offers {{the first group of}} aphorisms." [...] They especially argue that the abridgement theory is supported by plates a9 and b3, which is the cross over point from irony to refutation. Plate a9 depicts a prone figure with his head on the right, whereas plate b3 is a mirror image, a figure with his head on the left; [...] "this visual reversal complements the sudden change of philosophical perspective in the accompanying text." [...] The plates are also ideologically in direct opposition; they both deal with perceptions and organs of sense, but whereas a9 asserts that man can experience through such organs only, b3 states that this is patently false, and perceptions can go beyond organs of sense. Plate b4 elaborates on this theory, and plate b12 fulfils the prophecy <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> [...] "when we know more." [...] Thus the series forms a coherent, if brief, statement. As to the question of why Blake omitted the rest of the plates, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that plates b6-11 deal with issues which thematically wouldn't fit into the abridgement – hence the 1794 print represents a streamlined version of the overall thesis; [...] "a statement on the empiricist theory of perception followed by its direct and forceful rebuttal." ...|$|E
