40|$|<b>Orphan</b> <b>genes</b> are protein-coding {{regions that}} have no {{recognizable}} homolog in distantly related species. A substantial fraction of coding regions in any genome sequenced consists of <b>orphan</b> <b>genes,</b> but the evolutionary and functional significance of <b>orphan</b> <b>genes</b> is not understood. We present a reanalysis of the Drosophila melanogaster proteome that shows {{that there are still}} between 26 % and 29 % of all proteins without a significant match with noninsect sequences, and that these orphans are underrepresented in genetic screens. To analyze the characteristics of <b>orphan</b> <b>genes</b> in Drosophila, we used sequence comparisons between cDNAs retrieved from two Drosophila yakuba libraries and their corresponding A melanogaster orthologs. We find that a cDNA library from adults yields twice as many <b>orphan</b> <b>genes</b> as Such a library from embryos. The <b>orphan</b> <b>genes</b> evolve oil average more than three times faster than nonorphan genes, although the width of the evolutionary rate distribution is similar for the two classes. In particular, some <b>orphan</b> <b>genes</b> show very low substitution rates that are comparable to otherwise highly conserved genes.

40|$|Genome {{annotation}} {{produces a}} considerable number of putative proteins lacking sequence similarity to known proteins. These are referred to as “orphans. ” The proportion of <b>orphan</b> <b>genes</b> varies among genomes, and is independent of genome size. In the present study, we show that the proportion of <b>orphan</b> <b>genes</b> roughly correlates with the isolation index of organisms (IIO), an indicator introduced in the present study, which represents the degree of isolation of a given genome as measured by sequence similarity. However, there are outlier genomes with respect to the linear correlation, consisting of those genomes that may contain excess amounts of <b>orphan</b> <b>genes.</b> Comparisons of genome sequences among closely related strains revealed that some of the annotated genes are not conserved, suggesting that they are ORFs occurring by chance. Exclusion of these non-conserved ORFs within closely related genomes improved the correlation between the proportion of <b>orphan</b> <b>genes</b> and the IIO values. Assuming that the correlation holds in general, this relationship was used to estimate the number of “authentic ” <b>orphan</b> <b>genes</b> in a genome.

40|$|Microsatellites {{are short}} tandem repeats {{of one to}} six bases in genomic DNA. As {{microsatellites}} are highly polymorphic and {{play a vital role}} in gene function and recombination, they are an attractive subject for research in evolution and in the genetics and breeding of animals and plants. Orphan genes have no known homologs in existing databases. Using bioinformatic computation and statistical analysis, we identified 19, 26 orphan genes in the rice (Oryza sativa ssp. Japanica cv. Nipponbare) proteome. We found that a larger proportion of orphan genes are expressed after sexual maturation and under environmental pressure than nonorphan genes. Orphan genes generally have shorter protein lengths and intron size, and are faster evolving. Additionally, orphan genes have fewer PROSITE patterns with larger pattern sizes than those in nonorphan genes. The average microsatellite content and the percentage of trinucleotide repeats in orphan genes are also significantly higher than in nonorphan genes. Microsatellites are found less often in PROSITE patterns in orphan genes. Taken together, these <b>orphan</b> <b>gene</b> characteristics suggest that microsatellites play an important role in <b>orphan</b> <b>gene</b> evolution and expression.

40|$|Many {{nematodes}} form dauer larvae {{when exposed}} to unfavorable conditions, representing an example of phenotypic plasticity and a major survival and dispersal strategy. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the regulation of dauer induction is a model for pheromone, insulin, and steroid-hormone signaling. Recent studies in Pristionchus pacificus revealed substantial natural variation in various aspects of dauer development, i. e. pheromone production and sensing and dauer longevity and fitness. One intriguing example is a strain from Ohio, having extremely long-lived dauers associated with very high fitness and often forming the most dauers in response to other strains' pheromones, including the reference strain from California. While such examples have been suggested to represent intraspecific competition among strains, the molecular mechanisms underlying these dauer-associated patterns are currently unknown. We generated recombinant-inbred-lines between the Californian and Ohioan strains and used quantitative-trait-loci analysis to investigate the molecular mechanism determining natural variation in dauer development. Surprisingly, we discovered that the <b>orphan</b> <b>gene</b> dauerless controls dauer formation by copy number variation. The Ohioan strain has one dauerless copy causing high dauer formation, whereas the Californian strain has two copies, resulting in strongly reduced dauer formation. Transgenic animals expressing multiple copies do not form dauers. dauerless is exclusively expressed in CAN neurons, and both CAN ablation and dauerless mutations increase dauer formation. Strikingly, dauerless underwent several duplications and acts in parallel or downstream of steroid-hormone signaling but upstream of the nuclear-hormone-receptor daf- 12. We identified the novel or fast-evolving gene dauerless as inhibitor of dauer development. Our findings reveal the importance of gene duplications and copy number variations for <b>orphan</b> <b>gene</b> function and suggest daf- 12 as major target for dauer regulation.

40|$|All {{organisms are}} known to contain {{a unique set of}} genes called 2 ̆ 7 orphan genes 2 ̆ 7, which do not share any {{similarity}} with genes or protein domains in other evolutionary lineages. Such orphan genes can impart unique traits to the organism resulting in lineage specific evolutionary innovation. In this work Brassicaceae specific orphan genes in Arabidopsis thaliana were analysed for their functionality in abiotic stress responses. Abiotic stress responsive orphan genes were identified based on their differential expression under various stress conditions and were functionally screened using three different approaches; loss-of-function screen, gain-of-function screen and gain-of-function screen by heterologous expression. From the loss of function screen, one <b>orphan</b> <b>gene</b> (ASR 50) was identified which confers tolerance to salt stress when knocked out. The mutant asr 50 - 1 also shows high photosynthetic efficiency under salt stress compared to wild type. The gain-of-function screen in A. thaliana resulted in two promising candidates, ASR 35 and ASR 63, which conferred tolerance to salt stress and iron deficiency respectively. The third approach, a gain-of-function screen by heterologous expression using yeast stress sensitive mutants, identified a total of 27 orphan genes conferring varied degrees of stress tolerance or sensitivity to different abiotic stress conditions. Importantly, this approach also indicated that <b>orphan</b> <b>gene</b> functionality is transferable to other lineages. 	The overexpression lines of ASR 63 (35 S::ASR 63) were further analysed to identify the possible mechanism of tolerance conferred under iron deficiency. The results suggested that the 35 S::ASR 63 lines accumulated more iron in shoots and in the mature seeds compared to wild type control. Furthermore, the transgenic lines were found to produce higher levels of the antioxidants glutathione and ascorbic acid in the shoots which possibly maintains favourable redox balance under iron deficiency for the normal uptake of iron. In addition, the seeds of 35 S::ASR 63 lines show germination sensitivity to ABA and the GA inhibitor PAC which needs further characterization. Our hypothesis is that ASR 63 is a de novo gene originated due to the divergent transcription of a 2 ̆ 7 bifunctional 2 ̆ 7 promoter of an upstream gene.

We demonstrate that transcription from the promoter upstream of ygaVP is constitutive in a ygaVP mutant, suggesting that YgaV is an autoregulated, TBT-inducible repressor...|$|R
50|$|Novel <b>orphan</b> <b>genes</b> {{continually}} arise de novo from non-coding sequences. These novel genes may {{be sufficiently}} beneficial {{to be swept}} to fixation by selection. Or, more likely, they will fade back into the non-genic background. This latter option is supported by research in Drosophila showing that young genes are more likely go extinct.|$|R
