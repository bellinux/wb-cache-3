5|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, made {{the development of}} an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939. Progress was slow until the arrival of the British MAUD Committee report in late 1941, which indicated that only 5–10 kilograms of isotopically enriched uranium-235 was needed for a bomb instead <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> of un-enriched uranium and a neutron moderator (e.g. heavy water).|$|E
5|$|The {{fire was}} fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, {{but also by}} the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and {{gunpowder}} stored in the riverside district.

50|$|Agricultural {{production}} is heavily biased toward crops, which in 2006 accounted for 64% of gross agricultural output. The principal agricultural products are grains (mostly wheat and barley), potatoes, vegetables, grapes (both table and wine), and fruits. In 2006, Armenia produced 212,500 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> grain, 539,500 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> potatoes, 915,000 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> vegetables and melons, 286,000 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> fruits, and 201,400 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> grapes.

5|$|The mining washed {{hundreds}} of thousands <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> of earth and sediment into the Little Applegate and its tributaries, devastated the landscape. The Sterlingville post office opened in 1879, but was closed four years later as the town's population declined. Buncom's post office opened in 1896. By 1910, however, most mining operations had ended, and it was closed in 1918. Hydraulic mines were reopened from 1933 to 1957 during the Great Depression. Three buildings remain in Buncom, but Sterlingville was abandoned and destroyed.|$|E

As early as December 1961, the 3rd Truck Transportation Group of PAVN's General Rear Services Department had become the first motor transport unit fielded by North Vietnamese to work the trail {{and the use of}} motor transport escalated.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{methods used to}} produce {{synthetic}} diamond. The original method uses high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) and is still widely used because of its relatively low cost. The process involves large presses that can weigh hundreds <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> to produce a pressure of 5GPa at 1500°C. The second method, using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), creates a carbon plasma over a substrate onto which the carbon atoms deposit to form diamond. Other methods include explosive formation (forming detonation nanodiamonds) and sonication of graphite solutions.|$|E

Sodium chloride is extensively used for anti-icing and de-icing {{and as a}} preservative; sodium bicarbonate is mainly used for cooking. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability; though potassium is the better ion in most cases, sodium is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight.

5|$|Worldwide {{production}} of thorium {{is a few}} tens <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> per year. The low demand makes working mines for extraction of thorium alone not profitable, and it is almost always extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of {{production of}} other minerals. The current reliance on monazite for production is due to thorium being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as thorite contain more thorium and could easily be used for production if demand rose. Present knowledge {{of the distribution of}} thorium resources is poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor.|$|E
5|$|Along the Makran coast, heavy {{rainfall}} washed away hundreds of houses, leaving residents {{to ride out}} the storm along adjacent hillsides. Between Jiwani and Gwadar, Phet's rains washed away a bridge and damaged several portions of the Makran Coastal Highway, while also halting service for Pakistan Railways. Ten hours of rainfall in Gwadar flooded the port, damaging dozens of boats and launches. Throughout the town, Phet wrecked around 10,000houses. The storm flooded coastal neighborhoods, inundating the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation building which temporarily lost its capability for FM broadcasting. For five days, the town and other coastal locations were without power or natural gas due to the storm. Elsewhere, the rains filled and washed away irrigation dams, and swept away fishing boats. Heavy rainfall also caused power outages in Hyderabad. Along the Sindh coast, the storm wrecked around 3,000houses made largely of straw.

5|$|Britain {{contributed to}} the Manhattan Project by helping {{initiate}} the effort to build the first atomic bombs in the United States during World War II, and helped carry it through to completion in August 1945 by supplying crucial expertise. Following the discovery of nuclear fission in uranium, scientists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch at the University of Birmingham calculated, in March 1940, that the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235 was as little as , and would explode {{with the power of}} thousands <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> of dynamite. The Frisch–Peierls memorandum prompted Britain to create an atomic bomb project, known as Tube Alloys. Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist working in Britain, was instrumental in making the results of the British MAUD Report known in the United States in 1941 by a visit in person. Initially the British project was larger and more advanced, but after the United States entered the war, the American project soon outstripped and dwarfed its British counterpart. The British government then decided to shelve its own nuclear ambitions, and participate in the American project.|$|E

Shortly after 9:00 am on Friday 21 October 1966 one of these tips collapsed, sending thousands <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> of semi-liquid waste hurtling towards Aberfan. The point of impact was Pantglas Junior School, where morning lessons were beginning. The school was half buried; inside, 109 children and 5 teachers were killed. A further 7 children and 23 adults lost their lives outside the school, in the streets or adjoining houses.

5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests that were carried between 1962 and 1969, {{the last one}} was {{the most powerful and}} had the highest yield of transuranium elements. Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond. However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount, and collection <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 1 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which demonstrated the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock. Shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.|$|E

In the dependence on the atomic mass number, the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes, due to their higher fission rates. The major practical problem of the entire proposal was however collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount and collection <b>of</b> <b>tons</b> of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude.
