5|$|After its creation, SEATO {{quickly became}} {{insignificant}} militarily, {{as most of}} its member nations contributed very little to the alliance. While SEATO military forces held joint military training, they were never employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to intervene in conflicts in Laos because France and the United Kingdom rejected use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>action.</b> As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962. Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied {{because of lack of}} British and French cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Loch Leven Castle is {{a ruined}} castle {{on an island}} in Loch Leven, in the Perth and Kinross local {{authority}} area of Scotland. Possibly built around 1300, the castle was the location <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> during the Wars of Scottish Independence (1296–1357). In {{the latter part of}} the 14th century, the castle was granted by his uncle to William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, and remained in Douglas' hands for the next 300 years. Mary, Queen of Scots was imprisoned here in 1567–1568, and forced to abdicate as queen, before escaping with the help of her gaoler's family. In 1588, the Queen's gaoler inherited the title Earl of Morton, and moved away from the castle. It was bought, in 1675, by Sir William Bruce, who used the castle as a focal point in his garden; it was never again used as a residence.|$|E
