5|$|An {{alternative}} explanation {{proposed by}} Friedwardt Winterberg {{is that in}} the course of a gravitational collapse and in reaching the event horizon <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> all matter disintegrates into a burst of gamma radiation.|$|E
5|$|Whenever {{the ratio}} of an object's mass to its radius becomes {{sufficiently}} large, general relativity predicts the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape. In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, neutron stars of around 1.4 solar masses, and stellar black holes with a few to a few dozen solar masses, {{are thought to be}} the final state for the evolution of massive stars. Usually a galaxy has one supermassive black hole with a few million to a few billion solar masses in its center, and its presence is thought to have {{played an important role in}} the formation of the galaxy and larger cosmic structures.|$|E
5|$|During that period, general {{relativity}} remained {{something of a}} curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly superior to Newtonian gravity, being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters (""). Similarly, a 1919 expedition led by Eddington confirmed {{general relativity}}'s prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, making Einstein instantly famous. Yet the theory entered the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, {{now known as the}} golden age of general relativity. Physicists began to understand the concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> and to identify quasars as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations. Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power, and relativistic cosmology, too, became amenable to direct observational tests.|$|E
40|$|In {{gravitational}} thermodynamics, {{the origin}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole’s</b> entropy is the topology of its instanton or constrained instanton. We {{prove that the}} entropy <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary nonrotating <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> is one quarter {{the sum of the}} products of the Euler characteristics of its horizons with their respective areas. The Gauss-Bonnet-like form of the action is not only crucial for the evaluation, but also for the existence of the entropy. This result covers all previous results on the entropy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonrotating <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> with <b>a</b> regular instanton. The argument can be readily extended into the lower or higher dimensional model. The problem of quantum creation <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> is completely resolved.

25|$|The {{event horizon}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> may {{be thought of}} as a surface moving outward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between {{escaping}} and falling back. The event horizon of a white hole is a surface moving inward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between being swept outward and succeeding in reaching the center. They are two different kinds of horizons—the horizon of a white hole is like the horizon <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> turned inside-out.|$|E
40|$|We study <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> {{radiation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Reissner-Nordstrom <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> with <b>an</b> {{electric charge}} {{in the framework of}} quantum gravity. Based on a canonical quantization for a spherically symmetric geometry, under physically plausible assumptions, we solve the Wheeler-De Witt equation in the regions not only between the outer apparent horizon and the spatial infinity but also between the spacetime singularity and the inner apparent horizon, and then show that the mass loss rate <b>of</b> <b>an</b> evaporating <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> due to thermal radiation agrees with the semiclassical result when we choose an integration constant properly by physical reasoning. Furthermore, we also solve the Wheeler-De Witt equation in the region between the inner Cauchy horizon and the outer apparent horizon, and show that the mass loss rate <b>of</b> <b>an</b> evaporating <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> has the same expression. The present study is the natural generalization of the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Schwarzschild <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> to that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> charged Reissner-Nordstrom <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> Comment: improved discussion in Section 3 and typos. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1503. 0214...|$|R

25|$|A {{detailed}} study of the quantum geometry <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> horizon has been made using loop quantum gravity.

25|$|Black {{holes are}} {{predicted}} by the theory of general relativity. According to classical general relativity, no matter or information can flow from the interior <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> to an outside observer, although quantum effects may allow deviations from this strict rule. The existence of black holes in the universe is well supported, both theoretically and by astronomical observation.|$|E

25|$|The entropy is {{proportional}} to the logarithm of the number of microstates, the ways a system can be configured microscopically while leaving the macroscopic description unchanged. Black hole entropy is deeply puzzling — it says that the logarithm of the number of states <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> {{is proportional}} to the area of the horizon, not the volume in the interior.|$|E
25|$|The time {{reversal}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> {{would be}} a hypothetical object known as a white hole. From the outside they appear similar. While a black hole has a beginning and is inescapable, a white hole has an ending and cannot be entered. The forward light-cones of a white hole are directed outward; and its backward light-cones are directed towards the center.|$|E
25|$|The {{formulae}} {{from the}} previous section are only applicable if the laws of gravity are approximately valid {{all the way down}} to the Planck scale. In particular, for black holes with masses below the Planck mass (~), they result in impossible lifetimes below the Planck time (~). This is normally seen as an indication that the Planck mass is the lower limit on the mass <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E

50|$|Hawking {{radiation}} has {{a thermal}} spectrum. During most <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole's</b> lifetime, the radiation {{has a low}} temperature and is mainly {{in the form of}} massless particles such as photons and hypothetical gravitons. <b>As</b> the <b>black</b> <b>hole's</b> mass decreases, its temperature increases, becoming comparable to the Sun's by the time the <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> mass has decreased to 1019 kilograms. The hole then provides <b>a</b> temporary source <b>of</b> light during the general darkness of the <b>Black</b> <b>Hole</b> Era. During the last stages <b>of</b> its evaporation, <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> will emit not only massless particles, but also heavier particles, such as electrons, positrons, protons, and antiprotons.|$|R
25|$|An object {{can cross}} through {{the event horizon}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> from the outside, and then fall rapidly to the central region where our {{understanding}} of physics breaks down. Since within a black hole the forward light-cone is directed towards {{the center and the}} backward light-cone is directed outward, it is not even possible to define time-reversal in the usual manner. The only way anything can escape from a black hole is as Hawking radiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{holographic}} principle {{was inspired by}} black hole thermodynamics, which conjectures that the maximal entropy in any region scales with the radius squared, and not cubed as might be expected. In the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> the insight was that the informational content of all the objects that have fallen into the hole might be entirely contained in surface fluctuations of the event horizon. The {{holographic principle}} resolves the black hole information paradox {{within the framework of}} string theory.|$|E
25|$|In astrophysical {{systems with}} strong {{gravitational}} fields, {{such as those}} near the event horizon <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> -body simulations {{must take into account}} general relativity; such simulations are the domain of numerical relativity. Numerically simulating the Einstein field equations is extremely challenging and a parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), such as the Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations, is used if possible. The two-body problem in general relativity is analytically solvable only for the Kepler problem, in which one mass is assumed to be much larger than the other.|$|E

25|$|Time {{independent}} {{solutions to}} field equations do not emit radiation, because a time independent background conserves energy. Based on this principle, Hawking {{set out to}} show that black holes do not radiate. But, to his surprise, a careful analysis convinced him that they do, and {{in just the right}} way to come to equilibrium with a gas at a finite temperature. Hawking's calculation fixed the constant of proportionality at 1/4; the entropy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> is one quarter its horizon area in Planck units.|$|E
25|$|Like any {{physical}} system, {{a black hole}} has an entropy {{defined in terms of}} the number of different microstates that lead to the same macroscopic features. The Bekenstein–Hawking entropy formula gives the expected value of the entropy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole,</b> but by the 1990s, physicists still lacked a derivation of this formula by counting microstates in a theory of quantum gravity.

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{models of}} black hole evaporation {{lead to the}} black hole information paradox.
