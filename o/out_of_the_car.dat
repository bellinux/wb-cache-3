5|$|At a {{labelled}} building, {{the player}} can get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and enter, though enemies will only appear during certain {{times of the}} day. If the player arrives too early, the enemy gangsters will attempt to escape. If the player arrives too late, the building will be found vacant. A timetable of all meetings {{are included in the}} game's instruction manual. The aesthetic interior of buildings include two rooms, with limited decorations such as a pool table and chairs. Some buildings contain evidence bags which can be collected for extra points. Once the player comes into contact with an enemy, a separate window will appear which will display his name. The player can apprehend him by either catching or trapping him. Once caught, the player may take him to the city hall to interrogate him in order to receive information such as the location of the next gangster meetup. Points are gained by apprehending criminals, returning evidence bags or destroying cars.|$|E

Along {{the way he is}} chased by the police and a crowd of people, who presume he is rabid, but he escapes them by {{swimming}} across the Hudson River. Later he is attacked by a mongrel guard dog, but he refuses to run from the battle. He initially struggles to defend himself while muzzled, but then the other dog inadvertently bites through the strap holding the muzzle on, allowing Lad to quickly defeat him. When the Master and Mistress return from searching for Lad, they find him waiting on the porch.|$|E
5|$|One night, {{a pair of}} LAPD {{officers}} come in {{to speak}} to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community {{to bring in a}} suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence, in order to appease the black community. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat the officers into unconsciousness.|$|E
50|$|Refuelling was {{permitted}} from the 1994 season until <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2009 season. During this period, a pit stop involved about twenty mechanics, with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> completing <b>the</b> stop {{as quickly as}} possible. Stops generally lasted for six to twelve seconds {{depending on how much}} fuel is put into <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> However, if there is a problem, such as a fuel pump failing or the engine stalling, or repairs having to be made, it can take much longer. Cars were fuelled at a rate of more than 12 litres per second. This was accomplished by a fairly complex closed system that pumped air <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> fuel tank as the fuel was being pumped in.|$|R
50|$|In October 2006 another {{prisoner}} escaped whilst {{returning to}} Grendon. The inmate {{had been released}} on a temporary licence, and was being driven back to the prison by officers, when he jumped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moving <b>car</b> on to a motorway, and escaped.|$|R
50|$|On <b>the</b> night <b>of</b> May 20, {{hundreds}} of taxis led a large parade of buses, large trucks and <b>cars</b> toward <b>the</b> Provincial Office {{to meet the}} protest. As the drivers drove in the demonstration, the troops used tear gas, pulled them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> and beat them. These “drivers of democracy” showed up to support the citizens and <b>the</b> demonstration because <b>of</b> troop brutality witnessed earlier in the day, as well as <b>out</b> <b>of</b> anger after many taxi drivers were assaulted when trying to assist the injured and while taking people to the hospital. Some were shot after the drivers attempted to use the vehicles to block soldiers or as weapons.|$|R
5|$|Ritter leaves Scully {{staking out}} Fellig's apartment, but Scully is unnerved {{when she sees}} Fellig {{shooting}} photos of her out his window and bangs on his door, demanding to know how he took photos {{at a crime scene}} before the police even knew the crime had been committed. He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a prostitute who appears to be gray to him. Fellig tells Scully that the woman will be dead very soon. A pimp approaches the woman and begins to harass her. Scully leaps <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> with her gun, announcing that she is an FBI agent and handcuffing the pimp, but when the prostitute tries to flee, she is hit by a truck and killed.|$|E
5|$|The third {{practice}} session on Saturday saw limited running as well, as training was halted {{due to a}} massive crash by Carlos Sainz Jr.. The Spaniard lost control of his car going into turn 13, hit a wall {{and went on to}} crash into the safety barriers, burying the nose of his car in the process. The session was stopped while Sainz was taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and transported to hospital, albeit uninjured. Practice was not resumed afterwards and the time of 1:38.561 set by Nico Rosberg before the accident remained the fastest lap of the session. He was more than seven-tenths of a second faster than Valtteri Bottas in second, with Lewis Hamilton another tenth behind. Sainz's teammate Max Verstappen finished the session 17th fastest after spinning in the final corner.|$|E

2500|$|It was Ferrari's eighth one-two finish <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season. Barrichello said [...] "To win, it was very, very, very good... I got to {{the last}} corner, I didn't {{know what to do}} and nothing has been said. Michael was just very kind to, you know, let us finish equally. I guess I pointed a little bit in front, but, you know, what can we say?" [...] Schumacher said [...] "The end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race was not planned... We tried to cross the line {{together}} but failed by a tiny bit and in fact we did not know who had won until we got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> I just felt Rubens deserved to win this race." ...|$|R
50|$|The Force India VJM06 is a Formula One {{racing car}} {{designed}} and built by the Force India team {{for use in the}} 2013 season where it was driven by Paul di Resta and Adrian Sutil, who returned to the team after spending <b>the</b> 2012 season <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sport. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> was launched on 1 February 2013 at the team's base near the Silverstone Circuit, and is complete redesign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous year's <b>car.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a Wisconsin case (Zimmer v. City of Milwaukee), an {{uninsured driver}} {{of a car}} with faulty brakes hit and killed a six-year-old boy at a school {{crossing}}. The school crossing had a stop sign and a crossing guard. The plaintiff lawyer argued that the accident might have been avoided if the crossing guard, instead <b>of</b> signalling <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to stop, had attempted to get <b>the</b> child <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> path. <b>The</b> city (the crossing guard's employer) {{was found to be}} one percent at fault. Under proportionate liability (sometimes also called comparative negligence), the city would only have been liable for their one percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damages. However because the driver was uninsured (and also insolvent), the city had to pay 100% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damages.|$|R
5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian gets <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> A {{police officer}} gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter {{has to pay}} $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat {{which turns out to}} be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out of a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on the street for treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he was not a good dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E
