30|$|In case of tariff {{reduction}} by TPP-ASEAN countries too, export of Malaysia and Vietnam grows at a modest rate of 3.2 and 4.8 %, respectively, with the USA as a member. The corresponding rates {{in case of}} without the USA are 1.0 and 2.9 %, respectively. This implies that increased imports of these countries resulting from their <b>own</b> <b>tariff</b> cut also boost their exports to some extent. This is an indirect impact on the export resulting from increased import of intermediate goods following the {{tariff reduction}} by the TPP-ASEAN countries. However, for Brunei, export growth {{is found to be}} negative in response to its <b>own</b> <b>tariff</b> reduction. The top five sectors in scenario 3 (Table  6) are more or less same as in scenario 2 for all of the TPP-ASEAN countries, implying that increased import in response to their <b>own</b> <b>tariff</b> liberalization enhances the export growth more.|$|R

This output growth of services in scenario 3 could be explained through increased level of domestic production in the TPP-ASEAN countries resulting from increased import of intermediate goods entering into these economies in response to their <b>own</b> <b>tariff</b> reduction.|$|R

Following the result that a customs union dominates a free trade area, with coordination of domestic tax policies, we show that a free trade area may nevertheless be chosen if tariffs are determined endogenously through industry lobbying.

30|$|In {{response}} to their <b>own</b> <b>tariff</b> reduction, that in scenario 3, TPP-ASEAN countries experience a growth in their import, though the impact would vary among these four nations. While Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore register a modest import growth, Vietnam is witnessed {{to have a significant}} growth in import. In FTAs, the developing countries generally benefit most from their <b>own</b> <b>tariff</b> liberalization (Cimino-Isaacs and Schott 2016). Vietnam registers 8.2 and 7.2 % of import growth in the tariff reduction scenarios with the USA and without the USA, respectively (Table  4). USA is not included in Vietnam’s top import origins, so withdrawal of the USA from the TPP might have no major impact on the growth of import. In contrast, Malaysia is found to be affected more in terms of import growth with the omission of the USA from the TPP. The study finds that {{in the absence of the}} USA, Malaysia registers a negative growth in import (Table  4). The USA features among the top three import origins of Malaysia along with China and Singapore, so withdrawal of the USA undoubtedly has an adverse impact on Malaysia as far as the growth of import is concerned. For Brunei too, import growth reduces from 6.05 to 3.92 % when the USA is considered as the non-member of TPP. USA is among the top five import origins of Brunei. So, the withdrawal of the USA from the TPP results in decline of total import growth for the country.|$|R

The Confederacy collected a mere $3.5 million in tariff revenue from the Civil War start to end and had to resort to inflation and confiscation instead for revenue.|$|R
50|$|According to an {{analysis}} by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Trump's proposed tariff increases on China and Mexico could, if China and Mexico retaliate with their <b>own</b> <b>tariff</b> increases, push the U.S. into recession and cost 5 million U.S. jobs. Even more limited retaliation by China and Mexico, or an aborted trade war (the Trump administration backs down from its tariff increases one year into them) would hit the U.S. economy hard. Gary Clyde Hufbauer, senior fellow at PIIE, notes that there is ample precedent and scope for a U.S. president to unilaterally raise tariffs as Trump has vowed to do, and that efforts to block Trump's actions through the courts, or by amending the authorizing statutes in Congress, would be difficult and time-consuming.|$|R

With regards to between-industry shifts, tariff reductions expanded sectors which were initially female intensive. With regards to within-industry shifts, we find a positive association between reductions in export tariffs (U. S. tariffs on Mexican goods) and hiring of women in skilled blue-collar occupations. Finally, we find suggestive evidence that household bargaining power shifted in favor of women. Expenditures shifted from goods associated with male preference, such as men’s clothing and tobacco and alcohol, to those associated with female preference such as women’s clothing and education. ...|$|R
