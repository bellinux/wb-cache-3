Sivanath Sastri had class friends such as Aghore Nath Gupta and Vijay Krishna Goswami, who had joined the Brahmo Samaj. Another Brahmo, Umesh Chandra Mukhopadhyay influenced him. He started attending prayers of the Brahmo Samaj against the wishes of his father. Keshub Chunder Sen formally initiated him into the Brahmo Samaj in 1869. Twenty other persons were also initiated on the same day. That included Ananda Mohan Bose, Krishna Behari Sen, Rajaninath Roy and Srinath Dutta. He abandoned his sacred thread.

The Comité secretly received funds from the CIA, with the understanding that this fact could prove [...] "very embarrassing" [...] and that a new source would eventually need to be found. Although the Comité was theoretically an intelligence agency, it also had some police powers. It could order the arrest <b>of</b> <b>anybody</b> suspected of being a communist, and had oversight over all army and police authorities.

The film likely saw a wide national release, advertisements in theaters are known in Indiana, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave the most detailed review of the trade publications by summing up the scenario and approving of the plot and the good acting in the production. The reviewer concluded, [...] "Not only are the leading roles well portrayed, but the minor parts are quite well done in the picture - the dismissed stenographer and the old landlady actually look and act their parts. There is a pleasing, symmetrical competence in the whole cast." [...] The production was reviewed positively by The Moving Picture World and concludes with the statement, [...] "The story ends there without a suspicion <b>of</b> <b>anybody</b> {{falling in love with}} anybody else, a restraint which will be duly appreciated." [...] Bower's notes that many Thanhouser plots conclude with the romance and the reviewer noted this change was a welcome one for this production.
