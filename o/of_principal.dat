5|$|The Principal acts as {{the chief}} {{executive}} officer of the university under the authority of the Board and the Senate, and supervises and directs the academic and administrative work of the university and of its teaching and non-teaching staff. Since 1974, principals have been appointed for five-year terms, renewable subject to review. The formal authority for the appointment of the Principal rests under the Royal Charter with the Board of Trustees although recent principals have been selected by a joint committee of trustees and senators. Daniel Woolf has served as the twentieth principal, serving since 1 September 2009. The office of the vice-chancellor has typically been held by the incumbent principal. In 1961, an amendment was secured by the Board to separate the office <b>of</b> <b>principal</b> from vice-chancellor if it wished. The first, and only person to ever hold the office of vice-chancellor, but not the office <b>of</b> <b>principal,</b> was William Archibald Mackintosh.|$|E

Even though the entrance conditions are different in distinct European countries, some issues they deal with are similar.

40|$|This study {{examined}} principals 2 ̆ 7 and teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions regarding both {{the importance of}} certain leadership skills and the ratings <b>of</b> <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 actual skills. There are strong theoretical bases for the use <b>of</b> <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 and teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions in this study. The analysis of perceptions of leadership skills can lead to: (1) an increased awareness <b>of</b> <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 strengths and weaknesses; (2) greater communication between principals and teachers; and, (3) hopefully, increased productivity on the part <b>of</b> <b>principals</b> and teachers. The population for this study included a group <b>of</b> twenty-eight <b>principals</b> {{who participated in the}} Confederation of Oregon School Administrators Assessment Center, and teachers in those principals 2 ̆ 7 schools. These principals represented the total number of Assessment Center participants who were promoted to their positions subsequent to their participation in the Center. Assessment Center predictions ratings <b>of</b> these <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills were compared to teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings <b>of</b> the same <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills. Research questions sought information in the following areas: (1) principals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their own skills; (2) principals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the importance of given skills; (3) principals 2 ̆ 7 predictions of teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of the importance <b>of</b> skills; (4) <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 predictions of teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings <b>of</b> <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 actual skills; (5) teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions <b>of</b> <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills; (6) teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the importance of given skills; and, (7) Assessment Center predictions ratings <b>of</b> <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills. The methodology for this study combined survey research with information provided by the COSA Assessment Center. Mailed surveys were used to collect data regarding principals 2 ̆ 7 and teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of leadership skills. The results of this study suggested that there is a general agreement between principals and teachers regarding principals 2 ̆ 7 leadership skills. Additionally, the predictions made regarding principals 2 ̆ 7 skills by the Assessment Center accurately reflected teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions <b>of</b> the same <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills in the field. The area of greatest difference in this study was in principals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings. Principals generally predicted that teachers would rate the importance of skills lower than teachers actually rated them. Because teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions <b>of</b> <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills are generally accurate, it can be concluded that teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings <b>of</b> their <b>principals</b> can {{play an important role in}} the total process <b>of</b> <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 evaluations...|$|R
