5|$|Among Presbyterians, communion was {{the central}} {{occasion}} of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals {{as part of a}} communion season. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving their knowledge of the Shorter Catechism. They were then given communion tokens that entitled them {{to take part in the}} ceremony. Long tables were set up in the middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem Holy Fair. They could also be <b>occasions</b> <b>for</b> evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark.|$|E

Lê Duẩn {{is believed to have been}} in bad health during this period; he had travelled to the Soviet Union on several <b>occasions</b> <b>for</b> medical treatment during the late-1970s and early 1980s. It was reported that Lê Duẩn did not lead the party delegates of the 5th National Congress to the Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum because of his deteriorating health. Lê Duẩn looked both feeble and old; he had problems reading his report to the Congress.|$|E

5|$|On 8 June 1972 the National Assembly of Bhutan {{approved}} Resolution 28, bringing {{into effect}} National Flag Rules {{drafted by the}} Cabinet. The rules have eight provisions covering the description and symbolism of the flag's colouring, fields and design elements. Other rules relate {{to the size of}} the flag as well as flag protocol including the appropriate places and <b>occasions</b> <b>for</b> flying the flag and who may display the flag on cars. In general, the flag is given as much respect as the Bhutanese state and the head of state. As in the United States Flag Code, no other flags must be placed higher than the Bhutanese flag, the flag cannot be used as a cover or drape (with some exceptions) and the flag must not touch the ground. Other provisions include prohibitions on including the design in other objects or in a logo. Exceptionally, the flag may be used to drape coffins, but only those of high-ranking state officials such as ministers or military personnel.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than its}} use in the kulintang ensemble, the agung also had other non-ensemble uses among the Maguindanao and Maranao. The agung {{has been used to}} warn others of {{impending}} danger, announcing the time of day and other important <b>occasions.</b> <b>For</b> instance, long ago the sultan would beat the agung repeatedly to announce the onset of a meeting or during the fasting month of Ramadhan, the agung would ring either {{at three in the morning}} to indicate the signal to eat (sawl) or at sunset, to mark the end for fasting that day. And supposedly due to the deep, loud sound the agung produces, people believed that it possessed supernatural powers. For instance, during an earthquake, the locals of Maguindanao would strike the agung in a fast, loud rhythm called baru-baru, believing its vibrations would either lessen or even halt the jolt of an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The Asiatic lion is {{a common}} motif in Chinese art. They were first used in art during the late Spring and Autumn period (fifth or sixth century BC), and became much more popular during the Han Dynasty (206 BC – AD 220), when {{imperial}} guardian lions started {{to be placed in}} front of imperial palaces for protection. Because lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of Buddhist art to China in the Tang Dynasty (after the sixth century AD), lions usually were wingless, with shorter, thicker bodies, and curly manes. The lion dance is a form of traditional dance in Chinese culture in which performers mimic a lion's movements in a lion costume, often with musical accompaniment from cymbals, drums, and gongs. They are performed at Chinese New Year, the August Moon Festival and other celebratory <b>occasions</b> <b>for</b> good luck.|$|E

5|$|The Briarcliff Lodge was {{a luxury}} {{resort in the}} village of Briarcliff Manor, New York. It was a notable example of Tudor Revival architecture, {{and was one of the}} largest wooden {{structures}} in the United States. It was also the first hotel in Westchester County. Walter William Law had it built on his estate, and the Law family owned it until 1937. When the lodge opened in 1902, it was one of the largest resort hotels in the world. The lodge hosted presidents, royalty, and celebrities, and was the scene of numerous memorable <b>occasions</b> <b>for</b> visitors and local residents who attended weddings, receptions, and dances in the ballroom and dining room. For a long time, the lodge was situated among other businesses of Walter Law, including the Briarcliff Farms and Briarcliff Table Water Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} representing Vršac at the Exhibition {{was originally}} meant to depict folk hero Janko Halabura fighting the Turks, {{an idea to}} which Jovanović took a liking. The Vršac council members soon changed their minds, and Jovanović was asked to paint a composition showing the everyday lives of the town's inhabitants. Over {{the course of the}} triptych's creation, Jovanović visited his hometown on a number of <b>occasions</b> <b>for</b> the purpose of sketching its people and structures. The triptych proved to be a particularly difficult undertaking. Jovanović's firm grasp in Western Medieval panel and mural painting proved of great importance. Earlier, Jovanović had been the recipient of several church commissions that called for multi-sectional painting, though not to the same extent as some of his contemporaries, such as Uroš Predić. Each scene needed to connect seamlessly with the others, and Jovanović was met with the additional challenge of painting a number of figures engaged in actions requiring precise definition. The artist addressed this by carefully drawing each figure, the landscape and the panels themselves so as to ensure compositional unity. To ensure natural light, Jovanović painted the triptych out of studio, en plein air. It took the artist about ten months to complete.|$|E
5|$|White's kicking {{accuracy}} was {{of particular}} note for a ruckman—his goal-kicking accuracy finished at {{slightly less than}} 60%. He was a consistent exponent of the spectacular mark, preferring to take chest marks high over packs. He was nominated on several <b>occasions</b> <b>for</b> the Mark of the Year, but he never won the award. His ball-skills and work around the ground remained one of his greatest strengths throughout his career. He effected 5000 hit-outs in his AFL career, the most by any one player since records began in 1987, with a career-high game total of 47 during a resounding round-22 win over West Coast Eagles in 2000. Testament to his durability and consistency, he was {{ranked in the top}} five in the AFL in total number of hit-outs for nine consecutive seasons from 1999. At 195cm, White is relatively short for a ruckman, and operated more as a ruck-rover than as a traditional ruckman. He was noted for his athleticism and vertical-leap, which helped him overcome his lack of height in comparison to other ruckmen. His approach to ruck-work—with greater emphasis on possessing the ball and working around the ground—helped him adapt to the changed centre-circle rules, and compensated for his lack of height and diminished ability at stoppages. Following the departure of Jim Stynes from Melbourne, White later worked on his game with former ruckman Sam Newman. Percy Johnson, Stynes and finally Newman guided and influenced White's ruck-work during his career.|$|E
