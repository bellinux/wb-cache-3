40|$|In recent years, ozone is a {{disinfectant}} {{frequently used}} for enhancing water quality. However, since its short half-life and relatively low solubility in water, {{it is not}} possible to ensure its presence continuously in distribution system. Hence, ozone can only be used as a primary disinfectant. After <b>ozonization,</b> in order to complete the disinfection process in the distribution system, a secondary disinfectant like chlorine, chlorodioxide and monochloramine must be used. As well as odor in water, and inorganic materials such as iron and manganese, ozone effectively removes organic matter, drug residues and pesticides mixed into the water for any reason by oxidation from media. When used appropriately and in the correct amount ozone is an efficient chemical and microbiological disinfectant. However, when ozone is used in unfavorable conditions and/or in large quantities, it can cause the production of unwanted by-products. Ozone shows its disinfection effect through oxidation properties and high reactivity. The effect mechanism of ozone in water is depended on many parameters, mainly on pH. While ozone effects in molecular form at acidic conditions, hydroxyl radical forms are dominant in much higher pH values. By-products formed by both of the mechanisms are different from each other. Organic acids and aldehydes which are by-products of <b>ozonization</b> can easily be converted to the assimilable organic compounds or to the biodegradable carbon derivatives. Thus the application of the biological active process with <b>ozonization</b> makes easier removal of the biodegradable by-products. To apply <b>ozonization</b> appropriately, it is needed to determine the ozone demand in water...|$|E
30|$|Conclusions Following today’s {{state of}} {{knowledge}} activated carbon filtration (eventually coupled with <b>ozonization)</b> is {{best suited to}} remove drug residues and other xenobiotics from raw water. Water works that do not apply the activated carbon filtration technique for cleanup of bank filtration water should consider an upgrade. The <b>ozonization</b> is primarily required for disinfection of the water. As no acute health hazard proceeds from drinking water contamination by pharmaceuticals at the present time, the upgrade of wastewater treatment plants {{by one of the}} aforementioned innovative methods is currently not required in view of drinking water quality. This offers the opportunity to develop sustainable approaches that already aim to reduce drug contaminations of wastewater and hence of ground-, surface- and drinking water.|$|E

40|$|Background: Date {{is one of}} the {{foodstuffs}} {{that are}} produced in tropical areas and used worldwide. Conventionally, methyl bromide and phosphine are used for date disinfection. The toxic side effects of these usual disinfectants have led food scientists to consider safer agents such as ozone for disinfection, because food safety is a top priority. The present study was performed to investigate the possibility of replacing common conventional disinfectants with ozone for date disinfection and microbial load reduction. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, date samples were ozonized for 3 and 5 hours with 5 and 10  g/h concentrations and packed. Ozonized samples were divided into two groups and kept in an incubator which was maintained at 25 °C and 40 °C for 9 months.
