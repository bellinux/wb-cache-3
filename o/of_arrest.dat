40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a descriptive analysis <b>of</b> the police <b>arrest</b> records for Muncie, Indiana, {{to determine if}} there was a decrease in the sex ratio <b>of</b> adults <b>arrested</b> for non-traffic violations from 1967 - 1970. The Muncie police arrest records were compared to the national arrest statistics as published in the Uniform Crime Report. The problems associated with absolute figures on the number r <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> were avoided by considering the total population of Muncie and the nation. The results of the study showed that on the whole, Muncie followed the general national trend of a decreasing sex ratio <b>of</b> <b>arrests.</b> Although the general national trend was towards a decreasing sex ratio <b>of</b> <b>arrests,</b> there were a few years namely 1962, 1965, and 1966 in which the sex ratio <b>of</b> national <b>arrests</b> increased slightly. Further, Muncie's trend of a decreasing sex ratio <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> was interruped in 1970 by a slight increase. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R

5|$|Schubert's famous String Quintet {{was written}} in September 1828, {{together}} with the final versions of the sonatas. The slow movements of the quintet and the B-flat Sonata bear striking similarities in their main sections: both employ the same unique textural layout, in which two-three voices sing long notes in the middle register, accompanied by the contrasted, short pizzicato notes of the other voices, in the lower and upper registers; in both movements, the long notes over the relentless ostinato rhythm, convey an atmosphere of complete stillness, <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> of all motion and time. String quintet textures also appear elsewhere, throughout the sonata trilogy.|$|E

5|$|By 1730, on the {{recommendation}} of General Wilhelm Dietrich von Buddenbrock, the rehabilitated Zieten entered the newly-formed Freikompanie (independent company) of hussars at Potsdam. On 1 March 1732, a second company of the Hussars was created, and Zieten was appointed as its chief and promoted to the Rittmeister with 50 thalers a month's salary. In summer 1732, Zieten was given four weeks <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> for an offense. In 1735, Frederick William appointed Zieten as the head of a hussar company, and sent him to the Imperial Army on the Rhine, where he participated in the Rhine campaign. Károly József Batthyány, the Austrian hussars' superintendent, served as his mentor in the fighting against France. At that time, the Austrians were the reputed masters of light cavalry work. His next promotion, to major took place on 29 January 1736.|$|E
5|$|Counsel for Chng, de Souza and Wong {{argued that}} {{although}} section 10 of the ISA conferred {{power on the}} Minister of Home Affairs to revoke a direction suspending a detention order, it did not empower him to subsequently re-arrest and re-detain his clients. Since section 10 should be strictly construed in favour of the detainees' liberty, the court could not imply a power <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> and detention into section 10 when Parliament had not provided for it. The Court of Appeal took the view that once a suspension direction under section 10 is revoked, the original detention order becomes operative again. The power to arrest and detain is conferred by the detention order itself.|$|E

5|$|Fearful <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> as a rebel once he {{left the}} Senate, Benjamin quickly {{departed}} Washington for New Orleans. On the day of Benjamin's resignation, the Provisional Confederate States Congress gathered in Montgomery, Alabama, and soon chose Davis as president. Davis {{was sworn in as}} provisional Confederate States President on February 18, 1861. At home in New Orleans for, it would prove, the last time, Benjamin addressed a rally on Washington's Birthday, February 22, 1861. On February 25, Davis appointed Benjamin, still in New Orleans, as attorney general; the Louisianan was approved immediately and unanimously by the provisional Congress. Davis thus became the first chief executive in North America to appoint a Jew to his Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|In its secret negotiations, the Committee of Public Safety was {{initially}} unable {{to form a}} consensus concerning the jailed deputies, but as some Girondins fled to the provinces and attempted to incite an insurrection, its opinion hardened. By early July, Saint-Just was able to address the Convention with a lengthy report {{in the name of}} the Committee, and his damning attack left no room for any further conciliation. The Girondins' trials must proceed, he said, and any verdicts must be severe. The proceedings dragged on for months, but Brissot and twenty of his allies were eventually condemned and sent to the guillotine on 31 October 1793. Saint-Just used their situation to gain approval for intimidating new laws, culminating in the Law of Suspects (17 September 1793) which gave the Committee vast new powers <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> and punishment.|$|E
5|$|Abuses {{of power}} over the villagers by Abir had been {{reported}} by missionaries almost since they began operations in the Congo but the first real public disclosure came in 1901 {{with the publication of}} a report, written by an ex-agent, in several Belgian newspapers. The Free State began an investigation into Abir's abuses during which an inquiry established at Bongandanga heard evidence from missionaries in the concession. As a result, Abir took action against the missionaries, stopping the carriage of their mail on company steamers, stopping the missionaries' boats and confiscating any mail that they carried. Abir also forbid missionaries from buying food from villagers, forcing them to buy from Abir's own stores. In 1904 Roger Casement issued the Casement Report which condemned the Abir system; this resulted in the Free State launching another investigation later that year. Although evidence of unlawful killings made by Abir was uncovered the investigation had no powers <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> and could only submit a report to the Free State authorities. This lack of action resulted in deteriorating relations between Abir and the missionaries and there was at least one attempted shooting of a missionary. Evidence for Abir's abuses also came from the governor of the French Congo, to the north-west, who claimed that prior to 1903 30,000 people had been driven from the Free State to the French Congo by Abir's actions.|$|E

5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds <b>of</b> <b>arrest,</b> consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to U.S. Army {{regulations}} as well, {{no charges}} were ever filed against Stone {{nor did he}} stand trial. While he was in solitary confinement at Fort Lafayette, he could not exercise, and consequently Stone's health began to degrade. His physicians protested heavily to Stanton, who ordered him transferred to the military prison at Fort Hamilton. There Stone was allowed to exercise and his condition improved. He stayed at Fort Lafayette for fifty days, and would spend another 139 in Fort Hamilton. Stone was finally released without explanation or apology on August 16, 1862. The reason for his release was new legislation written by California Senator James A. McDougall. In a small addition to another bill, McDougall reiterated the Articles of War requirement that official charges be filed within eight days <b>of</b> <b>arrest,</b> but went on to include that any imprisoned officer must be given their trial within thirty days. McDougall also made it clear this legislation applied to those currently under arrest, which covered Stone's case. It passed the U.S. Congress and {{was signed into law}} by President Lincoln on July 17, 1862. Stanton then waited the thirty days before releasing Stone.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Middlesex {{exploited}} the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex. Prior {{to the introduction}} of bills, a writ would have to be issued, with different writs depending on the issue. If A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, the court would have to issue an individual writ for each action, with associated delays and costs for A, and then ensure that B appeared in court. Bills, on the other hand, were traditionally used against court officials and the court's prisoners; as such, the defendant was assumed to already be in the court's custody and presence in court was unnecessary. Thus a legal fiction arose; if A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, he would have a writ issued for trespass. B would be arrested as a result, and the detinue and debt actions undertaken by bill after he had been detained. Eventually it became even more fictitious; if A wished to sue B merely for debt and detinue, a trespass writ would be obtained and then quietly dismissed when B was detained in custody. This was originally undertaken through getting a writ of trespass from the Chancery, but eventually a shorter workaround was used; as the King's Bench retained criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex, the trespass (which was fictitious anyway) would be said to have occurred in that county, allowing the King's Bench to issue its own bill <b>of</b> <b>arrest.</b> This became known as the Bill of Middlesex, and undermined the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, which normally dealt with such civil cases.|$|E

5|$|The {{recovery}} of the King's Bench was thanks to its use of Chancery-like procedure; centrally, the system of bills. Prior to this, a writ {{would have to be}} issued, with different writs depending on the issue.

Thus a legal fiction arose; if A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, he would have a writ issued for trespass. B would be arrested as a result, and the covenant, detinue and debt actions undertaken by bill after he had been detained. Eventually it became even more fictitious; if A wished to sue B merely for debt and detinue, a trespass writ would be obtained and then quietly dismissed when B was detained in custody.
