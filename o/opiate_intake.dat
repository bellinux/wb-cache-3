40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} maternal deprivation predisposes male rats to anxiety, accompanied {{with an increase}} in their opiate consumption. In the present report, we searched for brain epigenetic mechanisms that possibly underlie this increase. For that, we examined the expression of the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP 2 and of the histone deacetylases HDAC 2 and HDAC 3, as well as the acetylation status of histone H 3 and H 4 in mesolimbic structures of adult maternally deprived rats, using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. A long-lasting increase in MeCP 2 expression was found throughout the striatum of deprived rats. Enhanced HDAC 2 expression and increased nuclear HDAC activity in the nucleus accumbens of deprived rats were associated with lower acetylation levels of histone H 3 and H 4. Treatment for 3 weeks with the HDAC inhibitor sodium valproate abolished HDAC activation together with the decrease in the acetylation levels of histone H 4, and was accompanied with normalized oral morphine consumption. The data indicate that epigenetic mechanisms induced by early adverse environment memorize life experience to trigger greater opiate vulnerability during adult life. They suggest that sodium valproate may lessen vulnerability to <b>opiate</b> <b>intake,</b> particularly in subgroups of individuals subjected to adverse postnatal environments...|$|E
40|$|Aims To compare {{heroin and}} other opiate use of heroin {{overdose}} fatalities, current street heroin users and drug-free therapeutic community clients. Design Hair morphine concentrations that assess heroin use and other opiate {{use in the}} 2 months preceding interview or death were compared between heroin overdose fatalities diagnosed by forensic pathologists (fOD) (n = 42), current street heroin users (CU) (n = 100) and presumably abstinent heroin users in a drug-free therapeutic community (TC) (n = 50). Setting Sydney, Australia. Findings The mean age and gender breakdown of the three samples were 32. 3 years, 83 % male (FOD), 28. 7 years, 58 % male (CU) and 28. 6 years, 60 % male (TC). The median blood morphine concentration among the FOD cases was 0. 35 mg/l, and 82 % also had other drugs detected. There were large differences between the three groups in hair morphine concentrations, with the CU group (2. 10 ng/mg) having concentration approximately four {{times that of the}} FOD group (0. 53 ng/mg), which in turn had a concentration approximately six times that of the TC group (0. 09 ng/mg). There {{were no significant differences between}} males and females in hair concentrations within any of the groups. Hair morphine concentrations were correlated significantly with blood morphine concentrations among FOD cases (r = 0. 54), and self-reported heroin use among living participants (r = 0. 57). Conclusions The results indicate that fatal cases had a lower degree of chronic <b>opiate</b> <b>intake</b> than the active street users, but they were not abstinent during this period...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} impact on gestation played by the simple human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -seropositive status either alone or complicated by opiate abuse in the absence of other confounding variables. To this purpose the main obstetric complications and the perinatal outcome were prospectively evaluated in 38 simple HIV-infected women, 14 of whom were simple carriers and 24 under methadone treatment, and in 76 uninfected women, 16 of whom were methadone users and 60 controls. In simple HIV-carriers maternal weight gain (P < 0. 001) and both 1 - and 5 -min Apgar scores (P < 0. 005) were reduced whereas the incidence of miscarriage was increased (P < 0. 05). Worse obstetric and perinatal outcomes were found in HIV-seropositive drug addicts, in which gestational length (P < 0. 001), maternal weight gain (P < 0. 001) and Apgar scores were lower (P < 0. 005 and P < 0. 001, respectively) and the rate of preterm labour, small for gestational age newborns, vaginal and urinary infections as well as of unexplained fever (P < 0. 05) was higher. Outcomes were similar in HIV-seropositive and seronegative drug addicts and in both groups a positive correlation (r = 0. 62 P < 0. 001, and r = 0. 44, respectively) was found between the number of infectious episodes throughout pregnancy and the mean dose of opiate consumed daily. Our results suggest that HIV-seropositive condition might exert slight direct and indirect detrimental effects on pregnancy. Whatever the maternal serologic status, <b>opiate</b> <b>intake</b> not only causes a further worsening of gestational and perinatal outcomes, but also increases the susceptibility towards pathogens...|$|E
40|$|The aim is {{to model}} {{treatment}} pathways and outcomes of <b>opiate</b> users at <b>intake</b> and at 1 - and 3 -year follow-up and to assess {{the implications of these}} for treatment policy. Opiate users entering a new treatment episode were recruited. Analysis revealed that there were no differences between the three outcome groups at intake. Those who were not in treatment and using at 3 -years had displayed little improvement at 1 -year and those who were not in treatment and not using at 3 -years had displayed improvements in physical and mental health outcomes at 1 -year...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ascending}} and descending doses of buprenorphine (0. 01 4 - 0. 789 mg/kg/day) and methadone (0. 1 79 - 1 1. 86 mg/kg/ day) on <b>opiate</b> and food <b>intake</b> were studied in Macaque mon-keys over 1 95 to 245 days. Food (1 -g banana pellets) and i. v. drug self-administration (heroin 0. 01 or 0. 02 mg/kg/injection or Dilaudid 0. 02 mg/kg/injection) were maintained on a second-order schedule of reinforcement [FR 4 (VA 1 6 : 5) ]. Buprenorphine (0. 282 - 0. 789 mg/kg/day) produced a significant suppression of opiate self-administration at 2. 5 to 7 times the dose {{shown to be}} effective in human opiate abusers (P <. 05 -. OO 1). Methadone (1. 43. -i 1. 86 mg/kg/day) did not suppress opiate self-administra-tion in four of five monkeys across a dose range equivalent to 1 00 to 800 mg/day in man. The distribution of opiate self-administration across drug sessions did not account for th...|$|R
40|$|Two cohorts of substance-using {{women were}} {{compared}} retrospectively. From 1969 to 1979 {{a very high}} perinatal mortality rate (PMR 9. 8 %) was found among 92 polydrug-using women (1 twin excluded). Preterm delivery occurred in 25 % of all pregnancies and in 30 % of the children birth weight was below the 10 th percentile. Nineteen women using heroin only had a worse fetal outcome (PMR 32 %, preterm delivery in 47 %, birth weight < 10 th percentile in 42 %). These results led to a strict surveillance system. In the period 1980 - 1989, 240 women (4 twins excluded) delivered after 16 weeks. Total fetal loss decreased to 2. 1 % and PMR to 0. 4 %, which was similar to results in controls. However, 22 % of the women still delivered before 37 weeks and 27 % delivered a child < 10 th percentile. Methadone-using women were able to halve their dosage during pregnancy and 16 were detoxified. Multivariate analysis within the substance users of the second cohort showed that the neonatal abstinence syndrome, but not the (registered) amount of opiates used, was related to a lower birth weight. Not coping with prenatal care was related to a shorter pregnancy length. Multivariate analysis, including the controls, showed a significant relation of birth weight (345 g lower) with substance use. Also, head circumference was 0. 8 cm smaller. Length of pregnancy however was related to smoking. This study shows {{that it is difficult}} to make substance users attend prenatal care, but also that women coping with prenatal care reduce substance <b>intake.</b> <b>Opiate</b> use might be responsible for lower birth weight, although not in a clear dose-response relationship, whereas lifestyle, as represented by not coping with prenatal care and the quantity of cigarette smoking, shortens the length of pregnanc...|$|R
40|$|Phantom limb pain is {{an often}} severe and {{debilitating}} phenomenon {{that has been}} reported in up to 85 % of amputees. Its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Peripheral and spinal mechanisms are thought {{to play a role in}} pain modulation in affected individuals; however central mechanisms are also likely to be of importance. The neuromatrix theory postulates a genetically determined representation of body image, which is modified by sensory input to create a neurosignature. Persistence of the neurosignature may be responsible for painless phantom limb sensations, whereas phantom limb pain may be due to abnormal reorganisation within the neuromatrix. This study assessed the clinical outcome of deep brain stimulation of the periventricular grey matter and somatosensory thalamus for the relief of chronic neuropathic pain associated with phantom limb in three patients. These patients were assessed preoperatively and at 3 month intervals postoperatively. Self-rated visual analogue scale pain scores assessed pain intensity, and the McGill Pain Questionnaire assessed the quality of the pain. Quality of life was assessed using the EUROQOL EQ- 5 D scale. Periventricular gray stimulation alone was optimal in two patients, whilst a combination of periventricular gray and thalamic stimulation produced the greatest degree of relief in one patient. At follow-up (mean 13. 3 months) the intensity of pain was reduced by 62 % (range 55 - 70 %). In all three patients, the burning component of the pain was completely alleviated. <b>Opiate</b> <b>intake</b> was reduced in the two patients requiring morphine sulphate pre-operatively. Quality of life measures indicated a statistically significant improvement. This data supports the role for deep brain stimulation in patients with phantom limb pain. The medical literature relating to the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of this clinical entity is reviewed in detail...|$|E
