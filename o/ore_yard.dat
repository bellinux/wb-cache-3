40|$|In steel works, {{iron ores}} {{are stored in}} <b>ore</b> <b>yard</b> and sent to various plants of down stream accoding to {{transfer}} requests. To attain stable operation, it is neccesary to keep a certain allowable stock level in ore tanks of all plants. To this purpose, ore transfer routing method has been developed based on decentralized agent method. In case of disaster such as a big earthquake or a big fire, damages in the facilities of industrial complex may be unavoidable. In this paper, decentralized optimization method is tested to cope with such emergencies. Decentralized agents corresponding to kind of ore make their own transfer route plan exchanging information with others. As {{the application of the}} proposed method, transfer scheduling in <b>ore</b> <b>yard</b> in steel works are made in case of destruction of transfer facilities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For {{the vehicle}} {{management}} require {{of the large}} materials yard, this paper researched the monitor problem based on u- Blox GPS. Designed the GPS applicable unit, researched the Setting Method of LEA- 4 H and the extract skill of GPS Protocol data. Researched the Grid-based map technology to mark, zoom, translate the map and match the vehicle track. Propose the “same side judgment ” to check the vehicle whether in the yard only by GPS location. Fig. 4 shows how to judge the non-convex polygon yard by divide it into convex. The correctness and stability of the research result are proved by the reliable operation of an unmanned iron <b>ore</b> <b>yard</b> vehicle system for years. The researches provide good reference {{for the design of}} the monitor and manage system in other material yard and fleet...|$|E
2500|$|The port has 6-km-long {{rail link}} {{connecting}} the coal and iron <b>ore</b> stack <b>yards</b> and the North Chennai Thermal Power Station with Athipattu and Athipattu-Pudhunagar railway stations. A 26km Y-shaped single-track northern link {{from the port}} to the Anuppampattu railway station, connecting the port with the Chennai-Gudur mainline, was proposed in 2012 at an estimated cost of [...] 1,700 million. The link will have two arms at the port end, with one arm culminating at coal and iron <b>ore</b> stack <b>yards</b> and the other culminating at the upcoming container terminals. The link would eventually upgraded to a dual-track one. In-principle approval from the Indian Railways was obtained in September 2013.|$|R
50|$|Edgar Thomson Yards Braddock, Pennsylvania are as follows: *Valley Yard, Rail <b>Yard,</b> Joe Wolfe, <b>Ore</b> Yard,Port Perry <b>Yard.</b>|$|R
50|$|Highlights of the game: Quarterback Kellen Moore (BSU) had 386 yards passing, {{running back}} LeGarrette Blount (ORE) rushed for 99 yards, and tight end Ed Dickson (<b>ORE)</b> {{received}} 103 <b>yards.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{iron ore}} terminal, which can handle 6 million {{tons per year}} and can load iron ore {{at a rate of}} 6,000 tons per hour, is also located at the Bharathi Dock. Berth BD2 can {{accommodate}} ore carriers up to [...] in length. The terminal's separate receiving and shipping lines can function as an interconnected system. The terminal is served by rail lines and includes an <b>ore</b> stock <b>yard</b> with capacity for 544,000 metric tons.|$|R
5|$|Modern {{furnaces}} {{are equipped}} {{with an array of}} supporting facilities to increase efficiency, such as <b>ore</b> storage <b>yards</b> where barges are unloaded. The raw materials are transferred to the stockhouse complex by ore bridges, or rail hoppers and ore transfer cars. Rail-mounted scale cars or computer controlled weight hoppers weigh out the various raw materials to yield the desired hot metal and slag chemistry. The raw materials are brought {{to the top of the}} blast furnace via a skip car powered by winches or conveyor belts.|$|R
50|$|On the ground, Taylor's {{performance}} was supplemented by Tech running back Branden Ore, who led all rushers with 55 yards on 19 rushes. Fourteen of <b>Ore's</b> 55 <b>yards</b> {{came on a}} single play halfway through the fourth quarter when the Boston College's defensive line gave way, admitting Tech's runner into the defensive secondary. The run helped set up Virginia Tech's go-ahead touchdown later in the fourth quarter. Capping Tech's ground game were complimentary performances by Kenny Lewis and Sean Glennon, each of whom earned fewer than 10 yards, but picked up first downs on two plays.|$|R
50|$|Beginning {{at their}} own 20-yard line, the Virginia Tech offense marched down the field. Running back Branden <b>Ore</b> ran 11 <b>yards</b> for a first down, and two long passes from Sean Glennon to wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal put the Hokies into scoring position. After failing to gain first downs with short runs, Virginia Tech was forced to use its timeouts to stop the clock and the first half from ending before {{they had a chance}} to score. On a 3rd-and-7 from the Boston College 13-yard line, Glennon finally connected with wide receiver Josh Hyman, who crossed into the end zone for a touchdown. The extra point tied the game, 16 - 16.|$|R
5|$|On the ground, the Hokies {{had even}} less success {{than they did}} in the air. Branden Ore, Tech's {{starting}} tailback, earned 42yards in 20shortrushes during the game. With a long run of eight <b>yards,</b> <b>Ore</b> was kept in check by Georgia's defense. The only other Hokie to achieve positive yardage on the ground was backup tailback Kenny Lewis, who only managed five yards. Glennon was sacked three times, once fumbling the ball. These sacks wiped out the 11 rushing yards he managed to gain during his scrambles for yardage. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech was aided by excellent field position, enabling them to score three offensive touchdowns. Tech's average starting field position in that quarter was the Georgia 48-yard line, allowing for easy scores even for a struggling offense.|$|R
5000|$|The Lokayukta Report {{on illegal}} mining in Karnataka [...] details the methods in which miners, {{government}} officials and ministers colluded to defraud the government of mining revenues. The report details the complete breakdown of democratic governance in the bellary area and uncovers the [...] "zero risk system", a protection and extortion racket, masterminded by G. Janardhana Reddy. The report describes the illegal money transfers to foreign companies and tax shelters by mining entities such as Obulapuram Mining Company, Associated Mining Company, GLA Trading and GJR Holdings owned by the Reddy Brothers.The report tells about illegal mining, bureaucrats-politicians-businessman nexus. Even banks and public sector companies also participated in the loot. There are more than 100 names involved in illegal operation. NMDC and JSW Steel are some major name in fraud list. Charges against these companies are illegal movement of iron <b>ore</b> from mining <b>yard</b> without permits and without paying royalties, forest encroachment, mining lease violations, overloading of trucks and sandry violation etc. The iron ore was illegally exported to china through ports of southern India and payment is made through more than 4000 banks account. Damage to environment can not be calculated.|$|R
