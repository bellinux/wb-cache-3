The reader is forced to reconsider the conventions set up by society for the relationships between women and men. Nineteenth-century society had conventions, which were enforced. In this novel Swithin St Cleeve's idealism pits him against such contemporary social constraints.|$|E
25|$|The Latin Rite of the Catholic Church {{does not}} teach that the {{suffering}} of purgatory is imposed by God.

Knowing the acts <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> those on earth are offering for one might conceivably make more bearable the remorse.|$|E

Millard stated the band's dream for the album was [...] "to inspire others to ‘pay it forward’ to the cross. It doesn’t have to be about major sacrifices.

[...] Producer Paul Webster acknowledged the familial theme in the DVD featurette [...] "A Bennet Family Portrait", remarking [...] "Yes, it's a great love story between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, but underpinning it all is the kind <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> runs this family." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2000 Harvey {{began work}} on her fifth studio album Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea with Rob Ellis and Mick Harvey. Written in her native Dorset, Paris and New York, the album showcased a more {{mainstream}} indie rock and pop rock sound to her previous albums and the lyrics followed themes <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> tied into Harvey's affection for New York City. The album also featured Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke on three tracks, including his lead vocals on [...] "This Mess We're in." [...] Upon its release in October 2000 the album was a critical and commercial success, selling over one million copies worldwide and charting in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The album's three singles — [...] "Good Fortune", [...] "A Place Called Home" [...] and [...] "This Is Love" [...] — were moderately successful.|$|E

Poppy Reid of The Music Network criticized the song for {{its reliance on}} autotune and lyrics [...] "you just don't expect (or want) from a 41-year-old". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated in a review <b>of</b> <b>Love?</b> <b>that</b> apart from [...] "Good Hit" [...] and [...] "Invading My Mind", [...] "Lopez shines when the beat hits 120 or higher." [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy called the song generic. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club was critical of the song, stating that: [...] " [...] in which she drones [...] "I got that good hit" [...] when she clearly doesn't—nor does she seem to even want it." [...] Scott Shetler of PopCrush noted [...] "Good Hit" [...] to sound as if Lopez was covering Britney Spears [...] "rather than doing her own thing."

500|$|Thomas Merton {{characterized}} {{the goal of}} Christian meditation as follows: [...] "The true end of Christian meditation is practically {{the same as the}} end of liturgical prayer and the reception of the sacraments: a deeper union by grace and charity with the Incarnate Word, who is the only Mediator between God and man, Jesus Christ." [...] While Protestants view salvation in terms of faith and grace alone (i.e. sola fide and sola gratia) both Western and Eastern Christians see a role for meditation on the path to salvation and redemption. Apostle Paul stated in Epistle to the Romans [...] that salvation only comes from [...] "God that hath mercy". The path to salvation in Christian meditation is not one of give and take, and the aim of meditation is to bring joy to the heart of God. The Word of God directs meditations to show the two aspects <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> please God: obedience and adoration. The initiative in Christian salvation is with God, and one does not meditate or love God to gain his favor.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the play}} is {{concerned}} with demonstrating the immensity of the difficulties that face Jason in trying to rescue Number 18. For example, he finds it difficult {{to be away from}} his wife, and struggles with the decision of whether to continue his work or return to Canada. To depict this tension, Jason and Ali communicate via Skype, represented on stage by two laptop computers placed back-to-back with Jason and Ali standing on either side facing one another. The two argue, but their interactions demonstrate the kind <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> Number 18 can only dream of. In the 2012 cross-Canada tour, a torn picture of Number 18's family remained on stage as scenery to emphasize what the character has lost. This picture took the form of a painted curtain held over a geometric floor pattern and depicted the family as tired, poor, and living in a shack. Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate said the most emotionally gripping scene was the one in which the voices cause Number 18 to recall the face of her dead father. [...] Anna Borowiecki of the St. Albert Gazette called the play a story of [...] "fallible people who find strength in each other under the worst conditions." ...|$|E
500|$|Television critics reacted mostly {{positive}} {{toward the}} episode, calling the storyline [...] "heartfelt." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded and followed the show, respectively, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I spent the entire time expecting the rug to be pulled out {{and the whole thing}} revealed to be Seth MacFarlane just trying to manipulate my emotions." [...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think {{it may have been a}} little bit too far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we will do for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change." [...] Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian.|$|E

500|$|The Kurt–Blaine storyline was {{met with}} general acclaim from critics. In her review for the episode, Katie Morgan of Billboard reacted {{positively}} to the interaction between Kurt and Blaine. She wrote, [...] "It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy." [...] In his review, Mark Perigard opined, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold {{the hell out of}} the moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery." [...] Robert Canning was more critical on the storyline. He highly criticized Darren Criss' performance as Blaine. In a detailed review regarding the storyline, Canning wrote, [...] "Kurt finally got the first kiss he deserved. Too bad it came from the wooden, glass-eyed Blaine. Chris Colfer has been in the running for performance awards for good reason. Darren Criss will not be. Colfer and his character deserve better than the cardboard, unemotional declaration <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> Criss delivered. Yay for Kurt and his first boyfriend, but that was a bland work up to their kiss." [...] Sandra Gonzalez called the whole development [...] "simply perfect". Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet", and stated that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. James Poniewozik reacted positively to the storyline. In his review, Poniewozik wrote, [...] "As for the at-long-last kiss, it's to Glees credit that it made me think, ‘Finally, Blaine and Kurt are locking lips already!’ before it made me think, ‘Look, an honest-to-God gay kiss, between two men, on my primetime TV show!’" [...] Aly Semigran of MTV praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, saying that the kiss scene was a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". Semigran went on to praise the acting in the scene, saying that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty". Brett Berk deemed the interaction to be [...] "appropriately fervid".|$|E

2500|$|Victor Kiernan, a Marxist {{scholar and}} historian, writes {{that it is}} for the greater sake <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> this loss of {{identity}} takes place and that individual characters are made to suffer accordingly: [...] "It was the more extravagant cult <b>of</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> struck sensible people as irrational, and likely to have dubious effects on its acolytes." [...] He believes that identities in the play are not so much lost as they are blended together to create a type of haze through which distinction becomes nearly impossible. It is driven by a desire for new and more practical ties between characters as a means of coping with the strange world within the forest, even in relationships as diverse and seemingly unrealistic as the brief love between Titania and Bottom: [...] "It was the tidal force of this social need that lent energy to relationships." ...|$|E
