5|$|A {{sea anemone}} {{is capable of}} {{changing}} its shape dramatically. The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> and can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the gullet, with the sphincter closing the aperture; during this process, the gullet folds transversely and water is discharged through the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotally {{injection}} of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure {{of blood vessels}} (embolization) and decay <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam is not very soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper {{in a manner similar}} to LSD.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Objective: In {{the present}} study {{we are trying to}} find out whether we can {{diagnose}} the various pathology <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> and muscle injuries by high resolution ultrasonography. Background: Clinical evaluation of many pathological conditions <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> is often very difficult. With the help of MRI, we can diagnose most of the pathologies <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> almost accurately; but it is neither cost effective nor widely available. Similarly, CT scan is also not very helpful in this regard. Method: We examined forty patients with various types of unilateral pathological conditions <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> with the help of high resolution ultrasonography and compared with the normal anatomy of the opposite side. This method is a non-invasive, rapid, less expensive and widely available. Result: We have shown that we can diagnose the different pathological conditions <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> and muscle injuries with the help of high resolution USG. Conclusion: Therefore, ultrasonography should be the first choice of investigation, particularly in our country to diagnose pathological conditions <b>of</b> <b>muscles...</b>|$|R

5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are well}} known for their strong muscle-relaxing {{properties}} and {{can be useful in}} the treatment <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> spasms, although tolerance often develops to their muscle relaxant effects. Baclofen or tizanidine are sometimes used as an alternative to benzodiazepines. Tizanidine has been found to have superior tolerability compared to diazepam and baclofen.|$|E
5|$|Myoclonic {{seizures}} involve spasms {{of muscles}} {{in either a}} few areas or all over. Absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of the head or eye blinking. The person does not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends. Atonic seizures involve the loss <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> activity for greater than one second. This typically occurs {{on both sides of}} the body.|$|E

25|$|The nerves {{within the}} corticospinal tract are {{involved}} in movement <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the body. Because of the crossing-over <b>of</b> fibres, <b>muscles</b> are supplied {{by the side of}} the brain opposite to that <b>of</b> the <b>muscle.</b> The nerves within the corticobulbar tract {{are involved in}} movement in <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the head. They are involved in swallowing, phonation, and movements of the tongue. By virtue of involvement with the facial nerve, the corticobulbar tract is also responsible for transmitting facial expression. With the exception <b>of</b> lower <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> facial expression, all functions of the corticobulbar tract involve inputs from both sides of the brain.|$|R
5|$|Similarly, {{pathogenic}} mutations {{have been}} identified in the prion-like domains of heterogeneous nuclear riboproteins hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 in familial cases <b>of</b> <b>muscle,</b> brain, bone and motor neuron degeneration. The wild-type form of all of these proteins show a tendency to self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, while the pathogenic mutations exacerbate this behaviour and lead to excess accumulation.|$|E

Poisoned individuals {{may appear to}} be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizuring, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins.|$|E
5|$|Thyrotoxic {{periodic}} paralysis (TPP) is {{a condition}} featuring attacks <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> weakness {{in the presence of}} hyperthyroidism (overactivity of the thyroid gland). Hypokalemia (a decreased potassium level in the blood) is usually present during attacks. The condition may be life-threatening if weakness of the breathing muscles leads to respiratory failure, or if the low potassium levels lead to cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate). If untreated, it is typically recurrent in nature.|$|E

50|$|The main {{function}} {{of the facial nerve}} is motor control of all <b>of</b> the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> facial expression.

5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating the regulation <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections {{had an effect}} on protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
5|$|Blood tests may be {{performed}} to exclude other causes <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> disease (elevated creatine kinase may indicate a myositis, and abnormal thyroid function tests may indicate thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels {{can be identified}} in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a CT scan of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months {{for the first two}} years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron emission tomography scan of the body may also {{be performed}} to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.|$|E

5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to muscle cells directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with muscle cell metabolism. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and depletion of ATP, the main carrier {{of energy in the}} cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction of the muscle cell leads to breakdown of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 20th century, {{paleontologist}} R. S. Lull {{proposed that}} the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as anchor points for their jaw muscles. He later noted that for Styracosaurus, the spikes would have given it a formidable appearance. In 1996, Dodson supported the idea <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> attachments in part and created detailed diagrams of possible muscle attachments in the frills of Styracosaurus and Chasmosaurus, but did not subscribe {{to the idea that}} they completely filled in the fenestrae. C.A. Forster, however, found no evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.|$|E

The transaminases, enzymes abundant in both liver and muscle tissue, are also usually increased; this {{can lead to}} the condition being confused with acute liver injury, at least in the early stages. The incidence of actual acute liver injury is 25% in people with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis; the mechanism for this is uncertain.|$|E
