Also the success <b>of</b> <b>nonprofit</b> and NGOs is shown through tangible results, leading organizations more toward service delivery than capacity building.|$|E

40|$|Charity giving {{continues}} to be an important aspect of the economic and social fabric of the United States. The number and total assets <b>of</b> <b>nonprofits</b> registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under the section 501 (c) (3) of the tax code have grown significantly over the past decade. Given the significant share of donations in supporting the activities <b>of</b> <b>nonprofits,</b> it is important for donors to {{have a better understanding of}} their operations and governance. As the number <b>of</b> <b>nonprofits</b> with similar objectives increases, it becomes overly complicated for donors to make a choice that is consistent with their own purpose for giving. The goal of this paper is to develop an analytic framework for selecting a nonprofit from among competing alternatives. Specifically, we propose a process in which consultants or financial advisors help donors evaluate nonprofits using a set of financial and governance criteria to generate a ranked short list of alternatives for further evaluation. Donors differ in their criteria for evaluating the performance <b>of</b> <b>nonprofits.</b> The methodology we use allows donors to incorporate their preferences for specific criteria to the selection <b>of</b> a <b>nonprofit</b> in a consistent manner. ...|$|R

[...] In the fall of 1974, an amendment to the National Labor Relations Act permitted the employees <b>of</b> <b>nonprofit</b> hospitals to unionize. [...] In addition to activist initiatives from individuals, the amendment inspired a Local 77 drive to unionize all service workers in the Duke Medical Center.

2500|$|A third kind of {{criticism}} {{is that the}} model fails to fully reflect the needs of stakeholders – putting bias on financial stakeholders over others. [...] Early forms of Balanced Scorecard proposed by Kaplan & Norton focused {{on the needs of}} commercial organisations in the USA – where this focus on investment return was appropriate. [...] This focus was maintained through subsequent revisions. Even now over 20 years after they were first proposed, the four most common perspectives in Balanced Scorecard designs mirror the four proposed in the original Kaplan & Norton paper. [...] However, as noted earlier in this article, there have been many studies that suggest other perspectives might better reflect the priorities of organisations – particularly but not exclusively relating to the needs of organisations in the public and Non Governmental sectors. For instance, the balanced scorecard does not address important aspects <b>of</b> <b>nonprofit</b> strategy such as social dimensions, human resource elements, political issues and the distinctive nature of competition and collaboration in nonprofit settings. More modern design approaches such as 3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard, the Public Sector Scorecard and the UN's Results Based Management methods explicitly consider the interests of wider stakeholder groups, and perhaps address this issue in its entirety.|$|E
