5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is native {{only to the}} eastern United States, congregating in colonies that often consist of fewer than 20individuals. They prefer {{calcareous}} wetlands (areas containing lime), including meadows, bogs, marshes, and spring seeps, that have both wet and dry regions. Their habitat is often on the edge <b>of</b> <b>woods.</b> Bog turtles have sometimes been seen in cow pastures and near beaver dams.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{articles}} {{have shown that}} modification <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> by citric acid (CA) improves dimensional stability and resistance <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> against fungi attack. However, chemical modification <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> also modifies its mechanical properties in some way. The compression strength <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> is one <b>of</b> its representative mechanical properties. Modified wood with lower values of compression strength has limited purpose. The intention of this work is to show the effect <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> modification by citric acid on the compression strength <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> Fir wood (Abies alba Mill.) and beech wood (Fagus sylvatica L.) were impregnated by citric acid with sodium-dihydrogen-hypophosphite (NaH 2 PO 2) as a catalyst. Part of the impregnated samples together with control samples were cured at the temperature of 140 °C for 10 hours and the remaining samples were cured in microwaves for 35 minutes. The average compression strength parallel to the grain <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> modifi ed by CA, using different regimes of curing, was compared to the strength <b>of</b> unmodifi ed <b>wood.</b> The average compression strength parallel to the grain <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> was retained after modification. In the case <b>of</b> fir <b>wood,</b> the average compression strength was even improved after modification. The results indicate that wood modified by citric acid may be considered for the purposes where compression strength properties are equally important as improved durability and dimensional stability <b>of</b> <b>wood...</b>|$|R
5|$|For {{many years}} Cheadle Hulme was rural countryside, made up <b>of</b> <b>woods,</b> open land, and farms.
