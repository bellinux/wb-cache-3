5|$|With the {{development}} of Neverwinter Nights II coming to an end, <b>Obsidian</b> was contacted by three different publishers. Electronic Arts wanted <b>Obsidian</b> to develop a role-playing game to compete with , and another publisher was also interested in having <b>Obsidian</b> develop a fantasy RPG. The third publisher was Sega, who wanted the studio to develop an action role-playing game set within the Alien franchise. The game, titled Aliens: Crucible, was to feature base-building, dialogue choices, and character customization. In February 2009 <b>Obsidian</b> sent a prototype to Sega. Sega decided to cancel the game three weeks later without inspecting the demo. The cancellation was officially confirmed in June of that year. At around the same time, Atari again approached <b>Obsidian,</b> this time to revive Baldur's Gate III. <b>Obsidian</b> requested a large budget, which Atari could not afford, and the deal between the two companies fell apart when Atari Europe was sold to Namco Bandai Games.|$|E

50|$|Darrow and Mustang seek an {{alliance}} with the Moon Lords of Jupiter, who are led by the self-declared Sovereign of the Outer Rim, Romulus au Raa. Darrow's former friend Roque au Fabii is also there, in his position as the Imperator of Octavia au Lune's Sword Armada, to negotiate a truce with the Moon Lords. Darrow secures their support against Octavia when he manipulates Roque into confirming that she possesses planet-destroying atomic weapons to use against them if necessary. Darrow's forces are joined by those of the Moon Lords against Roque's Sword Armada and the fleet of Victra's brutal sister, Antonia au Severus-Julii. Using a tactical ruse, Darrow along with Sefi's <b>Obsidians</b> board the Roque's flagship. They overtake the ship, and the proud Roque, refusing to surrender, commits suicide. Antonia flees, but is soon captured by Victra. After the battle, Sefi and her <b>Obsidians</b> instigate a riot among the Sons of Ares to execute their Gold prisoners, having been enraged by the savagery of the Jackal. Sevro proves their hypocrisy in dramatic fashion by first hanging Cassius for killing Fitchner, and then hanging himself for his own multiple murders.

Their involvement extended beyond creative input; their company initially financed the game, believing that a game based on the controversial television show would struggle to receive financial support from publishers without them placing restrictions on the content to make it more marketable. The initial funding was intended to allow <b>Obsidian</b> to develop enough of the game to show a more complete concept to potential publishers. In December 2011, THQ announced that they would work with <b>Obsidian</b> on South Park: The Game, as it was then known.

5|$|Indigenous {{people of}} the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes have {{inhabited}} the area for hundreds of years. In pre-contact times, these people lived a nomadic lifestyle. They did not build permanent structures in which to live, as they moved from region to region to find food and resources. Animals such as caribou, martin, moose and caribou were hunted and trapped by the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes. In summer, these people gathered roots, plants and a volcanic glass called <b>obsidian.</b> Anahim <b>obsidian</b> was traded widely throughout the Interior {{and up and down}} the Coast from the community of Bella Coola.

40|$|International audienceRhyolitic <b>obsidians</b> from Krafla volcano, Iceland, {{record the}} {{interaction}} between mobile hydrous species liberated during crystal growth and the reduction of ferric iron in the silicate melt. We performed synchrotron µ-FTIR and µ-XANES measurements along a transect extending from a spherulite into optically distinct colorless and brown glass zones. Measurements show that the colorless glass is enriched in OH groups and depleted in ferric iron, while the brown glass shows the opposite relationship. The color shift between brown and clear glass is sharp, suggesting that the colorless glass zone was produced by a redox front that originated from the spherulite margin and moved through surrounding melt during crystallization. We conclude that the most likely reducing agent is hydrogen, produced by magnetite crystallization within the spherulite. The Krafla <b>obsidians</b> dramatically capture redox disequilibrium on the micoscale and highlight the importance of hydrous fluid liberation and late-stage crystallization to the redox signature of glassy lavas...|$|R
40|$|The {{volatile}} concentrations {{and thermal}} characteristics of hydrothermally-altered rhyolitic deposits erupted under Icelandic glaciers {{have been studied}} by combined differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (DSC-TGA-MS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD).

50|$|Artificial glass {{sometimes}} crystallizes {{and contains}} spherulites {{that may be}} {{as large as a}} marble. As the glass has little similarity in chemical composition to volcanic <b>obsidians,</b> these spherulites when analyzed throw little light on the mineral nature of spherulites in rocks. They show, however, that in viscous semi-solid glasses near their fusion point crystallization tends to nucleate at certain centers and to spread outwards, producing spherulitic structures. Many salts and organic substances exhibit the same tendency, yielding beautiful spherulite crystallizations when melted and cooled rapidly on a microscopic slide.|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2003 {{the team}} was {{contacted}} by LucasArts president Simon Jeffrey, who requested that <b>Obsidian</b> make an action role-playing game set in the Star Wars universe. The team suggested a game concept which featured first-person lightsaber melee combat and that included established characters like R2-D2. Their idea was rejected, and Jeffrey instead asked <b>Obsidian</b> to create a follow-up to the BioWare-developed , as the team at <b>Obsidian</b> {{was familiar with the}} technology that the original game used. The partnership between the two companies finalized in late 2003, and development of the game, which became , began in October 2003. <b>Obsidian</b> was given 15 months to develop The Sith Lords. Originally set for a holiday 2004 release, LucasArts gave the studio an extension into 2005, before shifting the release date back to holiday 2004 following the Electronic Entertainment Expo. While LucasArts did dispatch members of its own staff to help get the game out on time, a number of features wound up being cut due to time constraints. Due to the moved deadline, <b>Obsidian</b> also did not have enough time to polish the game, and The Sith Lords suffered from crashes and other technical issues. Despite its issues, The Sith Lords was released to positive critical reception. The cut features were eventually restored by modders, who began their effort in 2009 and finished in 2012.|$|E

5|$|BioWare {{provided}} its Aurora Engine from Neverwinter Nights for the sequel. One of {{the decisions}} to use Aurora rather than build a new engine from scratch was the toolset—Obsidian wanted players {{to continue to be}} able to make content for the game, which may not have been possible with a new engine. BioWare made itself available to <b>Obsidian</b> with technical support on the engine, but <b>Obsidian</b> planned on completely overhauling Aurora, including its code. The designers wanted to improve the visuals of the first game with additions such as better lighting and textures, which required significant changes to the engine. The upgraded engine was referred to as Electron. Electron was designed to incorporate DirectX to make it compatible for a potential Xbox 360 release, but <b>Obsidian</b> eventually abandoned plans for a port to the system for financial reasons. The toolset that was used to create the game was also revamped, and included several additions like a customizable interface, a new dialogue format, and building assistants—similar to the wizards found in Microsoft Word and Excel. Like Neverwinter Nights, the toolset was included in the game's release for players to use.|$|E
50|$|Objects made {{of stone}} have also been found. The stones most used are basalts, phonolites and <b>obsidians.</b> The stones were worked to create sharp edges with which to work other raw {{materials}} (wood, bone, skin/leather) or to carry out other works such as meat cutting or food preparation. Basalt was also used to make mortars, some round and some of elongated shapes. Some round mortars were used to grind grain for flour, some others for the red ochre that {{was used for the}} paintings and to decorate the pots.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was performed to determine the hydrogen isotope fractionation factors between water vapor and “water” dissolved as hydroxyl groups in rhyolitic and feldspathic glasses and melts. Experiments were carried out in quartz tubes with a large excess of water at 530 – 850 °C and P_(H 2 O) = 1. 4 – 2. 8 bars. Infrared measurements of water concentration profiles and isotopic reversal experiments indicate that equilibrium was attained during the 210 – 5400 hr runs. The fractionation factors ([D/H_(vapor) ]/[D/H_(glass) ]) between the vapor and dissolved water in the glasses decrease from about 1. 051 to 1. 040 for rhyolite glass and 1. 049 to 1. 035 for albite-orthoclase glass as temperature increases from 530 to 750 °C. These fractionations are greater than those observed for most hydrous mineral-water systems at these temperatures, perhaps reflecting the strong hydrogen bonding of hydroxyl groups in the studied glasses. The measured fractionation factor for rhyolitic melt accounts for the observed decreases in δD with decreasing water contents of <b>obsidians</b> erupted from young rhyolitic volcanoes and supports a two-stage degassing history of these magmas. The variation of δD values with water contents of explosively erupted <b>obsidians</b> {{can be explained by}} a closed-system vapor-melt partitioning, whereas the low water contents and δD values of the quiesciently erupted domes and flows are interpreted to be a result of open-system degassing...|$|R

These analyses were used to calibrate infrared spectroscopic measurements of water in glass using several infrared and near-infrared absorption bands.
