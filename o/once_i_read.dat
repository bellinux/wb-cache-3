2500|$|On February 6, 2012, Bryant passed O'Neal for fifth {{place on}} the all-time scoring list. Bryant {{said it was an}} honor because of their championships together. O'Neal congratulated Bryant, saying [...] "I'm proud of him. I'm happy for him. And, most of all, I want to thank him for being a part of the {{greatest}} 1-2 punch ever created, never to be duplicated." [...] Bryant stated on radio the following day that he and O'Neal were never going to last as teammates. Bryant recalled: [...] "There was an interview that I heard Shaq do which he kind of threw down the challenge of me not being able to win without him. After I read that, I said, 'Aw, that's it.' Some comparison that he made with me and Penny Hardaway, and <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> that, I said, 'You know what? I can't finish my career with people saying that. There's no way.'" [...] In 2013, Bryant said that the two [...] "have a really, really good relationship now", calling it [...] "a good lesson for all of us." [...] He said the two had [...] "mutual respect" [...] for each other, while O'Neal commented that they had an [...] "athletic dislike" [...] for each other but [...] "never had a real dislike". That year, the Lakers retired O'Neal's No. 34 during a halftime ceremony. [...] Bryant did not attend the ceremony, but called O'Neal [...] "the most gifted physical specimen I've ever seen play this game" [...] in a recorded video during the event. [...] Questioned about his absence, Bryant told the media, [...] "I appreciate you guys trying to start some stuff for old times' sake." [...] Later, it came out that Bryant had missed the ceremony because he had been receiving treatment from the Lakers' training staff.|$|E

60|$|The stealthiness {{with which}} a fox stalks his game {{is one of}} the most {{remarkable}} things about him. Stupid chickens are not the only birds captured. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> in the snow the story of his hunt after a crow--wary game to be caught napping! The tracks showed that quite a flock of crows had been walking about an old field, bordered by pine and birch thickets. From the rock where he was sleeping away the afternoon the fox saw or heard them, and crept down. How cautious he was about it! Following the tracks, one could almost see him stealing along from stone to bush, from bush to grass clump, so low that his body pushed a deep trail in the snow, till he reached the cover of a low pine on the very edge of the field. There he crouched with all four feet close together under him. Then a crow came by within ten feet of the ambush. The tracks showed that the bird was a bit suspicious; he stopped often to look and listen. When his head was turned aside for an instant the fox launched himself; just two jumps, and he had him. Quick as he was, the wing marks showed that the crow had started, and was pulled down out of the air. Reynard carried him into the densest thicket of scrub pines he could find, and ate him there, doubtless to avoid the attacks of the rest of the flock, which followed him screaming vengeance.|$|E

He immediately granted it me; but, like an old courtier, {{told me it was}} wholly on my account, but that he heard I had intended to engage Mr. Secretary to speak to him, and desired I would engage him to do so, but that, however, he did it only for my sake. This is a Court trick, to oblige as many as you can at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> prayers to poor Mrs. Wesley, who is very much out of order, instead of going to church; and then I went to Court, which I found very full, in expectation of seeing Prince Eugene, who landed last night, and lies at Leicester House; he was not to see the Queen till six this evening. I hope and believe he comes too late to do the Whigs any good. I refused dining with the Secretary, and was like to lose my dinner, which was at a private acquaintance's. I went at six to see the Prince at Court, but he was gone in to the Queen; and when he came out, Mr. Secretary, who introduced him, walked so near him that he quite screened me from him with his great periwig. I'll tell you a good passage: as Prince Eugene was going with Mr. Secretary to Court, he told the Secretary that Hoffman, the Emperor's Resident, said to His Highness that it was not proper to go to Court without a long wig, and his was a tied-up one: [...] "Now," [...] says the Prince, [...] "I knew not what to do, for I never had a long periwig in my life; and I have sent to all my valets and footmen, to see whether any of them have one, that I might borrow it, but none of them has any."--Was not this spoken very greatly with some sort of contempt? But the Secretary said it was a thing of no consequence, and only observed by gentlemen ushers. I supped with Lord Masham, where Lord Treasurer and Mr. Secretary supped with us: the first left us at twelve, but the rest did not part till two, yet I have written all this, because it is fresh: and now I'll go sleep if I can; that is, I believe I shall, because I have drank a little.|$|E

40|$|It {{began as}} a joke; a novelty that I thought would go nowhere. One warm summer’s night {{browsing}} the internet for no good reason, I stumbled across some book called Batman and Philosophy. I’d just written a paper on the film The Dark Knight but I’d never considered actually investing any time or money in the topic of Batman. Just for the novelty, though, I ordered it. But after reading it I did another basic Google search; I found another Batman book. And then another. And then another. But let’s {{go back to the}} beginning. In 2008 I, like millions of others, wandered into a dark cubical room with my father and sister to see The Dark Knight. The 16 year old boy in me thought it was awesome, but thought little more about it until one day when I stumbled upon a blog post by a screenwriter in North Carolina analyzing the film. I even remember the last line to this day; Batman “tried to make Gotham a better place, and failed, in every conceivable way. The Joker wins at the end of The Dark Knight and now it’s Gordon’s dogs who chase him. ” <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> that last line, I was hooked.

40|$|Stereotypical {{gender roles}} have {{probably}} existed {{as long as}} human culture and are such a natural part if our lives that we barely take notice of them. Nevertheless, images of what we perceive as typically masculine and feminine in appearance and behavior depend on the individual’s perception. Within each gender one can find different stereotypes.

I find it interesting hoe stereotypes function {{and how they are}} preserved almost without our awareness. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> started <b>reading</b> and researching the topic of stereotypes it became clear to me that literature contains many stereotypes.

It seemed that he had lent his name to the prospectus of a company formed {{for the purpose of}} working some worthless patent designed to revolutionize the silk weaving trade.

One angry shareholder stated plainly at the meeting that he had taken his shares on account of the Duke's name upon the prospectus, and hinted ugly things. The Duke had risen calmly in his place. He assured them that he fully recognized his responsibilities in the matter. If the person who had last spoken was in earnest when he stated that the Duke's name had induced him to take shares in this company, then he was prepared to relieve him of those shares at the price which he had paid for them. Further, if there was any other persons who were able honestly to say that the name of the Duke of Rowchester upon the prospectus had induced them to invest their money in this concern, his offer extended also to them.|$|R

He had been in the profession for more than 40 years and had seen repeated attempts tomake clinical practicemore research based and was not optimistic that this latest attempt would be any more successful than previous ones. What was once a buzzword was the theme of our 2005 national convention in San Diego. The buzzword is, of course, evidence-based practice.
