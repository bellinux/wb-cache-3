40|$|Acute {{otitis media}} {{is a common}} {{infection}} in children. Most acute otitis media episodes can be treated at an outpatient setting with antimicrobials, or only expectant <b>observation.</b> <b>Hospital</b> treatment with parenteral medication, and myringotomy or tympanostomy, {{may be needed to}} treat those with severe, prolonged symptoms, or with complications. The most common intratemporal complication of acute otitis media is acute mastoiditis. If a child with acute mastoiditis does not respond to this treatment, or if complications develop, further examinations and other surgical procedures, including mastoidectomy, are considered. Since the treatment of complicated acute otitis media and complicated acute mastoiditis differs, it is important to differentiate these two conditions. This article focuses on the differential diagnostics of acute otitis media and acute mastoiditis in children...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{question}} of whether any adverse cognitive or psychosocial outcomes occur after mild head injury in early childhood has evoked considerable controversy. This study examined mild head injury before age 10 and potential differences in late childhood/early adolescence {{as a function of}} severity of mild injury and age at injury. Methods: A fully prospective longitudinal design tracked a large birth cohort of children. Confirmed cases of mild head injury before age 10 were divided on the basis of outpatient medical attention (n= 64 – 84) or inpatient <b>observation</b> (<b>hospital</b> overnight; n= 26 – 28) and compared with the non-injured remainder of the cohort (reference group; n= 613 – 807). A range of pre-injury and post-injury child and family characteristics were used to control for any potential confounds. Outcome after injury before and after age 5 was also assessed. Results: After accounting for several demographic, family, and pre-injury characteristics, the inpatient but not the outpatient group displayed increased hyperactivity/inattention and conduct disorder between ages 10 to 13, as rated by both mothers and teachers. Psychosocial deficits were more prevalent in the inpatient subgroup injured before age 5. No clear effects were evident for various cognitive/academic measures, irrespective of severity of mild injury or age at injury...|$|E
40|$|A nonparametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is {{performed}} on {{hospitals in the}} federal state of Saxony (Germany) and in Switzerland. This study is of interest from three points of view. First, contrary to most existing work, patient days are not treated as an output but as an input. Second, the usual DEA assumption of a homogeneous sample is tested and rejected for {{a large part of}} the observations. The proposed solution is to restrict DEA to comparable observations in the two countries. Finally, hospital beds are treated as a discretionary input in one DEA and as a fixed input in the other, and the effect on efficiency is related to differences in hospital planning in Germany and Switzerland.

40|$|Background: There is an {{increase}} in admission rate for elderly patients to the ICU. Mortality rates are lower when more liberal ICU admission threshold are compared to more restrictive threshold. We sought to describe the temporal trends in elderly admissions and outcomes in a tertiary hospital before and after the addition of an 8 -bed medical ICU. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a comprehensive longitudinal ICU database, from a large tertiary medical center, examining trends in patients ’ characteristics, severity of illness, intensity of care and mortality rates over the years 2001 – 2008. The study population consisted of elderly patients and the primary endpoints were 28 day and one year mortality from ICU admission. Results: Between the years 2001 and 2008, 7, 265 elderly patients had 8, 916 admissions to ICU. The rate of admission to the ICU increased by 5. 6 % per year. After an eight bed MICU was added, the severity of disease on ICU admission dropped significantly and crude mortality rates decreased thereafter. Adjusting for severity of disease on presentation, there was a decreased mortality at 28 - days but no improvement in one- year survival rates for elderly patient admitted to the ICU over the years of <b>observation.</b> <b>Hospital</b> mortality rates have been unchanged from 2001 through 2008.

40|$|Review question/objective What is {{the effect}} of using the teach-back method for health {{education}} to improve adherence to treatment regimen and self-management in chronic disease? Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider all studies that include adult patients (aged 18 years and over) in any healthcare setting, either as inpatients (eg acute care, medical and surgical wards) or those who attend primary health care, family medical practice, general medical practice, clinics, outpatient departments, rehabilitation or community settings. Participants need to have been diagnosed as having one or more chronic diseases including heart failure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, arthritis, epilepsy or a mental health condition. Studies that include seriously ill patients, and/or those who have impairments in verbal communication and cognitive function will be excluded. Types of intervention This review will consider studies that investigate the use of the teach-back method alone or in combination with other supporting education, either in routine or research intervention education programs; regardless of how long the programs were and whether or not a follow-up was conducted. The intervention could be delivered by any healthcare professional. The comparator will be any health education for chronic disease that does not include the teach-back method. Types of outcomes Primary outcomes of interest are disease-specific knowledge, adherence, and self-management knowledge, behavior and skills measured using patient report, nursing observation or validated measurement scales. Secondary outcomes include knowledge retention, self-efficacy, hospital readmission, hospitalization, and quality of life, also measured using patient report, nursing <b>observation,</b> <b>hospital</b> records or validated measurement scales...|$|E
40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} shown that there is an {{increase}} in admission rate for elderly patients to the ICU. Mortality rates are lower when more liberal ICU admission threshold are used in hospitals with high ICU bed capacity compared to more restrictive threshold among hospitals with lower ICU bed capacities. We sought to describe the temporal trends in elderly admissions and outcomes in a tertiary hospital before and after the addition of an 8 -bed medical ICU. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a comprehensive longitudinal ICU database, from a large tertiary medical center, examining trends in patients’ characteristics, severity of illness, intensity of care and mortality rates over the years 2001 - 2008. The study population consisted of elderly patients who had an unplanned ICU admission. The primary endpoints were 28 day and one year mortality from unplanned ICU admission. Results: Between the years 2001 and 2008, 7, 265 elderly patients above the age of 65 had 8, 916 unplanned admissions to ICU. The rate of admission to the ICU of elderly patients increased by 5. 6 % per year. After 2006, the year when an eight bed MICU was added, the severity of disease on ICU admission dropped significantly and crude mortality rates decreased thereafter. Adjusting for severity of disease on presentation, there was a decreased mortality at 28 - days but no improvement in one- year survival rates for elderly patient admitted to the ICU over the years of <b>observation.</b> <b>Hospital</b> mortality rates have been unchanged from 2001 through 2008. Conclusion: In a high capacity ICU bed hospital, there was a temporal decrease in severity of disease on ICU admission, more so after the addition of additional medical ICU beds. While crude mortality rates decreased over the study period, adjusted one-year survival in ICU survivors did not change with the addition of ICU beds. These findings suggest that outcome in critically ill elderly patients may not be influenced by ICU admission. Adding additional ICU beds to deal with the increasing age of the population may therefore not be effective...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} practices {{related to}} observation care {{and to examine}} the current models of pediatric observation medicine in US children's hospitals. DESIGN: We utilized 2 web‐based surveys to examine observation care in the 42 hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database. We obtained information regarding the designation of observation status, including the criteria used to admit patients into <b>observation.</b> From <b>hospitals</b> reporting the use of observation status, we requested specific details relating to the structures of observation care and the processes of care for observation patients following emergency department treatment. RESULTS: A total of 37 hospitals responded to Survey 1, and 20 hospitals responded to Survey 2. Designated observation units were present in only 12 of 31 (39 %) <b>hospitals</b> that report <b>observation</b> patient data to the Pediatric Health Information System. Observation status was variably {{defined in terms of}} duration of treatment and prespecified criteria. Observation periods were limited to < 48 hours in 24 of 31 (77 %) hospitals. Hospitals reported that various standards were used by different payers to determine observation status reimbursement. Observation care was delivered in a variety of settings. Most hospitals indicated that there were no differences in the clinical care delivered to virtual observation status patients when compared with other inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Observation is a variably applied patient status, defined differently by individual hospitals. Consistency in the designation of patients under <b>observation</b> status among <b>hospitals</b> and payers may be necessary to compare quality outcomes and costs, as well as optimize models of pediatric observation care.
