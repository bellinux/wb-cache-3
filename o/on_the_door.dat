5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E

5|$|Bathhouses are {{not always}} {{identifiable}} as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Bathhouses sometimes display the rainbow flag, which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first television advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on commercial television in Melbourne promoted Wet on Wellington, a sauna in Wellington Street, Collingwood.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Ruth Rosiene, a {{descendant}} of the Perkins and Ashlawn's owner, was featured in an article by The Day. Rosiene had been maintaining the house for years, which required repainting every four or five years.

The article notes that the original sliding shutters are now absent, whereas the original nomination form from 1979 stated they were not installed.|$|E

Sharp died at approximately two o'clock in the morning. After lying in state in the House of Representatives Hall, he was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|On July 29, 2008, the PGPD and PGSO {{raided the}} home of Cheye Calvo, {{the mayor of the}} Town of Berwyn Heights. The raid team did not {{coordinate}} their action with the local police department as required by mutual agreement, nor did they did not obtain a warrant or knock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to announce their presence. They raided the house with explosive devices and with firearms drawn. During the course of the raid, they shot and killed the Calvo family's two pet Labrador retriever dogs.|$|E

Cardinal tells her that Krycek is headed to an abandoned missile silo in Black Crow, North Dakota. There, the agents are captured by the Smoking Man's men and are escorted away. Deep inside, Krycek sits atop the UFO and coughs out the black oil, which seeps into the ship. Skinner recovers and returns to work. Mulder sees Scully at Melissa's grave, explaining that Cardinal {{was found dead in}} his cell. Meanwhile, Krycek is trapped within the silo, banging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in an attempt to be let out.|$|E

5|$|These Nishidhis {{detail the}} names, dates, the {{duration}} of the vow, and other austerities performed by the person who observed the vow. The earliest Nishidhis (6th to 8th century) mostly have an inscription on the rock without any symbols. This style continued until the 10th century when footprints were added alongside the inscription. After the 11th century, Nishidhis are inscribed on slabs or pillars with panels and symbols. These slabs or pillars were frequently erected in mandapas (pillared pavilions), near basadi (temples), or sometimes as an inscription <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> frame or pillars of the temple.|$|E
5|$|With {{the skin}} {{no larger than}} a {{periwinkle}} leaf, he is visited by Pauline in his room; she expresses her love for him. When she learns the truth about the shagreen and her role in Raphaël's demise, she is horrified. Raphaël cannot control his desire for her and she rushes into an adjoining room to escape him and so save his life. He pounds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and declares both his love and his desire to die in her arms. She, meanwhile, is trying to kill herself to free him from his desire. He breaks down the door, they consummate their love in a fiery moment of passion, and he dies.|$|E
5|$|Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{return to}} Squamash, {{and the two}} ask the sheriff about the murder of an {{unidentified}} transient. Doggett believes that the transient was murdered by Mulder. Doggett and Skinner travel to the cemetery and discover that the grave dug up by the backhoe earlier {{is that of the}} transient. The two find the casket empty, but Doggett notices that the transient tunneled out of his own coffin. The sheriff arrives with the creature—revealed to be a soul eater, a creature that subsists off human disease—at the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> again. The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Hangemuhl. Doggett suggests to Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect Hangemuhl from the man {{who was supposed to be}} in that grave. Meanwhile, deep underground, the creature vomits what appears to be the visceral remains of Marie into a person-shaped mold in the soil.|$|E

5|$|Epstein {{died of an}} {{overdose}} of Carbitral, a form of barbiturate or sleeping pill, in his locked bedroom, on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler had knocked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and then hearing no response, asked the housekeeper to call the police. Epstein was found on a single bed, dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single bed. At the statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident; caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral in his system, combined with alcohol. It was revealed {{that he had taken}} six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol they reduced his tolerance to lethal levels.|$|E
5|$|Homer, Bart and {{the group}} arrive at Miami's Pro Player Stadium for pre-game festivities, but the ticket agent reveals the tickets Wally had bought were counterfeit. Attempting to sneak into the stadium, the group is locked up in the {{detention}} center and vents their frustration on Homer. They are freed when Kogen's friend Dolly Parton uses her extra-strength makeup remover to dissolve the lock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> They run into a skybox suite and get {{a view of the}} game until the owner Rupert Murdoch arrives and confronts them. Homer's posse flee to the field, chased by Murdoch's security, until they get lost in the sea of victorious players. The group ends up in the locker room where they share the celebration, and everyone has a Super Bowl ring on one of their hands at game's end.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} {{when proposing}} a disputation {{to have the}} theses printed by the university press and publicly posted. No copies of a Wittenberg printing of the Ninety-five Theses have survived, {{but this is not}} surprising as Luther was not famous and the importance of the document was not recognized. In Wittenberg, the university statutes demand that theses be posted on every church door in the city, but Philip Melanchthon, who first mentioned the posting of the Theses, only mentioned the door of All Saints' Church. Melanchthon also claimed that Luther posted the Theses on 31 October, but this conflicts with several of Luther's statements about the course of events, and Luther always claimed that he brought his objections through proper channels rather than inciting a public controversy. It is possible that while Luther later saw the 31 October letter to Albert as the beginning of the Reformation, he did not post the Theses to the church door until mid-November, but he may not have posted them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> at all. Regardless, the Theses were well-known among the Wittenberg intellectual elite soon after Luther sent them to Albert.|$|E

5|$|Luther {{sent the}} Theses {{enclosed}} {{with a letter}} to Albert of Brandenburg, the Archbishop of Mainz, on 31 October 1517, a date now considered {{the start of the}} Reformation and commemorated annually as Reformation Day. Luther may have also posted the Theses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of All Saints' Church and other churches in Wittenberg in accordance with University custom on 31 October or in mid-November. The Theses were quickly reprinted, translated, and distributed throughout Germany and Europe. They initiated a pamphlet war with indulgence preacher Johann Tetzel, which spread Luther's fame even further. Luther's ecclesiastical superiors had him tried for heresy, which culminated in his excommunication in 1521. Though the Theses were the start of the Reformation, Luther did not consider indulgences to be as important as other theological matters which would divide the church, such as justification by faith alone and the bondage of the will. His breakthrough on these issues would come later, and he did not see the writing of the Theses as the point at which his beliefs diverged from those of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Some {{weeks after}} their encounter, word reached Le Gris of accusations being made against him by Carrouges and his wife. It {{will never be}} known what basis these {{allegations}} had in fact but Carrouges claimed that on 18 January 1386, whilst Carrouges was still in Paris, Le Gris had entered the chateau of Carrouges' mother Nicole and there raped Marguerite. According to Marguerite de Carrouges' testimony, a squire in Le Gris' employ named Adam Louvel had knocked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the chateau and demanded entry. All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so Marguerite was alone when Louvel called. Once inside, Louvel gave Marguerite a message that Le Gris was outside and desired to see her because he was passionately in love with her. Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris broke {{into the house and}} propositioned her, offering money in exchange. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris attempted to take her by force and raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel. As Le Gris departed, he threatened her with violence if she told of the encounter.|$|E
5|$|The Special Boat Section {{was founded}} in July 1940 by a Commando officer, Roger Courtney. Courtney became a {{commando}} recruit in mid-1940, and {{was sent to the}} Combined Training Centre in Scotland. He was unsuccessful in his initial attempts to convince Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes and later Admiral Theodore Hallett, commander of the Combined Training Centre, that his idea of a folding kayak brigade would be effective. He decided to infiltrate , a Landing Ship, Infantry anchored in the River Clyde. Courtney paddled to the ship, climbed aboard undetected, wrote his initials <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the captain's cabin, and stole a deck gun cover. He presented the soaking cover to a group of high-ranking Royal Navy officers meeting at a nearby Inveraray hotel. He was promoted to captain, and given command of twelve men, the first Special Boat Service/Special Boat Section.|$|E
