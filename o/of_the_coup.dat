5|$|At {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> Prince Paul was in Zagreb {{en route to}} a planned holiday in Brdo. On the morning of 27 March, Deputy Prime Minister Maček was {{informed}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> and met Prince Paul at Zagreb's railway station to discuss the situation. Maček suggested that Paul stay in Zagreb, with the possibility of mobilizing army units in the Banovina of Croatia in his support. Prince Paul declined this offer, at least partially because his wife Princess Olga and children remained in Belgrade. He reached the capital by train that evening and was immediately ordered to sign papers abolishing the regency. He was subsequently exiled to Greece.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav coup d'état {{occurred}} on 27 March 1941 in Belgrade, Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The coup was planned and {{conducted by a}} group of pro-Western Serb-nationalist Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers formally led by its commander, General Dušan Simović, who had been associated with a number of coup plots from 1938 onwards. For practical purposes Brigadier General of Military Aviation Borivoje Mirković, Major Živan Knežević of the Yugoslav Royal Guards, and his brother Radoje Knežević all performed leadership roles in the conduct <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup.</b> In addition to Radoje Knežević, some other civilian leaders were probably aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> before it was launched and moved to support it once it occurred, but they were not among the organisers.|$|E
5|$|The result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> was a {{polarization}} of Spain. Following General Mola's orders of instilling fear in potential pro-republican ranks {{by means of}} systematic executions in captured cities, a spontaneous revenge {{in the form of}} random murders of perceived fascists, conservatives and coup-sympathizers by exalted mobs flared up in loyalist areas.|$|E
25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup's</b> {{prominent}} targets, Major-General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, caught wind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{plot and}} escaped capture. He {{then began to}} move against <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> conspirators. Ironsi eventually managed to prevent <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> and then took power himself. During these events, Prime Minister Balewa died while under <b>the</b> arrest <b>of</b> Ifeajuna. Official police reports into <b>the</b> circumstances <b>of</b> his death (which remain redacted) claim Ifeajuna shot Balewa while driving to Abeokuta and abandoned the body by the road. Some claim that Balewa was not deliberately killed (given {{that he was not}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup's</b> stated assassination targets), but rather died of an asthma or heart attack during the ordeal. This subject remains an unresolved element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1966 <b>coup</b> attempt.|$|R
5|$|Tho was apprehended during <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> and {{put under}} house arrest while the {{plotters}} consolidated their grip on power; he was then removed from the political scene. General Nguyen Van Vy, who had returned from France after Diệm's deposal to serve as Deputy Chief of Staff for training, was put {{under house arrest}} before being released within a day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup's</b> success.|$|R

5|$|At this point, several {{conflicts}} {{began to}} develop that threatened {{the future of the}} new government at Athens. First, the planned coup at Samos was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats and a group of Athenians who they entrusted with helping them. When the army at Samos heard the news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> at Athens, which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government, they declared their loyalty to democracy and hostility to the new government. At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of Scelias {{as the leader of the}} moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by Phrynicus, containing such prominent leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> as Peisander and Antiphon, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were willing to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although willing to seek peace with Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens' power, were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5,000, presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher.|$|E
5|$|In the novel's final chapters, {{the three}} storylines {{intersect}} with increasing frequency. The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture {{and death of}} the assassins {{at the hands of}} the SIM, the failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> the rape of Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country. The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island.|$|E
5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that Aubame participated in the planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup.</b> It appears that he joined the effort after being recruited by the new government. His nephew, Pierre Eyeguet, a former ambassador to the United Kingdom, may have known of the plot beforehand and notified his uncle, although it is unknown whether or not Aubame established contact with the plotters.|$|E
50|$|During the First Republic, the Democratic Party, led by Afonso Costa, {{managed to}} hold power despite {{suffering}} several revolutionary attempts, both monarchist and republican. Although some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coups</b> partially succeeded (Monarchy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, Pimenta de Castro, Sidónio Pais) the Democratic Party always managed to retain power.|$|R

5|$|Jadid's {{government}} {{was the most}} radical administration in Syria's history. The coup created a permanent schism between the Syrian and Iraqi regional branches of the Ba'ath Party and their respective National Commands, with many senior Syrian Ba'athists defecting to Iraq. As a legacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> during Jadid's rule, Syria initiated a propaganda campaign against the Iraqi Ba'athists. Jadid's government would be overthrown in the Corrective Movement of 1970, which brought Hafez al-Assad to power.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 1972, {{just before}} the newly renamed Constituent Assembly was to approve a revised constitution, Lon Nol {{announced}} that he was suspending the deliberations. He then forced Cheng Heng, the chief of state since Sihanouk's deposition, to surrender his authority to him. On the second anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> Lon Nol relinquished his authority as chief of state, but retained his position as prime minister and defense minister.|$|E
5|$|Vladimir Kryuchkov, the KGB Chairman, {{had told}} Pavlov <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> on 18 August, {{one day before}} it began. He was asked by Kryuchkov to meet his co-plotters at the Moscow Kremlin, where on 19 August, he and his co-conspirators {{appeared}} on live television and told the Soviet people that Gorbachev was indisposed. As the day wore on it soon became apparent that Pavlov had been drinking since he issued several contradictory orders and repeated himself. In retrospect {{he admitted that he}} had been drinking with his son the day before. On the same day, his fellow plotters decided to depose Pavlov, sending him to his dacha where his wife took care of him. As with all the others, Pavlov was arrested following the collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup.</b> Shortly after Pavlov was hospitalised with hypertension whilst remaining in custody. He was released on bail in January 1993 and granted amnesty by the Russian State Duma in 1994.|$|E
5|$|John's coup {{was written}} {{extensively}} about by contemporaries: the historian Niketas Choniates deals with it briefly and rather dismissively, but Nicholas Mesarites left a long eyewitness account of events, in which his own role is suitably emphasized. The scholars Nikephoros Chrysoberges and Euthymios Tornikes wrote speeches in celebration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup's</b> failure.|$|R
2500|$|The 2013 book [...] "Party Music", by Rickey Vincent, was {{inspired}} by <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Coup's</b> 2001 album [...] "Party Music" [...] and discussions that the author had with Boots Riley about the subject. The book {{is a history of}} [...] "The Lumpen", the Black Panther Party's funk band. Riley wrote the introduction to the book.|$|R

5|$|Accounts of {{the final}} {{termination}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> attempt vary between historians. Gleijeses stated that while the freighter {{was on its way}} to Nicaragua, a CIA employee went to Miller, and asked him to sign a document on behalf of the munitions department. Miller refused, and instead showed the document to his superiors, who in turn informed Dean Acheson. Gleijeses writes that Acheson immediately spoke to Truman as a result of this document, and the operation was cut short. Nick Cullather writes that due to Somoza spreading the word about the coup, the State Department decided that the cover of the operation had been lost. Other diplomats began to learn of the operation, and on 8 October Dean Acheson summoned Smith and called off the operation.|$|E
5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing the details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> {{to go public}} would damage {{the image of the}} US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the Organization of American States, or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. In order to achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention {{in the internal affairs of}} other countries. If PBFORTUNE had become public knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a country that was also a member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy. Thus the State Department promptly ended the operation when they became aware that its cover was blown.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Diệm regime, Thảo was {{designated}} by the head of state Minh and the civilian Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ to create the nucleus of a group called the Council of Notables, and promote it to the public. which, as an interim body of prominent civilians, would advise the military junta before it handed over power to an elected legislature under civilian rule. The Council of 60 people, 58 men and 2 women, held its first meeting on 1 January 1964 in Saigon. The council was composed almost entirely of well-known professionals and academics and, as such, was hardly representative of South Vietnamese society; there were no delegates from the agricultural or labour sectors of the economy. It gained a reputation for being a forum of debate, rather than a means of enacting policy change and government programs for the populace. Thơ and Minh assigned Thảo with the task of encouraging a transition to democracy by facilitating the formation of a few political parties. This was ineffective, as many political parties with only a handful of members sprang up and squabbled. Within 45 days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> 62 parties had formed but nothing meaningful resulted. In the end, these efforts proved to be irrelevant as Minh's junta and the accompanying Council of Notables were overthrown {{before the end of the}} month. During this period, Thảo served as the head of military security and played a role in replacing Colonel Đỗ Khắc Mai with Nguyễn Cao Kỳ as the head of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. In the aftermath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> Vietcong attacks increased markedly amid infighting among the Saigon leadership, which Thảo had helped to stir up.|$|E

5|$|Another result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> {{was that}} the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} rose, Lithuania {{asked the}} Allied Supreme Council to intervene, and it proposed two demarcation lines to prevent open hostilities, drawn in June and July 1919 (the second one {{was known as}} the Foch Line). However, Poland ignored both lines and advanced deeper into the Lithuanian-controlled territory. Faced with pressure from the Entente, Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski, who was significantly involved in planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> did not want open Polish–Lithuanian hostilities, which could led to much bloodshed and even greater tensions between Poland and Lithuania. Instead, since he thought there were enough Polish sympathizers in Lithuania to stage a coup d'etat, he decided to plan one to topple the Lithuanian government.|$|E
5|$|By mid-October, Diệm and Nhu knew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> plans, but did {{not know}} that Đính was firmly among them, {{although}} they were wary of him. Nhu then decided to outwit the generals with a counter-plot. The generals heard of this and decided to counteract him. The other generals were still suspicious of Đính, fearing he would betray them. Having discovered that Nhu was trying to use him to trap them, and not sure which side he was really on, they promised to make him interior minister and offered other rewards if he helped to overthrow the Ngô brothers.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{headed for}} the cellar, joining his younger brother and confidant Ngô Đình Nhu, and his wife Madame Nhu. Brigadier General Nguyễn Khánh, {{at the time the}} Chief of Staff of the ARVN, climbed over the palace wall to reach Diệm during the siege. Khanh lived in the city center, close to the palace, and awoken by the gunfire, he drove towards the action. The {{plotters}} had tried to put him under house arrest at the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> but were unaware that he moved house. Khanh proceeded to coordinate the loyalist defenders, along with Ky Quan Liem, the deputy director of the Civil Guard.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> the rebels forced Tung to order his men to surrender. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend Gia Long Palace. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had told his men to surrender. Minh ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy, since the special forces commander had disguised his men in army uniforms and framed the generals for the pagoda raids. The generals {{were aware of the}} threat Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces.|$|E
5|$|Gabon gained its {{independence}} from France on 17 August 1960. The country had a relatively high standard of living and {{was considered one of}} the more stable countries in West Africa, both politically and economically. At the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> the country had an estimated US$200 average annual income {{and was one of the}} few countries in Africa with a positive trade balance, with exports exceeding imports by 30 percent. As of 1964, the country was among the largest producers of uranium and manganese in French Africa, which Time suggested was one of the reasons for France's response to the coup. It also had petroleum, iron, and logging interests stationed in Gabon.|$|E
