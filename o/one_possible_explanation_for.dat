5|$|<b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> this {{asymmetry}} is {{a large-scale}} convection above the core. The convection can create {{variations in the}} local abundances of elements, resulting in uneven nuclear burning during the collapse, bounce and resulting expansion.|$|E
5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
5|$|During his exile at Cephellania, Hybrida {{pretended to}} act as {{governor}} of the island which the people secretly allowed. In 49 BC, his nephew, Mark Antony, {{was elected to the}} role of tribune of the people and a legate of Caesar's in Italy. Despite this, Hybrida remained in exile until 47 BC when he returned to Rome at the request of Caesar himself. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> this is that Mark Antony was indebted to Hybrida; as Hybrida was in exile and had no civil rights, he could not enforce a payment and this suited Mark Antony. Hybrida was a candidate for censorship around 45 BC; his character and support from Mark Antony, however, made his attempt at the position a failure. The final mention of Hybrida during his life comes from Cicero who commented upon Mark Antony's divorce from Antonia Hybrida Major and the insult this conferred upon Hybrida himself.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a direct}} test, this paper studies the month-of-the-year {{effect on the}} higher moments of six {{industrial}} stock indices of the Hong Kong market. We also examine the portfolio effect on skewness and kurtosis across {{month of the year}} to see if such an anomaly exists. The empirical results support a weak month-of-the-year effect in higher moments of stock returns. Using a complete sample of all possible combinations for each portfolio size, we show that portfolio effect varies across month of the year for both skewness and kurtosis. In particular, our results show that diversification does not necessarily provide benefits to rational investors when the stock return distribution is non-normal, even though portfolio formation can reduce standard deviation. In June, August and October, diversification across industrial sectors results in a more negatively skewed and leptokurtic return distribution, which is not preferred by investors with risk-aversion.

5|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that Kuiper belt objects {{are composed of}} a mixture of rock {{and a variety of}} ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The temperature of the belt is only about 50 K, so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid. The densities and rockâ€“ice fractions are known for {{only a small number of}} objects for which the diameters and the masses have been determined. The diameter can be determined by imaging with a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when an object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, by using the albedo of an object calculated from its infrared emissions. The masses are determined using the semi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are therefore known only for a few binary objects. The densities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The least dense objects are thought to be largely composed of ice and have significant porosity. The densest objects are likely composed of rock with a thin crust of ice. There is a trend of low densities for small objects and high densities for the largest objects. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> this trend is that ice was lost from the surface layers when differentiated objects collided to form the largest objects.|$|E

40|$|Transverse Schottky spectra and beam {{transfer}} functions (BTFs) of coasting ion beams {{were measured}} in the heavy ion synchrotron SIS- 18 in order to study the impact of space charge on the transverse beam dynamics. The particle number in the beam was varied to investigate the intensity dependence of the space-charge effect. No cooling {{was applied to the}} beams throughout the experiment. The expected deformation of the Schottky spectra and BTFs is observed. An analytic model with linear space charge is employed to describe the deformed Schottky and BTF signals. In this model, the incoherent space-charge force and the coherent forces due to impedances are treated separately. Using the model, the space-charge induced tune shift is evaluated both from the position and the form of the signals. The data are well described by the model, only in the high-intensity BTFs deviations are observed. The stability diagrams are shifted according to the space-charge parameter obtained from the BTFs. In addition, the tune shift is estimated by virtue of measured beam profiles and particle numbers.

40|$|Objectives. When used in subject-verb-object sentences, {{abstract}} verbs seem {{to elicit}} stronger causal inferences about {{the object and}} stronger personality inferences about the subject than concrete verbs. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> this paradox is that inferring traits and explaining behaviors imply different cognitive mechanisms. The second is that verb abstraction affects inferences about the subject and the object in a curvilinear manner so that the paradox occurs because different studies have compared different verb levels. The present {{study was designed to}} compare the two explanations. Design and methods. Participants read subject-verb-object sentences with descriptive action verbs, interpretative action verbs and state verbs. Half of them rated the degree to which each interactant caused the event, the other half rated {{the degree to which the}} events were informative about each interactantâ€™ personality Results. Participants made stronger inferences about the subject and weaker inferences about the object from interpretative than from descriptive action verbs. They made weaker inferences about the subject and stronger inferences about the object from state verbs than from both interpretative and descriptive action verbs. The curvilinear effect of verb abstraction did not depend on whether participants made causal or personality inferences. Conclusion. Verb abstraction affects causality and personality inferences in a curvilinear manner. Therefore, studies on the effect of verb abstraction on inferences should compare multiple verb types and that researchers seeking to explain the effect of verb abstraction on inferences from descriptions of interpersonal events should explain a curvilinear rather than a linear trend. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Once {{they have}} {{exhausted}} their supply of hydrogen through nuclear fusion, medium- to low-mass stars shed their outer layers {{to form a}} planetary nebula and evolve into white dwarfs.

25|$|This first type, usually {{known as}} the First small cross or Reform type, {{remained}} in currency for Edgarâ€™s last years, the whole of Edward the Martyrâ€™s short reign and even into {{the first years of}} Ã†thelred II, who came to the throne in 978/9. At some point early in his reign, however, another of the features that was to characterise the late Anglo-Saxon currency system came into play: the first of many changes of type. More than fifty such changes occurred during the existence of the coinage as reformed by Edgar, which persisted until the 1150s. Within the reign of Ã†thelred, for instance, six such changes can be seen, manifested in the progression of the following types: First Small cross; First hand; Second hand; Crux; Long Cross; Helmet; Last Small cross. After the death of Cnut, under whom another three types (Quatrefoil, Helmet and Short cross) were struck, types become more numerous and changes presumably more frequent: fourteen types were struck in the years between 1035 and the Norman Conquest of 1066, probably lasting only two or three years each. It is presumed that each change of type required coins of old money to be exchanged for new, with the king and the moneyer taking a cut either as a portion {{of the value of the}} new coins or from the minting process. The weight of the coinage varied considerably, even within types, suggesting that there may have been some profit taken in minting by extracting silver from the coinage, though within the kingdom of England it would have been possible to enforce that all coins be accepted at face value regardless of weight. Hoard evidence, at least from before the 1030s, suggests that reminting of the whole coinage was stipulated at each change of type, for a number of hoards survive consisting of only one type. Alongside these, however, are â€˜savingsâ€™ hoards, which contain a mixture of two or more types; and a mixture of types becomes much more common in hoards from after the 1030s. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> this change in the pattern of production and hoarding is that it came to be the rule, after the 1030s, that only payments to the crown had to be in the current type, whereas other types of English coinage were viable for other purposes.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Po Valley (Italy) model {{inter-comparison}} exercise (POMI) {{has been}} carried out in order to explore the changes in air quality in response to changes in emissions. The starting point was the evaluation of the simulated particulate matter and ozone (O- 3) modelled concentrations against observations for the year 2005 of the six participating chemical transport models. As models were run with the same configuration in terms of spatial resolution, boundary condition, emissions and meteorology, the differences presented in the models' results are only related to their formulation. As described in the paper, significant efforts have been made to improve the accuracy of the anthropogenic emissions and meteorological input data. Nevertheless, none of the models using the proposed meteorology succeeded to fulfil the quality performance criteria set in the 2008 Air Quality Directive and in the literature for particulate matter, while also for ozone the results are not very satisfying. Although the overall performances look better for O- 3 than for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 mu m (PM 10), the models tend to exhibit a similar behaviour and show the largest model variability in locations where concentrations are the highest (urban areas for PM 10 and suburbs and hilly areas for O- 3). While differences are significant in terms of standard deviation and bias, the correlation remains quite similar among models indicating that models generally capture well the main temporal variations, especially the seasonal <b>ones.</b> <b>Possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> this common behaviour and a discussion of the differences among models' results are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|By using updated stellar {{low mass}} stars models, we can {{systematically}} investigate the nucleosynthesis processes occurring in AGB stars, when these objects experience recurrent thermal pulses and third dredge-up episodes. In this paper we present the database {{dedicated to the}} nucleosynthesis of AGB stars: the FRUITY (FRANEC Repository of Updated Isotopic Tables & Yields) database. An interactive web-based interface allows users to freely download the full (from H to Bi) isotopic composition, as it changes after each third dredge-up episode and the stellar yields the models produce. A first set of AGB models, having masses in the range 1. 5 < M/Msun < 3. 0 and metallicities 1 e- 3 < Z < 2 e- 2, is discussed here. For each model, {{a detailed description of}} the physical and the chemical evolution is provided. In particular, we illustrate the details of the s-process and we evaluate the theoretical uncertainties due to the parametrization adopted to model convection and mass loss. The resulting nucleosynthesis scenario is checked by comparing the theoretical [hs/ls] and [Pb/hs] ratios to those obtained from the available abundance analysis of s-enhanced stars. On the average, the variation with the metallicity of these spectroscopic indexes is well reproduced by theoretical models, although the predicted spread at a given metallicity is substantially smaller than the observed <b>one.</b> <b>Possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> such a difference are briefly discussed. An independent check of the third dredge-up efficiency is provided by the C-stars luminosity function.
