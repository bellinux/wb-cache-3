5|$|Arriving in {{the second}} wave on Jig, the 56th Infantry Brigade was to capture Bayeux and a nearby ridge, thus cutting the N13 highway between Caen and Bayeux to make it {{difficult}} for the Germans to move in reinforcements. The second wave on King, the 151st Infantry Brigade, was tasked with capturing the Caen road and railway, along with setting up positions on high ground between the Aure and Seulles rivers. <b>Other</b> <b>forces</b> involved in the landing included artillery regiments, signals corps, and engineering units.|$|E

He {{commanded}} Army Group South in the Flămânda operation against the Third Bulgarian Army and <b>other</b> <b>forces</b> of the Central Powers, ultimately stopped by the German offensive (Averescu's forces did not register important losses, and orderly retreated to Moldavia, where Romanian authorities had taken refuge from the successful German operations).|$|E
5|$|For {{purposes}} of geophysical and oceanographic research {{and to determine}} habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all extremely important to the Polaris program – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or <b>other</b> <b>forces</b> and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.|$|E

5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All <b>other</b> <b>forces</b> in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
5|$|Beddard (1858–1925) was an English {{zoologist}} {{specializing in}} Annelid worms, but writing much more widely on topics including mammals and zoogeography. He also contributed articles on earthworms, leeches and nematode worms to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. His decision {{to write an}} accessible book on animal coloration falls into this pattern. Beddard wrote Animal Coloration {{at a time when}} scientists' confidence in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was at a low ebb. Beddard's book was part of an ongoing debate among zoologists about how far natural selection affected animals, and how far <b>other</b> <b>forces</b> – such as the direct action of light – might be the causes of observed features such as the colours of animals. Edward Bagnall Poulton's far more strongly pro-Darwinian book The Colours of Animals had appeared just two years earlier in 1890.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Beatty's battlecruisers were in {{position}} to block Hipper's chosen egress route, while <b>other</b> <b>forces</b> were en route to complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the IIScouting Group began {{to pass through the}} British forces searching for Hipper. One of the cruisers in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron spotted Stralsund and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however those were some 50km (31mi) ahead. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.|$|E

5|$|Davout {{anticipated}} {{the problems and}} withdrew his corps from Regensburg, leaving a garrison of only 2,000 for defence. The northbound Austrian columns in the KelheimAbbach zone ran into the four French columns heading west towards Neustadt {{in the early hours}} of the 19th. The Austrian attacks were slow, uncoordinated, and easily repulsed by the experienced French III Corps. Napoleon knew there was fighting in Davout's sector and had already devised a new strategy that he hoped would beat the Austrians: while the Austrians attacked to the north, Masséna's corps, later augmented by Oudinot's forces, would strike southeast towards Freising and Landshut in hopes of rolling up the entire Austrian line and relieving the pressure on Davout. Napoleon was reasonably confident that the joint corps of Davout and Lefebvre could pin the Austrians while his <b>other</b> <b>forces</b> swept the Austrian rear.|$|E
5|$|General von Toll {{initially}} {{planned to}} order his infantry {{to start the}} assault at 16:00, but Paskevich through his aides ordered him to postpone the attack until 16:45. Eventually around 5:00 von Kreutz's corps advanced towards Forts 21 and 22 in two columns. Russian horse artillery reached a position 200 paces from Fort 22 and started shelling the defenders at close range. Already shaken by the fire of the Grand Battery, the Poles abandoned the fort and retreated before the surprised Russian infantry approached. It was a rare example of artillery capturing a fortified position {{without the help of}} <b>other</b> <b>forces.</b> Meanwhile, the fighting for the nearby Fort 22 was heavy. In the end its garrison fell almost to the last man.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May {{the brigade}} became the corps reserve and at noon {{were ordered to}} assist the 179th (2/4th London) Brigade in their attack on El Haud. The {{regiment}} crossed the bridge and started forward, through artillery fire, first walking then increasing their pace to a canter, until they reached cover. But then they were ordered back and {{had to return to}} Umm Es Shert, so they headed back through the shellfire until they reached the village. They remained there overnight until ordered forward to support the 4th Light Horse Brigade defending the road from the Ed Damieh ford to Es Salt, which was the only route back {{for the rest of the}} force attacking Es Salt. For the next day the regiment held a defensive position along the road, and then moved, dismounted, into the mountains to help the Australian Mounted Division extricate themselves. On 3 May, once the Australians had moved past them, the regiment walked back down the track behind them, shelled by Turkish artillery. They then moved into the lines held by the infantry until the <b>other</b> <b>forces</b> had reached safety, before forming the rearguard back to Ghoraniyeh, arriving at 16:00 on 5 May.|$|E

5|$|On 11March 1944, No.84 Squadron was hurriedly redeployed to North-Western Area {{to replace}} the Supermarine Spitfires of No.1 Wing, which had been {{despatched}} to Perth {{in response to a}} feared Japanese naval attack. No attack took place, and No.84 Squadron returned to Horn Island less than two weeks later. On 17May, the squadron departed Horn Island for Townsville, and was subsequently reduced to cadre. No.7 Squadron continued operations in the Dutch East Indies from Higgins, generally in conjunction with <b>other</b> <b>forces</b> such as B-25 Mitchells from North-Western Area, before its tasking was reduced in August pending transfer to No.71 Wing in New Guinea. No.23 Squadron was equipped with A-31 Vengeance dive bombers and undertook army-cooperation duties out of Higgins until being declared non-operational in June. That month, a squadron leader from North-Eastern Area Command arrived at No.75 Wing headquarters to investigate Vengeance accidents and unserviceability; on departure his Vengeance crash-landed on the beach at Princess Charlotte Bay and the crew had to be rescued by an aircraft of No.9 Squadron. No.23 Squadron was subsequently re-equipped with B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and transferred to North-Western Area.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>forces</b> under Kinkaid's command {{included}} the cruisers of Task Force 74 under Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley, Task Force 75 under Russell S. Berkey, and Task Force 76, the VII Amphibious Force, under Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey. The main {{role of the}} Seventh Fleet was supporting MacArthur's drive along the northern coast of New Guinea {{with a series of}} 38 amphibious operations, usually directed by Barbey. Kinkaid accompanied MacArthur for the landing in the Admiralty Islands, where the two men came ashore a few hours after the assault troops. With 215 vessels involved, Operations Reckless and Persecution in April 1944 together constituted the largest operation in New Guinea waters. It was followed in quick succession by four more operations, at Wakde, Biak, Noemfor and Sansapor.|$|E
5|$|When the Allies {{received}} {{the news that}} Xerxes was clearing paths around Mount Olympus, and thus intending to march towards Thermopylae, it was both the period of truce that accompanied the Olympic games, and the Spartan festival of Carneia, during both of which warfare was considered sacrilegious. Nevertheless, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they despatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men (in this case, the elite young soldiers in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had sons). Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Peloponnesian cities allied to Sparta, and <b>other</b> <b>forces</b> that were picked up en route to Thermopylae. The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes's arrival.|$|E

5|$|Xerxes's {{estimated}} time {{of arrival}} at Thermopylae coincided with both the Olympic Games and the festival of Carneia. For the Spartans, warfare during these periods was considered sacrilegious. Despite the uncomfortable timing, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they dispatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men. The customary elite young men in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had children. Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Allied Peloponnesian cities, and <b>other</b> <b>forces</b> that the Allies picked up on the way to Thermopylae.

5|$|A {{number of}} People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units had been {{identified}} in AO Surfers, including the regular North Vietnamese 7th Division—consisting of the North Vietnamese 141st and 165th Regiments {{under the command of}} Nguyen the Bon, the Vietcong 5th Division—consisting of Viet Cong 274th and 275th Regiments, and the Dong Nai Regiment. These divisions were believed to have participated in the assault on Saigon and allied intelligence considered it likely they would attempt to withdraw through the Australian area of operations in order to regroup. <b>Other</b> <b>forces</b> included North Vietnamese 85th Regiment as well as the 165th, 233rd, 269th, 275th, D280 and 745th Viet Cong Infiltration Groups and various units used for reconnaissance, guiding, logistics, liaison and other tasks. In total, an estimated strength of 3,000 to 4,000 men. Regardless, despite earlier warnings that they may concentrate up to regimental-strength, a breakdown in the passage of intelligence led the Australians to believe that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong would remain dispersed in small groups in an attempt to avoid detection. As such the Australians assumed that the communist forces would pose little threat and envisioned patrolling from company harbours to find and ambush them as they withdrew. Meanwhile, due to the risk of heavy ground fire, only a very limited aerial reconnaissance of the new area of operations was undertaken and this later had significant implications.|$|E
5|$|In June–July 1941, the Australians were {{deployed}} to Syria and Lebanon {{for the campaign}} against the Vichy French, which was launched by the British {{in order to prevent}} the French-held colonies from being controlled by the Germans; the majority of the Australian forces were drawn from the 7th Division, although the 17th Brigade was called upon to provide reinforcements, detaching the 2/3rd and 2/5th Battalions. The 2/5th Battalion's initial involvement in the campaign came in mid-June during the French counterattack, when one of its companies went into action around Merdjayuon. After this, the battalion's main involvement came in early July, when it took part in the Battle of Damour, which proved to be the final battle of the campaign. After a preliminary move across the Damour River, during the final assault on Damour, the 2/5th Battalion, in concert with the 2/3rd, advanced from El Boum, moving through the 21st Brigade's position, to cut the road {{to the north of the}} Damour, while <b>other</b> <b>forces</b> advanced from the east. In the days following the capture of Damour, the 2/5th had continued the advance north towards Khalde on the coastal road to Beirut; meanwhile, the Vichy commanders sought an armistice, bringing the campaign to an end on 12 July. The 2/5th's casualties during the brief campaign amounted to 41 men killed or wounded. In the aftermath, the battalion remained in the Middle East, serving as an occupation force in Syria and Lebanon until January 1942. Following Japan's entry into the war, the Australian government requested the return of the battalion as it was needed for the fighting in New Guinea and elsewhere in the Pacific.|$|E
