5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Robert Harrington led {{a search}} to {{determine}} the real cause of the apparent irregularities. He calculated that any PlanetX would be at roughly three times the distance of Neptune from the Sun; its orbit would be highly eccentric, and strongly inclined to the ecliptic—the planet's orbit would be at roughly a 32-degree angle from the orbital plane of the other known planets. This hypothesis was met with a mixed reception. Noted PlanetX sceptic Brian G. Marsden of the Minor Planet Center pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by Le Verrier, and could easily be due to observational error.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in November 1945, Cariappa {{was made}} the {{commander}} of the Bannu Frontier Brigade in Waziristan. It was during this time that Colonel Ayub Khan – later Field Marshal and President of Pakistan (1962–1969) – served under him. Unlike previous British commanders who tried to keep the local tribes under control by force, Cariappa tried a different approach by extending them friendly relations which worked well. When Head of the Interim Government, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited Bannu he found it extremely peaceful and settled, compared to Razmak where another brigade was stationed. Nehru was impressed by Cariappa's way of dealing with the tribes. He was also widely acclaimed for his treatment of the Indian National Army's (INA) prisoners. When Cariappa visited one of the camps that held INA prisoners, he was moved by the conditions in which they lived. He immediately wrote to the Adjutant General recommending that their living conditions be improved and to pardon some of those who were not guilty. These included Colonel Prem Kumar Sahgal, Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan. Cariappa pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> prisoners had considerable support from the Indian leaders, who would later rule the country. This led the British to release most of the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|In 677 or 678, Wilfrid and Ecgfrith quarrelled, and Wilfrid was {{expelled}} from his see. Abbess Hilda of Whitby was a leader in a faction of the Northumbrian church that disliked Wilfrid, and her close ties with Theodore helped to undermine Wilfrid's position in Northumbria. Another contributory factor in Wilfrid's expulsion was his encouragement of Æthelthryth's entry into a nunnery; he had personally given her the veil, the ceremony of entering a nunnery, on her retirement to Ely Abbey. Æthelthryth had donated the lands Wilfrid used to found Hexham Abbey, and the historian N. J. Higham argues {{that they had been}} part of the queen's dower lands, which, when Ecgfrith remarried, his new queen wanted to recover. The historian Eric John feels that Wilfrid's close ties with the Mercian kingdom also contributed to his troubles with Egfrith, although John points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> ties were necessary for Wilfrid's monastic foundations, some of which were in Mercia. Wilfrid not only lost his diocese, he lost control of his monasteries as well.|$|E

Chromosomal inversion, a reversal of a segment, {{is the basis for}} differentiation in Drosophila.

25|$|Others point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> {{allegations}} fail {{to account}} for the issues facing TCRT. Automobiles were more flexible than trains, didn't require the rider to abide by a schedule and afforded some privacy. A population growing more wealthy could afford such luxuries. Highway development enabled settlement over a wider area. Minneapolis' population peak in the late 1940s and St. Paul's a decade later in the late 1950s. Population growth and job growth was spread out in less dense suburbs where capital requirements for building new rail were too high compared to the potential ridership. Building rails to service these areas was cost prohibitive. Buses though could be profitable on such routes. More so other streetcar lines without connection to NCL also converted to buses, frequently having done so long before the TCRT began the process.|$|E

25|$|The German {{historian}} Ingo Haar {{believes that}} civilian {{losses in the}} expulsions have been overstated in Germany for decades for political reasons. Haar argues that during the Cold War the West German government put political pressure on the Statistisches Bundesamt to push the figures upward {{to agree to the}} unreliable Church Service figure of 2.3 million dead and missing. Harr disputes the statements of the German government and maintains that the lower estimates of 500-600,000 deaths already include post war deaths due to malnutrition and disease. He also maintains that the figures for the population of prewar Germany include 27,000 Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Harr points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> issues were raised with the West German government, but the inflated numbers continued to be used when the demographic report was published in 1958 in order to agree with the previous findings of the Schieder commission and the Church Search Service.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Winter War, Paasikivi {{became the}} Finnish {{representative}} {{in the negotiations}} in Moscow. Seeing that Joseph Stalin {{did not intend to}} change his policies, Paasikivi supported compliance with some of the demands. When the war broke out, Paasikivi was asked to enter Risto Ryti’s cabinet as a minister without portfolio—in practice in the role of a distinguished political advisor. He ended up in the cabinet's leading triumvirate together with Risto Ryti and Foreign Minister Väinö Tanner (chairman of the Social Democrats). Paasikivi also led the negotiations for an armistice and peace, and continued his mission in Moscow as Envoy. In Moscow he was necessarily isolated from the most secret thoughts in Helsinki; and when he found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> thoughts ran in the direction of revanche, of retaking, with Germany's aid, territory lost in the Winter War, he resigned. Paasikivi retired for the second time.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the bankers Overend, Gurney and Company in 1866 and the financial crisis the following year brought the LB {{to the brink of}} bankruptcy. A special meeting of shareholders was adjourned, and the powers {{of the board of directors}} were suspended pending receipt of a report into the financial affairs of the company and its prospects. The report made clear that the LB had over-extended itself with large capital projects sustained by profits from passengers, which suddenly declined as a result of the crisis. Several country lines were losing money– most notably between Horsham and Guildford, East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells, and Banstead and Epsom– and the LB was committed to building or acquiring others with equally poor prospects. The report was extremely critical of the policies of Schuster and the company secretary, Frederick Slight, both of whom resigned. It did however point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> lines had been built or acquired as a means for preventing competition from neighbouring railways. The committee recommended the abandonment of several projects, and that the LB should enter into a working agreement with the SER.|$|E

25|$|A fight erupted on {{the floor}} of the Senate over the bridge provision. Both the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia {{approved}} the bridge. But many Senators were unhappy that the federal budget was increasing rapidly. The bill was held up for 10 months, while Senators worked behind the scenes to resolve these differences. The D.C. appropriations bill did not reach the Senate floor for another 10 months. When the bill did reach the chamber floor on February 15, 1905, Senator Stephen B. Elkins (R-West Virginia) demanded that the bridge provision be removed. Senator William B. Allison (R-Iowa) rose to support the expenditure. Their floor fight lasted three full days. Elkins claimed on February 16 that no citizens of the city wanted the bridge, and he demanded a full Senate vote on the bridge amendment. Senator Allison replied on February 17 by bringing in petitions from the Brightwood Citizens Association and the Mt. Pleasant Citizens Association asking for construction of the bridge, and pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> petitions had been delivered to the Senate some months ago. Although Elkins won a vote on the amendment, the Senate overwhelmingly approved its inclusion in the final bill on February 17, ending the three-day floor fight.|$|E
25|$|There was {{legitimate}} concern from {{supporters of}} vaccination about its safety and efficacy, {{but this was}} overshadowed by general condemnation, particularly when legislation started to introduce compulsory vaccination. The reason for this was that vaccination was introduced before laboratory methods were developed to control its production and account for its failures. Vaccine was maintained initially through arm-to-arm transfer and later through production on the skin of animals, and bacteriological sterility was impossible. Further, identification methods for potential pathogens were not available until the late 19th to early 20th century. Diseases later shown {{to be caused by}} contaminated vaccine included erysipelas, tuberculosis, tetanus, and syphilis. This last, though rare—estimated at 750 cases in 100 million vaccinations—attracted particular attention. Much later, Dr. Charles Creighton, a leading medical opponent of vaccination, claimed that the vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis and devoted a book to the subject. As cases of smallpox started to occur in those who had been vaccinated earlier, supporters of vaccination pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> were usually very mild and occurred years after the vaccination. In turn, opponents of vaccination pointed out that this contradicted Jenner's belief that vaccination conferred complete protection. The views of opponents of vaccination that it was both dangerous and ineffective {{led to the development of}} determined anti-vaccination movements in England when legislation was introduced to make vaccination compulsory.|$|E

500|$|Much of folk {{psychology}} {{involves the}} attribution of intentional states (or more specifically as a subclass, propositional attitudes). Eliminativists point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> states are generally ascribed syntactic and semantic properties. An {{example of this}} is the language of thought hypothesis, which attributes a discrete, combinatorial syntax and other linguistic properties to these mental phenomena. Eliminativists argue that such discrete and combinatorial characteristics have no place in the neurosciences, which speak of action potentials, spiking frequencies, and other effects which are continuous and distributed in nature. Hence, the syntactic structures which are assumed by folk psychology can have no place in such a structure as the brain. Against this there have been two responses. On the one hand, there are philosophers who deny that mental states are linguistic in nature and see this as a straw man argument. The other view is represented by those who subscribe to [...] "a language of thought". They assert that the mental states can be multiply realized and that functional characterizations are just higher-level characterizations of what's happening at the physical level.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} quantum {{dynamics}} of the non-relativistic two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator in Heisenberg's picture. Such a system is taken as toy model to analyze some of the various quantum theories that can be built from the application of Dirac's quantization rule to the various symplectic structures recently reported for this classical system. It is pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> quantum theories are inequivalent {{in the sense that}} the mean values for the operators (observables) associated with the same physical classical observable do not agree with each other. The inequivalence does not arise from ambiguities in the ordering of operators but from the fact of having several symplectic structures defined with respect to the same set of coordinates. It is also shown that the uncertainty relations between the fundamental observables depend on the particular quantum theory chosen. It is important to emphasize <b>that</b> <b>these</b> (somehow paradoxical) results emerge from the combination of two paradigms: Dirac's quantization rule and the usual Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.
