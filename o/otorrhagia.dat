40|$|<b>Otorrhagia</b> after facial trauma A man in {{his late}} twenties {{presented}} to the emergency depart-ment following a syncopal episode while in a standing position. Paramedics reported he fell forward onto his face and was unconscious for less than one min. Review of systems revealed recent gastroenteritis, a new onset of headache, jaw pain, trismus and a bite malocclusion. He was alert and oriented without neurological deficits. A 3 cm chin laceration was present and bleeding from the right external auditory canal (EAC) was noted (figure 1). The tympanic membrane was intact and without hemotympanus. A non-contrast CT of the head and facial bones were obtained (figure 2), and revealed a displaced, comminuted fracture through the neck of the right mandibular condyle. The sharpened edge of the ramus penetrated through the anteroinferior wall of the external auditory canal. Post-traumatic <b>otorrhagia</b> is most commonly associated with basilar skull fracture; however, it can also occur with a temporal bone fracture, soft tissue laceration of the external auditory canal and a tympanic membrane rupture. While the vast majority of mandibular fractures involve the condyle, there is a rare associ-ation with <b>otorrhagia,</b> especially when there are subcondylar and unilateral fractures. 1 Patients who present with <b>otorrhagia</b> and chin trauma should undergo a high resolution, reformatted CTof the head and temporomandibular joints and be evaluated by otolaryngology...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{rare case}} of {{bilateral}} mandibular condylar fractures associated with bilateral {{external auditory canal}} fractures and <b>otorrhagia</b> is reported. The more severe external auditory canal fracture was present {{on the side of}} high condylar fracture, and the less severe external auditory canal fracture was ipsilateral to the condylar neck fracture. A mechanism of injury is proposed to account for such findings...|$|E
40|$|Leeches are blood-sucking {{hermaphroditic}} parasites that {{attach to}} vertebrate hosts, bite through the skin, and suck out blood. When leeches feed, they secrete an anticoagulant (hirudin), which helps them {{get a full}} meal of blood. This is the first report of leech removal from external auditory canal. Previous leech involvement cases were explained in nasopharynx, larynx, pharynx, eye, and gastrointestinal tract. Prominent sign of all cases was active bleeding from the leech attachment site; that stopped with leech removal. A 24 -year-old man was presented to Al-Zahra hospital with left <b>otorrhagia</b> and otalgia from 2 days ago. After suction of ear a small soft foreign body {{was seen in the}} external ear near the tympanic membrane, then the ear filled with glycerine phenice, the patient explained decreased movement of foreign body. Four hours later the bloody discharge stopped and otalgia decreased. After suction of clots, a leech was extruded from external auditory canal by alligator. Leech infestation is a rare cause of <b>otorrhagia</b> and should be suspected in the endemic region in all of unusual bleeding; it can be diagnosed and treated by exact inspection and removal...|$|E
30|$|A 50 -year-old {{woman was}} {{diagnosed}} during {{an episode of}} ear fullness and hearing loss. A 10 -year-old boy consulted our department about an episode of recurrent <b>otorrhagia.</b> A 20 -year-old man found a bulge of his external auditory canal by chance. Complete surgical resection was performed for the first patient. The second patient underwent electro-coagulation of the lesion. In the third patient, to exclude {{the possibility of a}} malignant tumor, a biopsy was performed under local anesthesia. Histopathological analysis demonstrated the characteristic of vascular tumors. The lesion showed remarkable reduction during his treatment with antibiotics and cleaning. He remains under careful observation.|$|E
30|$|Vascular lesions in the {{external}} auditory canal might be treated by various manners such as radical resection, laser solidification, electrocoagulation, embolus therapy, sclerotherapy or radiotherapy. In 10 of the 12 reported cases, radical operation was performed for the lesion, whereas the others kept under observation. Zinis reported that {{there was no need for}} treatment unless the lesion showed especially rapid growth (Luca et al. 2007). However, we have shown that conductive hearing loss by vascular tumors localized in {{the external}} auditory canal can be treated. Besides, <b>otorrhagia</b> due to small vascular malformation at an entrance of an external auditory canal was easily coagulated using a bipolar electrical scalpel under local anesthesia.|$|E

40|$|Summary: A 3 -year-old {{child was}} {{examined}} because of <b>otorrhagia.</b> CT scans showed an unusual vessel, confirmed by angiography, {{related to a}} persistent pharyngohyosta-pedial artery. This embryonic persistent artery associated with the normal internal carotid artery would explain the ‘‘duplication’ ’ aspect of the internal carotid artery. Anomalies of the internal carotid artery are rare, usually detected as an incidental finding. The case presented here illustrates the persistence of a pha-ryngohyostapedial artery associated with a normal internal carotid artery. Embryologic considerations are discussed. Case Report A 3 -year-old girl underwent two tympanotomies on the left ear, {{both of which were}} heavily hemorrhagic. Immediately af...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{fractures}} in {{the temporal bone}} are lesions that are observed in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The computed tomography of high-resolution (CT) allows evaluating the fracture and the complications. Objective: Evaluate patients with TBI and temporal bone fracture. Way of study: Retrospective study. Method: Were evaluated 28 patients interned by TBI with clinical evidence and/or radiologic from temporal bone fractures. Results: The age ranged from 3 to 75 years. The most affected side was the right side 50 % (n= 14), left side 36 % (n= 10) and both sides 14 % (n= 4). The etiology of the trauma was the falling 25 % (n= 7), accidents with motorcycles and bicycles 21 % (n= 6), physical aggression 14 % (n= 4), running over 11 % (n= 3), fall of object 4 % (n= 1) and other causes 25 % (n= 7). The clinical signs were: <b>Otorrhagia</b> 78 %, otalgia 11 % (n= 3), otorrhea 7 % (n= 2), facial paralysis 7 % (n= 2) and hearing loss 7 % (n= 2). The otoscopic findings: <b>otorrhagia</b> 57 % (n= 16), laceration of external auditory canal 36 % (n= 10), hemotympanum 11 % (n= 3), normal 7 % (n= 2) and Battle signal 7 % (n= 2). The findings for CT of skull were: with no alterations 54 % (n= 15) and temporal fracture 7 % (n= 2) and the CT of temporal bones were: line of fracture 71 % (n= 20), opacification of the mastoid 25 % (n= 7), glenoid cavity air 14 % (n= 1), dislocation of the ossicular chain 7 % (n= 2) and veiling {{of the middle ear}} 4 % (n= 1). Conclusion: Patients with TBI must be submitted to the otorhinolaryngological evaluation and imaging, for the early diagnosis of the complications and treatment...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report a}} case of left <b>otorrhagia</b> in a 1 -year-old male infant in the {{presence}} of a mass involving the parotideal and upper cervical regions, which had appeared after an infection of the upper airways. Non-invasive techniques, such as echography and CT scan, provided useful but contradicting information. Surgery allowed us to define the diagnosis of mycotic aneurysm of the external carotid artery. The authors, after pointing out the extreme rarity of such a pathology, discuss the ethiopathogenetic theories, the clinical features, the diagnosis and the surgical and medical treatment of the disease. Concerning surgery ligation of the external carotid artery is the treatment of choice, since distally the blood flow is provided by a conspicuous collateral circle and because a possible postoperative septic dissemination is avoided...|$|E
30|$|External {{auditory}} canal tumors are extremely rare. Mangham et al. (1981) reported that only ten vascular tumors (vascular malformation, hemangioma) were observed among 1, 430 cases of temporal bone tumors (0.7 %), {{and they usually}} occurred in the internal {{auditory canal}} or along {{the course of the}} facial nerve. Twelve cases of external auditory canal vascular lesions excluding the tympanic membrane have been reported to date (Luca et al. 2007; Hawke and van Nostrand 1987; Krueger and Porto 1988; Limb et al. 2002; Reeck et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2006; Verret et al. 2007; Covelli et al. 2008; Rutherford and Leonard 2010; Martines et al. 2012; Shu et al. 2013) (Additional file 1 : Table S 1). The patients ranged from 10 to 67  years old, and 11 of them were male. Eight cases were in the left ear and in one case it was not reported which side was affected. The most common chief complaint was hearing loss (8 cases), followed by ear fullness and <b>otorrhagia</b> (5 cases).|$|E
40|$|A 21 -year-old man {{was brought}} to the {{emergency}} department due to multiple trauma (MT) caused by a motor car accident (MCA). On arrival, the patient was intubated by prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) and had a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 6 on 10 (Due to intubation, verbal score was omitted). Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 150 / 70 mmHg, oxygen saturation (O 2 sat) of 60 %, and pulse rate of 110 /min. Examination of the tracheal tube site revealed incorrect esophageal placement. The patient was intubated again and his O 2 sat improved and reached approximately 96 %. His pupils were reactive and of the same size. The Doll’s eye was normal, and plantar reflex was neuter in both sides. Neither expanding hematoma nor emphysema was observed in his neck. Laceration was noted on his left ear, but <b>otorrhagia</b> and tympanic perforation were not found. The lung sounds were normal in both sides. Extended focused abdominal sonography for trauma (e-FAST) examination revealed the absence of free fluid in the abdomen and pericardial space. No deformity of limbs was noted and the distal pulses were palpable. The patient’s O 2 sat decreased during his admission to the emergency department, and further examination indicated obvious decreased sound in his right lung that could not be reversed by needle thoracostomy. On reviewing his previous chest computed tomography, an obvious questionable pathology was detected in his right side Figure 1. What is your diagnosis? </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Basal skull {{fractures}} (BSF) in {{head injury}} may be missed clinically. Early detection ensures prompt treatment {{and prevention of}} complications We compared the clinical and Computed Tomography (CT) features of basal skull fractures in head injured patients in a southwestern Nigerian hospital. Materials and Methods: Head injury patients who had cranial CT at a Southwestern Nigerian hospital were selected. CT images were acquired with a 64 -slice Toshiba Aquillion CT scanner using a standard head protocol. The images were evaluated for evidence of skull fractures, and associated complications. The clinical data and CT findings were analyzed. Results: One hundred and thirty patients were evaluated, including 103 (79. 2 %) males. Their ages ranged between 7 months and 81 years, mean 35 years (SD, 20. 3). In 59 patients (45. 4 %, 59 / 130) BSF was detected on CT, while 71 (54. 6 %) had no evidence BSF. Forty-two (71. 2 %) of the 59 patients detected on CT had clinical suspicion of BSF (P 0. 05). The commonest observed clinical feature in patients with confirmed BSF was <b>otorrhagia</b> (45. 8 %) and the petrous temporal bone (45. 8 %) was the most commonly fractured bone. The BSF was caused most commonly by motor bike accidents in 53 (40. 8 %). The most common associated intracranial injuries were intracerebral haemorrhage (34. 6 %) and subdural (17. 3 %) Conclusion: It appears that neurosurgical evaluation is comparatively reliable in evaluating basal skull fractures in this study area even as they are consistently demonstrated by high resolution CT scanners. A clinical suspicion of BSF should warrant a closer detailed CT evaluation and reporting by radiologists...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{management}} of head-injured patients admitted to emergency departments is not standardized. METHODS The authors performed {{a retrospective analysis}} of 10, 000 head-injured patients admitted to the Emergency Department of our hospital in a 21 -month period and, {{on the basis of}} a statistical correlation between each clinical parameter (symptoms and signs upon arrival at the hospital or risk factors) and the presence of intracranial lesions, they propose a practical protocol in an attempt to avoid the overuse of radiologic examinations and yet identify patients with possible life-threatening complications. RESULTS On the basis of this correlation the patients have been divided into four groups, In the first group (called group alpha) are patients with: no history of loss of consciousness, no vomiting or amnesia, a normal neurologic examination, and minimal if any subgaleal swelling. They can be released into the care of relatives who are given a special instruction sheet (X rays unnecessary). No patient in group alpha had complications of any kind. The second group (group beta) is made up of patients with at least one of the following features: transient loss of consciousness, posttraumatic amnesia, a single episode of vomiting or significant subgaleal swelling. They undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan and if this is normal, only a short period of observation is needed. If CT scan is not available, the skull is X rayed and, if this X ray is negative, the patient is sent home with the warning sheet after an observation period. If a fracture is found, CT scan should be performed promptly. No patient in group beta with normal skull X rays developed intracranial lesions. The third group (group gamma) contains patients with at least one of the following symptoms: impaired consciousness, repeated episodes of vomiting, neurologic deficits, <b>otorrhagia,</b> otorrhea, rhinorrea, signs of basal skull fracture, seizures, penetrating or perforating wounds, lack of cooperation for varying reasons, patients who have undergone previous intracranial operations or been affected by coagulopathy or submitted to anticoagulant therapy, and finally, epileptic or alcoholic patients. They receive a CT scan immediately and, if necessary, again prior to discharge. Six patients in group gamma with GCS = 15 upon admission were operated on for intracranial hematoma. The fourth group (group delta) is composed of comatose patients. Immediately following resuscitation maneuvers and prior to any surgical intervention, they undergo a CT scan. A linear association between the severity groups and the presence of intracranial lesions has been demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS The present protocol stresses the importance of the patient's clinical and anamnestic evaluation upon arrival in the Emergency Department, especially in minor head injuries...|$|E
