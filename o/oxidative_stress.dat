5|$|Given {{the role}} of {{mitochondria}} as the cell's powerhouse, {{there may be some}} leakage of the high-energy electrons in the respiratory chain to form reactive oxygen species. This was thought to result in significant <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress</b> in the mitochondria with high mutation rates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Hypothesized links between aging and <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress</b> are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. A vicious cycle was thought to occur, as <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress</b> leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress.</b>|$|E

In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress</b> in cardiovascular disease.

40|$|Abstract Background Senescence is an {{important}} developmental process {{that leads to the}} cell death through highly regulated genetically controlled processes in plants. Biotic and abiotic <b>Oxidative</b> <b>stresses</b> can also artificially induce senescence and increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) specifically in chloroplast. One of the important <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses</b> is paraquat that induces deviation of electron from photosynthesis electron chain and lead to the production of more ROS in chloroplast. Plants have evolved special adoptive mechanism to reallocate nutrient to reproductive and juvenile organs in senescence and different <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses.</b> Rubisco seems to be the most abundant protein in plants and is involved in many changes during senescence. Results In the present study, the effects of ROS on Rubisco during senescence and <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses</b> were evaluated by measuring photosynthesis factors such as net photosynthesis rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (G), evaporation rate (E), intra cellular CO 2 concentration (Ci), fluorescence and total protein during three stages of development. Our results showed that in paraquat treated plants, CO 2 assimilation is the most effective factor that refers to Rubisco damages. The highest correlation and regression coefficient belonged to Ci, while correlation coefficient between photosynthesis rate and total protein was much smaller. Conclusion It appears in the early stage of <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses</b> such as exposing to paraquat, ROS has the most effect on Rubisco activity that induces more susceptibility to Rubisco specific protease. Moreover, Rubisco deactivation acts as an initiative signal for Rubisco degradation. </p...|$|R

To understand how microbes in intertidal biofilms adapt to the stresses, the microbial metagenomes of biofilms from intertidal and subtidal zones were compared. The genes responsible for resistance to metal ion and <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses</b> were enriched in both 6 -day and 12 -day intertidal biofilms, including genes associated with secondary metabolism, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, signal transduction and extracellular polymeric substance metabolism. In addition, these genes were more enriched in 12 -day than 6 -day intertidal biofilms. We hypothesize that a complex signaling network is used for stress tolerance and propose a model illustrating the relationships between these functions and environmental metal ion concentrations and <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses.</b> These findings show that bacteria use diverse mechanisms to adapt to intertidal zones and indicate that the community structures of intertidal biofilms are modulated by metal ion and <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses...</b>|$|R

5|$|While {{antioxidant}} supplementation {{is widely}} used in attempts to prevent the development of cancer, antioxidants may interfere with cancer treatments, since the environment of cancer cells causes high levels of <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress,</b> making these cells more susceptible to the further <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress</b> induced by treatments. As a result, by reducing the redox stress in cancer cells, antioxidant supplements (and pharmaceuticals) could decrease the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. On the other hand, other reviews have suggested that antioxidants could reduce side effects or increase survival times.|$|E
5|$|A protein called DMT1 is {{the major}} {{transporter}} in manganese absorption from the intestine, and may be the major transporter of manganese across the blood–brain barrier.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that Gastrodia elata Bl (GE), an oriental herb medicine, ameliorates various neurological disorders, that GE modulates the monoaminergic and GABAergic systems, and that GE possess antioxidant activities. We examined whether GE affects methamphetamine (MA) -induced striatal dopaminergic toxicity in mice. Treatment with MA (7. 5 mg/kg, i. p. × 4) resulted in significant decreases in behavioural activity (as shown by locomotor activity and rota rod performance), dopamine level, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity, and TH protein expression (as evaluated by immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis). In addition, MA treatment showed significant increases in lipid peroxidation [as evaluated by 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (4 -HNE) expression and malondialdehyde formation], protein oxidation (as shown by protein carbonyl expression and its formation), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Treatment with GE significantly attenuates MA-induced behavioural and dopaminergic impairments, and <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Our results suggest that GE treatment shows anti-dopaminergic effects in response to MA insult via, at least in part, inhibiting <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses</b> in the striatum of the mice...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{characterized}} by slowly progressive neuronal death, but its molecular cascade remains elusive for over 100 years. Since accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (also called granulo-vacuolar degenerations) {{represents one of the}} pathologic hallmarks of degenerating neurons in AD, a causative connection between autophagy failure and neuronal death should be present. The aim of this perspective review is at considering such underlying mechanism of AD that age-dependent <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses</b> may affect the autophagic-lysosomal system via carbonylation and cleavage of heat- shock protein 70. 1 (Hsp 70. 1). AD brains exhibit gradual but continual ischemic insults that cause perturbed Ca 2 + homeostasis, calpain activation, amyloid b deposition, and <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses.</b> Membrane lipids such as linoleic and arachidonic acids are vulnerable to the cumulative <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses,</b> generating a toxic peroxidation product 'hydroxynonenal' that can carbonylate Hsp 70. 1. Recent data advocate for dual roles of Hsp 70. 1 as a molecular chaperone for damaged proteins and a guardian of lysosomal integrity. Accordingly, impairments of lysosomal autophagy and stabilization may be driven by the calpain-mediated cleavage of carbonylated Hsp 70. 1, and this causes lysosomal permeabilization and/or rupture with the resultant release of the cell degradation enzyme, cathepsins (calpain–cathepsin hypothesis). Here, the author discusses three topics; (1) how age-related decrease in lysosomal and autophagic activities has a causal connection to programmed neuronal necrosis in sporadic AD, (2) how genetic factors such as apolipoprotein E and presenilin 1 can facilitate lysosomal destabilization in the sequential molecular events, and (3) whether a single cascade can simultaneously account for implications of all players previously reported. In conclusion, Alzheimer neuronal death conceivably occurs by the similar 'calpain-hydroxynonenal-Hsp 70. 1 -cathepsin cascade' with ischemic neuronal death. Blockade of calpain and/or extra-lysosomal cathepsins as well as scavenging of hydroxynonenal would become effective AD therapeutic approaches...|$|R

30|$|In addition, {{bioactivity}} of {{nitric oxide}} (NO) partially {{depends on its}} interaction with ROS, particularly superoxide anions [11].

SOD 3 prevents the inactivation of NO by superoxide; therefore, an increase in sod 3 expression in blood vessels preserves endothelial function by overcoming <b>oxidative</b> <b>stresses</b> [13]. Furthermore, several evidences suggest that SOD 3 may have a protective role against inflammation [10, 14].|$|R

5|$|While all the {{reaction}} mechanisms {{of these species}} within the body are not yet fully understood, {{one of the most}} reactive products of <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress</b> is the hydroxyl radical (·OH), which can initiate a damaging chain reaction of lipid peroxidation in the unsaturated lipids within cell membranes. High concentrations of oxygen also increase the formation of other free radicals, such as nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and trioxidane, which harm DNA and other biomolecules. Although the body has many antioxidant systems such as glutathione that guard against <b>oxidative</b> <b>stress,</b> these systems are eventually overwhelmed at very high concentrations of free oxygen, and the rate of cell damage exceeds the capacity of the systems that prevent or repair it.
