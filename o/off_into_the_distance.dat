It {{turns out that the}} set of events that seemed to point towards Duncan having stolen the baby were a scam so that Veronica and Duncan could successfully smuggle Duncan and the baby to Mexico together. Sheriff Lamb learns this fact just as Keith finds diapers in the apartment. A reporter contacts Wallace. Sheriff Lamb goes down to Mexico and asks around for Duncan Kane. Keith confronts Veronica about her actions regarding the baby, angry that she used him and tells her he'll never be able to fully trust her again. The FBI agents search Veronica’s apartment, but Keith has removed the diapers and continues to claim he doesn't know anything. Weevil learns that Felix was dating Molly Fitzpatrick. Sheriff Lamb continues his search before finding his trunk unloaded. Duncan, disguised as a hitchhiker, gets picked up by Vinnie Van Lowe and Astrid (Celeste’s assistant), and they drive <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The final {{story to}} be {{produced}} {{as part of the}} original run was Ghost Light, although it was not the last to be broadcast. That was Survival, the last episode of which was transmitted on 6 December 1989, and brought the series' twenty-six year run to a close. John Nathan-Turner decided close to transmission that a more suitable conclusion should be given to the final episode as it was possibly {{going to be the last}} ever. Accordingly, Andrew Cartmel wrote a short, melancholic closing monologue for Sylvester McCoy, which McCoy recorded on 23 November 1989 – by coincidence, the show's twenty-sixth anniversary. This was dubbed over the closing scene as the Doctor and his companion Ace walked <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance,</b> apparently to further adventures.|$|E

500|$|In Gender Advertisements, {{he writes}} about how gender is {{represented}} in the advertising we all absorb in our everyday lives. [...] He explains relative size, feminine touch, function ranking, the family, the ritualization of subordination, and licensed withdraw. [...] Relative size means that the women represented in advertisements are generally shown shorter or smaller in comparison to men. [...] Feminine touch is when a woman touches a man or an object {{in a way that}} is very loose, and not gripping the object tightly. [...] Function ranking represents a hierarchy in the images, by way that the man is shown in front and largest in front of women and children. [...] The family is typically depicted in a way that gives the father and a son a close relationship, and the mother and a daughter a close relationship. [...] The ritualization of subordination is when women are shown in a lower ranking or worth of an image, and they are smaller, underneath, and overall of lesser importance to men. [...] Finally, licensed withdrawal is when a women is shown as not interested in the camera, or looking <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> with head and body cant. Goffman analyzes all of these topics in a very in-depth and easy to understand format.|$|E

Tosker has managed to rebuild his business {{and is about to}} hold the opening night of his new floating nightclub, based on a boat moored on the River Tyne (filmed on the real club the Tuxedo Princess). Mary, now a Labour Member of Parliament sympathetic to New Labour, is also invited to the opening, and Tosker is surprised to find Geordie back in the city as well; he has escaped from prison. Neither Mary nor Geordie make it to the opening night party, but the four friends are reunited the following day at Nicky's house after his mother's funeral. Tosker leaves to be with his grandchildren, and Mary leaves after agreeing to meet Nicky for lunch the next day. However, a desperate Nicky realises that [...] "tomorrow's too late" [...] and runs after Mary's car. He eventually attracts her attention and breathlessly asks, [...] "Why not today?"

Meanwhile, Geordie walks off, and the series ends with him heading <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> across the Tyne Bridge after looking down at Tosker playing with his grandchildren on the boat below.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Yeah 3x" [...] {{was directed by}} Colin Tilley and filmed at the Universal Studios. It premiered on MTV on October 21, 2010, and features cameo appearances by Teyana Taylor, Kevin McCall, and Future Funk from America's Got Talent. The video opens with Brown walking down a deserted street wearing a navy sweatshirt, dark blue denim, and white sneakers. It then cuts to another scene where Brown makes an acrobatic entrance onto {{the top of a}} truck in a neighborhood of old-timey storefronts and brownstones. Wearing a black vest, trousers and a red skinny tie, Brown then leads a mob of kids, teenagers and older residents down the street. As the first chorus nears, Brown begins his first dance sequence with two male dancers. Together, they pull off high mid-air twirls, each seemingly jumping several feet above the ground. Brown then follows a woman down the street, and runs into four female dancers wearing tank tops and suspenders. Together, they perform arm movements, and work in a few hip thrusts. The next scene, Brown is seen at a storefront labeled [...] "Popin Pete's" [...] and continues more dancing with Pete. During the bridge, Brown can be seen wearing a hot pink/salmon-colored blazer, gold chain and, in one shot, carrying a massive shiny boombox. Brown then rallies the crowd from a fire escape just before someone opens a fire hydrant and unleashes a spray of water onto the crowd. In the final scene, Brown is wearing a peach blazer while baring his chest, and performs the last bit of choreography with male and female dancers. The video ends as Brown spins, stops and looks <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The single's music video, {{directed}} by renowned photographer David LaChapelle, involves Lavigne, who is seen alone, {{trying to find}} someone, whilst her band members play the song alone in the streets. Showing her originally at a party, the video also sees Lavigne pushing a guy {{when he tries to}} get with her. Most of the video is shown in slow motion but Lavigne's mouth movements are in sync with the song's vocals. This was achieved by recording the footage while the song was played twice as fast. The video also sees Lavigne walking on the streets and wearing a black jacket. Through the video, she is seen standing behind a snowy bank. At the end of the video, Lavigne walks out of the club with her coat on, kicks out the door and walks away. Much Music named the video one of the [...] "Top 100 Best Videos of All Time".

60|$|We {{struck at}} last {{into a wide}} white high-road carpeted with {{noiseless}} dust. The night had come; the moon had been shining {{for a long while}} upon the opposite mountain; when on turning a corner my donkey and I issued ourselves into her light. I had emptied out my brandy at Florac, for I could bear the stuff no longer, and replaced it with some generous and scented Volnay; and now I drank to the moon's sacred majesty upon the road. It was but a couple of mouthfuls; yet I became thenceforth unconscious of my limbs, and my blood flowed with luxury. Even Modestine was inspired by this purified nocturnal sunshine, and bestirred her little hoofs as to a livelier measure. The road wound and descended swiftly among masses of chestnuts. Hot dust rose from our feet and flowed away. Our two shadows--mine deformed with the knapsack, hers comically bestridden by the pack--now lay before us clearly outlined on the road, and now, as we turned a corner, went <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ghostly <b>distance,</b> and sailed along the mountain like clouds. From time to time a warm wind rustled down the valley, and set all the chestnuts dangling their bunches of foliage and fruit; the ear was filled with whispering music, and the shadows danced in tune. And next moment the breeze had gone by, and in all the valley nothing moved except our travelling feet. On the opposite slope, the monstrous ribs and gullies of the mountain were faintly designed in the moonshine; and high overhead, in some lone house, there burned one lighted window, one square spark of red in the huge field of sad nocturnal colouring.|$|R
500|$|At several times, {{the film}} hints that Shanghai Lily and Hui Fei {{are more than}} best friends, and are in fact engaged in a lesbian relationship, so when the film ends with Lily {{choosing}} Harvey as her lover, this serves as a testament to his manly Western sex appeal, which [...] "redeems" [...] her from {{her life as a}} prostitute. At the same time that Shanghai Express embraces Yellow Peril stereotypes through the character of Chang, it also to some extent undermines them through the character of Hui, who is shown crying inconsolably after being raped by Chang, which gives her a certain humanity and allows the audience to sympathize with her. Hui is a courtesan who is looked down upon by all Western characters except for her best friend Lily on the account of her race and profession, but she is shown as possessing dignity and a willingness to stand up for herself. Several scenes seemed to suggest that Shanghai Lily and Hui are more attracted to one another then either are to Captain Harvey as the two women exchange longing glances more than once, through this may be suggesting Hui's sexuality is not quite normal (most people in 1932 would considered bi-sexuality to be unnatural). At one point, Hui wears a tight cheongsam dress, which clearly reveal her erect nipples, which definitely captures Lily's interest [...] The same criticism might be applied to Lily, but the film ends with Lily embracing heterosexual love by kissing Harvey while Hui walks <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> alone, sadder as a result of losing her best friend to Harvey and because she was raped, but otherwise unchanged. Finally, it is Hui who saves Harvey in the climax from being blinded/raped/castrated at the hands of Chang by killing Chang; Hui explains the killing as her way of regaining the self-respect that Chang had taken away from her.|$|E

Dismounting within, the mice take some amusing photographs whilst their naughty camel slurps up {{the contents of}} a beer barrel. As Minnie Mouse backs away with her camera from Mickey, who is posing for the shot, a sultan abducts her from behind a fence. Mickey takes to the chase, but his intoxicated camel is of little use; finding out the sultan's palace, the mouse scales the wall and, through a window, enters a room in the building, where he finds a screaming Minnie struggling against the amorous villain. Breaking the sultan's grasp, Mickey becomes the target of the sultan's bullets; hiding Minnie in a flower pot, and prevailing, through chance, over the sultan's well-armed men, Mickey is pursued (while delicately balancing the flower pot in his hands!) by the sultan himself, out the window, up the spiral stairway leading to the palace roof, thence to the next building over, where he drops the pot, only rescuing Minnie from the fall at the building's edge, from which he slips on account of a loose brick. Minnie and Mickey fall <b>into</b> an awning: <b>the</b> angry sultan, still in pursuit, leaps from the same edge, compelling Mickey to retract the awning, making the sultan's fall considerably less pleasant; the spears of the sultan's warriors, similarly avoided, {{make their way to the}} helplessly entombed sultan, who then rushes <b>off,</b> in pain, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance.</b> Mickey calls his camel, and, with Minnie, rides off happily.|$|R
40|$|Posted by shomaila i. It doesn’t {{take much}} effort does it? We all {{have seen a}} crowd of people looking or staring <b>off</b> in unison, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance.</b> They were looking perhaps at a {{speeding}} biker or {{to the top of a}} skyscraper. Who knows? But there’s a good chance you got curious and it took the better of you and made you steal a look there too. It is instant, kind of like a reflex, that too without paying much attention to the persons in the group. How can we so accurately tell where a crowd looks with almost no effort? Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Denver discovered that humans rely widely on a specialized visual process to perceive things. It is known as “ensemble coding ” and it helps us to determine where a crowd is looking. This study shows that humans are capable of telling where or what a group of people is looking at, in just about a fraction of a second of observation. We are able to do so by perceiving the group as a single entity as opposed to a collection of individuals. In this is a photo of a crowd we see the group as an entity and not as individuals standing in a group and we are instantly able to tell where they are looking.

60|$|Now, to {{this fact}} and principle, no {{landscape}} painter {{of the old}} school, as far as I remember, ever paid the slightest attention. Finishing their foregrounds clearly and sharply, and with vigorous impression on the eye, giving even the leaves of their bushes and grass with perfect edge and shape, they proceeded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> with equal attention to what they could see of its details--they gave all that the eye can perceive in a distance, when it is fully and entirely devoted to it, and therefore, though masters of aerial tone, though employing every expedient that art could supply to conceal the intersection of lines, though caricaturing the force and shadow of near objects to throw them close upon the eye, they never succeeded in truly representing space. Turner introduced {{a new era in}} landscape art, by showing that the foreground might be sunk for <b>the</b> <b>distance,</b> and {{that it was possible to}} express immediate proximity to the spectator, without giving anything like completeness to the forms of the near objects. This is not done by slurred or soft lines, observe, (always the sign of vice in art,) but by a decisive imperfection, a firm, but partial assertion of form, which the eye feels indeed to be close home to it, and yet cannot rest upon, or cling to, nor entirely understand, and from which it is driven away of necessity, to those parts of distance on which it is intended to repose. And this principle, originated by Turner, though fully carried out by him only, has yet been acted on with judgment and success by several less powerful artists of the English school. Some six years ago, the brown moorland foregrounds of Copley Fielding were very instructive in this respect. Not a line in them was made out, not a single object clearly distinguishable. Wet broad sweeps of the brush, sparkling, careless, and accidental as nature herself, always truthful as far as they went, implying knowledge, though not expressing it, suggested everything, while they represented nothing. But far <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mountain <b>distance</b> came <b>the</b> sharp edge and the delicate form; the whole intention and execution of the picture being guided and exerted where the great impression of space and size was to be given. The spectator was compelled to go forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> waste of hills--there, where the sun broke wide upon the moor, he must walk and wander--he could not stumble and hesitate over the near rocks, nor stop to botanize on the first inches of his path.[25] And the impression of these pictures was always great and enduring, as it was simple and truthful. I do not know anything in art which has expressed more completely the force and feeling of nature in these particular scenes. And it is a farther illustration[26] of the principle we are insisting upon, that where, as in some of his later works, he has bestowed more labor on the foreground, the picture has lost both in space and sublimity. And among artists in general, who are either not aware of the principle, or fear to act upon it, (for it requires no small courage, as well as skill, to treat a foreground with that indistinctness and mystery which they have been accustomed to consider as characteristic of <b>distance,)</b> <b>the</b> foreground is not only felt, as every landscape painter will confess, to be the most embarrassing and unmanageable part of the picture, but, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, will go near to destroy the effect of the rest of the composition. Thus Callcott's Trent is severely injured by the harsh group of foreground figures; and Stanfield very rarely gets through an Academy picture without destroying much of its space, by too much determination of near form; while Harding constantly sacrifices his <b>distance,</b> and compels <b>the</b> spectator to dwell on the foreground altogether, though indeed, with such foregrounds as he gives us, we are most happy so to do. But it is in Turner only that we see a bold and decisive choice of <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> and middle distance, as his great object of attention; and by him only that the foreground is united and adapted to it, not by any want of drawing, or coarseness, or carelessness of execution, but by the most precise and beautiful indication or suggestion of just so much of even the minutest forms as the eye can see when its focus is not adapted to them. And herein is another reason for the vigor and wholeness of the effect of Turner's works at any distance; while those of almost all other artists are sure to lose space as soon as we lose sight of the details.|$|R

6000|$|It is well, perhaps, that I {{had this}} first enthusiasm to {{encourage}} {{me up the}} long hill above High Wycombe; for the day was a bad day for walking at best, and now began to draw towards afternoon, dull, heavy, and lifeless. A pall of grey cloud covered the sky, and its colour reacted on the colour of the landscape. Near at hand, indeed, the hedgerow trees were still fairly green, shot through with bright autumnal yellows, bright as sunshine. But a little way off, the solid bricks of woodland that lay squarely on slope and hill-top were not green, but russet and grey, and ever less russet and more grey as they drew <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance.</b> As they drew <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance,</b> also, the woods seemed to mass themselves together, and lay thin and straight, like clouds, upon the limit of one's view. Not that this massing was complete, or gave the idea of any extent of forest, for every here and there the trees would break up and go down into a valley in open order, or stand in long Indian file along the horizon, tree after tree relieved, foolishly enough, against the sky. I say foolishly enough, although I have seen the effect employed cleverly in art, and such long line of single trees thrown out against the customary sunset of a Japanese picture with a certain fantastic effect that {{was not to be}} despised; but this was over water and level land, where it did not jar, as here, with the soft contour of hills and valleys. The whole scene had an indefinable look of being painted, the colour was so abstract and correct, and there was something so sketchy and merely impressional about these distant single trees on the horizon that one was forced to think of it all as of a clever French landscape. For it is rather in nature that we see resemblance to art, than in art to nature; and we say a hundred times, [...] "How like a picture!" [...] for once that we say, [...] "How like the truth!"
