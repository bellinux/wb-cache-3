40|$|This {{capstone}} project {{addressed the}} issue of regulation of the verification procedures for diplomas and other documents issued by the Private Providers <b>of</b> <b>Higher</b> Education (PPHEs) [1] in Kosovo. This verification procedure has created a problematic situation. Firstly, in the legal aspect, it violates the applicable 2011 Law on Higher Education[2] which states the principles that “all institutions <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> education are equal before the Law”. “All students and personnel of the institutions <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> education should have equal opportunities without any discrimination”. Secondly, since the Kosovo Accreditation Agency (KAA) evaluates and accredits both public and private institutions <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> education, it guarantees and ensures that all institutions <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> education in Kosovo and their programs meet the quality standards internationally recognized. Thus there should not be a verification procedure only for students from PPHEs. In this project qualitative and quantitative research methods have been used. It started with archival materials being collected from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST), KAA, PPHEs, and the University of Prishtina. Four forms of questionnaires were designed and used for: a) students and graduates, b) officials of the PPHEs, and c) experts <b>of</b> <b>Higher</b> Education and MEST officials and d) experts <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> education in the SEE countries. Interviews with experts <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> education were also conducted. [1] Private Providers <b>of</b> <b>Higher</b> Education refer to the private colleges or private higher schools, i. e. institutions <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> eduction.
