30|$|In this paper, the {{artifice}} of {{the primary}} user in the spectrum lease is investigated. The basis of this problem {{is based on the}} transmission desire <b>of</b> the <b>secondary</b> user. The system performance {{of the primary}} network is evaluated by using the outage probability and the symbol error rate, while that <b>of</b> the <b>secondary</b> network is analyzed in terms of the outage secrecy probability and the asymptotic average secrecy capacity. The simulation results show that the primary network outperforms the direct transmission protocol when the spectrum share coefficient <b>of</b> the <b>secondary</b> user increases and that the secrecy performance <b>of</b> the <b>secondary</b> network is better in the high SNR region. These results are important for selecting the best power sharing fraction so that the performance of the primary network is improved and the secrecy performance <b>of</b> the <b>secondary</b> network is maintained in the cooperative communication. In addition, the location <b>of</b> the <b>secondary</b> nodes is discussed to evaluate the effects on both networks.|$|R

40|$|AbstractOur {{research}} {{purpose is}} to realize a consciousness system on computers. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} relation between a primary system that directly interacts and learns the input-output relation within an environment, and a secondary system that continuously monitors and is able to direct the primary system. We hold that consciousness is not composed of a primary system alone, but that the employment <b>of</b> a <b>secondary</b> system is essential. The {{purpose of this paper is}} therefore to clarify the importance <b>of</b> a <b>secondary</b> system. We show by numerical experiments that the addition <b>of</b> a <b>secondary</b> system provides adaptability to a wider range of environmental changes than a primary system alone. Alternatively, we present an extraordinary case where a customized primary system fully adapts to an environment undergoing a particular type of change. Far from refuting the value <b>of</b> a <b>secondary</b> system, this special case serves to point out the importance of the effective design <b>of</b> a <b>secondary</b> system. Therefore, we confirm the value and usefulness <b>of</b> a <b>secondary</b> system in a machine consciousness system through these numericalexperiments...|$|R
