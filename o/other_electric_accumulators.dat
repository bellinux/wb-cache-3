50|$|An {{electric}} supercharger, {{if supplied}} by common stock <b>electric</b> <b>accumulators,</b> runs {{independent of the}} engine to which it provides its boost. However, electrical energy consumed is often higher than what a production-line generator (e.g. alternator) of the engine can supply. Larger alternators are therefore fitted to recharge accumulators during the engine run.|$|R
40|$|The {{point of}} this work is to compare and to {{describe}} basic types and principles of electric storage systems. With the increasing imbalance between consumption and generation of electric energy {{there is a need}} for integration of <b>electric</b> <b>accumulators</b> to the <b>electric</b> grid. Technologies for electric energy storage can be divided into several types, which differ in form and conversion of energy. These technologies are suitable for specific industrial applications...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of Terylene and cotton overalls {{has been made}} in the lead-acid <b>electric</b> <b>accumulator</b> industry. Six hand pasters wore personal lead-in-air samplers for two weeks. Three of the men wore cotton overalls the first week and Terylene overalls the second; the other three men wore Terylene overalls the first week and cotton overalls the second. The mean lead-in-air concentration in the breathing zone when the men wore Terylene overalls was slightly greater than when they wore cotton overalls but the difference was not statistically significant. Significant differences of lead-in-air concentrations were found between men and between the two weeks but not between days within the weeks. The lead-in-air concentration did not increase during the week. Neither a change to Terylene overalls nor more frequent laundering of overalls should be recommended for pasters in this factory {{on the basis of this}} study...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMicro-CHP (Combined Heat and Power) {{energy systems}} are {{potentially}} suitable for residential and tertiary utilities, typically characterized by low-grade heat demand and limited electric-to-thermal energy demand ratio values. Different innovative and under development CHP technologies are currently investigated in small scale units, but a standard {{has not been}} identified till now. Moreover, depending on the load request, the produced electricity can be used, stored in <b>electric</b> <b>accumulator</b> or in the external net, or integrated with other external sources. Contextually, the available heat can be used, accumulated inside the system or dissipated. The actual convenience of small size CHP systems depends on the demand profiles and the operation management logic. A test facility is being developed, at the University of Bologna, for the experimental characterization of the cogenerative performance of small scale hybrid power systems, composed of micro-CHP systems of different technologies (such as Organic Rankine Cycles and Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells), a battery and a heat recovery subsystem. The test set-up is also integrated with an external load simulator, in order to generate variable load profiles. This report describes the main characteristics of the implemented test bench, the selection procedure of the adopted micro-CHP unit and expected performance...|$|R
