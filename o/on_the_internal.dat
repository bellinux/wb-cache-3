5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the walls, in the niches and on arches.

In 2005, Zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of several white-bodied toxic Amanita species, {{most of which are}} found in Asia.

5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E

5|$|In {{evolutionary}} terms, {{the split}} between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the Permo-Triassic boundary; the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups {{are found in the}} early Jurassic. Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> genitalia, especially those of the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings.|$|E

5|$|The genus Amphidromus {{is unusual}} in that it {{includes}} species that have dextral shell-coiling and species that have sinistral shell-coiling.

This is an extremely rare phenomenon, and very interesting to biologists. Studies focused on the soft anatomy of Amphidromus are scattered and fragmentary. Information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> anatomy is known only from a few species, and no larger, comparative morphological study has ever been carried out.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Today, many {{applications}} for formal circuit verification exist {{that rely on}} solvers for Boolean satisfiability (SAT). Usually, these applications use the SAT solver as a black-box. However, exploiting information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internals</b> of <b>the</b> solving process can speed-up {{the treatment of the}} verification task. In this paper, we present the tool VisSAT. VisSAT provides insights into <b>the</b> <b>internals</b> of SAT solvers. Statistics of <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> solving process are collected and visualized <b>on</b> <b>the</b> circuit. By this, a verification engineer gets insight about potential bottlenecks for formal verification. This can be used to reconfigure the SAT solver or to improve the encoding...|$|R

5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} in {{the literature}} about whether Suillus cothurnatus represents a different species from S.salmonicolor. The online mycological taxonomy database MycoBank lists them as synonyms, contrary to Index Fungorum. In their 2000 monograph of North American boletes, Alan Bessette and colleagues list the two taxa separately, noting that the range of S.cothurnatus {{is difficult to determine}} because of confusion with S.salmonicolor. In a molecular analyses of Suillus phylogeny, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> transcribed spacer, S.salmonicolor (as S.subluteus) and S.intermedius clustered together very closely, indicating a high degree of genetic similarity. These analyses were based on comparing the sequence differences in a single region of ribosomal DNA; more recent molecular analyses typically combine the analysis of several genes to increase the validity of inferences drawn.|$|E

5|$|The {{early part}} of the story {{provides}} an anthropological view of the culture of the Tombs, and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The reader is shown that the true names of people have no particular significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which Tenar recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away. Scholars have described Le Guin's depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of the Tombs, which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of the {{early part of}} the novel describes the life that Tenar leads in the stable world of the Tombs. Ged's arrival acts as a turning point, and the rest of the book explores the possibility of change, and introduces different perspectives <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> world of the novel.|$|E

5|$|The state {{suffered}} from financial difficulties {{during its first}} three decades. Jonathan Jennings attempted to begin a period of internal improvements. Among his projects, the Indiana Canal Company was reestablished to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio. The Panic of 1819 caused the state's only two banks to fold. This hurt Indiana's credit, halted the projects, and hampered the start of new projects until the 1830s, after the repair of the state's finances during the terms of William Hendricks and Noah Noble. Beginning in 1831, large scale plans for statewide improvements were set into motion. Overspending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> improvements led to a large deficit {{that had to be}} funded by state bonds through the newly created Bank of Indiana and sale of over nine million acres (36,000km²) of public land. By 1841 the debt had become unmanageable. Having borrowed over $13million, the equivalent to the state's first fifteen years of tax revenue, the government could not even pay interest on the debt. The state narrowly avoided bankruptcy by negotiating the liquidation of the public works, transferring them to the state's creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in the state's debt. The internal improvements began under Jennings paid off as the state began to experience rapid population growth that slowly remedied the state's funding problems. The improvements led to a fourfold increase in land value, and an even larger increase in farm produce.|$|E
