5|$|Schubart's poem {{takes the}} {{viewpoint}} of a male speaker, advising women {{to be careful of}} young men. By removing the stanza, Schubert removes the moral and creates uncertainty in the sex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} postmodern novels, Fowles uses {{multiple}} different stylistic and structural techniques to highlight his thematic interests in The French Lieutenant's Woman. When discussing these stylistic concerns, many literary critics {{comment on the}} importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> and the narration, the intertextual references to other literary works, and the multiple endings.|$|E

5|$|Divided {{into five}} stanzas of ten lines each, the ode {{contains}} a narrator's discourse {{on a series}} of designs on a Grecian urn. The poem focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover eternally pursues a beloved without fulfilment, and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines of the poem declare that beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know", and literary critics have debated whether they increase or diminish the overall beauty of the poem. Critics have focused on other aspects of the poem, including the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator,</b> the inspirational qualities of real-world objects, and the paradoxical relationship between the poem's world and reality.|$|E
5|$|One other point, already mentioned, {{was how to}} {{deal with}} the problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, you were in the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E
