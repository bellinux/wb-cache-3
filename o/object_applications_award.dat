Load balancing enables a better use of the system resource capabilities and a better performance by allocating nodes that {{are more suitable for}} the execution of some tasks. This work proposes a multi-agent load balancing architecture for distributed <b>object</b> <b>applications</b> denominated MALBA which uses artificial neural networks and a set of policies to support the process of migrating and replicating the <b>application</b> <b>objects.</b> MALBA architecture outlines a decentralized balancing process which balances the load among nodes which execute a distributed <b>object</b> <b>application...</b>|$|R

40|$|Large {{numbers of}} mobile objects and {{continuous}} queries about them characterize mobile <b>object</b> <b>applications.</b> Efficient and parallel evaluation of queries about mobile objects that continuously move {{is important for}} achieving acceptable response times. In such applications, the traditional approaches suffer from the need for parallel updates processing and real time querying and visualization. This results in poor performance in such critical systems. The emerging multicore and manycore microprocessing technologies {{have the potential to}} offer scalable performance improvement. How to explore the multicore resources to speed up mobile <b>objects</b> <b>applications</b> is thus a natural question but also a huge challenge for Moving <b>Objects</b> <b>Applications</b> (MOA). In this paper, we propose and evaluate a methodology to explore parallelism via multi-threading, transactional loosely coupled methodology design, and to implement it on multicore processors for Moving <b>Objects</b> <b>Applications.</b> We apply the proposed methodology of the loosely coupled strategy, which has been identified as the key strategy in many design optimizations for different data dependency types, to time-constrained location applications. A parallel framework and its implementation on multicore processors for the proposed strategy have been developed based on multi-threaded concepts. Experiments of using loosely coupled multithreaded parallelization to produce mobile objects parallel query processing and visualization showed clear improvement in terms of speed and efficiency...|$|R
