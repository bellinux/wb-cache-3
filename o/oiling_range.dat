40|$|Abstract The oils of some {{unconventional}} oilseeds (hemp, radish, terebinth, stinging nettle, laurel) {{were obtained}} by a cold-press method in which the total oil content, fatty acids, tocopherol isomers, some metal contents (Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu), antioxidant activity and oxidative stability were determined. The total oil content was determined ranging between 30. 68 and 43. 12 %, and the oil samples had large amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, with oleic acid and linoleic acid. Of all the oils, terebinth seed oil had the highest a-tocopherol content (102. 21 ± 1. 01 mg/kg oil). Laurel oilseed had the highest antiradical activity in both the DPPH and ABTS assays.

40|$|ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: In this study, we {{evaluated}} the chemical composition {{of a commercial}} sample of essential oil from Eucalyptus smithii R. T.

METHODS: Morphological changes in these fungi after treatment with the oil were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The antifungal activity of the oil was determined {{on the basis of}} minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values. RESULTS: The compound 1, 8 -cineole was found to be the predominant component (72. 2 %) of the essential oil.
