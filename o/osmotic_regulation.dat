5|$|Table salt {{is made up}} of {{just under}} 40% sodium by weight, so a 6g serving (1teaspoon) {{contains}} about 2,300mg of sodium. Sodium serves a vital purpose in the human body: via its role as an electrolyte, it helps nerves and muscles to function correctly, and it is one factor involved in the <b>osmotic</b> <b>regulation</b> of water content in body organs (fluid balance). Most of the sodium in the Western diet comes from salt. The habitual salt intake in many Western countries is about 10 g per day, and it is higher than that in many countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. The high level of sodium in many processed foods has a major impact on the total amount consumed. In the United States, 75% of the sodium eaten comes from processed and restaurant foods, 11% from cooking and table use and the rest from what is found naturally in foodstuffs.|$|E

40|$|Asteromonas gracilis, a green wall-less halotolerant alga, {{grows on}} salt {{concentrations}} from 0. 5 molar NaCl (seawater) to saturation (4. 5 molar NaCl). The specific growth rate was maximal at concentrations between 0. 5 and 2. 5 molar and only gradually decreased above 2. 5 molar. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution was maximal over {{a range of}} salinities around 2. 5 molar and the photosynthesis to respiration ratio showed a maximum at 1. 5 molar NaCl. The alga accumulates large amounts of intracellular glycerol in response to saline conditions. The glycerol content of the cells varied {{in direct proportion to}} the extracellular salt concentration, being about 50 and 400 picograms glycerol per cell in algae grown at 0. 5 and 4. 5 molar NaCl, respectively. In salt concentrations lower than 3. 5 molar and at growth temperatures below 40 C, essentially all the glycerol was intracellular. Above 3. 5 molar NaCl, about 25 per cent of the total glycerol leaked slowly from the cells to the medium. Treating the algae for several minutes at temperatures exceeding 47 C caused 50 per cent release of the internal glycerol. At 60 C, 100 per cent of the glycerol was released. When the extracellular salt concentration was increased or decreased, the intracellular glycerol varied accordingly, reaching its new intracellular level after a few hours. Both photosynthesis and respiration were inhibited on transfer of the cells from 1. 5 to 3. 5 molar NaCl but were not inhibited on transfer of the cells from 3. 5 to 1. 5 molar NaCl.

40|$|Episodes {{of water}} deficit (WD) during the crop cycle of tomato may {{negatively}} impact plant growth and fruit yield, {{but they may}} also improve fruit quality. Moreover, a moderate WD may induce a plant "memory effect" which is known to stimulate plant acclimation and defenses for upcoming stress episodes. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the positive and negative impacts of repeated episodes of WD at the plant and fruit levels. Three episodes of WD (- 38, - 45, and - 55 % of water supply) followed by three periods of recovery ("WD treatments"), were applied to the eight parents of the Multi-Parent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross population which offers the largest allelic variability observed in tomato. Predawn and midday water potentials, chlorophyll a fluorescence, growth and fruit quality traits [contents in sugars, acids, carotenoids, and ascorbic acid (AsA) ] were measured throughout the experiment. Important genotypic variations were observed both at the plant and fruit levels and variations in fruit and leaf traits were found not to be correlated. Overall, the WD treatments were at the origin of important <b>osmotic</b> <b>regulations,</b> reduction of leaf growth, acclimation of photosynthetic functioning, notably through an increase in the chlorophyll content and in the quantum yield of the electron transport flux until PSI acceptors poREi JABS,) The effects on fruit sugar, acid, carotenoid and AsA contents on a dry matter basis ranged from negative to positive to nil depending on genotypes and stress intensity. Three small fruit size accessions were richer in AsA on a fresh matter basis, due to concentration effects. So, fruit quality was improved under WD mainly through concentration effects. On the whole, two accessions, LA 1420 and Criollo appeared as interesting genetic resources, cumulating adaptive traits both at the leaf and fruit levels.

40|$|Chronic {{alcohol abuse}} results in morphological, metabolic, and {{functional}} brain damage which may, to some extent, be reversible with early effects upon abstinence. Although morphometric, spectroscopic, and neuropsychological indicators of cerebral regeneration {{have been described}} previously, the overall amount and spatial preference of early brain recovery attained by abstinence and its associations with other indicators of regeneration are not well established. We investigated global and local brain volume changes in a longitudinal two-timepoint study with T 1 -weighted MRI at admission and after short-term (6 - 7 weeks) sobriety follow-up in 15 uncomplicated, recently detoxified alcoholics. Volumetric brain gain was related to metabolic and neuropsychological recovery. On admission and after short-term abstinence, structural image evaluation using normalization of atrophy (SIENA), its voxelwise statistical extension to multiple subjects, proton MR spectroscopy (1 H-MRS), and neuropsychological tests were applied. Upon short-term sobriety, 1 H-MRS levels of cerebellar choline and frontomesial N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were significantly augmented. Automatically detected global brain volume gain amounted to nearly two per cent on average and was spatially significant around the superior vermis, perimesencephalic, periventricular and frontal brain edges. It correlated positively with the percentages of cerebellar and frontomesial choline increase, as detected by 1 H-MRS. Moreover, frontomesial NAA gains were associated with improved performance on the d 2 -test of attention. In 10 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects, no significant brain volume or metabolite changes were observed. Although cerebral <b>osmotic</b> <b>regulations</b> may occur initially upon sobriety, significant increases of cerebellar choline and frontomesial NAA levels detected at stable brain water integrals and creatine concentrations, serum electrolytes and {{red blood cell indices}} in our patient sample suggest that early brain recovery through abstinence does not simply reflect rehydration. Instead, even the adult human brain and particularly its white matter seems to possess genuine capabilities for regrowth. Our findings emphasize metabolic as well as regionally distinct morphological capacities for partial brain recovery from toxic insults of chronic alcoholism and substantiate early measurable benefits of therapeutic sobriety.

40|$|The {{effects of}} turgor pressure-induced {{membrane}} tension on junctional coupling of Hensen cell isolates {{from the inner}} ear were evaluated by input capacitance or transjunctional conductance measurement techniques. Turgor pressure was altered by changing either pipette pressure or the osmolarities of extracellular solutions. Both positive pipette pressure and extracellular applications of hypotonic solutions, which caused cell size to concomitantly increase, uncoupled the cells as indicated by reduced input capacitance and transjunctional conductance. These changes were, in many cases, reversible and repeatable. Intracellular application of 50 μM H- 7, a broad-based protein kinase inhibitor, and 10 mM BAPTA did not block the uncoupling effect of positive turgor pressure on inner ear gap junctions. The transjunctional conductance at a holding potential of − 80 mV was 53. 6 ± 5. 8 nS (mean ± SEM, n = 9) and decreased ∼ 40 % at a turgor pressure of 1. 41 ± 0. 05 kPa.
