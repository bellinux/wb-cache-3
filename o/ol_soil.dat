40|$|Phosphorus (P) is an {{important}} element for crop production. A low concentration limits crop growth whereas the residual quantity after fertilization contributes to eutrophication of surface waters. A key to success in the soil P management is its accurate estimation and potential supply to the plant. The objective of this project was to compare the soil P extractability between the Pi- filter strip method and P depletion without a sink (0. 01 M CaCl 2). The results were compared to those obtained using ammonium lactate (AL), Olsen (<b>OL)</b> <b>soil</b> P tests. The {{results showed that the}} efficiency of different methods decreased in the order Pi (62 - 85 %) > OL (25 - 40 %) > 0. 01 M CaCl 2 (8 - 24 %) of the total P extracted by AL. A strong correlation (r = 0. 99) was obtained between the pairs (Pi; AL), (Pi; OL), and (OL; AL). Further, it was found that all methods were equally well correlated (the r was between 0. 88 and 0. 90) with the depletion method. The soil with the highest P adsorption capacity had higher values of P extracted by the AL, Pi and OL methods but was lower in 0. 01 M CaCl 2 extractable P. The results indicated that in the soils studied, the efficiency of the Pi-filter strip method in comparison to the routine P tests (AL and OL) was not attributed to the soil properties. It was rather attributed to the length of soil P desorption time and the number of filter strips...|$|E

40|$|The {{observation}} {{could be}} used to reduce the model uncertainties with data assimilation. If the observation cannot cover the whole model area due to spatial availability or instrument ability, how to do data assimilation at locations not covered by observation? Two commonly used strategies were firstly described: One is covariance localization (CL); the other is observation localization (OL). Compared with CL, OL is easy to parallelize and more efficient for large-scale analysis. This paper evaluated <b>OL</b> in <b>soil</b> moisture profile characterizations, in which the geostatistical semivariogram was used to fit the spatial correlated characteristics of synthetic L-Band microwave brightness temperature measurement. The fitted semivariogram model and the local ensemble transform Kalman filter algorithm are combined together to weight and assimilate the observations within a local region surrounding the grid cell of land surface model to be analyzed. Six scenarios were compared: 1 _Obs with one nearest observation assimilated, 5 _Obs with no more than five nearest local observations assimilated, and 9 _Obs with no more than nine nearest local observations assimilated. The scenarios with no more than 16, 25, and 36 local observations were also compared. From the results we can conclude that more local observations involved in assimilation will improve estimations with an upper bound of 9 observations in this case. This study demonstrates the potentials of geostatistical correlation representation in OL to improve data assimilation of catchment scale soil moisture using synthetic L-band microwave brightness temperature, which cannot cover the study area fully in space due to vegetation effects...|$|R
40|$|Wheat was a {{profitable}} crop in Iowa until about 1870, and averaged from 20 to 30 bushels per acre. Since then, {{on account of}} deterioration <b>ol</b> <b>soils,</b> changes of climate, rust, blight and chinch bugs, the acreage and average yield have grown less steadily. Last year the average yield of wheat in the state was nine bushels per acre, and in 1881 it ran as low as six bushels. At the present time we are depending on Minnesota and Dakota for {{a large share of}} our bread, but the constant falling off in the yield and quality of the wheat in the states just named indicates, that we will have to go farther for it before long or grow it ourselves. One of our tasks at the Iowa Experiment Station will be, to produce hardier and more productive kinds of wheat than those which we have now, and determine the best methods of preparing the ground for them. Last year we sowed twelve kinds of wheat broad-cast, at the rate of 75 ft 3 ̆es per acre on undrained ground which received only ordinary preparation; but all of them proved worthless on account of rust and blight. Last summer, we broke up an old pasture to the depth of four inches after tile draining it. Last March, 2. 30 acres of this plat were thoroughly pulverized with a disc and reversible harrow and sowed broad-cast at the rate of 7 oft»s per acre with the following kinds of wheat, viz: Black Sea, Fife, White Fife, Manitoba Fife, Golden Globe and Lost Nation. The ground was then thoroughly harrowed and rolled. Immediately afterwards, I applied top-dressings of Peruvian guano, land plaster and common salt to strips running across the different kinds of wheat, leaving other strips between them not fertilized. All of the varieties grew well and promised a good crop-until most of their blossoms had fallen, when— about one-fifth of the plat, including all of the varieties, was blown down by a rain storm. A few days alter the storm, the entire piece of wheat showed much rust and more or less blight. I was unable to discover that any of the different kinds of wheat had been affected by the guano or the land plaster; but I did see clearly, that the best wheat and the cleanest straw was on the strip to which I had applied salt. As I did not consider any of the varieties sufficiently rust-proof to warrant me in sowing them again, I threshed them together in tbe field on July 30 th and the yield of the mixture per acre, proved to be 19 bushels o f more or less shriveled wheat. On {{the south end of the}} Station grounds is a plat of i TV acres, three-fifths of which is old ground and the remainder was a low, wet slough, which was thoroughly drained and broken in June, 1888. Last fall this plat was plowed to the depth of eight inches, and last March it was well pulverized with a disc and reversible harrow, when it was sowed, (broad-cast) with one bushel of Velvet Chaff Blue Stem wheat and then harrowed and rolled thoroughly. It came up well, stooled well and made a large growth; but on the lowest ground about one-fifth of the wheat was blown down when it was in blossom and remained down. A few days afterwards, I noticed that the blades of the blue-stem wheat were slightly rusted, but at no time did any appear on its stalks. On July 30 th, the wheat on this plat was threshed in the field and yielded 48...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} study of a loess-paleosol sequence in Oberlaab, Upper Austria, is presented with emphasis on macro- and micromorphological features, grain size distribution, rock magnetism properties, and weathering degree that allows correlation with other loess-paleosol sequences in neighboring areas, and interpretation of main pedogenic trends. The studied sequence comprises four paleosol complexes, which likely developed during four interglacial stages MIS 11, 9, 7 and 5 e, and a modern soil. The oldest paleosol complex (OL 5) represents three phases of soil formation, and distinct sedimentary events never reported in the area, with strong reductomorphic properties. The OL 4 profile also results from three phases of pedogenesis with increased reductomorphic features in the deepest zone (affected by cryoturbation events). OL 3 has abundant features related to gleyic/stagnic processes, but shows signs of clay illuviation. <b>OL</b> 2 (Eemian <b>soil)</b> correlates with the MIS 5 e. This paleosol shows higher degrees of clay illuviation and weathering, and fewer features related to reductomorphic processes. The modern soil is also polygenetic and constitutes a pedocomplex. Its lowermost part is formed by Würmian glacial deposits, where no well-developed soils are found; only reworked materials and pedosediments. Main pedogenic trends in the sequence are clearly differentiated. All of the paleosols were formed in humid environments, but differing in drainage conditions. The base, with OL 5 and OL 4 paleosols, was more affected by gleyic processes, while in the upper paleosols, especially OL 2, clay illuviation is dominant. We interpret such differences {{to be caused by}} the topographic position. The basal paleosols were more affected by fluvioglacial processes due to their position on top of the terrace. The upper paleosols received increased amounts of sediment through fluvial, colluvial and aeolian (loess) input...|$|R
