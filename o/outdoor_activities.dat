Formal accident analysis is an accepted means of understanding such events and improving safety. Despite this, there remains no universally accepted framework for collecting and analysing accident data in the led <b>outdoor</b> <b>activity</b> domain. This article presents an application of Rasmussen’s risk management framework {{to the analysis of}} the Lyme Bay sea canoeing incident. This involved the development of an Accimap, the outputs of which were used to evaluate seven predictions made by the framework. The Accimap output was also compared to an analysis using an existing model from the led <b>outdoor</b> <b>activity</b> domain. In conclusion, the Accimap output was found to be more comprehensive and supported all seven of the risk management framework’s predictions, suggesting that it shows promise as a theoretically underpinned approach for analysing, and learning from, accidents in the led <b>outdoor</b> <b>activity</b> domain. Statement of Relevance: Accidents represent a significant problem within the led <b>outdoor</b> <b>activity</b> domain.

This was a classrooms action research study involving grade VIIA students of SMP Negeri 1 Kaligondang Purbalingga regency. This study focused on improving the social skill. The data of improvement of social skills were collected through observation, interviews, documentation, which is then analyzed for comparison: (1) the result of observations {{before and after the}} actions, and (2) the result of observation of social skills of each cycle supported by responses from different  parties. Before the actions, the researchers conducted observations of social skills and the mean score was 2. 79 (in the moderate category). Through the application of the outdoor activitiy in cycle I obtained mean score of 3. 12 (in the moderate category). Through the application of the <b>outdoor</b> <b>activity</b> in cycle II obtained mean score of 3. 69 (in the good category). Through the application of <b>outdoor</b> <b>activity</b> in cycle III, the student’ social skill improved, with a mean score of 4. 16 (in the good category). Based on the result of the observations of students' social skills on precycle, cycle I, cycle II, and  cycle III, it can be concluded that the application of the learning method of <b>outdoor</b> <b>activity</b> in Social Studies can improve social skills in students. Thus the method of learning with <b>outdoor</b> <b>activity</b> feasible in learning social studies as one of the learning activities, in particular {{to improve the}} students’ social skills.
