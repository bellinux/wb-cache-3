5000|$|Congressionally {{appropriated}} in 1961, the 61-inch Kaj Strand Telescope (or 1.55-m Kaj Strand Astrometric Reflector, KSAR) remains largest telescope {{operated by}} the U.S. Navy since it saw first light in 1964. This status will change when the NPOI four 1.8-meter telescopes see their own first light in the near future. KSAR rides {{in the arms of}} an equatorial fork mount. The telescope is used in both the visible spectrum, and in the near infrared (NIR), the latter using a sub-30-kelvin, helium-refrigerated, InSb (Indium antimonide) camera, [...] "Astrocam". In 1978, the 1.55-m telescope was used to [...] "discover the moon of dwarf planet Pluto, named 'Charon'". (Pluto itself was discovered in 1930, across town at Lowell Observatory). The Charon discovery led to mass calculations which ultimately revealed how tiny Pluto was, and eventually caused the IAU to reclassify Pluto as a dwarf (not a principle) planet. The 1.55-meter telescope was also used to observe and track NASA's Deep Impact Spacecraft, as it navigated to a successful inter-planetary impact with the celebrated Comet 9p/Tempel, in 2005. This telescope is particularly well-suited to perform stellar parallax studies, narrow-field astrometry supporting space navigation, and has also {{played a key role in}} discovering one of the coolest-ever known brown dwarf objects, in 2002. The 61" [...] dome is centrally located on NOFS grounds, with support and office buildings attached to the dome structures. The large vacuum coating chamber facility is also located in this complex. The chamber can provide very accurate coatings and <b>overcoatings</b> of 100 (+/-2) Angstrom thickness (approximately 56 aluminium atoms thick), for small-to-multi-ton optics up to 72-inches (1.82 meters) in diameter, in a vacuum exceeding , using a vertical-optic, 1500-ampere discharge system. A dielectric coating capability has also been demonstrated. Large optics and telescope components can be moved about NOFS using its suite of cranes, lifts, cargo elevators and specialized carts. The main complex also contains a controlled-environment, optical and electronics lab for laser, adaptive optics, optics development, collimation, mechanical, and micro-electronic control systems needed for NOFS and NPOI.|$|E

40|$|Through an Air Force Research Laboratory {{sponsored}} STM program, reliable, low-cost, low-weight, non-hermetic coatings for multi-chip-module(MCK applications were developed. Using {{the combination}} of Sandia Laboratory ATC- 01 test chips, AvanTeco's moisture sensor chips(MSC's), and silicon slices, we have shown that organic and organic/inorganic <b>overcoatings</b> are reliable and practical non-hermetic moisture and oxidation barriers. The use of the MSC and unpassivated ATC- 01 test chips provided rapid test results and comparison of moisture barrier quality of the <b>overcoatings.</b> The organic coatings studied were Parylene and Cyclotene. The inorganic coatings were Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2. The choice of coating(s) {{is dependent on the}} environment that the device(s) will be exposed to. We have defined four(4) classes of environments: Class I(moderate temperature/moderate humidity). Class H(high temperature/moderate humidity). Class III(moderate temperature/high humidity). Class IV(high temperature/high humidity). By subjecting the components to adhesion, FTIR, temperature-humidity(TH), pressure cooker(PCT), and electrical tests, we have determined {{that it is possible to}} reduce failures 50 - 70 % for organic/inorganic coated components compared to organic coated components.

Some effects are very damaging to surface optical properties while some are more subtle and even beneficial. Most combustible materials are heavily etched, and some coatings, such as silver and osmium, are seriously degraded or removed as volatile oxides.

The use of a novel electrolyte, a deep eutectic solvent, made from choline chloride: chromium (III) chloride enabled highly conformal <b>overcoatings</b> of chromium on individual bare carbon nanotubes to be obtained. Very high aspect ratio metal microstructures could be obtained by this novel technology.

An example shows the discharge of trapped electrons when dielectric strength is exceeded. This leaves {{a portion of the}} Teflon volume no longer clear, but diffusely transmitting and reflecting. Thermophysical changes included degradation of solar absorptance coefficients as much as five-fold. The situation that prevails for earth orbit contrasted with polymer performance in the solar wind.

This program addresses the definition of requirements for IFE optics protective coatings, the conceptual design of the required deposition equipment according to accepted contamination control principles, and the deposition and evaluation of diamondlike carbon (DLC) test coatings. DLC coatings deposited by Plasma Immersion Ion Processing were adherent and abrasion-resistant, but their UV optical losses must be further reduced to allow their use as protective coatings for IFE final optics.

40|$|The {{effects of}} exposing 23 {{specimens}} of optical and thermal control materials to space at 120 km altitude for over 40 hrs during the STS- 8 mission are discussed. Ten samples of paint targeted for the Space Telescope (ST) and the Tethered Satellite were exposed, and included polyurethane, oxide, silicone, and glossy {{black and white}} samples which were scanned for alterations in the optical properties after being retrieved. Nine mirror-type materials were also investigated, along with silver specimens typical of solar cell interconnects. The oxygen flow at the orbital altitude was 3. 5 x 10 to the 20 th atoms/cu cm. The exposures caused no degradation of the magnesium fluoride mirror coatings, while the Kapton coating for the ST solar cell panels showed evidence of losing thickness.

40|$|Neutrons {{generated}} by the deuterium-tritium reaction (D- 2 + T- 3 [...] 3 ̆e n + alpha) are correlated to the alpha particle by energy and momentum conservation to lie along trajectories 180 degrees with respect to one another. An associated particle neutron generator uses this spatial correlation to infer the neutron trajectory by detecting the alpha particle. This technique {{can be used to}} suppress backgrounds and in building three-dimensional images using the return excitation gamma-ray energy due to the neutron interactions. The critical-performance component of the system is the alpha detection element, which is embedded within the neutron generator accelerator head. This element must be highly efficient, capable of nanosecond timing, and robust under the temperature changes encountered during manufacture. ZnO(Ga) scintillator coatings of differing thicknesses, with and without Ni <b>overcoatings,</b> were evaluated for this purpose, when excited by alpha particles between 3. 2 and 5. 4 MeV.

40|$|A flight {{experiment}} using a hand-held, image-intensified spectrographic {{camera was}} performed on mission 41 -D. The instrument enabled the photographic documentation {{of the position of}} the spectral slit on the image to be subjected to spectrographic analysis. Because of this instrument feature, the spectrum of the glow on the Shuttle tail pod could be clearly separated from spectrum of the scattered light from the Orbiter. From the measurements {{it is clear that the}} spectrum of the glow is a continuum in the passband of the instrument between 4200 A and 8000 A. The measured spectral resolution of the instrument was 35 A. The scattered light from the Orbiter surfaces distinctly show the components of the earth's airglow at 5577 A and 7620 A. On the same flight material samples were also carried by the Orbiter attached to the Remote Manipulating System arm. These samples were representative of the material <b>overcoatings</b> used on the space telescope. The altitude of the 41 -D flight was 290 km, instead of the 220 km which was originally planned for this experiment. The signal to noise ratio in the material glow discrimination experiment was quite low. This made it difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding the glow propensity of the materials. Nevertheless it was clear that polyethylene produces a very weak glow, while most black overcoating materials produce significant glow. MgF 2 was also found to produce a relatively intense glow...|$|E
40|$|Work {{function}} tunability {{of metal}} electrodes provides a route to improving performance of organic electronic devices. Using an electrode {{with a different}} work function changes the potential barrier at the polymer/electrode interface, leading to altered device characteristics, such as turn-on voltage in light emitting diodes or series resistance photodiodes. In this work, we explore work function modification by employing solution-based conducting materials, poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), printed as <b>overcoatings</b> on oxidized Ni. The capability of direct write technologies, namely inkjet and aerosol jet printing, to control thin film thickness is investigated. The correlation between film thickness and work function is evaluated from profilometer measurements and ambient Kelvin probe measurements of the work function of the modified electrode. We find that aerosol jet printing is an attractive tool for modifying printed film thickness of PEDOT:PSS and CNTs. The achieved variation in thickness of printed films allows for work function modification exhibiting values that vary from the bare oxidized Ni value to the bulk PEDOT:PSS or CNT value as {{the thickness of the}} printed film is increased. Further, we fabricate infrared Schottky photodetectors, with poly(3 -hexylthiophene) :C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (P 3 HT:PCBM) composite as the active organic layer, to demonstrate the change in device performance with the implementation of the PEDOT:PSS- and CNT-modified electrodes.

These experiments were carried out on the OMEGA facility. Fifty-nine beams were focused onto the target, providing nominally 18 kJ of energy in a 1 ns pulse for an irradiance of {approximately} 2 {times} 10 {sup 14 }/cm{sup 2 }. Some beam smoothing, provided by spectral dispersion, was used, but {{may not have been}} particularly effective alone, i. e., without the presence of distributed phase plates in the beams. The plastic microballoon targets were nominally 900 {mu}m in diameter with 10 - and 20 -{mu}m thick walls, and were filled with neon to a pressure of 10 atm. <b>Overcoatings</b> of Mg and Al in thicknesses ranging from 0. 2 to 4 {mu}m were applied. A 1 -{mu}m thick layer of CH was added in some early shots to reduce the rate of expansion of the metallic coatings. In the extreme ultraviolet (euv) spectral region, we observed n= 3 to n= 2 emissions from Li-, He- and H-like ions from the Mg and Al coatings. We also obtained evidence confirming our previously-published laser-field-induced satellites lines at 53. 1 {Angstrom} and 62. 8 {Angstrom}, apparently {{at the peak of the}} Gaussian drive pulse. Both the Mg-line and the continuum euv emissions are high during the radial collapse. The metallic coating materials appear to be in place to some degree during the compression phase, i. e., are not all blown away as coronal plasma at earlier times as modeled. This also is apparent in the Al Lyman-{alpha} x-ray measurements before and after compression. Here, however, higher line opacity made it difficult to track the resonance lines through the compression phase. This illustrates the importance of euv measurements of less opaque lines at high densities...|$|E
