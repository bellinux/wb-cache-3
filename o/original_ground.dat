5|$|Various {{methods were}} used to build mottes. Where a natural hill could be used, scarping could produce a motte without the need to create an {{artificial}} mound, but more commonly much of the motte {{would have to be}} constructed by hand. Four methods existed for building a mound and a tower: the mound could either be built first, and a tower placed on top of it; the tower could alternatively be built on the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> surface and then buried within the mound; the tower could potentially be built on the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> surface and then partially buried within the mound, the buried part forming a cellar beneath; or the tower could be built first, and the mound added later.|$|E
5|$|Barça's local rival {{has always}} been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, {{being one of the}} clubs granted royal patronage, was founded {{exclusively}} by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid. Their <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> was in the affluent district of Sarrià.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{play their}} home {{games at the}} 49,000-{{capacity}} all-seater Stadium of Light having moved from Roker Park in 1997. The <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> capacity was 42,000 which was increased to 49,000 following expansion in 2000. Sunderland have a long-standing rivalry with their neighbouring club Newcastle United, with whom they have contested the Tyne–Wear derby since 1898. Since their most recent promotion to the Premier League in 2007, Sunderland have {{become one of the}} world's wealthiest football brands, being valued at USD $93 million in 2014, 31st in the world overall.|$|E

5|$|The club spent £1,400 {{appointing}} {{designers to}} oversee the excavation and levelling of the land, and moved a one-year-old stand from Carlisle Road to the highest {{part of the new}} ground. The <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> comprised the relocated stand, a 2,000-capacity stepped enclosure with the players' changing rooms beneath the stand, the playing area, a cinder athletics track and fencing to limit the total capacity to 18,000. The playing field was made of ballast, ashes, soil and sods. The ground was officially opened on 27 September 1886 for a game against Wakefield Trinity which was watched by a capacity crowd, but construction work meant most of Manningham's early games were away fixtures.|$|E
5|$|Around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, using as the prototype for the three-arched bridge spanning the Avon an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge and the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, which it resembles, {{it is one of}} the very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath. The Georgian streets in the vicinity of the river tended to be built high above the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> level to avoid flooding, with the carriageways supported on vaults extending in front of the houses. This can be seen in the multi-storey cellars around Laura Place South of Pulteney Bridge, in the colonnades below Grand Parade, and in the grated coal holes in the pavement of North Parade. In some parts of the city, such as George Street, and London Road near Cleveland Bridge, the developers of the opposite side of the road did not match this pattern, leaving raised pavements with the ends of the vaults exposed to a lower street below.|$|E

25|$|Many of the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> leases {{were written}} {{to last for}} nine hundred and ninety-nine years, but some ran for only ninety-nine; around 2001 many of these shorter leases began to expire, whereupon the Foundation sold the {{freehold}} of the land to the house-owners.|$|E
25|$|During {{reclamation}} work, {{the ground}} level {{was raised by}} approximately , with mud and silt from dredging work.

25|$|In 1782 {{the club}} moved from its <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> at Broadhalfpenny Down to Windmill Down, {{about half a}} mile away towards the village of Hambledon.

However, after a couple of seasons playing on the steep sloping and highly exposed new ground the club agitated for a move to a more suitable location and Ridge Meadow was purchased as a permanent replacement. Ridge Meadow is still the home of Hambledon C.C. today.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{has been}} found that {{challenges}} the accepted date of the Dyke's construction. In December 1999, Shropshire County Council archaeologists uncovered the remains of a hearth or fire on the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> surface beneath Wat's Dyke near Oswestry, England. Carbon dating analysis of the burnt charcoal and burnt clay in situ showed it was covered by earth on or around AD 446. Archaeologists concluded that this part of Wat's Dyke, so long thought of as Anglo-Saxon and a mid-8th-century contemporary of Offa's Dyke, must have been built 300 years earlier in the post-Roman period.|$|E
25|$|The {{centre of}} the mound {{contained}} an oak-built main chamber (Grave I), built on the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> level. It measured 5.7 by 3.5 m and was circa 1 m high. This grave, containing {{a man and a}} woman, had already been plundered shortly after the burial. The remaining finds, reflecting its original riches include horse trappings, nearly 600 glass beads from a necklace, pieces of amber, and fine gold threads that were originally part of a brocade-like fabric. The floor had been covered with cowskins. A central mound, 5m high and 40 m in diameter covered this chamber.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{possible}} archaeological {{indicator of}} a changed relationship between horses and humans is the appearance about 4800-4400 BCE of horse bones and carved images of horses in Chalcolithic graves {{of the early}} Khvalynsk culture and the Samara culture in the middle Volga region of Russia. At the Khvalynsk cemetery {{near the town of}} Khvalynsk, 158 graves of this period were excavated. Of these, 26 graves contained parts of sacrificed domestic animals, and additional sacrifices occurred in ritual deposits on the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> surface above the graves. Ten graves contained parts of lower horse legs; two of these also contained the bones of domesticated cattle and sheep. At least 52 domesticated sheep or goats, 23 domesticated cattle, and 11 horses were sacrificed at Khvalynsk. The inclusion of horses with cattle and sheep and the exclusion of obviously wild animals together suggest that horses were categorized symbolically with domesticated animals.|$|E

25|$|William of Tyre, {{chronicler of}} the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, {{reports on the}} {{renovation}} of the Church in the mid-12th century. The crusaders investigated the eastern ruins on the site, occasionally excavating through the rubble, and while attempting to reach the cistern, they discovered part of the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> level of Hadrian's temple enclosure; they decided to transform this space into a chapel dedicated to Helena (the Chapel of Saint Helena), widening their original excavation tunnel into a proper staircase. The crusaders began to refurnish the church in a Romanesque style and added a bell tower. These renovations unified the small chapels on the site and were completed {{during the reign of}} Queen Melisende in 1149, placing all the Holy places under one roof for the first time. The church became the seat of the first Latin Patriarchs, and was also the site of the kingdom's scriptorium. The church was lost to Saladin, {{along with the rest of}} the city, in 1187, although the treaty established after the Third Crusade allowed for Christian pilgrims to visit the site. Emperor Frederick II (r. 1220–50) regained the city and the church by treaty in the 13th century while he himself was under a ban of excommunication, with the curious consequence that the holiest church in Christianity was laid under interdict. The church seems to have been largely in Greek Orthodox Patriarch Athanasius II of Jerusalem's hands, ca. 1231–47, during the Latin control of Jerusalem. Both city and church were captured by the Khwarezmians in 1244.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} work, an earth mound, or motte, [...] high, was {{piled up}} {{around the base of}} the tower. The <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> floor of the castle was now an {{underground}} cellar, probably used as a puteus, or pit, for detaining low status prisoners and reached by ladder from the first floor. Some infilling of the ground floor occurred in order to equalise the pressure on the walls from the mound. It is uncertain how many other towers or keeps have similar mounds, as excavation is usually required before the foundations can be examined, but Totnes and Farnham castles are known to have mottes build against the walls of the keep. The reason for building the mound is uncertain, but it was almost certainly not designed as a serious defensive feature. It was instead probably intended as to superficially imitate older motte and bailey designs, with the completed castle echoing these former symbols of power and reinforcing the current political status of its owner.|$|E
