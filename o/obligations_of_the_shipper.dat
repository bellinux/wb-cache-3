Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{requirements for}} <b>the</b> award <b>of</b> Doctor of Philosophy <b>of</b> Loughborough University. <b>The</b> specification <b>of</b> models in which <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> decisionmaking {{is apparent in}} the model structure has been a prime concern in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> freight demand modelling. This study is primarily concerned with <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> disaggregate models of logit form for explaining and predicting freight mode choice in Leicestershire. The models explain modal choice at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual <b>shipper.</b> They are behavioural in that the explanatory variables used result from a hypothesis reflecting <b>the</b> behaviour. : <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipper.</b> They are probabilistic in that they give {{the probability that a}} shipper will choose a given transport mode for dispatching a given consignment. From this point of view this research makes contributions to 1) <b>the</b> specification <b>of</b> factors which are most influential in <b>the</b> <b>shipper's</b> mode choice decision, 2) <b>the</b> specification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipper's</b> senitivity to changes in <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> these factors [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if a statistically significant difference exists between shipper and receiver measurements, a statistical combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipper's</b> and receiver's limit-of-error (LOE) is calculated to determine the shipper/receiver limit-of-error, LOES/R. <b>The</b> <b>shipper's</b> and receiver's LOE may possess random and systematic components. Depending on <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systematic and random components, <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LOES/R can be performed by several different calculational methods. These calculational methods and their associated underlying assumptions are reviewed in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LANL <b>shipper</b> receiver program.

30|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{literature}} on slow-steaming either takes <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> shipowners addressing technical, operational or cost-minimisation issues—assuming that <b>the</b> effect on <b>shippers</b> is fully captured by an increased {{cost of capital}} {{tied up in the}} transported products—or that of society with implications of lower emissions by slow-steaming. In reality, however, the effects on supply chains using container liner shipping is far more complex; consequently, this study takes <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shippers.</b> <b>The</b> purpose is to briefly elaborate on <b>the</b> logistics consequences <b>of</b> slow-steaming, categorise principle mitigation strategies, and investigate and categorise <b>the</b> strategies Swedish <b>shippers</b> purchasing deep sea container transport services use to cope with <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> slow-steaming.|$|R

30|$|The {{remaining}} four pre-defined {{practices are}} {{described in more detail}} from <b>the</b> <b>shipper</b> side than from the LSP side. Regarding mode choice and intermodal transportation, the LSPs express in a very general way that intermodal transports are part of their offering in environmental terms, while many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shippers</b> describe more concretely their ambition regarding specific modes. For the practice logistics system design, the LSPs describe <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> their transport network, while <b>the</b> <b>shippers</b> describe efforts needed to make their logistics system more environmentally friendly. Transport management is described quite sparsely from the LSPs compared to <b>the</b> <b>shippers,</b> who comprise a wide variety of efforts to increase <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transports. The pattern that emerges is the opposite from the one described for the first six practices: <b>the</b> <b>shippers</b> appear as more specific as they describe features relating to their system, which in turn creates the demands. The LSPs, on the other hand, need to address <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> many <b>shippers</b> in providing solutions for a variety of logistics systems.|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. The state-of-practice in commercial vehicle modelling often neglects the sophisticated behaviour found between stakeholders in a supply chain and the impact thereof on the ultimate vehicle flow. The state-of-the-art in commercial vehicle modelling needs to capture this behaviour to accurately predict <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> changes in <b>the</b> supply chain. In this paper, we discuss how changes in <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receiver influence <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipper</b> and carrier, while focussing on a supply chain in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry. Retailers in the FMCG industry typically order in large quantities with high stock turnover rates. Utilising an order policy, they place orders with suppliers, either replenishing stock to a predetermined level every certain number of days or once a certain re-order point is reached. <b>The</b> supplier (<b>the</b> <b>shipper</b> and carrier) utilises route optimisation and scheduling of deliveries to cater for <b>the</b> demand <b>of</b> its customers. We show how <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> these stakeholders can be captured in an agent-based modelling environment and how <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipper</b> and carrier is sensitive for changes in <b>the</b> order policies <b>of</b> its customers.
