Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use <b>of</b> <b>paperboard</b> boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{relative}} humidity (RH) {{on the energy}} absorption characteristics <b>of</b> honeycomb <b>paperboard</b> and multi-layered corrugated paperboard (MLCP) is investigated experimentally. The concept of specific load is employed to compare the energy absorption properties of these two structural parts with different constructions and materials. Results indicate that energy absorption capacity <b>of</b> honeycomb <b>paperboard</b> is insensitive to RH {{in the range of}} 40 %~ 75 %; when RH is higher than 75 %, energy absorption decreased significantly with the increasing of RH. While for MLCP, its energy absorption properties decline continually by small margin as the RH increase in relative humidity range between 40 %- 95 %. Energy absorption properties <b>of</b> honeycomb <b>paperboard</b> far outweigh that of MLCP in humidity range of 40 %- 85 %, however, in extremely humid environment (95 %RH), energy absorption <b>of</b> honeycomb <b>paperboard</b> is nearly equal to that of MLCP. Results of this research can be applied in the optimum design and material selection of paper-based cushioning materials in actual logistics environments...|$|R

The constitutive relations <b>of</b> honeycomb <b>paperboard</b> have been changed after the fatigue damage.

Energy absorption diagram based {{on the effect of}} FD is constructed from the stress-strain curves obtained after fatigue compression experiments. FD is a significant consideration for honeycomb paperboard after transports. The results of this paper could be used for optimization design of packaging materials...|$|R
