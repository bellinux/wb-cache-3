5|$|For his {{performance}} in the 1924 Rose Bowl, Navy quarterback Ira McKee was awarded Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors. McKee completed 16 of 20 passes {{for a total of}} 175 yards, including one pass for a touchdown. McKee also had 85rushing yards on twelve attempts. Washington running back Elmer Tesreau was given the game's Ironman Award, though he had little effect on the game. Against the urging of his coaches, Tesreau had played with boils completely covering <b>one</b> <b>knee.</b> He left {{near the end of the}} game, and was later discovered to have broken his previously unaffected leg in multiple places.|$|E
5|$|Thompson was a {{stand-up}} goaltender, rarely falling on both knees {{to stop a}} puck. He {{was one of the}} first NHL goaltenders to catch the puck with his hand to make a save, and helped popularize the technique. Using gloves that were smaller than those of other players, he was among the best puck-catchers of his era. He stood in the way of the puck with minimal padding, risking being struck when moving to catch it instead of simply deflecting it away from the net. His signature technique, very often featured in photographs of him, involved dropping to <b>one</b> <b>knee</b> with the paddle of his goalstick covering the five-hole, and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught the puck with his glove, he did so without gloves resembling the modern blocker and trapper glove combination. Thompson was described by Johnny Bower, a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as a good puckhandler, and one of the best of his time at forward passing. In the 1935–36 season, Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.|$|E

25|$|The triarii (sing. triarius) {{were the}} veteran soldiers, {{to be used}} in battle only in extreme situations; they rested <b>one</b> <b>knee</b> down when not engaged in combat. The triarii served {{primarily}} as reserves or barrier troops designed to backstop the hastati and principes, and were equipped with long hastae (spears) rather than the pilum and gladius (the hastati and principes stopped using spears in 387 BC). Thus armed, they fought in a phalanx formation. The sight of an advancing armored formation of triarii legionaries frequently discouraged exultant enemies in pursuit of retreating hastati and principes troops. Ad triarios redisse – To fall back upon the triarii was a Roman idiom – meaning to use one's last resort.|$|E
25|$|Younis is {{regarded}} as one of the best players of spin bowling in the world, being particularly strong on the leg side. His favourite and trademark shot is the flick, but it has also been his shortcoming, with him being particularly prone to falling lbw during the early stages of his innings. He is also prone to getting down on <b>one</b> <b>knee</b> and driving extravagantly. But this flamboyance is coupled with grit. One of his main weaknesses is playing away from the body, he also has a tendency to leave straight balls, a trait that has been exploited by bowlers in the past, particularly by the Australian attack. Along with Mohammad Yousuf and the now retired Inzamam-ul-Haq, he formed a formidable middle order batting line up for Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|A sweep is a cross-batted {{front foot}} shot played {{to a low}} {{bouncing}} ball, usually from a slow bowler, by kneeling on <b>one</b> <b>knee,</b> bringing the head down {{in line with the}} ball and swinging the bat around in a horizontal arc near the pitch as the ball arrives, sweeping it around to the leg side, typically towards square leg or fine leg. A paddle sweep shot is a sweep shot in which the ball is deflected towards fine leg with a stationary or near-stationary bat extended horizontally towards the bowler, whereas the hard sweep shot is played towards square leg with the bat swung firmly in a horizontal arc. Typically the sweep shot will be played to a legside delivery, but it is also possible for a batsman to sweep the ball to the legside from outside off stump. Attempting to sweep a full straight delivery on the stumps is generally not recommended because of the risk of lbw.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{important}} to note that traditionally, the Eastern Orthodox service has no kneeling in the Western sense of standing on <b>one's</b> <b>knees.</b> While kneeling for prayer was customary in the primitive church, the Byzantine tradition did not maintain it, and the people stood traditionally. In the 20th century in some western countries, some Eastern Orthodox churches have begun to use pews and kneelers and so have begun kneeling {{in some parts of the}} service.|$|R
50|$|The phobia {{could be}} the result of a {{negative}} experience in a person’s life that was associated with knees. The discomfort at the sight of <b>one's</b> <b>knees</b> {{could be the}} result of the person’s parents or themselves wearing exclusively clothing that covered the knees growing up, therefore making the person unfamiliar with the sight of them. It could {{be the result of}} a traumatic injury that left a scar on the individual’s knee or on someone that they know.|$|R
25|$|This shot, though risky in the execution, has the {{advantage}} of being aimed at a section of the field where a fielder is rarely placed – particularly in Twenty20 and One Day International cricket where the number of outfielders is limited. However the Marillier shot is played over the batsman's shoulder to fine leg, but the basis of the scoop stroke is for the batsman to go down on <b>one</b> <b>knee</b> to a good length or slightly short-of-length delivery off a fast or medium paced bowler and scoop the ball over the head of the wicket-keeper. The scoop shot is a risky shot to play as the improper execution of this shot may lead to a catch being offered. One famous example of the scoop backfiring is of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Final when Pakistan were 152/9 and needed 6 runs off 4 balls and Misbah-ul-Haq improperly executed this shot resulting in a catch to Sreesanth.|$|E

500|$|Indeed, {{far from}} being a radical or {{threatening}} manifestation of womanhood, recent academics have noted {{the extent to which the}} character of She conforms to traditional conceptions of Victorian femininity; in particular her deferring devotion to Kallikrates/Leo, whom she swears wifely obedience to at the story's climax: [...] "'Behold!' and she took his [...] hand and placed it upon her shapely head, and then bent herself slowly down till <b>one</b> <b>knee</b> for an instant touched the ground – 'Behold! in token of submission do I bow me to my lord!

Cruise asks Kidman how he can prove he is not gay, and she recommends that they make the film Eyes Wide Shut. Stanley Kubrick is portrayed as a sleazy film director, and the program shows a newspaper headline giving a critical review of Eyes Wide Shut. The show portrays Cruise's relationship with Penélope Cruz, who is seen wearing a mantilla. Travolta introduces Cruise to his third wife Katie Holmes (Laura Patch) who is depicted as a robotic Stepford Wife. [...] "Greetings, Earth Man, I am here to serve you," [...] says Holmes to Cruise upon their first meeting. After Cruise asks Holmes to marry him, she states, [...] "Affirmative". The show makes fun of Cruise's couch jumping incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show. (This spoof is in reference to a 2005 appearance by Cruise on the Oprah program, where he [...] "jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell to <b>one</b> <b>knee</b> and repeatedly professed his love for his new girlfriend.") At the wedding of Cruise and Holmes, an alien bride and groom are displayed {{on the top of}} the couple's wedding cake, and the show spoofs the couple's wedding vows.
