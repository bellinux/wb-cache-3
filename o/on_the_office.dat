5|$|Abrams {{had been}} rumored as {{director}} since December 2006, and NBC confirmed this the following month. He and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon were both hired to direct an episode during February sweeps week. Abrams had known cast member Kate Flannery years before, {{when he used}} to write in a restaurant where Flannery worked as a waitress. The two were reunited <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Office</b> set, where he stated that he was pleased with her success.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Ben Silverman {{was named}} {{co-chairman}} of NBC's entertainment division in 2007, he asked Greg Daniels {{to create a}} new comedy series. Silverman and Daniels previously worked together <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Office,</b> a half-hour comedy Daniels adapted from the British comedy of the same name by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Daniels wrote the pilot for what eventually became Parks and Recreation along with series co-creator Michael Schur, who had served as a writer <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Office.</b> Daniels and Schur had been considering ideas for a possible show with cast members Rashida Jones and Aziz Ansari, but the concept for the series did not form until they learned Amy Poehler could play the lead character. Once that casting was determined, the script for the pilot episode was first written in the summer of 2008 revolving around her as a city bureaucrat seeking to turn an enormous construction pit into a park. They also decided the script would include the mockumentary comedy style of The Office and, like that show, would allow for improvisation on set. However, they did not consider the script an Office spin-off and NBC officials vehemently insisted to media outlets that the show was a completely separate series, despite the similarities between the two shows.|$|E
5|$|Morgan was {{sometimes}} {{sought to investigate}} public problems on behalf of federal or state governments. She examined the food quality at San Quentin Prison in 1939, and in the 1940s she was the founding chair of the California Nutrition War Committee and served <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> of Scientific Research and Development. In 1960, Morgan {{was a member of}} a committee that looked at the toxicity of pesticides used in agriculture. She co-authored a textbook, Experimental Food Study, with Irene Sanborn Hall, and she wrote detailed histories of the Alpha Nu and Iota Sigma Pi honor societies.|$|E

5|$|Cameron {{was one of}} six {{candidates}} {{elected as}} aldermen to Edmonton's first town council in 1892; he received the fifth most votes of the fourteen candidates. He was defeated in his 1893 re-election bid, in which he finished seventh of nine candidates. He briefly returned to the council after being elected again in 1895, but did not seek re-election the following year and remained out of politics thereafter. During his first term on the council, {{he was involved in}} an altercation in which the dominion government had made a decision to Dominion Land Office from Edmonton to Strathcona, at the time a separate town, south of the North Saskatchewan River. When news of the decision and crews to execute it arrived in Edmonton, angry citizens descended <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> and tore to pieces the wagon that the officer was packing with records for transportation. Led by mayor Matthew McCauley, Cameron was {{part of a group of}} prominent citizens that headed the resistance, eventually leading to the dominion reversing its decision.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Gladstone {{brought forward}} {{legislation}} {{to establish a}} Catholic university in Dublin. This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a reshuffle. As part of that change, Gladstone took <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of Chancellor, leading to questions {{as to whether he}} had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministry—until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, {{contractors}} halted construction {{because of}} fears {{that they will}} not be paid. This caused Morningstar to reconsider their lease commitment. As a result, the value of the project declined, which made the resale of the project rights difficult. Mills was close to a deal with German investment firm, Deutsche Immobilien Fonds A.G. prior to the difficulties. DIFA had outbid Chicago developer Golub & Co., which then became the frontrunner. Golub, an international real estate investment company headquartered in Chicago, has closed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> space portion of the project. Mills eventually sold the retail space rights to Chicago developer Joseph Freed & Associates, who had previously purchased the nearby Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building (located at 1 South State Street) that closed in early 2007.|$|E

5|$|Later that day, Lane storms into a partners' meeting, {{shouting}} at Pete about how Edwin's wife has {{found out about}} Edwin's adultery and is devastated; Edwin has withdrawn his business as a result. Lane blames Pete's methods for losing the account, and Pete responds by citing Lane's redundant role at the firm and challenging his sexuality. To the surprise and shock of the other partners, Lane responds by challenging Pete to a fistfight. Pete and Lane exchange blows until Lane wins, leaving a bloodied Pete <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> floor. Bruised, shaken, and humiliated, Pete retreats to his office. Joan goes to comfort Lane, only Lane misinterprets her affection as romantic and kisses her. Joan, startled, stands and opens the door, but does not leave. She instead stays with Lane and forgives his blunder, claiming that he'd done to Pete what everyone in the office had wanted to do for some time.|$|E
5|$|The grandsons are {{depicted}} {{in very different}} styles: Alessandro acts in a formal manner and wears clothes of similar colour and tones to Paul. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, {{an area of the}} painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is awkward and difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Alessandro has a distracted, brooding expression. He holds the knob of Paul's backrest, in an echo of Raphael's portrait where Clement VII holds the chair of Leo X as an indicator of his ambitions of succession. Thus Alessandro seems better placed politically, standing to Paul's right in a pose that recalls traditional depictions of Paul the Apostle, and his hand is raised as if in blessing. In the end, Paul was unable to influence his succession after Charles V weakened the Medici hold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
5|$|The inquiry {{recommended}} the western (1875) train shed roof should be retained in new development; consequently it was repaired and reinforced between 1982 and 1984, followed by repairs {{to the main}} roof completed in 1987. Initial plans included the widening of the stations' exit by two tracks to make eight, with 22 platforms in a layout {{similar to that of}} Waterloo station; the combined Broad Street and Liverpool Street station was to be {{at the level of the}} latter, with relatively low-rise office developments. Poor use of land value caused the development to be reassessed in 1983/4, when it was decided to retain the existing six-road exit throat and 18-platform layout, in combination with resignalling; this resulted in a station confined to the Liverpool Street site, with ground space released for development. In 1985 British Railways signed an agreement with developers Rosehaugh Stanhope and work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> development, known as Broadgate, began.|$|E
