50|$|The {{observation}} {{light is}} focused via {{a series of}} lenses through a doughnut shaped aperture, which then passes through a central aperture to form an annulus, before passing through the camera objective lens and through the cornea onto the retina. The light reflected from the retina passes through the un-illuminated hole in the doughnut formed by the illumination system. As the light paths of the two systems are independent, there are minimal reflections of the light source captured in the formed image. The image forming rays continue towards the low powered telescopic eyepiece. When the button is pressed to take a picture, a mirror interrupts {{the path of the}} illumination system allow the light from the flash bulb to pass into the eye. Simultaneously, a mirror falls in front of the <b>observation</b> <b>telescope,</b> which redirects the light onto the capturing medium, whether it is film or a digital CCD. Because of the eye’s tendency to accommodate while looking though a telescope, it is imperative that the exiting vergence is parallel in order for an in focus image to be formed on the capturing medium.|$|E
40|$|Network telescopes {{have been}} {{invaluable}} for collecting information about dynamics of large-scale worm events. Yet, a <b>telescope’s</b> <b>observation</b> may be incomplete due to scan congestion drops, hardware limitations, filtering and presence of NATs, a worm’s non-uniform scanning strategy or its short life. We investigate inaccuracies in <b>telescope</b> <b>observations</b> {{that arise from}} worm-induced congestion drops of worm scans and show that they may lead to significant underestimates {{of the number of}} infectees and their scanning rate. We propose a method to infer worm-induced congestion drops from <b>telescope’s</b> <b>observations</b> and use them to accurately estimate global worm dynamics. We apply our methods to CAIDA <b>telescope’s</b> <b>observations</b> of Witty worm’s spread, and release corrected statistics of worm dynamics for public use...|$|R

40|$|The Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) is {{the fourth}} in NASA's series of Great Observatories. It will feature a one-meter class cryogenically cooled telescope. It is planned for a NASA fiscal start for the {{development}} phase in 1994 with a launch in about 2001. The launch vehicle {{will be the new}} upgraded Titan IV with a Centaur upper stage. The operational orbit will be circular at an altitude of about 100, 000 km. The planned mission lifetime is 5 years. This paper addresses the rationale in the selection of the high altitude orbit, the performance of the launch vehicle in delivering the observatory to orbit, other orbit options, and the planned observational modes and capabilities of the observatory.

40|$|Steady and {{unsteady}} viscous, three-dimensional flowfields {{are calculated}} using {{a thin layer}} approximation of Navier-Stokes equations in conjunction with Chimera overset grids. The finite-difference numerical scheme uses structured grids and a pentadiagonal flow solver called "OVERFLOW". The configuration of Boeing 747 - 200 has been chosen as one of configurations {{to be used as}} a platform for the SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy). Initially, the steady flowfield of the full aircraft is calculated for the clean configuration (without a cavity to house telescope). This solution is then used to start the unsteady flowfield of a configuration containing cavity housing the <b>observation</b> <b>telescope</b> and its peripheral units. Analysis of unsteady flowfield in the cavity and its influence on the tail empennage, as well as the noise due to turbulence and optical quality of the flow are the main focus of this study. For the configuration considered here, the telescope housing cavity is located slightly downstream of the portwing. The entire flow-field is carefully constructed using 45 overset grids and consists of nearly 4 million grid points. All the computations axe done at one freestream flow condition of M(sub infinity) = 0. 85, alpha = 2. 5 deg, and a Reynolds of Re = 1. 85 x 10 de...|$|E

40|$|The orbit {{determination}} of a satellite in a geostationary orbit is usually based on optical <b>observations.</b> <b>Telescopes</b> {{all around the}} Earth are observing the geostationary ring to obtain periodically new measurements in order to update the estimation of the objects’ orbits. One critical aspect of the {{orbit determination}} process is the initial orbit determination because no a priori information are available. This paper proposes a new method based on search algorithms with heuristic principles aming to find the six independent orbital parameters that best fit the observations. A genetic algorithm makes the candidate solutions moving in a solution space of six dimensions. The problem is reduced into a two dimensional space with a Lambert’s solver using the initial and final angular observations.
