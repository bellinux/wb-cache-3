40|$|The {{inspection}} {{design for}} the Air Force’s Retirement For Cause (RFC) program uses automated eddy current and ultrasonic inspection systems to detect flaws in the compressor and turbine components of the F 100 engine. The requirements of the program include the inspection of bolt holes, cooling <b>holes,</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> in the various engine components. The hole diameters range from 0. 060 ″ to 0. 600 ″ {{with many of the}} components having 60 to 70 holes of a given size. The spacing between holes is fairly accurate; in general, variations are less than 0. 010 ″. Since the initial system accomodates approximately 20 different engine components, the only practical method of clamping the components to the systems’ turntable utilizes a set of jaws that clamp outwards on a component’s bore or rim. This method requires the operator to first align the part on the turntable. Accuracies on the order of 1 to 2 degrees are expected (0. 200 ″ at a 7 ″ radius). The inspection of holes is accomplished using rotating eddy current probes having a diameter 0. 010 ″ less than the hole diameter. For a reliable inspection, the probe must be centered in the hole to within 0. 001 ″ of true center. As stated above, initial probe placement may be 0. 200 ″ off center for the first hole and up to 0. 010 ″ off center for succeeding holes (see Figure 1). This means that centering must occur while the probe is outside of the hole. The resulting requirements for a hole centering algorithm are...|$|R
5000|$|The {{decision}} was made by Pond to attend Reno with the same engines used for flight testing. In fact, a vibrator was still attached to the left vertical stabilizer to initiate flutter {{as part of the}} planned flight test program. There was no expectation of victory the first year. It was viewed as a [...] "dress rehearsal" [...] more than anything else. After takeoff for the final event on Sunday, the left engine threw a rod out the side of the block and created a tunnel of fire 4 ft in diameter and about 15 ft long. An onboard halon extinguishing system put the oil fire out and an uneventful single-engine landing was made. The engine installations were very compact and [...] "close cowled", meaning the bodywork covering the engines had little clearance. The carbon fiber engine cowling was a structural component of the aircraft and as such had to be protected from heat-soak after shutdown. This was accomplished via two 2-stroke weed blowers immediately after the blades stopped turning, quickly followed by two air conditioner blowers attached to the air inlet [...] "scuppers". The engine cowlings were lined with corrugated inconel of [...]007 thickness. Airflow was vital to structural integrity. Conversely, the powerplant units had to be preheated to nearly operating temperature before fireup. This was due to the tight tolerances of the engine main bearings. Because methanol burns much cooler than gasoline, cooling was never an issue. Actually the cold nature of the methanol gave the team a problem with oil viscosity. The thick, graphite laden oil would [...] "puke" [...] overboard {{for the majority of the}} time while airborne. Eventually it was determined that the <b>oil</b> <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> were undersized in the rocker area of the heads as they were not intended to run at a constant high RPM in an automobile application. Fully half of the radiator inlet ducting was blocked off after the first test flight on March 22, 1991. Dick Rutan was the initial test pilot. Mike Melvill also flew the plane as did Steve Hinton as part of the test program.|$|R

The dressing was inspected and reapplied every 24  h thereafter until the surgical wound was completely dry. In addition, the suction canister drains were removed when the 24 -h output {{was less than}} 50  cc of fluid. A separate occlusive dressing {{was placed on the}} suction canister <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> and changed daily until completely dry. Wounds or <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> producing persistent copious drainage, defined as saturation of a dressing every 8  h, had a vacuum-assisted closure (KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA) device placed on either the incision or <b>drain</b> <b>holes.</b> The vacuum dressing was removed after 48  h and the wound reassessed. All wounds were assessed for infection. We defined infection as persistent purulent drainage, surrounding erythema, and positive intraoperative wound cultures. Patients were not discharged from the hospital until the incision and <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> were completely dry. At 2  weeks, patients returned to the clinic for staple removal or wound inspection. In addition, patients were evaluated in the clinic at 6  weeks, 3  months, 6  months, and 1  year.
