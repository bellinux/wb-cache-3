5|$|Several anecdotal stories {{supposedly}} {{explain why}} Warhol chose Campbell's Soup cans as {{the focal point}} of his pop art. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he needed a new subject after he abandoned comic strips, a move taken in part due to his respect for the refined work of Roy Lichtenstein. According to Ted Carey—one of Warhol's commercial art assistants in the late 1950s—it was Muriel Latow who suggested the idea for both the soup cans and Warhol's early U.S. dollar paintings.|$|E
5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters {{have turned}} to a digital mode of broadcasting called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts {{to as much as}} one million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.|$|E
5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E
50|$|On April 1, 1996, Vaillancourt {{moved to}} WBT. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> at WFNZ, {{he would have}} had to give up his role in Charlotte Hornets broadcasts.|$|R
50|$|Historically the Indian {{peoples of}} the North American {{continent}} rarely joined forces across tribal lines, which were divisions related to distinct language and cultural groups. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> most tribes <b>were</b> highly decentralized, with their people seldom united around issues.|$|R
5000|$|After some {{records for}} a new album in 1983 and 1984 the band split. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the band's success did not {{progress}} to countries other than Iceland. Egill Ólafsson started working {{as a writer and}} was a member in the band Stuðmenn in which other Þursaflokkurinn musicians were also playing.|$|R
5|$|Unlike a {{significant}} number of registered breeds today, a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred (with The Jockey Club registry) unless conceived by live cover, the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion. Artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer (ET), though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries, cannot be used with Thoroughbreds. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI, and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns, AI still requires more detailed record keeping. The main reason, however, may be economic; a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover. Thus the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds, although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible. As an example, in 2008, the Australian stallion Encosta De Lago covered 227 mares. By allowing a stallion to cover only a couple of hundred mares a year rather than the couple of thousand possible with AI, it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparing}} {{editions of}} the play, one will find several relatively minor textual differences. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Sheridan revised his text repeatedly, not only prior to its first production, but afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Most textual {{critics of}} the New Testament favor the Alexandrian text-type as the closest {{representative}} of the autographs for many reasons. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Alexandrian manuscripts are the oldest found; {{some of the earliest}} church fathers used readings found in the Alexandrian text. Another is that the Alexandrian readings are adjudged more often to be the ones that can best explain the origin of all the variant readings found in other text-types.|$|E
50|$|The 1970 Tour, {{with fewer}} flat stages, fewer time trials and more {{mountain}} stages, had been thought to <b>be</b> a route <b>that</b> suited climbing specialists. There were five split stages, and cyclists had complained about it. Nevertheless, the 1971 Tour again used split stages: <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the UCI rules {{did not allow}} long stages, to prevent the use of doping; another <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> split stages generated more income.|$|R
2500|$|On February 29, 1984, Cutter {{became the}} last of the four major blood product {{companies}} to get US approval to sell heated concentrate. [...] Even after Cutter began selling the new product, for several months, until August 1984, the company continued making the old medicine. [...] <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the company had several fixed-price contracts and believed that the old product would be cheaper to produce.|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{studies were}} {{conducted}} starting in 1993 that argued facilitated communication was an ineffective technique. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> autistic individuals <b>were</b> {{not able to}} communicate any better {{than they would have}} independently. [...] Another <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> because facilitators’ seemed to have an influence on the messages being typed by individuals with autism. In 1994, the American Psychological Association officially announced <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> “no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy." ...|$|R
25|$|Overall {{the culture}} of Northumberland, as with the north east of England in general, has much {{more in common with}} Scottish Lowland and Northern English culture than with that of Southern England. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both regions have their {{cultural}} origins in the old Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria, a fact borne out by the linguistic links between the two regions. These include many Old English words not found in other forms of Modern English, such as bairn for child (see Scots language and Northumbria).|$|E
25|$|The computable numbers may {{be viewed}} as the real numbers that may be exactly {{represented}} in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.|$|E
25|$|The human sexual {{response}} cycle set {{the foundation for}} studying and categorizing sexual dysfunctions in men and women. There are four main categories of sexual dysfunctions: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasm disorders, and sexual pain disorders. They are still categorized as such in the DSM-IV-TR. Recent research however, suggests that the current model of {{sexual response}} needs to be revised to better treat these dysfunctions. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is considerable overlap between sexual dysfunctions in women. One study found that in patients with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), 41% of women {{had at least one}} other sexual dysfunction and 18% had diagnoses in all 3 categories (that is, in desire, arousal, and orgasm disorders).|$|E
60|$|But <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> perhaps, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I had {{anticipated}} a narrative quite different; something agreeing with my previous surmises.|$|R
25|$|The sangha {{traveled}} through the subcontinent, expounding the dharma. This continued throughout the year, except {{during the four}} months of the Vassa rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> more difficult {{to do so without}} causing harm to animal life. At this time of year, the sangha would retreat to monasteries, public parks or forests, where people would come to them.|$|R
5000|$|After {{this meeting}} Sun would leave Penang for North America, United States. There are {{multiple}} possible causes on why he <b>was</b> banned. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> {{ordered by the}} British colonial authorities to leave Penang because of his public criticism of British colonial rule. [...] Another <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Straits administrator John Anderson ordered him to be banned because of inflammatory speech to incite support for his anti-Manchu revolutions on November 26, 1910, at a Chinese club.|$|R
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that each year about 17,000 children die from diarrhea. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> drinking water quality is often below standards. Some water treatment plants are not maintained properly and are thus inefficient in removing parasites, viruses and other parasitic microorganisms. In 2009, {{a study by the}} Ministry of Health showed that drinking water for half a million people in Asiut was unfit for human consumption. As of June 2011, nothing had been done to address the problem. Chlorination systems of wells, which had been installed years ago because high levels of bacteria had been detected in the groundwater, failed for lack of maintenance and have been shut down so that untreated water is provided to the residents.|$|E
25|$|Sweet {{potatoes}} {{became popular}} {{very early in}} the islands of the Pacific Ocean, spreading from Polynesia to Japan and the Philippines. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they were a reliable crop in cases of crop failure of other staple foods because of typhoon flooding. They are featured in many favorite dishes in Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and other island nations. Indonesia, Vietnam, India, and some other Asian countries are also large sweet potato growers. Sweet potato, also known as kelang in Tulu, is part of Udupi cuisine in South India. Uganda (the second largest grower after China), Rwanda, and some other African countries also grow a large crop which {{is an important part of}} their peoples' diets. The New World, the original home of the sweet potato, grows less than three percent (3%) of the world's supply. Europe has only a very small sweet potato production, mainly in Portugal. In the Caribbean, a cultivar of the sweet potato called the boniato is popular. The flesh of the boniato is cream-colored, unlike the more popular orange hue seen in other cultivars. Boniatos are not as sweet and moist as other sweet potatoes, but many people prefer their fluffier consistency and more delicate flavor.|$|E
500|$|Not all cities show {{a warming}} {{relative}} to their rural surroundings. After trends were adjusted in urban weather stations {{around the world to}} match rural stations in their regions, in an effort to homogenise the temperature record, in 42 percent of cases, cities were getting cooler {{relative to their}} surroundings rather than warmer. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> urban areas are heterogeneous, and weather stations are often sited in [...] "cool islands" [...] – parks, for example – within urban areas.|$|E
50|$|The song {{differs from}} Carr's {{previous}} songs. <b>One</b> main <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{instead of her}} rap/singing style, she went for a more melodic song.|$|R
5000|$|Perutz {{wrote that}} he stayed in Washington D.C. while U.S. Navy {{engineers}} evaluated the viability of Habbakuk. He concluded: [...] "The U.S. Navy finally decided <b>that</b> Habakkuk <b>was</b> a false prophet. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the enormous amount of steel needed for the refrigeration plant <b>that</b> <b>was</b> to freeze the pykrete <b>was</b> greater than <b>that</b> needed to build the entire carrier of steel, but the crucial argument <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the rapidly increasing range of land-based aircraft rendered floating islands unnecessary." ...|$|R
40|$|Before the 2007 – 09 crisis, {{standard}} risk measurement methods substantially underestimated {{the threat to}} the financial system. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these methods didn’t account for how closely commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies were linked. As financial conditions worsened in one type of institution, the effects spread to others. A new method that more accurately accounts for these spillover effects suggests that hedge funds may have been central in generating systemic risk during the crisis...|$|R
500|$|There {{are many}} reasons why Sockeye Salmon in the Snake River are reduced in number. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the river runs through three {{different}} states, and is over [...] long. Salmon swimming upstream in this river are faced with predators and dams. The Snake River has fifteen dams and is extremely difficult for salmon to access because of hydroelectric dams. Hell's Canyon Dam blocks passage to the entire upper Snake River. The Grand Coulee Dam also blocks spawning grounds to the famous [...] "June Hogs" [...] (legendary Chinook salmon that weighed over [...] ).|$|E
500|$|Most {{newspaper}} reviewers gave Inchon negative reviews; {{among them}} were The Boston Globe, The Philadelphia Inquirer, [...] The Miami Herald, [...] and The Washington Post. [...] In The New York Times, critic Vincent Canby commented, [...] "Inchon is a hysterical historical epic, somewhat less offensive than The Green Berets and far funnier. ... 'Inchon' looks like the most expensive B-movie ever made." [...] A review in the influential entertainment-trade magazine Variety commented, [...] "Olivier is convincing in his role {{throughout most of the}} saga, {{the only member of the}} cast to achieve that status. [...] Screenplay [...] generally treats all others as one-dimensional buffoons, giving them lines that are unintentionally laughable. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> all plot digressions are simply window dressing to the film's focus on the brutally invading North Koreans and the big-scale counterattack by the good guys. No speaking roles are given to the Communists, for example." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{properties}} that make black holes most promising sources of gravitational waves. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> black holes {{are the most}} compact objects that can orbit each other {{as part of a}} binary system; as a result, the gravitational waves emitted by such a system are especially strong. Another reason follows from what are called black-hole uniqueness theorems: over time, black holes retain only a minimal set of distinguishing features (these theorems have become known as [...] "no-hair" [...] theorems, since different hairstyles are a crucial part of what gives different people their different appearances). For instance, in the long term, the collapse of a hypothetical matter cube will not result in a cube-shaped black hole. Instead, the resulting black hole will be indistinguishable from a black hole formed by the collapse of a spherical mass, but with one important difference: in its transition to a spherical shape, the black hole formed by the collapse of a cube will emit gravitational waves.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Viacom {{attempted}} {{to sell its}} then-78% share of Spelling. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they wanted to recoup the debt incurred from buying Paramount Communications. Also, they felt that the operations of Spelling Television was too similar to its Paramount Television division. Potential bids came from PolyGram, New World Entertainment, and News Corporation. These plans were called off in 1996 as Viacom {{could not find the}} perfect bidder. The remainder of Spelling Entertainment was then acquired by Viacom on June 23, 1999.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2006, the K&K ceased both freight and tourist service. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> freight {{shipments}} over the line had declined seriously over the years. An additional <b>reason</b> the line <b>was</b> abandoned as a tourist operation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the main attraction of the ride was a trip over the Kinzua Bridge. The viaduct was extensively damaged by a tornado in 2003. When the State of Pennsylvania, which owns the viaduct, {{could not afford to}} repair it, the railroad lost its major tourist draw.|$|R
5000|$|<b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> sea power <b>was</b> never a {{priority}} of the Austrian foreign policy and that the Navy itself was relatively little known {{and supported by the}} public. Activities such as open days and naval clubs were unable to change the sentiment <b>that</b> the Navy <b>was</b> just something [...] "expensive but far away". Another point <b>was</b> <b>that</b> naval expenditures <b>were</b> for most of the time overseen by the Austrian War Ministry, which was largely controlled by the Army, the only exception being the period before the Battle of Lissa.|$|R
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 17, 1910. It states: [...] "Clara Moore is a society girl who has won the affections of Jack Cass, a young millionaire. He thinks she loves him, but it is really his money that she adores. Prompted by a letter of warning, Jack decides to prove his sweetheart's love. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he privately disapproves of the way Clara and her mother have treated a poor relation, an orphan girl, who has been left in their care. Instead of giving her a home, they make a servant of her. Jack's plot works like a charm. His faithful valet gives the newspapers {{the story of the}} failure of Jack's mind, and that young man's ruin. Clara reads it and when Jack calls and admits that the reports are correct, she returns his ring and says that all is over between them. In fact {{the only person in the}} house that shows any sympathy for Jack is the poor relation, May Dustin, and naturally he compares her with the heartless society girl. Jack wants to see more of May, and invents a unique way of doing so. He buys out the milkman who serves the family, and in that way is able to call on May everyday. Liking soon ripens into love, and May agrees to wed Jack, although thinking he has nothing in the world but a meager salary. After marriage she is told the truth and finds that her husband has money enough to supply her every wish. As for Clara, she has lost her only chance to win a prized millionaire." ...|$|E
2500|$|Few {{houses of}} the Romanesque period have survived across Europe. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{many of them were}} built of wooden or half timbered construction. A number of half timbered houses in Germany at Esslingen, Bad Wimpfen and Swabisch Hall have been shown to date from this period. [...] The houses that are still {{standing}} are mostly of stone, like the house at Bad Munstereifel in Germany, the houses in Lincolnshire, England, and the {{houses of the}} village of Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert, Languedoc-Roussillon, France.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{provenance}} {{for this}} object is not good, and being {{cut with a}} steel blade makes it suspect, both Métraux and Barthel believed it to be undoubtedly genuine. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it contains the rare glyph 36 and the rare compounds 38 and 684, and so is an unlikely forgery, though Barthel {{found out about it}} too late to include it in his catalogue. It was sold to the Musée de I'Homme in December 1961 by one Henry Reichlen, who had acquired it from a French family who had owned it for several generations — eighty years, by their count.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} debated why the Aztecs took little {{action against the}} Spanish and their allies after they fled the city. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Tenochtitlan <b>was</b> {{certainly}} {{in a state of}} disorder: the smallpox disease ravaged the population, killing still more important leaders and nobles, and a new king, Cuauhtémoc, son of King Ahuitzotl, was placed on the throne in February 1521. The people {{were in the process of}} mourning the dead and rebuilding their damaged city. It <b>is</b> possible <b>that</b> the Aztecs truly believed <b>that</b> the Spanish <b>were</b> gone for good.|$|R
50|$|After {{many weeks}} of {{negotiations}} {{during which the}} Greek government, often against Varoufakis' advice, made many concessions to the troika of Greece's lenders, no agreement <b>was</b> in sight. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the members of the}} troika did not have a unified position. For example, the IMF insisted that the Greek government's demand for a public debt restructure should be granted, while powerful finance ministers in the Eurogroup (Germany's, for instance) refused this. Another alleged <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> with elections approaching in Spain, Ireland and Portugal, various politicians within the EU {{did not want to see}} Greece's radical new government emerge as successful.|$|R
50|$|The mid-1950s saw the {{beginning}} of a period of heightened R&D activity at KMZ. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> lens production could be offloaded to a number of other new optical plants, including Arsenal in Kiev which began producing lenses in 1955. This freed up valuable resources at KMZ. Another <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> the changed economic policy under Nikita Khrushchev, which placed more emphasis on producing consumer goods, such as cameras, instead of investment goods and heavy industry. As a result, KMZ produced several highly interesting concept cameras that won international prizes at fairs such as the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels.|$|R
