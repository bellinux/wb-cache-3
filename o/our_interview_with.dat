In 1912, George V wrote to Nicholas II about [...] "that good fool Michael, who I am sure bores you with as many grievances as he does me." [...] Nicholas had written to George to tell him that Grand Duke Michael had asked his {{permission}} for his wife to accept a British title and that he had given consent, subject of course to George’s agreement. In his reply George pointed out [...] "I have not the power to grant a title in England to a foreign subject and still more impossible {{in the case of a}} Russian Grand Duke." [...] Gloomily accepting that the grand duke would be turning up to make a formal request for his wife’s title, George added that [...] "I do not look forward to <b>our</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> any pleasure, as I fear I have no alternative but to refuse his request”.|$|E

60|$|The wind shifted {{a day or}} {{two after}} this escape, giving us a slant that carried us past Scilly, fairly out into the Atlantic. A {{fortnight}} or so after <b>our</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> the Eddystone we carried away the pintals of the rudder, which was saved only by the modern invention that prevents the head from dropping, by means of the deck. To prevent the strain, and to get some service from the rudder, however, we found it necessary to sling the latter, and to breast it into the stern-post by means of purchases. A spar was laid athwart the coach-house, directly over the rudder, and we rove a chain through the tiller-hole, and passed it over this spar. For this purpose the smallest chain-cable was used, the rudder being raised from the deck by means of sheers. We then got a set of chain-topsail sheets, parcelled them well, and took a clove hitch with them around the rudder, about half-way up. One end was brought into each main-chain, and set up by tackles. In this manner the wheel did tolerably well, though we had to let the ship lie-to in heavy weather.|$|E
6000|$|As {{we passed}} {{to our own}} {{apartment}} I peeped into Job's sleeping place, {{to see how he}} fared, for he had gone away just before <b>our</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> the murdered Ustane, quite prostrated by the terrors of the Amahagger festivity. He was sleeping soundly, good honest fellow that he was, and I rejoiced to think that his nerves, which, like those of most uneducated people, were far from strong, had been spared the closing scenes of this dreadful day. Then we entered our own chamber, and here at last poor Leo, who, ever since he had looked upon that frozen image of his living self, had been in a state not far removed from stupefaction, burst out into a torrent of grief. Now that he was no longer {{in the presence of the}} dread She, his sense of the awfulness of all that had happened, and more especially of the wicked murder of Ustane, who was bound to him by ties so close, broke upon him like a storm, and lashed him into an agony of remorse and terror which was painful to witness. He cursed himself--he cursed the hour when we had first seen the writing on the sherd, which was being so mysteriously verified, and bitterly he cursed his own weakness. Ayesha he dared not curse--who dared speak evil of such a woman, whose consciousness, for aught we knew, was watching us at the very moment? ...|$|E
6000|$|I cannot write at {{any length}} of <b>our</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Fairlie, for I cannot recall it to mind without {{feelings}} of impatience and contempt, which make the scene, even in remembrance only, utterly repulsive to me. I prefer to record simply that I carried my point. Mr. Fairlie attempted to treat us on his customary plan. We passed without notice his polite insolence {{at the outset of}} the interview. We heard without sympathy the protestations with which he tried next to persuade us that the disclosure of the conspiracy had overwhelmed him. He absolutely whined and whimpered at last like a fretful child. [...] "How was he to know that his niece was alive when he was told that she was dead? He would welcome dear Laura with pleasure, if we would only allow him time to recover. Did we think he looked as if he wanted hurrying into his grave? No. Then, why hurry him?" [...] He reiterated these remonstrances at every available opportunity, until I checked them once for all, by placing him firmly between two inevitable alternatives. I gave him his choice between doing his niece justice on my terms, or facing the consequence of a public assertion of her existence in a court of law. Mr. Kyrle, to whom he turned for help, told him plainly that he must decide the question then and there. Characteristically choosing the alternative which promised soonest to release him from all personal anxiety, he announced with a sudden outburst of energy, that he was not strong enough to bear any more bullying, and that we might do as we pleased.|$|E

6000|$|I have here, I allow, not {{a little}} to foreshorten--have to skip sundry particulars, certain of the steps by which I came to think of my {{relation}} to my injury as a modus vivendi workable for the time. These steps had after the first flush of reaction inevitably had to be communications of my state, recognitions and admissions; which had the effect, I hasten to add, of producing sympathies, supports and reassurances. I gladly took these things, I perfectly remember, at that value; distinct to me as it still is nevertheless that the indulgence they conveyed lost part of its balm by involving a degree of publication. Direfully distinct have remained to me the conditions of a pilgrimage to Boston made that summer under my father's care for consultation of a great surgeon, {{the head of his}} profession there; whose opinion and advice--the more that he was a guaranteed friend of my father's--had seemed the best light to invoke on the less and less bearable affliction with which I had been for three or four months seeking to strike some sort of bargain: mainly, up to that time, under protection of a theory of temporary supine [...] "rest" [...] against which everything inward and outward tended equally to conspire. Agitated scraps of rest, snatched, to my consciousness, by the liveliest violence, were to show for futile almost to the degree in which the effort of <b>our</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> the high expert was afterwards so to show; the truth being that this interview settled my sad business, settled it just in that saddest sense, for ever so long to come. This was so much the case that, as the mere scene of our main appeal, the house from which we had after its making dejectedly emerged put forth to me as I passed it in many a subsequent season an ironic smug symbolism of its action on my fate. That action had come from the complete failure of our approached oracle either to warn, to comfort or to command--to do anything but make quite unassistingly light of the bewilderment exposed to him. In default of other attention or suggestion he might by a mere warning as to gravities only too possible, and already well advanced, have made such a difference; but I have little forgotten how I felt myself, the warning absent, treated but to a comparative pooh-pooh--an impression I long looked back to as a sharp parting of the ways, with an adoption of the wrong one distinctly determined. It was not simply small comfort, it was only a mystification the more, that the inconvenience of my state had to reckon with the strange fact of there being nothing to speak of the matter with me. The graceful course, on the whole ground again (and where moreover was delicacy, the proposed, the intended, without grace?) was to behave accordingly, in good set terms, as if the assurance were true; since the time left no margin at all for one's gainsaying with the right confidence so high an authority. There were a hundred ways to behave--in the general sense so freely suggested, I mean; and I think of the second half of that summer of '62 as my attempt at selection of the best. The best still remained, under closer comparisons, very much what it had at first seemed, and there was in fact this charm in it that to prepare for an ordeal essentially intellectual, as I surmised, might justly involve, in the public eye, a season of some retirement. The beauty was--I can fairly see it now, through the haze of time, even as beauty!--that studious retirement and preparatory hours did after all supply the supine attitude, did invest the ruefulness, did deck out the cynicism of lying down book in hand with a certain fine plausibility. This was at least a negative of combat, an organised, not a loose and empty one, something definitely and firmly parallel to action in the tented field; and I well recall, for that matter, how, when early in the autumn I had in fact become the queerest of forensic recruits, the bristling horde of my Law School comrades fairly produced the illusion of a mustered army. The Cambridge campus was tented field enough for a conscript starting so compromised; and I can scarce say moreover how easily it let me down that {{when it came to the}} point one had still fine fierce young men, in great numbers, for company, there being at the worst so many such who hadn't flown to arms. I was to find my fancy of the merely relative right in any way to figure, or even on such terms just to exist, I was to find it in due course quite drop from me as the Cambridge year played itself out, leaving me all aware that, full though the air might be of stiffer realities, one had yet a rare handful of one's own to face and deal with.|$|E

40|$|This project {{seeks to}} explore the concept of {{organizational}} culture {{and how it can}} be used in the situation of acquisitions. The group´s idea for the project is rooted in the acquisition process of the Danish Roskilde Bank by Spar Nord bank, back in summer of 2008. Much had been written both academically and in the mass media, about the crash of Roskilde Bank four years after the acquisition, we have investigated how the former Roskilde Bank employees at Køgevej 45 department assimilated the new organizational culture at Spar Nord bank which is the background of our case study. With regards to gathering empirical data we have contacted a former Roskilde Bank employee, Josa Ejs. She represents one of the eleven employees who joined Spar Nord bank after the crash. The acquisition of the branch occurred on 29 th of September 2008. <b>Our</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> her represents a unique empirical proof. The former employees of Roskilde Bank, on this specific department, were barred from speaking to the press under any circumstance. This is the first time a former Roskilde Band employee has granted us, students from Roskilde University, the chance to be interviewed for academic purposes. The intention of the group is to link the empirical data from <b>our</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> a former Roskilde Bank employee and our theory choice. Our choice of theory (theory of organizational culture) reflects the desire to see our problem formulation answered from a practical and theoretical context. The major conclusion reached in this project is that, the former employees of Roskilde bank were rather integrated into Spar Nord instead of assimilating them. The integration process was therefore not so difficult since it the same set of people being located in different organizational environmen...|$|E
