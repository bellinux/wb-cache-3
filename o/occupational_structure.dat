Proof-correcting arose as a new occupation, while a rise in the amount of booksellers and librarians naturally followed the explosion in the numbers of books.|$|E
25|$|Finland's export-dependent economy {{continuously}} {{adapted to}} the world market; in doing so, it changed Finnish society as well. The prolonged worldwide boom, {{beginning in the late}} 1940s and lasting until the first oil crisis in 1973, was a challenge that Finland met and from which it emerged with a highly sophisticated and diversified economy, including a new <b>occupational</b> <b>structure.</b> Some sectors kept a fairly constant share of the work force. Transportation and construction, for example, each accounted for between 7 and 8 percent in both 1950 and 1985, and manufacturing's share rose only from 22 to 24 percent. However, both the commercial and the service sectors more than doubled their share of the work force, accounting, respectively, for 21 and 28 percent in 1985. The greatest change was the decline of the economically active population employed in agriculture and forestry, from approximately 50 percent in 1950 to 10 percent in 1985. The exodus from farms and forests provided the labour power needed for the growth of other sectors.|$|E

40|$|Patterns of poor relief varied greatly amongst {{nineteenth century}} Irish cities. To date, however, {{there has been}} little {{examination}} of the reasons behind these divergences. One possible factor is the divergent <b>occupational</b> and demographic <b>structures</b> of these cities – ranging from the dramatic growth of an industrialising Belfast, to relative (post-Famine) stability in more service-oriented Dublin, to the slow decline of other southern regional capitals. This paper examines the occupational and social class breakdown of the six major Irish cities over the period from 1861 (after the Great Famine) to 1901 and explores whether the difference in these factors can help to explain the differences in poor relief policies adopted in the different poor law unions. It concludes that the aggregate evidence suggests little clear link between <b>occupational</b> <b>structures</b> and poor relief policies. While it would seem unlikely that <b>occupational</b> <b>structures</b> did not have some impact on such policies, it appears that the impact of such structures was mediated through a range of other policies and will only be revealed through detailed local studies. Drawing on broader work, the paper suggests that key influences in the different patterns of poor relief– in addition to overarching factors such as the wealth of a union – may have included both religious factors and the use of poor relief policy to control in-migration in the rapidly growing northern cities. ...|$|R

Their emergence fits a wider trajectory in the development of modern knowledge economies whereby increasing sectoral specialisation requires the expansion of activities which facilitate cross-sectoral relations.

The empirical methodology integrates a multinomial logit model of occupational attainment with estimated human capital wage equations across occupations. Empirical analysis of data from the 1979 cohort of the NLSY suggests that {{nearly two-thirds of the}} gender gap in hourly earnings results from men having more favourable earnings structures within occupations, relative to their female colleagues. Gender differences in occupational distributions apparently have a minor impact on the relative earnings of women. ...|$|R
