5|$|While Shakespeare's {{daffodil}} is {{the wild}} or true English daffodil (N. pseudonarcissus), many other species were introduced, {{some of which}} escaped and naturalised, particularly N. biflorus (a hybrid) in Devon and the west of England. Gerard, in his extensive discussion of daffodils, both wild and cultivated ("bastard daffodils") described twenty four species in London gardens (1597), ("we have them all and every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> our London gardens, in great abundance", p.114).|$|E

Mr. Evans is sympathetic, but powerless to help; so Danny decides {{to drop out of}} school to find work, against the wishes of his father, who tries to convince Danny to stay in school.|$|E

5|$|Máel Coluim's Queen Margaret was {{the sister}} of the native {{claimant}} to the English throne, Edgar Ætheling. This marriage, and Máel Coluim's raids on northern England, prompted interference by the Norman rulers of England in the Scottish kingdom. King William the Conqueror invaded and Máel Coluim submitted to his authority, giving his oldest son Donnchad as a hostage. From 1079 onwards there were various cross border raids by both parties and Máel Coluim himself and Edward, his eldest son by Margaret, died in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Alnwick, in 1093.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the frame}} houses {{was used as the}} first school in Elcor. It was not long before a new school was constructed. Elcor was {{included}} in the middle part of the Gilbert School system, known then as Independent School District No. 18. There were five schoolhouses in the district. The McKinley-Elba school was built in 1900, halfway between McKinley and Elba, complete with its own well and windmill. It had four teachers and housed classes through the eighth grade, accommodating pupils of both communities. Students walked to school over boardwalks. There were also three primary schools in the district, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> Elba on Malta Street.|$|E
5|$|Frederick II, {{ruler of}} the Holy Roman Empire in the 13th century, {{realised}} that his dynasty was losing its power and granted freedoms to many cities {{in order to keep}} their allegiance. These cities became Free imperial cities and Sélestat became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> 1217. Under the new status Sélestat was able to build city walls and collect taxes on its own. Its serfs and settlers were freed. The German monarch Adolf of Nassau granted Sélestat a constitution in 1292. It was amended many times but it regulated local politics until 1789. Although the new status favoured trade and prosperity, free cities in Alsace were afraid {{that they would not be}} defended by imperial forces if a conflict was to occur. So they decided to form an alliance called the Decapolis in 1354, which comprised ten cities: (Haguenau, Colmar, Wissembourg, Turckheim, Obernai, Kaysersberg, Rosheim, Munster, Sélestat and Mulhouse). The seat of the alliance was in Haguenau but its archives were kept in Sélestat. Because the town was the most centrally located, it often hosted meetings of the association.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 {{a private}} {{security}} guard {{with a pistol}} pursued on foot two men whom he believed tried to steal scrap metal. The men climbed on a railway embankment and started throwing rocks down at the guard who thereafter shot ten rounds in their direction, mortally wounding <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the head. The guard was first convicted of murder by the Municipal Court in Prague and given a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. The decision was changed by the High Court in Prague to conviction of intentional infliction of bodily harm resulting in death (i.e. manslaughter) and a sentence of five years imprisonment. The guard was finally exonerated by the Supreme Court in Brno which considered his action legitimate self-defense, noting that defense must be clearly more intensive than attack {{in order to be}} successful, and that the stones and bricks being thrown presented grave danger to the man's life.|$|E
5|$|Juan Martín del Potro and Roger Federer {{have played}} 24 times with Federer leading 18–6. They have met seven times in Grand Slam tournaments with Federer leading 5–2. Their two most famous Grand Slam tournament {{meetings}} came in 2009. The first {{was in the}} French Open semifinals, when Federer survived a five-set clash {{when he was on}} his way to the only French title of his career. The second was in the final of the US Open, where del Potro stunned five-time defending champion Federer in five sets, ending his 20-match winning streak at Grand Slams. Another high-profile match was in the semifinals of the 2012 London Olympics, where Federer prevailed 19–17 in the final set to secure the Olympic silver medal. They also met in the finals of the Swiss Indoors in 2012, 2013 and 2017, with del Potro prevailing on first two occasions, and Federer on last <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> tight three-set matches. In the 2017 U.S. Open quarterfinals, in a rematch of the 2009 US Open final, Del Potro again stunned Federer in four sets to end his unbeaten streak in grand slams that year. With this win, Del Potro also denied the first Federer-Nadal match at US Open, as in 2009 where he crushed Nadal in straight sets in the semifinals. Federer, however avenged this loss at the Shanghai Masters semifinals, where he beat del Potro in three sets after coming from a set down.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins on}} April 1, with Makoto {{awakening}} from a nightmare {{of a girl}} dying on April 6 with a bell in her hand. As the week goes on, he occasionally experiences premonitions of the future, all of which come true. Depending on the player's choices, Makoto ends up getting close {{to one of the}} girls, and on April 5, the story branches into different routes focusing on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> each route, the girl Makoto was close to dies on April 6 with a bell in her hand. Afterwards, Makoto finds that he has traveled back in time to April 1, retaining the memories of the previous six days. Concluding that he is trapped in an infinite loop, he vows to keep the girl alive and break free of the loop. He does so by rebuilding his relationships with her while dealing with the emotional problem troubling her. On April 6, the girl ends up in a situation similar to when she died in the last loop, but Makoto saves her, breaking free of the loop and becoming her boyfriend.|$|E
