50|$|Hundreds of {{millions}} of tonnes of wheat, corn, soybean, rice and <b>other</b> <b>grains</b> as <b>sorghum,</b> sunflower seeds, rapeseed/canola, barley, oats, etc., are dried in grain dryers. In the main agricultural countries, drying comprises the reduction of moisture from about 17-30%w/w to values between 8 and 15%w/w, depending on the grain. The final moisture content for drying must be adequate for storage. The more oil the grain has, the lower its storage moisture content will be (though its initial moisture for drying will also be lower). Cereals are often dried to 14% w/w, while oilseeds, to 12.5% (soybeans), 8% (sunflower) and 9% (peanuts). Drying is carried out as a requisite for safe storage, in order to inhibit microbial growth. However, low temperatures in storage are also highly recommended to avoid degradative reactions and, especially, the growth of insects and mites. A good maximum storage temperature is about 18 °C.|$|R
40|$|The black {{pericarp}} trait in <b>grain</b> <b>sorghum</b> [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] {{is a novel}} trait {{with complex}} inheritance. In addition to its uniform, dark appearance, black <b>sorghum</b> <b>grain</b> contains high levels of favorable phenolic compounds such as 3 -deoxyanthocyanidins (3 -DOA) and condensed tannins which have applications in the specialty food industry as high-antioxidant food additives, natural food colorants, or natural food preservatives. Previous studies have indicated the trait is not fully penetrant in all environmental conditions. Additionally, black sorghum has acceptable agronomic performance, but is significantly lower yielding than <b>other</b> elite <b>grain</b> <b>sorghum</b> hybrids. Further improvement of black sorghum is dependent on understanding the factors?both genetic and environmental?influencing the expression of this trait. The first of two studies investigated the effect of light shading on grain color and grain composition in black Tx 3362. Increased light shading reduced, and in some cases, eliminated the black color resulting in red grain production. In addition, increased shading reduced the concentration of 3 -deoxyanthocyanidins, total phenols, tannins, and fiber while increasing fat concentrations. Thus the black pericarp trait and associated high phenolic concentrations are strongly influenced by both intensity and duration of sunlight exposure. In the second study, a generation means analysis was performed to determine the genetic factors affecting the trait. This study concluded grain color and associated grain composition traits were influence by additive, dominance, and epistatic effects. The generation means analysis also determined the black pericarp trait is recessive, controlled by multiple genes, and is moderate to highly heritable. Despite these challenges, there is enough variation in breeding populations between red and black parents for further improvement of the trait. Creation of high yielding hybrids with uniformly dark grain {{and high levels of}} phenolic compounds will be possible through standard plant breeding practices...|$|R

In the first 2 years, maximum dry matter (DM) yields occurred at the late-dough stage of the <b>grain</b> <b>sorghum,</b> and interseeded silages had higher crude protein (CP) and acid detergent fiber contents than non-interseeded late-dough stage, <b>grain</b> <b>sorghum</b> control silages. In year 2, seeding <b>grain</b> <b>sorghum</b> {{and soybeans}} in alternating IS-inch rows increased DM yield, CP content, {{and the proportion of}} soybean plants in the mixture compared to drilled (6 -inch spacing) interseeding. Digestibilities of most nutrients were similar in all silages; however, cattle fed control silage consumed the most DM in year 1, but not in year 2. In both years, calves fed the control silages had faster gains than those fed drilled sorghum-soybean silages. Adding grain improved gain and intake only for calves fed the interseeded silage in year 1. In year 3, seeding <b>grain</b> <b>sorghum</b> and Williams 82 soybeans in alternating rows did not increase DM yield over the drilled interseeding. However, the drilled mixture had a much higher proportion of soybean plants compared to the first two years. All mixtures had higher CP content than control <b>grain</b> <b>sorghum...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Grain</b> <b>sorghum</b> (Sorghum bicolor L.) {{has become}} a popular {{rotation}} crop in the Great Plains. The transition from conventional tillage to no-tillage production systems {{has led to an}} increase in the need for crop rotations. Some of the soils of the Great Plains are acidic, and there is concern that <b>grain</b> <b>sorghum</b> production may be limited when grown on acidic soils. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of soil pH for <b>grain</b> <b>sorghum</b> production. Potassium chloride-exchangeable aluminum was also analyzed to determine <b>grain</b> <b>sorghum’s</b> sensitivity to soil aluminum (Al) concentration. The relationship between relative yield and soil pH was investigated at Lahoma, Perkins, and Haskell, Oklahoma, USA with soil pH treatments ranging from 4. 0 – 7. 0. Soil pH was altered using aluminum sulfate or hydrated lime. Soil acidity reduced <b>grain</b> <b>sorghum</b> yield, resulting in a 10 % reduction in yield at soil pH 5. 42. Potassium chloride-exchangeable aluminum levels above 18 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 resulted in yield reductions of 10 % or greater. Liming should be considered to increase soil pH if it is below these critical levels where <b>grain</b> <b>sorghum</b> will be produced...|$|R
