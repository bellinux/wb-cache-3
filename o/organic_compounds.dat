5|$|IUPAC {{committee}} {{has a long}} history of officially naming organic and inorganic compounds. IUPAC nomenclature is developed so that any compound can be named under one set of standardized rules to avoid duplicate names. The first publication, which is information from the International Congress of Applied Chemistry, on IUPAC nomenclature of <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> can be found from the early 20th century in A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of <b>Organic</b> <b>Compounds</b> (1900).|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{increasing}} the hydrogen:carbon ratio of an <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> is disclosed. The <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> can be one having {{any of the following}} functions: hydroxyl, carbonyl, epoxide, acetal, ketal, hemiacetal and hemiketal. The method involves introducing the <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> and a silicon hydride into a liquid which is either chemically inert or acidic and introducing BF 3 into the liquid to produce a reaction product having a higher hydrogen:carbon ratio than the starting <b>organic</b> <b>compound.</b> Examples of <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> starting materials disclosed include undecanal, benzaldehyde, p-methylbenzaldehyde, p-chlorobenzaldehyde, p-methoxybenzaldehyde, p-cyanobenzaldehyde, p-nitrobenzaldehyde, 2 -undecanone, cyclohexanone, 2 -methylcyclohexanone, adamantanone, p-cyanoacetophenone, fluorenone, 1 -naphthaldehyde, p-nitroacetophenone, fructose and cotton. The use, as the silicon hydride, of triethylsilane, (R) -(+) - 1 -naphthylphenylmethylsilane, dimethylethylsilane, phenylneopentylmethylsilane, and of tri-n-hexylsilane is disclosed, while methylene chloride is disclosed as the liquid in which the reaction is conducted...|$|R

5|$|The {{energy in}} {{sunlight}} is captured by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and some protists. This process is often coupled to {{the conversion of}} carbon dioxide into <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight {{as a source of}} energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of <b>organic</b> <b>compounds.</b>|$|E

5|$|Quantitatively, of all {{elemental}} chlorine produced, about 63% {{is used in}} the manufacture of <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> and 18% in the manufacture of inorganic chlorine compounds. About 15,000 chlorine compounds are used commercially. The remaining 19% of chlorine produced is used for bleaches and disinfection products. The most significant of <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in terms of production volume are 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, intermediates in the production of PVC. Other particularly important organochlorines are methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, vinylidene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, and trichlorobenzenes. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, Cl2O, HOCl, NaClO3, chlorinated isocyanurates, AlCl3, SiCl4, SnCl4, PCl3, PCl5, POCl3, AsCl3, SbCl3, SbCl5, BiCl3, S2Cl2, SCl2, SOCI2, ClF3, ICl, ICl3, TiCl3, TiCl4, MoCl5, FeCl3, ZnCl2, and so on.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{surfaces}} of cometary nuclei {{have a very}} low albedo, making them among the least reflective objects found in the Solar System. The Giotto space probe found that the nucleus of Halley's Comet reflects about four percent of the light that falls on it, and Deep Space 1 discovered that Comet Borrelly's surface reflects less than 3.0% of the light that falls on it; by comparison, asphalt reflects seven percent. The dark surface material of the nucleus may consist of complex <b>organic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Solar heating drives off lighter volatile compounds, leaving behind larger <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> that {{tend to be very}} dark, like tar or crude oil. The low reflectivity of cometary surfaces causes them to absorb the heat that drives their outgassing processes.|$|E
5|$|All of Neptune's inner moons {{are dark}} objects: their {{geometric}} albedo ranges from 7 to 10%. Their spectra {{indicate that they}} are made from water ice contaminated by some very dark material, probably complex <b>organic</b> <b>compounds.</b> In this respect, the inner Neptunian moons {{are similar to the}} inner Uranian moons.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{can form}} very long chains of {{interconnecting}} carbonâ€“carbon bonds, a property {{that is called}} catenation. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong and stable. Through catenation, carbon forms a countless number of compounds. A tally of unique compounds shows that more contain carbon that those that do not. A similar claim {{can be made for}} hydrogen because most <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> also contain hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{acetic acid}} is an {{excellent}} polar protic solvent, as noted above. It is frequently used as a solvent for recrystallization to purify <b>organic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Acetic acid {{is used as a}} solvent in the production of terephthalic acid (TPA), the raw material for polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In 2006, about 20% of acetic acid was used for TPA production.|$|E
5|$|If possible, {{the use of}} {{wood and}} {{cellulose}} derivatives should be avoided entirely. Many varnishes and paints are well known emitters of volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> (VOCs), {{some of which may}} be acidic, and thus have the potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these coatings should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.|$|E

5|$|In plants, {{nitrogen}} {{is first}} assimilated into <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> {{in the form}} of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses transaminases to move the amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, the Leblanc {{process was}} {{effectively}} {{replaced by the}} Solvay process without a hydrochloric acid by-product. Since hydrochloric acid was already fully settled as an important chemical in numerous applications, the commercial interest initiated other production methods, {{some of which are}} still used today. After the year 2000, hydrochloric acid is mostly made by absorbing by-product hydrogen chloride from industrial <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> production.|$|E
5|$|Inorganic {{elements}} play critical {{roles in}} metabolism; some are abundant (e.g. sodium and potassium) while others function at minute concentrations. About 99% of a mammal's mass {{is made up}} of the elements carbon, nitrogen, calcium, sodium, chlorine, potassium, hydrogen, phosphorus, oxygen and sulfur. <b>Organic</b> <b>compounds</b> (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen; most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.|$|E
