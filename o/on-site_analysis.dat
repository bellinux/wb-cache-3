In addition to Alpha Group, Gen.

The stated mission objectives could have been reached in no more than half-an-hour, but it would have come at a terrible human cost. Shortly after their assessment was made, Gen.

40|$|Paraquat (N,N′-dimethyl- 4, 4 ′-bipyridinium dichloride) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{herbicides}} owing to its high efficacy and low environmental persistence. However, because paraquat has significant acute toxicity, fatalities are often caused by accidental or voluntary ingestion of paraquat. In consideration of the strong toxicity and fast-Acting property of paraquat, <b>on-site</b> <b>analysis</b> at accident scenes should be effective in facilitating immediate medical treatment. In this study, a simple and rapid chemiluminescence assay using a portable luminometer was developed for <b>on-site</b> <b>analysis</b> of paraquat. The proposed assay is based on luminol chemiluminescence detection of superoxide anion radical resulting from the redox reaction between paraquat and dithiothreitol. Intense chemiluminescence was observed after mixing of paraquat and dithiothreitol in the presence of luminol. Because the chemiluminescence intensity was proportional to the concentration of paraquat, a quantitative measurement of paraquat was possible. The calibration curve for standard paraquat solution was linear from 0. 025 to 2. 5 μM with the correlation coefficient of 0. 992; the detection limit (blank + 3 SD) was 22 nM. The proposed assay was applied to determine paraquat in beverage samples after a cation exchange clean-up procedure. Given that the portable luminometer used in this study is small and lightweight, the proposed assay should be useful for <b>on-site</b> <b>analysis</b> of paraquat...|$|E

40|$|Background: Rapid on-site {{evaluation}} {{has been}} proposed as a method to improve the yield of transbronchial needle aspiration. Objectives: This study investigated whether <b>on-site</b> <b>analysis</b> facilitates routine diagnostic bronchoscopy in terms of sampling, yield and cost. Methods: Patients with lesions accessible for transbronchial needle aspiration on computed tomography were investigated. A cytopathologist screened the needle aspirates on site {{for the presence of}} diagnostic material. The bronchoscopic sampling process was adjusted according to the results. In 90 consecutive patients with neoplastic disease (n = 70; 78 %), non-neoplastic disease (n = 16; 18 %) or undiagnosed lesions (n = 4; 4 %) we aspirated 162 lung tumours or lymph node sites (mediastinal: 7 %; tracheobronchial: 68 %; other: 25 %). In 90 consecutive patients with neoplastic disease (n = 70; 78 %), non-neoplastic disease (n = 16; 18 %) or undiagnosed lesions (n = 4; 4 %) we aspirated 162 lung lesions (paratracheal tumours or lymph nodes: 7 %; tracheobronchial lymph nodes: 68 %; other: 25 %). Results: The diagnostic yield of needle aspiration was 77 and 25 % in patients with neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions, respectively. Sampling could be terminated in 64 % of patients after needle aspiration had been performed as the only diag-nostic modality, and <b>on-site</b> <b>analysis</b> identified diagnostic material from the first site aspirated in 50 % of patients. Only in 2 patients (2 %) diagnostic aspirates were not recognized on site. <b>On-site</b> <b>analysis</b> was cost effective due to savings for disposable diagnostic tools, which exceeded the extra expense for the on-site cytology service provided. Conclusions: Rapid <b>on-site</b> <b>analysis</b> of transbronchial aspirates is a highly useful, accurate and cost-effective addition to routine diagnostic bronchoscopy. Copyright © 2005 S.

40|$|In recent years, <b>on-site</b> <b>analysis</b> has {{garnered}} {{increased interest}} from the scientific community. The development of smaller, more sophisticated analytical instruments, {{and the establishment}} of new environmental regulations have encouraged the application of new methodologies for field analysis. Prominent advantages of <b>on-site</b> <b>analysis</b> include elimination of error sources due to sample transportation and matrix modification, considerable reduction in analysis time, and more accurate and precise analytical results. Several techniques suitable for <b>on-site</b> <b>analysis,</b> which integrate sampling and sample preparation in one step, have demonstrated high versatility and throughput in field applications. This research was focused on the application and evaluation of three microextraction techniques: solid phase microextraction (SPME), needle trap devices (NTD) and membrane extraction with sorbent interface (MESI), which were then coupled with various portable instruments for <b>on-site</b> <b>analysis</b> of different systems. Additionally, the conducted project involved the development of an approach using ion mobility spectrometry detection (IMS) coupled with a miniaturized gas chromatograph (GC) as a powerful system for field analysis. This proposed GC-IMS exhibited satisfactory performance in terms of retention time (inter-day variation < 3 %) and response stability (intra and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) < 10 %). Moreover, when coupled with NTD, it showed limits of detection comparable to those provided by conventional benchtop instruments. Other portable GC instruments employed in this project included flame ionization and mass spectrometry detection. Three different sample systems were investigated using SPME and NTD together with these portable instruments: emissions of a pine branch, breath samples, and indoor pollutants in a polymer synthesis laboratory. Consequently, the feasibility of using SPME and NTD for determination of free and total concentrations was investigated. Finally, MESI was successfully coupled with the newly proposed GC-IMS system, and its functionality was evaluated by analyzing acetone in breath samples...|$|E

40|$|Background—Complete {{bidirectional}} isthmus conduction block (CBIB) {{was initially}} assessed by sequential detailed activation mapping at {{both sides of}} the ablation line during proximal coronary sinus and anteroinferior right atrium pacing. Mapping only the ablation line (“on-site ” atrial potential analysis) was recently reported as a means of CBIB identification. The study was designed to compare these 2 techniques prospectively regarding the diagnosis of CBIB. Methods and Results—In 76 consecutive patients (mean age, 63. 4610. 5 years), typical atrial flutter ablation was performed using either the activation mapping technique (group I) or <b>on-site</b> atrial potential <b>analysis</b> (group II). Criteria for CBIB using <b>on-site</b> atrial potential <b>analysis</b> was the recording of parallel, widely spaced double atrial potentials along the ablation line. The CBIB criterion was retrospectively searched using the alternative technique {{at the end of the}} procedure. In successful patients, the mean radiofrequency delivery duration was longer in group II (8456776 versus 5346363 s; P 50. 03). On-site, clear-cut, widely spaced double atrial potentials and activation mapping suggesting CBIB were concomitantly observed in only 47 patients (54 %), and ambiguous/atypical double potentials were recorded in 31 patients (39 %). Conclusions—Although feasible, the <b>on-site</b> atrial potential <b>analysis</b> seemed to be inferior to the classic activation mapping technique, mainly because of the ambiguity of electrogram interpretation along the ablation line. However, when combined with the activation mapping technique, it provided additional information regarding isthmus conductio...|$|R
