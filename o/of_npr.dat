Steps were taken during the 1980s to completely wean NPR from government support, but the 1983 funding crisis forced the network to make immediate changes. According to CPB, in 2009 11.3% of the aggregate revenues of all public radio broadcasting stations were funded from federal sources, principally through CPB; in 2012 10.9% of the revenues for Public Radio came from federal sources.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, NPR {{revenues}} totaled $180 million, {{with the}} bulk of revenues coming from programming fees, grants from foundations or business entities, contributions and sponsorships. According to the 2009 financial statement, about 50% <b>of</b> <b>NPR</b> revenues come from the fees it charges member stations for programming and distribution charges. Typically, NPR member stations receive funds through on-air pledge drives, corporate underwriting, {{state and local government}}s, educational institutions, and the federally funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). In 2009, member stations derived 6% of their revenue from federal, state and local government funding, 10% of their revenue from CPB grants, and 14% of their revenue from universities. While NPR does not receive any direct federal funding, it does receive a small number of competitive grants from CPB and federal agencies like the Department of Education and the Department of Commerce. This funding amounts to approximately 2% of NPR's overall revenues.|$|E
25|$|In early September 1950, Yoshida {{nominated}} Hayashi to {{head the}} NPR {{with support from the}} Emperor, who not only had confidence in Hayashi, but also appreciated his performance as Vice-Minister of Imperial Household. This time the nomination of Hayashi was opposed by Willoughby and his intelligence staff, which was responsible for recruitment matters <b>of</b> <b>NPR.</b> They not only favored Hattori and other prewar Japanese army officers, but also even tried to prevent Hayashi from getting appointed. Nevertheless, their views were not shared by other parties within the GHQ. In particular, both Brigadier-General Courtney Whitney, Chief of the Government Section (GS), which was responsible for the NPR's personnel matters, and Major-General Whitfield P. Shepard, Chief of the Civil Affairs Section Annex (CASA), which was responsible for the development and training of the NPR, favored Hayashi. G-3 Division of the GHQ, which dealt with military operations, law enforcement and repatriation, also showed their support to Hayashi. Because of Willoughby's opposition, the nomination of Hayashi dragged on for a month and it took a few more weeks before the nomination was approved only after the intervention of MacArthur and Yoshida.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thompson <b>of</b> <b>NPR</b> Music {{called the}} song [...] "one of the decade's finest pop anthems" [...] which is infused with energy, {{charisma}} and full-throated intensity.

Gary Trust of Billboard thought that [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] is a defining song of the 2000s. He commented on its status as a blueprint for female pop songs, as seen in song productions by artists such as Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry and Pink. In 2014, Ryan Kailath <b>of</b> <b>NPR</b> Music argued that the song succeeded by borrowing from musical trends that preceded it, such as 1990s R and alternative rock. In 2015, Gary Trust of Billboard wrote that [...] "Kelly Clarkson's [...] "Since U Been Gone," [...] co-written by Max Martin, especially helped lead to pure pop's reemergence, and the breakthroughs of Rihanna, Katy Perry, [...] Swift and Lady Gaga would soon follow (as well as [...] Spears' own revival)", stating that the song [...] "began to erode hip-hop's early '00s reign, with women at the forefront of turning the tide".|$|E
