Reference [7] puts forward evaluation method of renewable energy accommodation capacity based on time series production simulation from annual time level, establishes mixed integer programming model, and develops relevant simulation software on this basis. The accuracy of this method is verified by relevant simulation software by CEPRI. Reference [8] also studies and establishes a simulation model of sequential production including wind and PV generation from annual time level. The model is solved by branch-and-bound method, which takes into account characteristics of renewable energy output, load and heating units, and has certain practical value. In reference [9], objective function of wind power accommodation assessment is modeled by wind power accommodation interval, and the upper and lower bounds of wind power accommodation are given considering stability constraints, unit output constraints and wind power output prediction in complex power network. Time series production simulation methods always are applied to annual accommodation capacity assessment of provincial power grid, which mainly corresponds to long-term application of power grid planning, and the application of power grid <b>operation</b> <b>angle</b> is relatively limited.|$|E

40|$|Volume {{holographic}} correlators {{offer the}} ability to encode and compare thousands of templates in one <b>operation.</b> <b>Angle</b> multiplexing of each individual template means {{the position of the}} correlation spot in the output plane corresponds to the matching template. To be useful as a correlator the shift invariance must be restored by scanning the input image. This can be achieved by implementing the input signal modulation on a high speed SLM such as a MQW or DLP that is capable speeds in excess of 30 kHz. The output correlation peak is read out using a high-speed linear CCD camera. The Bragg angle affects the number of templates that can be held on the hologram. However, this is not the same in both directions and this changes the correlator's shift invariance ability in different scan directions. In this paper we investigate this and how it affects the correlator's performance. This arrangement allows thousands of templates to be searched at video rate. The scanning nature allows space domain correlation to be implemented. The system we describe offers {{the ability to}} pre-filter the signal. We report on the results of a MACH filter implemented in a volume holographic correlator.
