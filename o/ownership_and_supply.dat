The results show that, on average, duopoly stations aired significantly less local news programming than their same market non-duopoly counterparts. Duopoly stations significantly increased their local news programming from 1997 to 2003, but so did non-duopoly stations. Also, the increases were contributed by the major stations in the markets. Minor stations did not show any increase in local news programming.

Using travel diary data for the US and Great Britain, we estimate models of car <b>ownership</b> <b>and</b> daily travel distance. Both a structural model with daily travel conditional upon car <b>ownership</b> <b>and</b> a reduced form model for daily travel, excluding car ownership, are estimated. Model results are similar, and show that differences in travel are explained by (1) differences in demographics between the two countries; (2) lower household income in Great Britain; (3) country specific differences in costs of car <b>ownership</b> <b>and</b> use, transport <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> other factors {{we have not been}} able to control. We find that metropolitan size affects travel only in the largest metropolitan areas of the US. Daily travel distance is inversely related to local population density, but the effect is much stronger for the US than Great Britain. We conclude that higher transport costs in Great Britain promote economizing behavior, which in turns leads to more consumption of local goods and services and more use of alternative transport modes. ...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, four {{different}} articles address {{the correlation between}} vertical integration and profitability in the Norwegian fish processing industry. By vertical integration we mean the <b>ownership</b> <b>and</b> control of one firm over different stages in the value chain. Firms within this industry consider the uncertain supply of fish as a main challenge. Literature prescribes vertical integration as an organisational form that can enable industries to overcome uncertainties in raw material <b>supply,</b> <b>and,</b> hence, increase profitability. Therefore, upstream vertical integration, i. e. <b>ownership</b> in – <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> from own – fishing vessels or fish farms, is expected to influence profitability positively in this industry. Detailed firm and industry data, from the period 1977 – 2002, reveals a great diversity of firms, with varying profitability. Also, their organisation towards the fishing fleet varies. A central conclusion from this work is that no clear correlation can be revealed between the profitability of firms and their degree of upstream vertical integration toward their raw material source. The study also demonstrate {{that the key to}} success in this industry seem to be connected to the resources firms possess, which enables them {{to make the most of}} the advantages – and minimise the disadvantages – of their choice of strategy. While successful integrated firms utilise a continuous production and reduced transaction costs, firms without <b>ownership</b> in – <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> from – fishing vessels have to develop alternative relations towards the fishing fleet, and exploit the advantages from a flexible production to succeed. A central part of the thesis has concentrated on developing adequate measures for evaluating the degree of vertical integration in firms in this industry – related to prior research and methodologies. Analyses show that in this particular industry, there exist effective and profitable alternatives which firms can utilise in order to handle the inherent uncertainty in the raw material markets...|$|R

The Japanese paper and paperboard industry has grown {{to be one of}} the largest in the world. It manufactures a range of products for sale primarily within Japan, and consumes organic fibre for these products from dispersed domestic and foreign forests, plantations and cities. This dissertation examines the links between the development and structure of the industry and its use of papermaking fibre. It takes a political ecology perspective and uses an industrial structure/consumption-production chain approach to show how the industry’s development and structure continue to depend on company control over fibre flows and the restructuring of products, product distribution and manufacture, the fibre <b>supply</b> chain <b>and</b> fibre resources. As with the modern global paper/board industry, the recent growth of the Japanese industry has been characterised by cycles of capacity expansion, market collapse, excess capacity and low prices and profits. Manufacturers and general trading companies involved in the industry have tried to support growth in the use of paper/board and counter these cycles by restructuring production, distribution, <b>ownership</b> <b>and</b> fibre <b>supply.</b> This restructuring helps protect the flow of fibre through the industry and concentrated it in particular companies. Obtaining increasing quantities of suitably-priced fibre has been at the base of the industry’s development. Open Acces...|$|R

This paper {{provides}} supply professionals {{an overview}} of intellectual property rights <b>and</b> <b>ownership</b> issues {{to watch out for}} in the procurement of goods and services. Some of the issues involve proprietary or customer specified software, business methods, or components. Appropriate contract language should be considered when dealing with these issues. The Opportunity. As more and more suppliers increase their holdings of intellectual property assets, spurred along by global financial markets which continue to place increasing value on such IP assets, supply professionals are increasingly faced with goods and service providers that are keenly aware of their own IP rights and the requirements for ownership of IP assets. The four major types of IP include: 1) patents, 2) trademarks, 3) trade secrets, and 4) copyrights. Each type of IP has its own nuances and peculiarities with respect to rights <b>and</b> <b>ownership</b> issues. <b>Supply</b> professionals familiar with the major types of intellectual property will be better equipped to identify potential IP rights <b>and</b> <b>ownership</b> issues earlier in <b>supply</b> negotiations <b>and,</b> consequently, stand a better chance of avoiding {{at least some of the}} perils and pitfalls of IP rights <b>and</b> <b>ownership</b> involved in the procurement of goods and services.

40|$|This paper briefly narrates the {{historical}} and present challenges facing sheep herders in the Kyrgyz Republic. Originally these were nomads employing an horizontal and vertical migration system, but Russian conquest and settlement forced this to change {{to a system of}} transhumance. The latter, albeit structured in a collective system, was more or less maintained throughout the communist period. Other major changes during this period included the shift from fat tail meat sheep to fine wool sheep and the increasing dependence on imported feed. Independence since 1991 has caused drastic changes in resource <b>ownership,</b> organisation <b>and</b> feed <b>supply.</b> These changes have led to a fragmentation of sheep <b>ownership</b> <b>and</b> a 50 % decline in sheep numbers. Although land reform in the Kyrgyz Republic is ongoing, the situation regarding rangeland is still rather confused. Many of the high mountain pastures are State owned, but logistical problems, together with the contraction of the national flock, have caused them to become decreasingly well used. This has led to the over-utilisation of lowland pastures, which has been aggravated by shortages in feed supplements (imports of which were halted after the break-up of the Soviet Union). Producer prices are low, and can be linked to the remote location of producers, a lack of local purchasing power and the low quality of wool produced. It is not yet clear whether the sheep production system will continue to produce fine wool in the future, or whether it will revert to the meat/coarse wool production system seen commonly throughout the Near East...|$|R

40|$|Today, policy {{analysts and}} {{regulatory}} governance scholars are sceptical about {{the capacity of}} the regulatory state hypothesis to describe change at the institutional level. For many, the hypothesis is a convenient oversimplification that fails to account for the hybridity of institutional arrangements within individual policy sectors and also for the divergence of reform trajectories across different national and sector-based policy contexts. This article assesses the influence of the key themes of the regulatory state on the UK Labour government's reregulation of National Health Service (NHS) commissioning organizations. Following the critics, it argues that these themes are only partially evident in the programme. While the government has codified previously informal relationships with policies like Patient Choice and has also subjected commissioning organizations to metaregulatory techniques, its reforms have neither displaced public <b>ownership</b> <b>and</b> the direct <b>supply</b> of commissioning services with markets and new mechanisms for rule making and standard setting, nor have the reforms divided labour within the state by creating an independent agency to regulate NHS commissioning organizations via technocratic means. Under the reforms, NHS commissioning continues to take place within a structure of bureaucratic relationships. However, the article suggests that the hybridity of regulatory techniques at work within the UK Labour government's reregulation of NHS commissioning lends weight to the claim that the current era is one of regulatory capitalism. It concludes with a discussion of the consequences of this finding for the public policy and regulatory governance literatures...|$|R

40|$|Two {{phenomena}} {{characterized the}} housing market in the 1970 s: a somewhat-disguised surge toward home <b>ownership</b> <b>and</b> a well-publicized sharp increase in the real price of housing. These movements were partially reversed {{in the first half}} of the 1980 s. In the "standard view", the 1970 s changes are attributed to an interaction of the tax system and rising inflation. Given the disinflation of the 1980 s, this explanation also seems consistent with the reversals in <b>ownership</b> <b>and</b> real prices. Recent work challenges the standard view.
