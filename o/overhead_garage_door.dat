50|$|Based on {{the warm}} {{reception}} the concept vehicle received, the Pontiac Trans Sport was approved for production in 1987. However, {{as is often}} the case, the styling and features showcased on the concept did not make the translation to the mass-produced edition. The gullwing door was deemed too expensive to produce and would probably have hit <b>overhead</b> <b>garage</b> <b>doors</b> in suburban <b>garages.</b> The glass roof was too heavy and too expensive, so the resultant production vehicle made-do with high-gloss black painted panels for the roof to suggest the glass canopy the concept sported.|$|R
50|$|The {{wings are}} four bays long and one bay wide under hipped slate-covered roofs. The south wing is an {{inspection}} shed for vehicles, and {{that on the}} north is a garage for government vehicles.

The remainder of these elevations, though clad with the same granite and matching limestone, are much simpler in appearance and are devoid of the decorative carved details. Window openings contain either single or paired casement sash with corresponding transoms. Several door and window openings have been infilled with metal louvers of limestone blocks. The main feature of the east elevation is the raised loading dock platform with its projecting canopy.

50|$|The {{highlight}} of offseason construction at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was {{the construction of}} a new, state of the art garage area. Just days after the 1985 race, the old Gasoline Alley garage area, most of which had stood since the 1940s, was dismantled and demolished. Official groundbreaking for the new facility occurred on August 26, 1985. The new concrete garages increased to 96 units (up from 88), and each stall provided approximately 30% more working room than their predecessors. The green and white barn doors were replaced with <b>overhead</b> <b>garage</b> <b>doors,</b> and the layout was changed from east-west to north-south. The access lanes were widened substantially, improving ingress and egress, and various vendor and support units were also part of the complex. Most of the work was completed in April, however, some of the finishing touches were still being completed {{during the first week of}} on-track activity.|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{version of}} an <b>overhead</b> <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> {{used in the past}} would have been built as a {{one-piece}} panel. The panel was mounted on each side with unequal parallelogram style hinge lifting mechanism. Newer versions of overhead garage doors are now generally built from several panels hinged together that roll along a system of tracks guided by rollers. The weight of the door may be 400 lb or more, but is balanced by either a torsion spring system or a pair of extension springs. A remote controlled motorized mechanism for opening garage doors adds convenience, safety, and security.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{warehouses}} on {{the east}} side of the building, near the southeast corner of the main building. The more southerly, and older, is a one-story brick rectangular front-gabled structure with a full-length brick addition on the side, just southeast of the main building's east wing. The main entrance on the north side is an <b>overhead</b> <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> with a normal one next to it. To their east are three oversized glass block windows. A former window in the gable peak has been bricked in. Inside the building is open, with an timber floor and exposed wooden trusses.|$|E
50|$|The {{hexagonal}} barn {{is located}} in the village of Newport, on a property at the northeast corner of Spring and Railroad Streets. Set near the street corner is a 1-1/2 story Cape style house with modest Greek Revival styling. Extending eastward, parallelling Railroad Street is a single-story ell, which joins the house to the barn. The barn is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hexagonal roof topped by a louvered six-sided cupola, and clapboard siding. Each of its six sides is of roughly equal length, and there are two windows, one set in the southwest wall on the second floor, and one set in the northeast wall on the northeast wall. There are four doors, two each on the eastern and northern sides, one on each level. The northern ground floor entrance was originally a typical two-leaf hinged door, but has been replaced by an <b>overhead</b> <b>garage</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
50|$|The east {{elevation}} {{contains the}} building's vehicular and service entrances. The <b>overhead</b> <b>garage</b> <b>doors</b> are sheltered under a wide projecting metal canopy which stretches {{the length of}} the elevation. The next two floor levels are clad with smooth limestone and contain long horizontal bands of windows. At the fourth floor level, the elevation changes character. The southern half, the 16-story tower, consists of a projecting glass and steel curtain wall that appears to be supported by projecting metal brackets. The curtain wall is divided horizontally by the same projecting fins at the floor plates and intermediate window mullions. The curtain wall is divided vertically by a central recessed channel. A bracketed vertical metal fin, rising from the 4th through the 15th floors, accentuates this channel. The 16th-floor level is set back from the plane of the elevation, creating another open-air rooftop terrace covered by an open canopy which is an extension of the building's vaulted metal roof.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Garage</b> <b>door</b> openers {{manufactured}} {{and installed}} in the United States since 1982 are required to provide a quick-release mechanism on the trolley that allows for the <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> to be disconnected from the <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opener {{in the event of}} entrapment.

50|$|Mechanical <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> openers {{can pull}} or push a <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> with enough force to injure or kill people and pets {{if they become}} trapped. All modern openers are {{equipped}} with “force settings” that make the door reverse if it encounters too much resistance while closing or opening. Any <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opener sold in the United States after 1992 requires safety eyes—sensors that prevent the door from closing if obstructed. Force settings should cause a door to stop or reverse on encountering more than approximately 20 lbs (9.07 kg) of resistance. Safety eyes should be installed a maximum of six inches above the ground. Many <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> injuries, and nearly all <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> related property damage, can be avoided by following these precautions.|$|R

50|$|A <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> {{is a large}} <b>door</b> on a <b>garage</b> {{that opens}} either {{manually}} or by an electric motor (a <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opener). <b>Garage</b> <b>doors</b> are frequently {{large enough to accommodate}} automobiles and other vehicles. Small <b>garage</b> <b>doors</b> may be made in a single panel that tilts up and back across the <b>garage</b> ceiling. Larger <b>doors</b> are usually made in several jointed panels that roll up on tracks across the garage ceiling, or into a roll above the doorway. The operating mechanism is spring-loaded or counterbalanced to offset the weight of the door and reduce human or motor effort required to operate the door. Less commonly, some <b>garage</b> <b>doors</b> slide or swing horizontally. Doors are made of wood, metal, or fiberglass, and may be insulated to prevent heat loss. Warehouses, bus garages and locomotive sheds have larger versions.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opener remote {{controls}} were simple {{and consisted of}} a simple transmitter (the remote) and receiver which controlled the opener mechanism. The transmitter would transmit on a designated frequency; the receiver would listen for the radio signal, then open or close the garage, depending on the door position. The basic concept {{of this can be}} traced back to World War II. This type of system was used to detonate remote bombs. While novel at the time, the technology ran its course when <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> openers became widely available and used. Then, not only did a person open their <b>garage</b> <b>door,</b> they opened their neighbor’s <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> as well. While the <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> remote is low in power and in range, it was powerful enough to interfere with other receivers in the area.|$|R
50|$|A <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opener is a {{motorized}} device that opens and closes <b>garage</b> <b>doors.</b> Most {{are controlled by}} switches on the garage wall, {{as well as by}} remote controls carried by the owner.|$|R
50|$|The typical {{electric}} <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opener {{consists of}} a power unit that contains the electric motor. The power unit attaches to a track. A trolley connected to an arm that attaches {{to the top of}} the <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> slides back and forth on the track, thus opening and closing the <b>garage</b> <b>door.</b> The trolley is pulled along the track by a chain, belt, or screw that turns when the motor is operated. A quick-release mechanism is attached to the trolley to allow the <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> to be disconnected from the opener for manual operation during a power failure or in case of emergency. Limit switches on the power unit control the distance the <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opens and closes once the motor receives a signal from the remote control or wall push button to operate the door.|$|R
50|$|<b>Garage</b> <b>doors</b> can be {{made out}} of many materials, but steel, aluminum, wood, copper, glass, and vinyl (polyethylene) {{are the most popular}} materials.
