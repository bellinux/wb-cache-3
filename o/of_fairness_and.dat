Although the discovery of coal did not cause boom cycles as did the precious metals, the early coal mining industry also established the conditions for violent confrontations between miners and mine owners. The usual issues were wages, hours, and working conditions, but miners were also concerned about issues <b>of</b> <b>fairness,</b> <b>and</b> company control over their personal lives.|$|E

25|$|While {{human rights}} groups and various {{political}} entities initially supported {{the establishment of the}} tribunal, they have since criticised it on issues <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> transparency, as well as reported harassment of lawyers and witnesses representing the accused. Jamaat-e-Islami supporters and their student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir, called a general strike nationwide on 4 December 2012, in proteat against the tribunal which erupted in nation-wide violence. They demanded that the tribunal be scrapped permanently and their leaders be released immediately.|$|E
25|$|Legal systems {{more or less}} try {{to uphold}} the notions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> justice. If a state is going to penalize a person or require that person pay {{compensation}} to another for losses incurred, liability is imposed according {{to the idea that}} those who injure others should take responsibility for their actions. Although some parts of any legal system will have qualities of strict liability, in which the mens rea is immaterial to the result and subsequent liability of the actor, most look to establish liability by showing that the defendant was the cause of the particular injury or loss.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} rank farming is an {{alternative}} route some players choose to use in order to accelerate the ranking process to faster access equipment and rank promotion buffs within the Ettenmoors that have a minimum rank requirement, though {{it is no longer}} allowed and considered an abuse of game mechanics. This concept is not unique to LOTRO and is seen in other games of the same genre. Most of this activity in LOTRO is achieved through the use of multiboxing with several copies of the game client run to utilise a multitude of reaver monster play characters. The reaver class went free-to-play early 2012 and has since most often been used in this type of play. Rank farming has had notable impact upon the PvP gaming community. An official statement released on August 28, 2013 by Turbine customer service has made rank farming a bannable offense. While the issue <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> sportsmanship has been raised for this style of play, Turbine has officially supported the multiboxing community in its official statements to date.|$|E

25|$|Administrative law is {{the area}} of law {{concerning}} the control of powers exercised by the government. It functions to regulate decision-making processes by public authorities with regard to maintaining basic standards <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> legality. Administrative law in Singapore originates from and shares many similarities with administrative law in the United Kingdom. In general, claims for judicial review in administrative law fall under three broad categories– illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. Instances of illegality fall under two main headings: whether the authority was empowered {{to make the decision}} in question, and whether it properly exercised its discretion to make that decision. Grounds for illegality under the first heading include simple ultra vires, and errors as to precedent facts. The second heading includes grounds of judicial review such as making decisions on the basis of insufficient evidence or errors of material fact, failing to take into account relevant considerations and taking into account irrelevant ones, making decisions for improper purposes, fettering of discretion, and failing to fulfil legitimate expectations.|$|E
500|$|However, evincing a thicker {{conception}} {{of the rule of}} law, he added that most people accepted two additional elements [...] "as being part of how a modern civilised society should be structured", though he felt it was [...] "debatable whether {{they are part of a}} strict definition of Rule of Law".

500|$|Black, however, {{believed}} that this interpretation of the due process clause was unjustifiably broad.

[...] Instead, Black advocated a much narrower interpretation of the clause. In his dissent to In re Winship, he analyzed the history of the term [...] "due process of law", and concluded: [...] "For me, the only correct meaning of that phrase is that our Government must proceed according to the 'law of the land'—that is, according to written constitutional and statutory provisions as interpreted by court decisions." ...|$|E

The church {{purchased}} the manuscript when the book appeared, and there were rumors that the plates had been destroyed. In June 1920 it also purchased some of McClure's research files from a New York manuscript dealer, including notes from Milmine and drafts of the book handwritten by Cather. Christian Scientists {{were reported to have}} bought and destroyed copies of the book, and removed them from libraries. Sergeant wrote in 1953 that the book [...] "disappeared almost immediately from circulation—the Christian Scientists are said to have bought the copies". It had become scarce even in libraries. According to Sergeant, readers in the 1950s were likely to have to borrow it from the chief librarian and be watched while reading it. The book's copyright expired 28 years after publication. Baker Book House, a Christian publishing house, republished it in 1971 [...] "in the interest <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> objectivity", according to its back cover.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Marcus in Minders of Make-Believe: Idealists, Entrepreneurs, and the Shaping of American Children's Literature, says [...] "Tunis's {{books were}} never only about sports", noting [...] "the author's {{determination}} {{to offer his}} readers basic lessons about good citizenship and fair play, {{and a chance to}} reflect on such rarely discussed social issues as racial equality and anti-Semitism". A doctoral study at Oklahoma State University in 1996 analyzed all of Tunis' juvenile sports books. The predominant value found both in the books and their main characters was Courtesy/Fairness/Respect. The second most identified value was Compassion/Kindness. The study found that [...] "the values are not portrayed didactically, as part of lessons, but rather as a natural part of the stories". In his book What Would Frank Merriwell Do?, Ryan Anderson also pointed out the recurring theme <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> sportsmanship over winning in both Tunis' fiction and non-fiction, saying [...] "The common thread winding through all his writing became his dismay over the nation's tendency to value winning above common decency." [...] In turning from primarily writing non-fiction for adults to juvenile fiction Tunis did not abandon his emphasis on values over victory, but it did give him an audience that seemed more willing to listen.|$|E

On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never stated her position on same-sex marriage publicly. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle {{went on to say}} that [...] "This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." ...|$|E
