Players use a mouse cursor interface (or hotkeys) to direct their units, which range from crossbowmen to King Tiger tanks. A three-dimensional (3D) camera system allows the player to view the action from any perspective, including isometric and first-person angles. A mini-map is included as well.|$|E

5|$|Renaissance art marks a {{cultural}} rebirth {{at the close}} of the Middle Ages and rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Modern</b> <b>world.</b> One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.|$|E

He saw in the Renaissance {{the emergence of the}} modern spirit of individuality, which the Middle Ages had stifled. His book was widely read and became influential {{in the development of the}} modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. However, Buckhardt has been accused of setting forth a linear Whiggish view of history in seeing the Renaissance as the origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

Balfas notes that three versions of Hasan are made apparent to the reader: Hasan's view of himself, the narrator's view of Hasan, and the narrator's reconstruction of Hasan.|$|E

5|$|Empires: Dawn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Modern</b> <b>World</b> is a 2003 {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} developed by Stainless Steel Studios {{and published by}} Activision. Set in a world-historical period that extends from the Middle Ages to World War II, the game tasks players with guiding one of nine rival great civilizations to victory. Customer surveys from Stainless Steel's previous game, Empire Earth, were used {{as a starting point}} for Empires: these inspired the team to take a more minimalist design approach, and to include civilizations without overlapping styles of play. Empires was positively received by critics, who enjoyed its multiplayer component. However, certain reviewers disliked its single-player mode, and opinion clashed on the game's level of uniqueness compared to competitors such as Rise of Nations. The sales of Empires, when combined with those of Empire Earth, totaled 2.5 million units by 2004.|$|E

The Reds won all five Opening Day games in seasons in which they won the World Series. In addition, prior to the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>World</b> Series, the Reds won the American Association championship in 1882.

Jack Billingham started {{one of the most}} famous Opening Day games in Reds history on April 4, 1974 against the Atlanta Braves.

5|$|The Roman Empire {{was among}} the most {{powerful}} economic, cultural, political and military forces in the world of its time. It was one of the largest empires in world history. At its height under Trajan, it covered 5 million square kilometres. It held sway over an estimated 70million people, at that time 21% of the world's entire population. The longevity and vast extent of the empire ensured the lasting influence of Latin and Greek language, culture, religion, inventions, architecture, philosophy, law and forms of government on the empire's descendants. Throughout the European medieval period, attempts were even made to establish successors to the Roman Empire, including the Empire of Romania, a Crusader state, and the Holy Roman Empire. By means of European colonialism following the Renaissance, and their descendant states, Greco-Roman and Judaeo-Christian culture was exported on a worldwide scale, playing {{a crucial role in the}} development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
