25|$|The Court of Arches {{finally took}} {{evidence}} on the case in May 1770, {{two years after the}} bishop who appointed Bowles, John Egerton, had left the see of Bangor. Richard Williams and John Thomas testified that Bowles had seldom conducted services at St Beuno's, and when he did it was only in English. Another witness, Henry Jones, testified that Bowles had conducted a service at St Beuno's no more than three times. Williams and Jones testified that soon afterwards Bowles tried to minister in Welsh, but his grasp of the language was so poor that none of the congregation could understand him. Several witnesses, including his own curate, declared that when Bowles tried to minister the sacraments at Holy Communion, his Welsh was so bad that many communicants either burst <b>out</b> <b>laughing</b> or had to stifle themselves to avoid doing so. Since then Bowles had but seldom attended St Beuno's, and had employed a Welsh-speaking perpetual curate, John Griffith, to officiate in his stead. Griffith testified that he never saw Bowles conduct a service at St Cwyfan's.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said [...] " [...] a nicely worked-out story and strong, integrated gags. He added [...] "it's a particularly well-crafted entry." [...] C. S. Strowbridge of The Numbers said [...] "There {{are a number}} of funny gags on this double-length short, but it feels padded. It's also heavy-handed. I do like that they have a message to go with the jokes, {{but it would have been}} more effective if it were more subtle." [...] Josh Rode of DVD Verdict described the episode as [...] "decent". Shannon Gosney of The Mommy-Files said [...] "there were many parts where my boys just burst <b>out</b> <b>laughing.</b> Even I found myself laughing at times." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst <b>out</b> <b>laughing.</b> Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E

Yes, the college is called Hearst…which I thought was funny, and it's certainly not related to publishing." [...] Hearst had never previously accepted roles where {{she was asked to}} play herself, stating that it was a [...] "pathetic attempt to get attention" [...] when other celebrities played themselves or characters similar to themselves. Hearst had heard of Veronica Mars and seen several episodes prior to her appearance; nevertheless, she still needed to talk to Thomas about the series and her character before agreeing to guest star, commenting that she discovered that the character's background was not exceedingly similar to her own life, as [...] "Selma's situation is nothing like anything I've had to deal with." [...] When reading the script for the first time, Hearst was amused by the fact that her character was the heiress to the [...] "Hearst Mart fortune", comparing it to Walmart; she stated, [...] "when I read that in the script, I burst <b>out</b> <b>laughing.</b> It was a spit-take kind of thing. I almost fell over." [...] When asked whether or not the character would become a recurring one, she responded that the idea had not come up in discussions with the crew. However, she stated that she would accept if given the opportunity, and she particularly enjoyed working with Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Ed Begley, Jr..|$|E

Though primarily screened at film festivals, DVDs of independent films are often available for purchase over the internet including paid-live-streamings, making access to films more easily available for the public. The very nature of commercial films being screened at public cinemas allows for the wide exposure to the mainstream mass audience, resulting in a faster and wider spread of Internet slangs. The latest commercial film is titled [...] "LOL" [...] (acronym for <b>Laugh</b> <b>Out</b> Loud or <b>Laughing</b> <b>Out</b> Loud), starring Miley Cyrus and Demi Moore.

2500|$|Good {{friends in}} real life, Fred Allen and Jack Benny {{inadvertently}} hatched a running gag in 1937, {{when a child}} prodigy, violinist Stuart Canin, gave a very credible performance on the Allen show, inspiring an Allen wisecrack about [...] "a certain alleged violinist," [...] who should hide in shame over his poor playing. Allen often mentioned his show-business friends on the air ("Mr. Jacob Haley of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts" [...] was Allen's way of saying hello to his pal Jack Haley), and on the Canin broadcast Allen knew Benny would be listening.

[...] After his birth evil demons tried to destroy him, but with Ahura Mazda's protection, he survived all attempts on his life. [...] The Zoroastrian tradition differs from the Christian one because the divine only assists in the preservation of Zoroaster’s seed. [...] "The central scripture, the Avesta and also the Pahlavi texts include the tradition that the 'kingly glory' is handed onward from ruler to ruler and from saint to saint for the purpose of illuminating ultimately the soul of the Zarathushtra." [...] Also the scriptures clearly allude to conjugal relations between his parents, during which evil spirits try to prevent his conception.

Almost {{immediately}} {{he established}} his {{independence of the}} King, excommunicating a royal forester and refusing to seat one of Henry's courtly nominees as a prebendary of Lincoln; he softened the king's anger by his diplomatic address and tactful charm. After the excommunications, he came upon the king hunting and was greeted with dour silence. He waited several minutes and the king called for a needle to sew up a leather bandage on his finger. Eventually Hugh said, with gentle mockery, [...] "How much {{you remind me of}} your cousins of Falaise" [...] (where William I's mother Herleva, a tanner's daughter, had come from). At this Henry just burst <b>out</b> <b>laughing</b> and was reconciled.

2500|$|The American scholar Rachel Brownstein {{wrote that}} the novel begins with the Dashwood sisters being disinherited and cast of their homes, and the narrator offers {{in the account of}} how this came to be that men would always use women and cast them aside when they are not longer convenient; that one's good {{character}} counts for nothing in a society dominated by greed, ingratitude and selfishness; and that one can behave badly yet still remain eminently respectable as one has money. Brownstein said that in a world where men are generally greedy, selfish, dishonest, and generally cold is [...] "...a harsh one for young women". The marriage of John and Fanny Dashwood is portrayed as devoid of love and held together only by greed with Mrs. Dashwood being [...] "more narrow-minded and selfish" [...] than her repulsive husband. Likewise, Sir John and Lady Middleton are described as having a [...] "total want of talent and taste" [...] with Sir John's interests being only hunting while Lady Middleton's being spoiling her children. Lady Middleton condemns the Dashwood sisters for being [...] "satirical" [...] despite the fact as the narrator notes that she does not know what the word satirical actually means.
