500|$|McCain {{attacked}} {{what he saw}} as the corrupting {{influence of}} large political contributions– from corporations, labor unions, other organizations, and wealthy individuals– and he made this his signature issue. Starting in 1994, he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold <b>on</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform; their McCain–Feingold bill attempted to put limits on [...] "soft money". The efforts of McCain and Feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted, by incumbents in both parties, by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well, and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias. Despite sympathetic coverage in the media, initial versions of the McCain–Feingold Act were filibustered and never came to a vote.|$|E

[...] Paul, a convicted drug dealer who would soon after be convicted on stock fraud charges after being extradited from Brazil, stated that he spent $1.2 million to produce the August 12, 2000 Hollywood Gala Salute to President William Jefferson Clinton event, which was both a tribute to honor President Clinton and a fundraiser for the First Lady's 2000 Senate campaign. The Justice Department indictment charged Rosen with filing false reports with the Federal Election Commission by reporting only $400,000 in contributions. On May 27, 2005, the jury acquitted Rosen on all counts. [...] On January 5, 2006 {{it was reported that}} Clinton's campaign group agreed to pay a $35,000 fine related to the underreporting of the fundraiser's expenses.|$|E
500|$|Starting in late 1994 {{he worked}} with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold <b>on</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform; their McCain-Feingold bill would attempt to put limits on [...] "soft money", funds that corporations, unions, and other {{organizations}} could donate to political parties, which would then be funneled to political candidates in circumvention of [...] "hard money" [...] donation limits. [...] From the start, McCain and Feingold's efforts were opposed {{by some of the}} interests targeted, by incumbents in both parties, by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech, and by those who wanted to lessen the power of what they saw as media bias. [...] On the other hand, it garnered considerable sympathetic coverage in the national media, and from 1995 on, [...] "maverick Republican" [...] became a label frequently applied to McCain in stories. [...] He has used the term himself, and one of the chapters in his 2002 memoir Worth the Fighting For would be titled [...] "Maverick". [...] The first version of the McCain-Feingold Act was introduced into the Senate in September 1995; it was filibustered in 1996 and never came to a vote.|$|E

Another leading authority, Herbert Alexander, had published in 1991 Reform and Reality, a book on financing state and local political campaigns. It is significant that the term reality appears in both titles. The issue of <b>campaign</b> <b>financing</b> is so complex, so illusory, and increasingly emotive that we often talk above, below, or past each other on the subject.

In April 2007, a Pew Research Center report cited both Colbert and The Daily Show viewers as more well-informed than those who gathered their information via newspapers, television news and radio. Colbert's Super PAC coverage was widely lauded, and studies later found that this coverage was more effective than traditional news programs at educating the audience <b>on</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance.</b> He was awarded a Peabody Award for the parody, which was described as an [...] "innovative means of teaching American viewers about the landmark court decision". The Annenberg Public Policy Center reported in 2014 that the Colbert Super PAC segments increased viewers' knowledge of PAC and 501(c)(4) campaign finance regulation more successfully than other types of news media.|$|E

However, the Court struck down the [...] "choice of expenditure" [...] rule, which required that parties could either make coordinated expenditures for all its candidates, or permit candidates to spend independently, but not both, which the Court agreed [...] "placed an unconstitutional burden on the parties' right to make unlimited independent expenditures." [...] The Court also ruled that the provision preventing minors from making political contributions was unconstitutional, relying on Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District.|$|R
