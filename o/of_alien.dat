The idea of cloning was suggested by producers David Giler and Walter Hill, who opposed the production <b>of</b> <b>Alien</b> Resurrection, as they thought it would ruin the franchise.|$|E

If the alien is killed on its way back, the core will drop and slowly float back to the core housing. Different towers provide various abilities that are good against different types <b>of</b> <b>aliens</b> so the player must build a strategy to defend the cores against all waves <b>of</b> <b>aliens.</b>|$|R

5|$|Alien {{has been}} {{released}} in many home video formats and packages over the years. The first of these was a seventeen-minute Super-8 version for home projectionists. It was also released on both VHS and Betamax for rental, which grossed it an additional $40,300,000 in the United States alone. Several VHS releases were subsequently issued both separately and as boxed sets. LaserDisc and Videodisc versions followed, including deleted scenes and director commentary as bonus features. A VHS box set containing Alien and its sequels Aliens and Alien 3 was released in facehugger-shaped boxes, and included some of the deleted scenes from the Laserdisc editions. When Alien Resurrection premiered in theaters, another set {{of the first three}} films was released including a Making <b>of</b> <b>Alien</b> Resurrection tape. A few months later the set was re-released with the full version <b>of</b> <b>Alien</b> Resurrection taking the place of the making-of video. Alien was released on DVD in 1999, both separately and, as The Alien Legacy, packaged with Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection. This set, which was also released in a VHS version, included a commentary track by Ridley Scott. The first three films of the series have also been packaged as the Alien Triple Pack.|$|E

[...] This provision gives broad powers to the President in regards to the entry <b>of</b> <b>aliens.</b> But a different provision enacted under an amendment in 1965 establishes that, [...] "no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence" [...] This non-discrimination clause is one basis for the legal challenges under the argument that while the President was given broad powers in 1952, such powers were eventually limited in 1965.|$|R
