5|$|On July 25, 1901, a large fire erupted on Davenport's east side. The fire burnt itself <b>out</b> <b>late</b> in the day, {{instead of}} being brought under control. Eight blocks of {{buildings}} were destroyed causing one million dollars of damage. No lives were lost during the fire.|$|E
5|$|OTUs, {{employing}} as {{they did}} warplanes that were more advanced and more powerful than trainers, and teaching combat techniques that often carried high risk, generally suffered higher accident rates than other flying training schools. On 3March 1943, a Wirraway of No.4 OTU crashed near Williamtown, killing both crewmen. Two others died when their Vengeance crashed and burned near Goulburn during a cross-country exercise on 4August. On 16August, a Vengeance flew into trees after apparently pulling <b>out</b> <b>late</b> from a dive, resulting in two fatalities. A Vengeance blew up in flight during dive-bombing practice at Williamtown on 14September, killing both crewmen. On 5October, a Vengeance on a dive-bombing exercise crashed into the sea near Newcastle; both crewmen were reported as missing, believed killed. No.4 OTU suffered two more fatalities when a Vengeance struck a hill near Braidwood during a cross-country flight on 26November 1943. Another Vengeance hit the water and exploded in Nelson Bay on 7April 1944 after failing to recover from a dive, killing the two-man crew.|$|E
5|$|Qualification for Euro 1988 meant {{winning a}} group {{containing}} Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Scotland. The campaign opened with Belgium at the Heysel Stadium, and though Ireland contained danger man Nico Claesen, {{they had to}} settle for a 2–2 draw after conceding twice from corner-kicks; Frank Stapleton and Liam Brady scored the goals for Ireland. They then dominated Scotland at Lansdowne Road, but failed to find the net and instead drew 0–0. In the return fixture at Hampden Park Mark Lawrenson scored an early goal and another clean sheet won the Irish their first win of qualification. The campaign faltered with a 2–1 loss in Bulgaria, though Charlton was furious with referee Carlos Silva Valente as he felt that both of Lachezar Tanev's goals should not have counted as Nasko Sirakov allegedly pushed Mick McCarthy in the build-up to the first and he felt that Sirakov was outside the penalty box when he was fouled by Kevin Moran – Valente instead gave a penalty. They picked up another point after a 0–0 draw with Belgium in Dublin. Despite not particularly impressing Ireland then picked up six points with two victories over Luxembourg. They ended the campaign with a 2–0 home win over Bulgaria, Paul McGrath and Kevin Moran the scorers, though Liam Brady (an ever-present in qualification) picked up a two match suspension after lashing <b>out</b> <b>late</b> in the game after being kicked by a Bulgarian. Despite the victory the Irish had to rely on a favour from the Scots in order to qualify, who duly obliged with a 1–0 victory in Sofia to keep Bulgaria one point behind Ireland in the table.|$|E

Just after its appearance, Costello was replaced by Lindsay McDougall on lead guitar and backing vocals – Costello left to attend university and become an animal rights activist. In November, the group issued a CD EP, Punch in the Face and, in January 1997, performed at Big Day <b>Out.</b> <b>Late</b> that year they toured the US supporting Blink-182.|$|E

25|$|This twelve-day period used to {{be called}} the unbaptized days, during which the demonic forces of all kinds were {{considered}} to be more than usually active and dangerous. People were cautious not to attract their attention, and did not go <b>out</b> <b>late</b> at night. The latter precaution was especially because of the demons called karakondžula, imagined as heavy, squat, and ugly creatures. When a karakondžula found someone outdoors during the night of an unbaptized day, it would jump on his back, and make him carry it wherever it wanted. This torture would end only when roosters announced the dawn; at that moment the creature would release its victim and run away.|$|E

25|$|The British {{once again}} sent ambassadors and Caesar, {{although}} he doubled {{the number of}} hostages, realised he could not hold out any longer and dare not risk a stormy winter crossing, Caesar had set <b>out</b> <b>late</b> in the campaigning season and the winter was approaching, and so allowed them to be delivered to him in Gaul, to which he returned with {{as many of the}} ships as could be repaired with flotsam from the wrecked ships. Even then, only two tribes felt sufficiently threatened by Caesar to actually send the hostages, and two of his transports were separated from the main body and made landfall elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Building on {{the fitness}} {{he showed the}} {{previous}} year, 2011's pre-season saw Cotchin train with the main group more than ever before. In a profile published in The Age prior to round 1 he cited a previous tendency to fade <b>out</b> <b>late</b> in games due to a low fitness base, but that he believed his first full pre-season {{would allow him to}} correct this. It proved to be the case, with Cotchin showing the strong form {{in the early part of}} the year. Cotchin had his first career game with 30 disposals in a round 4 loss to Collingwood at the MCG. In round 7, he kicked four goals in a match against , his highest tally to date.|$|E
25|$|In Venice, meanwhile, {{deliberations}} {{were taking}} place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would lend to Constantinople. The Senate decided upon sending a fleet in February 1453, but there were delays, and when it finally set <b>out</b> <b>late</b> in April, {{it was already too}} late for it to be able to take part in the battle. Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital at the moment when Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital. At the same time, Constantine's attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor's ambassadors— even Byzantine diplomacy could not save the city.|$|E

He gained confidence in his team with a very strong performance at Talladega, leading for 20 laps, and finishing 2nd to his protege Brad Keselowski after Keselowski sent Carl Edwards flying into the catch fence {{in one of the}} year's biggest upsets. However, two weeks later at Richmond, Earnhardt finished 27th. He was again spun <b>out</b> <b>late</b> in the race at Darlington and ended the race in 27th place. He then finished 10th in the All-Star race at Lowe's Motor Speedway. Earnhardt's poor performance continued as he finished in 40th at the Coca Cola 600 due to an ill-handling race car.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} Bryant High School in 1924, Merman {{was hired as}} a stenographer by the Boyce-Ite Company. One day during her lunch break, she met Vic Kliesrath, who offered her a job at the Bragg-Kliesrath Corporation for a $5 {{increase}} above the weekly $23 salary she was earning, and Merman accepted the offer. She was eventually made personal secretary to company president Caleb Bragg, whose frequent lengthy absences from the office to race automobiles allowed her to catch up on the sleep she had lost the previous night when she was <b>out</b> <b>late</b> performing at private parties. During this period, Merman also began appearing in nightclubs, first hired by Jimmy Durante's partner Lou Clayton. At this time, she decided the name Ethel Zimmermann was too long for a theater marquee. She considered combining Ethel with Gardner or Hunter, which was her grandmother's maiden name. These considerations caused her father's ire, and she abbreviated Zimmermann to Merman to appease her father.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} double murder, some parents warned their {{children}} about being <b>out</b> <b>late.</b> The second double murder shocked {{the city and}} curfews were set for businesses. The height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The Texarkana Gazette stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any moment, at any place and at any one. Before, it was normal to leave your house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. Some people would nail sheets over their windows or nail the window down. Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and Venetian blinds. Other items that sold well included window sash locks, screen door hooks, night latches, and other protective devices.|$|E
