5|$|Macandal {{is a black}} slave, first {{introduced}} on the same plantation as Ti Noel. He is admired for his qualities that are irresistible to black women {{and his ability to}} captivate men. He regales tales of great kingdoms and speaks of epic battles in which the animals were allies of men, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incarnation</b> of the serpent, of a queen who was the Rainbow, and of horses adorned with silver coins. Macandal has his left arm amputated after a machinery accident on the plantation of Lenormand de Mezy and, unable to complete heavy work, is put in charge of pasturing the cattle. He departs for the mountains and discovers many secret herbs, plants, and fungi about which he is taught more by an old, mysterious woman who is something of a witch. Macandal leaves the plantation, attains the ability to transform into various beings, and is represented as having superhuman powers due to his possession by the gods.|$|E
5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} the sentiment of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incarnation,</b> whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E

25|$|In the Oneness view, the Godhead is {{not three}} {{different}} persons united by one nature, but rather God’s titles. Nevertheless, Oneness Pentecostals hold {{to the traditional}} Christian doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incarnation,</b> professing Jesus Christ to be God.|$|E

25|$|Although St Louis {{is perhaps}} best known for his Mariology and devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, his spirituality is founded on the mystery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Incarnation</b> of Jesus Christ, and is {{centered}} on Christ, as reflected in his collected works God Alone.|$|E

25|$|Depictions of the Nativity {{soon became}} a normal {{component}} of cycles in art illustrating both the Life of Christ and the Life of the Virgin.

25|$|Soreth also {{founded the}} order of Carmelite nuns in 1452 (with {{authorisation}} from the papal bull Cum Nulla). The first convent, Our Lady of Angels, was in Florence, but the movement rapidly spread to Belgium (in 1452), France, and Spain (with the foundation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Incarnation</b> in Avila in 1479).|$|E
25|$|Before {{his death}} he was {{building}} at Hempstead Plains, Long Island, the village of Garden City, {{with the purpose of}} affording his employees comfortable and airy housing at a moderate cost. After his death, his wife Cornelia erected several buildings in his memory, including St. Paul's School and The Cathedral <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Incarnation,</b> Garden City; the latter also served as a mausoleum to both Stewart and his wife.|$|E

25|$|In the 4th century, this {{uniqueness}} of the circumstances related to the Nativity of Jesus, and their interplay with the mystery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incarnation</b> became a central element in both the theology and hymnody of Saint Ephrem the Syrian. For him, the {{uniqueness of}} the Nativity of Jesus was supplemented with the sign of the Majesty of the Creator through the ability of a powerful God to enter the world as a small newborn.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{records of}} a formal devotional following for Saint Joseph date to the year 800 and references to him as Nutritor Domini (educator/guardian of the Lord) {{began to appear in}} the 9th century, and continued growing to the 14th century. Saint Thomas Aquinas discussed the necessity of the presence of Saint Joseph in the plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Incarnation</b> for if Mary had not been married, the Jews would have stoned her and that in his youth Jesus needed the care and protection of a human father.|$|E
25|$|The {{incentive}} to give outward practical expression to her inward motive was inspired in Teresa by the Franciscan priest Saint Peter of Alcantara who became acquainted with her early in 1560, and became her spiritual guide and counselor. She now resolved {{to found a}} reformed Carmelite convent, correcting the laxity which she had found in the Cloister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Incarnation</b> and others. Guimara de Ulloa, a woman of wealth and a friend, supplied the funds. Teresa worked for many years encouraging Spanish Jewish converts to follow Christianity.|$|E

25|$|Saint Francis’ {{intuitive}} {{approach was}} elaborated into a philosophical vision by subsequent Franciscan theologians, such as Bonaventure of Bagnoregio and John Duns Scotus, leading {{figures in the}} Franciscan intellectual tradition. The philosophy of Scotus is founded upon the primacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Incarnation,</b> {{and may have been}} a particularly important influence on Sahagún, since Scotus’s philosophy was taught in Spain at this time. Scotus absorbed the intuitive insights of St. Francis of Assisi and his devotion to Jesus Christ as a human being, and expressed them in a broader vision of humanity.|$|E
25|$|Augustine’s later amillennial view {{laid the}} eschatological {{foundation}} for the Middle Ages, which practically abandoned premillennialism. The theological term “kingdom” maintained its eschatological function, {{though it was not}} necessarily futuristic. Instead it consistently referred to the present age so that the church was currently experiencing the eschaton. Julian of Toledo (642–690) summarizes the medieval doctrine of the millennium by referring to it as “the church of God which, by the diffusion of its faith and works, is spread out as a kingdom of faith from the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incarnation</b> until the time of the coming judgment”.|$|E
25|$|Teresa {{entered a}} Carmelite Monastery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Incarnation</b> in Ávila, Spain, on 2 November 1535. She found herself {{increasingly}} in disharmony with the spiritual malaise prevailing at the monastery. Among the 150 nuns living there, the observance of cloister — {{designed to protect}} and strengthen the spirit and practice of prayer — became so lax that it actually lost its very purpose. The daily invasion of visitors, many of high social and political rank, spoiled the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vain conversations. These violations of the solitude absolutely essential to progress in genuine contemplative prayer grieved Teresa {{to the extent that}} she longed to do something.|$|E

25|$|The Orthodox Church {{understands the}} death and resurrection of Christ Jesus to be real {{historical}} events, {{as described in the}} gospels of the New Testament. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was in his humanity (that is, in history) crucified, and died, descending into Hades (Sheol), the place of the dead, as all humans do. But He, alone among humans, has two natures, one human, one divine, which are indivisible and inseparable from each other through the mystery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incarnation.</b> Hades could not restrain the infinite God. Christ in His divine nature captured the keys of Hades and broke the bonds which had imprisoned the human souls who had been held there through their separation from God.|$|E
25|$|In heraldry, a unicorn {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a horse with a goat's cloven hooves and beard, a lion's tail, and a slender, spiral horn on its forehead (non-equine attributes may be replaced with equine ones, {{as can be seen}} from the following gallery). Whether because it was an emblem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Incarnation</b> or of the fearsome animal passions of raw nature, the unicorn was not widely used in early heraldry, but became popular from the 15th century. Though sometimes shown collared and chained, which may be taken as an indication that it has been tamed or tempered, it is more usually shown collared with a broken chain attached, showing that it has broken free from its bondage.|$|E
25|$|Epiphany {{is celebrated}} {{by both the}} Eastern and Western Churches, but a major {{difference}} between them is precisely which events the feast commemorates. For Western Christians, the feast primarily commemorates {{the coming of the}} Magi, with only a minor reference to the baptism of Jesus and the miracle at the Wedding at Cana. Eastern churches celebrate the Baptism of Christ in the Jordan. In both traditions, the essence of the feast is the same: the manifestation of Christ to the world (whether as an infant or in the Jordan), and the Mystery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Incarnation.</b> The miracle at the Wedding at Cana is also celebrated during Epiphany as a first manifestation of Christ's public life.|$|E
