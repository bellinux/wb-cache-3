5|$|Among several {{projects}} for memorials, Zvi Hecker designed the solemn Page Memorial (1996) with Micha Ullmann and Eyal Weizman. This site-specific memorial commemorates the Jewish community of Kreuzberg, and their Lindenstrasse synagogue {{which was designed}} in 1891 by architects Cremer & Wolffenstein. What was {{once one of the}} largest religious buildings in Berlin, with a capacity of 1800; was ruined by the Nazis in the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom. On the original floor plan, the benches of the synagogue were recreated in concrete, and where the bimah stood, trees are now planted. The designers conceived of the benches as sentences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> the Talmud.|$|E

25|$|Two Sydney journalists, J.F. Archibald and John Haynes, founded The Bulletin magazine: {{the first}} edition {{appeared}} on 31 January 1880. It {{was intended to be}} a journal of political and business commentary, with some literary content. Initially radical, nationalist, democratic and racist, it gained wide influence and became a celebrated entry-point to publication for Australian writers and cartoonists such as Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson, Miles Franklin, and the illustrator and novelist Norman Lindsay. A celebrated literary debate played out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> the Bulletin about the nature of life in the Australian bush featuring the conflicting views of such as Paterson (called romantic) and Lawson (who saw bush life as exceedingly harsh) and notions of an Australian 'national character' were taking firmer root.|$|E

25|$|In actual fact, {{the first}} {{building}} designs of Usko Nyström─Petrelius─Penttilä were wooden buildings, designed in a rustic, proto-National Romantic style. Penttilä even campaigned for a Finnish National Romantic style of architecture <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> the journal he edited, Suomen Teollisuuslehti, with the designs showing exposed notched corner joints, rather than covering the logs with boarding, {{which had been}} the custom at that time. Among their distinct wooden buildings were the Hollola Municipal House (1902), the Suviranta artists’ home for artist Eero Järnefelt, in Tuusulanjärvi, along the same lake shore where other artists would build their atelier homes, most notably Jean Sibelius. By far the largest scale project of the architectural firm was never realised, the Vyborg City Hall, which Nyström and Penttilä had won in an architectural competition in 1899. Their entry is in the neo-gothic style. However, over the following years, as the project awaited the go-ahead, the design changed to a more neo-renaissance style. The project was never built.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a modern-day}} account in The Cincinnati Enquirer, it is {{possible}} that the shooting match may have taken place in 1881 and not 1875. However, it appears the time of the event was never recorded. Biographer Shirl Kasper states the shooting match took place in the spring of 1881 near Greenville, possibly in North Star as mentioned by Butler during interviews in 1903 and 1924. Other sources seem to coincide with the North Fairmount location near Cincinnati if the event occurred in 1881. The Annie Oakley Center Foundation mentions Oakley visiting her married sister, Lydia Stein, at her home near Cincinnati in 1875. That information is incorrect as Lydia didn't marry Joseph C. Stein until March 19, 1877. Although speculation, it is most likely that Oakley and her mother visited Lydia in 1881 as she was seriously ill from tuberculosis. The Bevis House hotel was still being operated by Martin Bevis and W. H. Ridenour in 1875. It first opened around 1860 after the building was previously used as a pork packaging facility. Jack Frost didn't obtain management of the hotel until 1879. The Baughman & Butler shooting act first appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> The Cincinnati Enquirer in 1880. They signed with Sells Brothers Circus in 1881 and made an appearance at the Coliseum Opera House later that year.|$|E

500|$|In the volume, Stanton did {{not mention}} the Liberty Party's plank on woman {{suffrage}} pre-dating the Seneca Falls Convention by a month, and she did not describe the Worcester National Women's Rights Convention, organized by Stone and Davis in 1850, as the beginning of the women's rights movement. Rather, Stanton named the 1840 Anti-Slavery Convention in London as the birth of the [...] "movement for woman's suffrage, in both England and America". She positioned the Seneca Falls meeting as her own political debut, and characterized it as the beginning of the women's rights movement, calling it [...] "the greatest movement for human liberty recorded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> history—a demand for freedom to one-half the entire race." [...] Stanton worked to enshrine the Declaration of Sentiments as a foundational treatise in a number of ways, {{not the least of which}} was by imbuing the small, three-legged tea table upon which the first draft of it was composed an importance similar to that of Thomas Jefferson's desk upon which he wrote the Declaration of Independence. The M'Clintocks gave Stanton the table, then Stanton gave it to Susan B. Anthony on the occasion of her 80th birthday, though Anthony had no part in the Seneca Falls meeting. In keeping with Stanton's promotion of the table as an iconic relic, women's rights activists put it in a place of honor at the head of the casket at the funeral of Susan B. Anthony on March 14, 1906. Subsequently, it was displayed prominently on the stage at each of the most important suffrage meetings until 1920, even though the grievance and resolution about woman suffrage was not written on it. The table is kept at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.|$|E
