5|$|Interpretations {{of other}} {{features}} of Opabinia fossils differ. Since the animals {{did not have}} mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects, their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within the <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fossils.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the writing}} {{received}} mixed reviews, {{the reception of}} the artwork was almost entirely positive. Higgins, recalling the heavy blacks and bold <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original strip, found Critchlow's new style {{to be much more}} open and expressive. Maxwell also praised Critchlow's development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style. Carter thought that the art was a little flat in places, but nevertheless praised it for being unique with a lot of character.|$|E
5|$|Edwards {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film after seeing fishermen attempt to bring a creature in with a net, and imagining a monster inside. He pitched the idea to Vertigo Films, who suggested he watch In Search of a Midnight Kiss, a low-budget film starring McNairy. Edwards cast McNairy and Able in the lead roles. Principal photography lasted three weeks and had a production crew of six people. Filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. Most of the extras were people who were at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, and Edwards provided <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary plot points.|$|E

5|$|Given the {{repeated}} failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx {{also sought to}} understand capitalism and {{spent a great deal}} of time in the reading room of the British Museum studying and reflecting on the works of political economists and on economic data. By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title <b>Outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Critique of Political Economy.|$|E
5|$|The small {{fields in}} the western part of the area are {{particularly}} characteristic of the Chew Valley and date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Fields of this category are generally small in size, regular in outline and often the boundaries preserve the <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier strip field system. Regional variations in field size and pattern do occur. For example, there is evidence of medieval clearance of woodland on the slopes around Nempnett Thrubwell, south of Bishop Sutton and west and south of Chelwood.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of {{the fossil}} record {{continued}} to advance rapidly {{during the first few}} decades of the 19th century. By the 1840s, the <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geologic timescale were becoming clear, and in 1841 John Phillips named three major eras, based on the predominant fauna of each: the Paleozoic, dominated by marine invertebrates and fish, the Mesozoic, the age of reptiles, and the current Cenozoic age of mammals. This progressive picture of the history of life was accepted even by conservative English geologists like Adam Sedgwick and William Buckland; however, like Cuvier, they attributed the progression to repeated catastrophic episodes of extinction followed by new episodes of creation. Unlike Cuvier, Buckland and some other advocates of natural theology among British geologists made efforts to explicitly link the last catastrophic episode proposed by Cuvier to the biblical flood.|$|E

5|$|Stigwood and Russell {{decided to}} hold auditions with the eight actresses portraying Eva in the musical's {{worldwide}} productions, with an undisclosed number performing screen tests in New York and London. In November 1981, Russell continued holding screen tests at Elstree Studios. Karla DeVito {{was among those who}} auditioned for the role of Eva. Russell also travelled to London, where he screen tested Liza Minnelli wearing a blonde wig and custom-period gowns. He felt that Minnelli, a more established film actress, would be better suited for the role, but Rice, Stigwood and Paramount wanted Elaine Paige, the first actress to play Eva in the London stage production. Russell began working on his own screenplay without Stigwood, Rice or Lloyd Webber's approval. His script followed the <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage production, but established the character of Ché as a newspaper reporter. The script also contained a hospital montage for Eva and Ché, in which they pass each other on gurneys in white corridors as she is being treated for cancer, while Ché is beaten and injured by rioters. Russell was ultimately fired from the project after telling Stigwood he would not do the film without Minnelli.|$|E

25|$|Males in nuptial plumage are {{distinguished}} from green-winged teals by the horizontal white scapular stripe, {{the lack of}} a vertical white bar at the breast sides, and the quite conspicuous light <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face patch, which are indistinct in the green-winged teal drake. Males in eclipse plumage, females and immatures are best recognised by their small size, calls, and the speculum; they are hard to tell apart from the green-winged teal however.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{historian}} and philosopher Martin Grabmann was the first scholar to work out the <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ongoing development of thought in scholasticism and to see in Thomas Aquinas a response and development of thought rather than a single, coherently emerged and organic whole. Although Grabmann's works in German are numerous, only Thomas Aquinas (1928) is available in English. However, Grabmann's thought was instrumental in the whole modern understanding of scholasticism and the pivotal role of Aquinas.|$|E
