5|$|As the LSA grew, {{it began}} {{to take on a}} larger role outside of the {{professional}} sphere. During World War II, the LSA helped the United States government with language training programs through its Linguistic Institutes. After the longtime Secretary-Treasurer Archibald Hill retired from his position in 1969, the LSA made large changes to its organizational structure to better accommodate its new and growing role. The responsibilities of the Secretary-Treasurer were expanded and the LSA established a Secretariat in Washington, DC in order to act as a liaison between the members, federal government, and other professional organizations. In 1981, the LSA and 9 other professional organizations founded the Consortium <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> Associations in order to advocate for the governmental support <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>science</b> research.|$|E

The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E

5|$|At this time, {{the first}} serious student revolts started to emerge, {{motivated}} by the local and global changes of the decade, like the Vietnam war, the European student movement, {{the presence of the}} Peace Corps in Latin-America and specially in Colombia, the rejection of the IDB loan and the presence of the foreign foundations. On February 15, 1971, after the unconsulted election of the Dean of the Division <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Science</b> and Economics, some students took the rectory. This marked the first incursion of the police force to the university campus. For these events, some professors and students were expelled of the university.

5|$|Durkheim's {{period in}} Germany {{resulted}} in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed {{by the work of}} Wilhelm Wundt. Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the University of Bordeaux in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course. His official title was Chargé d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de Pédagogie and thus he taught both pedagogy and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before). The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of the change of times, and also the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences. From this position Durkheim helped reform the French school system and introduced the study <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>science</b> in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.|$|E
