Now I just wanted to level out of my turning bank, since my colleagues were already at a substantially higher altitude.

[...] "I've discussed {{times when}} [...] behaved {{in ways that}} I'm not certain are ethical, but {{this might be the}} most blatant case. [...] <b>Once</b> <b>again,</b> <b>I</b> am intrigued by the decisions to make Veronica less than pure, but this time, I'm not as disappointed by the followthrough." ...|$|E

Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today said [...] "it's vertical in focus and a typical-sounding power ballad, but it's {{not hard to imagine}} people latching on to its powerful Job-like expression of faith and hope.". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout praised it as [...] "sonic" [...] and called it a [...] "passionate and emotional worship experience". Brian Mansfield of USA Today felt that the song's lyric [...] "I was sure by now that You would have reached down and wiped our tears away/Stepped in and saved the day/But <b>once</b> <b>again,</b> <b>I</b> say 'Amen,' and it's still raining" [...] would resonate with listeners.|$|E

500|$|The {{video is}} {{structured}} as a cinematic peep show and voyeurism that portrays Madonna as a stripper. According to Mondino, the peep show {{was his idea}} since at that time, [...] "we were into a period where we were experimenting [...] some kind of freedom about the body, about sexuality and stuff". He {{wanted to have a}} [...] "naive and sweet" [...] feel with the portrayal of a boy waiting outside for Madonna. They built the set from scratch, including the frontal part with the ticket booth. Although it looked fake, Mondino liked it saying [...] "I like the fakeness of it. I haven't seen it for a long time, but when I saw it <b>once</b> <b>again,</b> <b>I</b> said, 'It's so naïve'. It's kind of badly done, which I like, compared to today. We didn't have the same equipment, people are more skillful today, but there's something sweet about it." [...] Madonna was initially asked by him to wear a black wig, and the initial reaction to the whole wardrobe was positive. But Madonna wanted Mondino's opinion on the whole ensemble, who replied that she would look better as a blonde. So the wig was kept for the initial scenes of the video only.|$|E
500|$|When the {{election}} was held, there was a 12 percent swing towards the Liberal Party in South Australia, or 7 percent on two party preferred. There was a large swing against Labor owing to the dissatisfaction with the Whitlam administration, but it generally {{went directly to the}} Liberal Party. Against this background, and with relatively little media attention paid to the LM and its cause, Despite gaining prominence for his stance on supply, Hall struggled to be re-elected, gaining only 6.5 per cent of the Senate vote and relying on preferences, ironically from Labor. In South Australia, Labor gained 41 per cent of the vote, and the Liberals 51 per cent. In the lower house, the LM managed only 6.2% across the 12 seats, again recording its best result in Boothby, with 10.4%. Hall's hope for Australia-wide support for the LM was dashed owing to the previous events, with the party gaining negligible results for their candidates in other states. The lower house candidates in the Australian Capital Territory registered around 3%, but the senate candidates in Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland received less than 1%. Hall's opinion was that [...] "the Liberal Movement was for its part in the contest happy to have survived." [...] Nevertheless, Hall was still adamant the LM's future was as a standalone entity: [...] "The LM is going to continue as an Australia-wide party ... We shall {{have to go through the}} sickening process of having the Liberal party make overtures to us <b>once</b> <b>again</b> ... <b>I</b> would like to tell them right now that they will be wasting their breath." [...] Despite Hall's defiance, the poor showing meant his senate term was only to last for three rather than six years, and he no longer had the balance of power and the resulting media exposure. This was a problem, as the party was largely centred around his personality.|$|E
2500|$|Van Gogh {{argued with}} Bernard and, especially, Paul Gauguin {{as to whether}} one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred, or paint what Gauguin called [...] "abstractions": {{paintings}} conceived in the imagination, or de tête. In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks {{in the fall and}} winter of 1888: [...] "When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know[...] [...] [...] But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall[...] [...] [...] And yet, <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>I</b> allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big—another failure—and I have had my fill of that." [...] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2010, after Massa {{announced}} he was dropping out of his re-election bid, Kuhl issued a statement, his first since conceding: [...] "Tonight all of the 29th Congressional District will have Eric Massa and his family in their hearts and prayers. His reoccurrence of cancer is devastating and I wish him a full recovery. I know firsthand that Eric is a fighter and I have full confidence that he will beat cancer <b>once</b> <b>again.</b> <b>I</b> have received numerous calls and emails today regarding my political future and I truly appreciate {{all of those who}} believed in me and supported me during my 28 years of public service. I will address any political decisions in the future but right now it is important for Eric to get the treatment that he needs to recover." [...] Since that time, Kuhl has become more public and has been issuing more public statements and granting interviews to local radio station WLEA, primarily about the Massa situation. He was considering entering the special election for the vacant seat, but passed on it, endorsing former Corning mayor Tom Reed.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of World War I at the young age of 16, Brodovitch {{abandoned}} his dream of entering the Imperial Art Academy and {{ran away from home}} to join the Russian army. Not long after, his father had him brought home and hired a private tutor to help Alexey finish school. Upon graduating, Brodovitch ran away again on several occasions. He recalls: After a week or so I ran away to the front line to kill Germans. But my father, now a military general {{at the head of a}} Red Cross hospital train, had plenty of influence, and I was soon brought back to him. On the train back I was employed as a nurses' aid. In East Prussia I ran away again and joined a nearby regiment. <b>Once</b> <b>again</b> <b>I</b> was caught, and this time I was sent to an officers' school, the Corps de Pages. During the Russian Civil War, Brodovitch served with the White Army. While fighting against the Bolsheviks in Odessa, he was badly wounded and was hospitalized for a time in Kislovodsk, in the Caucasus. [...] In 1918, the town was surrounded by the Bolsheviks, forcing Brodovitch into exile. It was during this retreat to the south through Caucasus and Turkey that he met his future wife, Nina.|$|E
