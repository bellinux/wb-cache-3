40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the implications of}} the discretion in the cut-off point in the accounting method for research and development. Our research problem targets the issues to reduce the existing research gap: - "Does the choice of accounting method for research and development matter when a creditor evaluates a company for a <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> decision?" - "How does the accounting method for research and development matter in a <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> decision?" Our study aims to answer these questions by investigating and analyzing the <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> assessment and by interviewing creditors at the major banks in Sweden. Fictitious case scenarios provide in-depth information about how the accounting methods matter for a <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> decision. We develop this study by gathering existing material regarding accounting standards, the accounting method and the <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> assessment. Previous studies about <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> and the accounting methods supplement the theoretical material. The approach to this study is a hermeneutic approach that tries to grasp the entire picture of the respondents' opinion about the accounting methods. To gain detailed and extensive information from the respondents, we use a qualitative research with semi-structured interviews. The research sample consists of experienced creditors at the largest banks in Sweden. This is to ensure relevant and informative answers on our questions. We utilise the four case scenarios to encourage the respondents to elaborate upon the accounting methods for R&D. This provides detailed knowledge about how the accounting methods matter for a <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> decision. The respondent states that abnormal values in the R&D account are suspicious and that investigation and adjustments of these values occurs if necessary. From this summarised statement, we draw the conclusion that the accounting methods for R&D matter in a <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> decision. However, we also establish that other factors are more influential on the decision. Furthermore, we find that the creditors examine the content of the R&D account because the methods and its content have different impact on the financial statements. The expense method indicates a negative impact on the <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> decision if the company cannot carry the costs, while the recognition method gives an appearance of stronger financial statements. However, the recognition method also gives rise to suspicions if the company relies on previous achievements. We conclude that depending on the amount of R&D both methods can be perceived as an advantage and a disadvantage for a <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> decision, however, our main finding suggests that a revaluation of the abnormal values in the R&D account occurs. From the support of our findings, we believe that our research has accomplished the objective of the study and we therefore believe that we have contributed to the existing knowledge in the subject. ...|$|R

40|$|In April 2008 an {{official}} report, SOU (2008 : 32), was presented. In that report {{it was suggested}} that the statutory audit for approximately 96 % of the Swedish companies was to be abolished. The report suggests that the new regulations should apply to all limited companies that are below two of three limits that have been suggested: a) a balance-sheet total of 41, 5 million SEK; b) a net turnover of 83 million SEK or; c) less than 50 employees. The regulations are suggested to come into force July 1, 2010. According to the Swedish laws that regulate the limited companies, Aktiebolagslagen 10 : 11, should all limited companies regardless of size have an chartered accountant or otherwise approved. The purpose of the audit is to create a trust towards the figures that the company shows and also to act as an assurance towards third parties (Collis, 2003; Strenger et al, 2008). Commercial banks are one of the parties that use the audited material in connection with <b>granting</b> of <b>credits</b> to small limited companies. The aim of our study has been to describe and analyze the commercial bank's <b>credit</b> <b>granting,</b> and to make a survey of what may happen with the process of <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> and the <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> as such in case of an abolishment of the statutory audit. To do this we used a qualitative research. We as researches have aimed to discuss the <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> process and a possible abolishment with the credit granters that are involved in the process. The study has shown that commercial banks always use audited material in the <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> process. The commercial banks have a positive attitude towards the audited material and regard it as a guarantee of quality. The study has shown that the commercial banks will not change how the <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> process is carried through in comparison of today.

40|$|Rural {{financing}} in Thailand {{is heavily}} dependent on bank lending. Therefore, understanding the determinants of bank lending in the rural sector is an important element for promoting the development of credit accessibility to Thai farmers in the rural regions. Appropriate bank lending decisions would reduce lending costs and increase repayment rate and profits to the banks. Thus, a well-developed rural financial market would lead to sustainable development in the rural sector. The purpose {{of this research is}} to identify critical factors in the bank lending decision and to investigate what factors affect the credit availability and loan price in rural lending in Thailand. This research also investigates the impact of the relationship lending (i. e., the relationship between the bank and the borrower) and the predictive power among the different estimation techniques in predicting the bank lending decision, amount of <b>credit</b> <b>granted,</b> and interest rate charged. The data used in this research are obtained from the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative (BAAC). During the period of 2001 to 2003, a total of 18, 798 credit files under the normal loan scheme are made available. The credit files are analyzed using the logistic regression (Logit), multiple linear regression (MLR), and four different types of the artificial neural networks (ANN), namely multi-layer feed-forward neural networks (MLFN), Ward networks (WD), general regression neural networks (GRNN), and probabilistic neural networks (PNN). The results show that the total asset value (Asset), value of collateral (Collateral), and the length of the bank-borrower relationship (Duration) are crucial factors in determining bank lending decision, amount of <b>credit</b> <b>granted,</b> and interest rate charged. As expected, Asset has a positive impact on the bank lending decision and the amount of <b>credit</b> <b>granted,</b> while Collateral has a positive and a negative influence on the amount of <b>credit</b> <b>granted</b> and the interest rate charged, respectively. However, Collateral has no significant impact on the bank lending decision, while Asset has a significant negative impact on the loan price in some specifications. Duration has a significant negative impact on bank lending decision, amount of <b>credit</b> <b>granted,</b> and interest rate charged, which implies the importance of relationship lending in the Thailand rural financial market. However, the negative relationships between Duration and the bank lending decision, and between Duration and the amount of <b>credit</b> <b>granted,</b> contradict the postulated hypothesizes. The results imply that the bank uses information from the borrowers and monitors the lending risk via the lending decision and amount of <b>credit</b> <b>granted.</b> On the <b>other</b> hand, the relationship lending benefits the borrowers via loan pricing since the borrowers with a long term relationship with the bank receive a lower lending rate. The predictive results of both in-sample and out-of-sample on bank lending decision, amount of <b>credit</b> <b>granted,</b> and interest rate charged show that in terms of predictive accuracy, most of the artificial neural networks models outperform the logistic and the multiple regression models. The empirical results also show the superiority of using the PNN model to classify and screen the loan applications, and the GRNN model to determine the amount of <b>credit</b> <b>granted</b> and interest rate charged...|$|R

40|$|In November 2010 the Swedish {{government}} {{approved the}} abolishment legislative proposal of mandatory audit for small limited companies. The changes of regulations led to voluntary audit {{according to the}} Swedish Audit Act (Revisionslag SFS 1999 : 1079). The Swedish Bankers Association supported the reform. However, it was underlined that banks still would value audited information. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine how this reform of mandatory audit had impact on the bank’s decision-making regarding the <b>credit</b> <b>granting.</b> In addition, it is also interesting to comprehend whether or not the audited financial reports increase the assurance and legitimacy of the company to bank and ease the process of lending credit or loan. However, both theoretical analysis and empirical findings of this study reveal that the absence of auditing have in somehow impact on the banks decision-making of <b>credit</b> <b>granting,</b> which banks sense difficulty and insecurity to evaluate the non-audited clients’ application for <b>credit</b> <b>granting.</b> Further, it might be claimed that the audited financial reports increase the assurance and legitimacy of the company; thereby banks can make the decision to <b>grant</b> <b>credit</b> or loan easier.

40|$|Trade credit {{has been}} shown to be an {{important}} source of short-term finance for smaller firms but small firms are also suppliers of trade credit. There is little empirical evidence on the <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> decisions of small firms. Previous empirical work (Petersen and Rajan, 1997; and Ng, Smith and Smith, 1999) has focused on <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> and investment in accounts receivable in larger firms. In this paper we look at the influences on <b>credit</b> <b>granting</b> for the smallest firms, using a sample of firms with an average of 10 employees. As in previous studies we find that product and demand characteristics influence credit terms. Moreover, we find evidence that firm size affects credit extension choices directly by setting limits on the possibilities for economies of scale, but it also impacts indirectly by affecting the firm's access to finance and its bargaining strength "vis-à-vis" suppliers. The dominant position of larger customers in bargaining with small suppliers constrains the impact of other factors on the firm's choice of credit terms. Small firms are also under pressure to conform to industry norms, although lack of resources can be a limiting factor. Constrained firms may make use of two-part terms in an attempt to improve their cashflow. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2002. ...|$|R
