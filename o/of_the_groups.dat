5|$|A {{year after}} he took office, Bruce began {{investigating}} whether there would be interest in building a religious center and chapel complex at the school. After several years of negotiations with the various religious denominations which had operated on and off campus, Bruce engineered a consensus that the university would build a center based {{on the model of}} the Armed Forces Base Chapel. The new religious center would have a single chapel which would be shared by all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups,</b> and office space for each group. The center opened in 1965 and was named for Bruce.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 McNallen {{was invited}} to the International Asatru Summer Camp, but this was opposed by many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> attending, who argued {{that he should not}} be invited because of what they {{perceived}} as his racist views; a number of European Heathen groups, such as Norway's Bifrost and the Swedish SAS, threatened to boycott the event as a result of McNallen's invite. In 2011, the AFA sent a contingent to the annual conference of a white nationalist organization, the National Policy Institute, in what some figures close to McNallen revealed was an attempt to recruit members. After this incident was publicized it resulted in accusations of racism being levelled against McNallen and the AFA from various parts of the Pagan blogosphere.|$|E

5|$|Section 4 of the Act {{includes}} new {{provisions to}} cover this sort of situation. Section 4(1) establishes a general duty to repair and maintain the property, owed by the landlord to anyone who could reasonably {{be expected to be}} harmed by a breach; this includes tenants, their friends and family and also trespassers. This duty applies when a landlord ought to have known of a defect, not just when he has been informed of a defect.

5|$|Some new bands, such as London's Alternative TV, Edinburgh's Rezillos, and Leamington's the Shapes, {{identified}} with the scene even as they pursued more experimental music. Others of a comparatively traditional rock 'n' roll bent were also swept up by the movement: the Vibrators, formed as a pub rock–style act in February 1976, soon adopted a punk look and sound. A few even longer-active bands including Surrey neo-mods the Jam and pub rockers the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer also became associated with the punk rock scene. Alongside the musical roots shared with their American counterparts and the calculated confrontationalism of the early Who, the British punks also reflected the influence of glam rock and related bands such as Slade, T.Rex, and Roxy Music. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> openly acknowledging that influence were the Undertones, from Derry in Northern Ireland.|$|E

After Hi-5's sale in 2012, there was a return to licensing international versions of the group.

5|$|Afterward, the PSC {{largely ignored}} the lease plan {{since it was}} still focused on {{building}} {{the first phase of}} the Dual Contracts. The Flushing Business Men's Association kept advocating for the Amity Street subway, causing a schism between them and the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> that supported the LIRR lease. Through the summer of 1915, the PSC and the LIRR negotiated the planned lease to $125,000 a first year, , with an eight percent increase each year; the negotiations then stalled in 1916. The Whitestone Improvement Association, impatient with the pace of negotiations, approved of the subway under Amity Street even though it would not serve them directly. The PSC's chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20,600 riders would use the Whitestone and Bayside lines each day in either direction, and that by 1927, there would be 34,000 riders per day per direction. The Third Ward Rapid Transit Association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for Flushing subway extensions to that point, compared to how little progress they had made in doing so. Negotiations continued to be stalled in 1917. Despite the line not having been extended past Corona yet, the idea of a subway extension to Little Neck encouraged development there.|$|E
5|$|At around 11:00 pm on 1 May, Bormann {{left the}} Führerbunker with SS doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler Youth leader Artur Axmann, and Hitler's pilot Hans Baur {{as members of}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> {{attempting}} {{to break out of}} the Soviet encirclement. Bormann carried with him a copy of Hitler's last will and testament. The group left the Führerbunker and travelled on foot via a U-Bahn tunnel to the Friedrichstraße station, where they surfaced. Several members of the party attempted to cross the Spree River at the Weidendammer Bridge while crouching behind a Tiger tank. The tank was hit by Soviet artillery and destroyed, and Bormann and Stumpfegger were knocked to the ground. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and several others eventually crossed the river on their third attempt. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and Axmann walked along the railway tracks to Lehrter station, where Axmann decided to leave the others and go in the opposite direction. When he encountered a Red Army patrol, Axmann doubled back. He saw two bodies, which he later identified as Bormann and Stumpfegger, on a bridge near the railway switching yard. He did not have time to check thoroughly, so he did not know how they died. Since the Soviets never admitted to finding Bormann's body, his fate remained in doubt for many years.|$|E

5|$|Following the Spanish–American War, {{which gave}} Cuba its {{independence}} from Spain, many anarchists were dissatisfied with the conditions that persisted after independence. They cited conditions that were perpetuated by the new government, like suppression of labor movements, US occupations, and dissatisfaction with the school systems. By 1899, anarchist workers had reorganized themselves, under the Alianza de Trabajadores (Worker's Alliance). By September of this year, five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> organizers had been arrested, following a mason's strike which spread {{to all of the}} construction trade. Around this time, anarchist organizer Errico Malatesta visited Cuba, giving speeches, and interviews to several periodicals, but was soon barred from further speaking engagements by civil governor Emilio Nuñez. Around 1902-03, anarchists and other labor organizers began to attempt to organize the sugar industry, then the largest industry in Cuba. But owners responded quickly, and two workers were murdered, and the crimes never solved.|$|E
5|$|Harith {{advocated}} various reforms, {{the most}} prominent being the full legal equality of the native non-Arab converts (mawali) with the Arab Muslims, echoing a long-standing demand of the former, in conformity with the precepts of Islam. This had been attempted twice before, by the Caliph Umar II (r. 717–720) and by the governors Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri and Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami, but both times the resulting rise in conversions and concomitant drop in revenue (as the numerous mawali {{would not have to}} pay the poll tax) put an end to this, leading to a first rebellion in 728 under Abu al-Sayda' Salih ibn Tarif. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> and individuals associated with this first uprising would also participate in Harith's movement. Harith was seen as a champion of the rights of the ʿajam (non-Arabs, especially Iranians), many of whom flocked to his banner, but he also had a large following from the disaffected among the Arabs themselves, especially his fellow Tamim and the Azd. Disaffection was widespread among the Khurasani Arabs due to the heavy casualties suffered against the Turgesh at the Battle of the Defile in 731, as well as the dissemination of anti-Umayyad propaganda by proto-Shi'ite groups. This was exacerbated by the resentment felt at the introduction of 20,000 Iraqi troops into the province {{in the aftermath of the}} Defile, and the parallel order of Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 723–743) to disperse the older Arab settlers from Marw to other settlements so as to improve their defence against the Turgesh.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{third of}} those aboard Titanic survived the disaster. Some {{survivors}} died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard Carpathia. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> shown in the table, 49% of the children, 26% of the female passengers, 82% of the male passengers and 78% of the crew died.

Although less than 10percent of first- and second-class women (combined) were lost, 54% of those in third class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished. The only first-class child to perish was Loraine Allison, aged 2. Proportionately, the heaviest losses were suffered by the second-class men, of whom 92% died. Additionally, among the pets brought aboard, three survived the sinking.|$|E
