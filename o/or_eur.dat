5000|$|EU {{regulation}} 2560/2001 {{could make}} non-eurozone cash withdrawals within the European Economic Area cheaper for eurozone customers, because euro cash withdrawals are regulated.

Because of the EU regulation, this makes EEA withdrawals in euros free of charge. For example, let's say that a eurozone card is used for a withdrawal in the UK. With DCC there are two options: processing the transaction in pounds (good exchange rate but a fixed cash withdrawal fee) or processing the transaction in euros (bad exchange rate but no fixed cash withdrawal fee).

40|$|Objective: To {{design an}} {{economic}} model describing {{the costs and}} outcomes for patients treated with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in current clinical practice in Sweden, {{to be used as}} a tool to estimate cost- effectiveness of the next generation of treatments. Methods: The model was constructed as a discrete event simulation (DES) model analysed at patient level. It contains treatment and outcome data for 1903 patients followed in the RA registry for biological drugs in southern Sweden between 1999 and 2007 [the Southern Swedish Arthritis Treatment Group (SSATG) Register]. Resource consumption was based on a survey of 1027 patients in the same region. Costs and quality- adjusted life years (QALYs) are presented for 10 (5) years, for patients with the mean characteristics at treatment start in SSATG [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score 1. 33, disease duration 12. 1 years, age 55 years], but also for patients with more or less severe disease. Cost and outcomes (QALYs) are discounted with 3 %. Results: The 10 - year costs in the base case amount to USD 336 000 (SD USD 64 000) <b>or</b> <b>EUR</b> 223 000, with a total of 4. 4 QALYs. Over 5 years, the costs amount to USD 208 000 <b>or</b> <b>EUR</b> 138 000 and QALYs to 2. 5. The results were most sensitive to HAQ level at treatment start, but also to underlying disease progression, age, and disease duration. Starting treatment at a lower HAQ level (0. 85) reduces costs by 10 % and increases QALYs by 20 %. Conclusion: This analysis is based on the longest available follow- up for patients treated with TNF alpha inhibitors and provides an opportunity to explore treatment strategies when new therapies become available using actual clinical practice data...|$|E
30|$|In {{the best}} case {{scenario}} (assuming our estimates are causal {{and there is no}} deadweight loss or substitution effect), this paper has estimated that the SIVP decreased the joblessness rate of university graduates by 8 percentage points. Given that: (i) there were around 38, 000 graduates in 200424; (ii) around one in four of these benefited from a SIVP (or 9, 500 individuals); (iii) the joblessness rate of non-beneficiaries was around 60 %; then the SIVP would have led to an additional 760 individuals in work. Further assuming that the programme cost approximately TND 1, 440 per participant 25 (or a total of TND 1, 140 x 9, 500 [*]=[*]TND 13.68 m), this implies a cost per job created of around TND 18, 000 (<b>or</b> <b>EUR</b> 9, 000). This compares to an estimated cost per job created by hiring credits in the United States of between USD 9, 100 and USD 75, 000 (Neumark 2013). Both the employment effect estimated and the cost-effectiveness of the programme thus appear in line with what has been found in the international literature.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{analyses}} {{influence of}} venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) investing on FDI inflow in the Czech Republic. There exist barriers in the Czech Republic, {{such as high}} investment thresholds, imperfect information or legislative barriers that negatively affect the PE and VC investment activity and prevent foreign investors from investing in Czech PE and VC. This {{is the main reason}} of the Czech Republic's little PE and VC market activity. Data on foreign direct investment (FDI) in PE and VC is distorted, though, as main foreign investors are investment funds with Czech managers who invest through vehicles established outside the EU for tax reasons. The solution that would contribute to dismantling the barriers of FDI inflow in PE and VC would be to create more favourable conditions for investing in the Czech Republic. If the Czech Republic pursues reaching the European average as benchmark, it has to fill-in a yearly gap in PE and VC investment of 0. 077 % GDP, <b>or</b> <b>EUR</b> 113. 2 million, according to 2007 - 2013 average figures...|$|E
