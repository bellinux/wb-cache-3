2500|$|Citizens of West Virginia {{were the}} first to notice a decline in the amount of Virginia big-eared bats in local caves. [...] The {{population}} of Virginia big-eared bats was estimated to be between 2,500 and 3,000 individuals in 1976. [...] The cause of the decline is thought to be human sport, including spelunking, and general human disturbance in caves inhabited by the bats, which have lower tolerance to <b>outside</b> <b>activity.</b> [...] The bats could also have been collected as a token for cave researchers because of their unique appearance. [...] Inhabiting mines have been shown to also result in a decrease in population. Deforestation also presents itself as a problem. The Virginia Big-Eared Bat eats a variety of moths, some 45 different species, but 77.8% of those moths grow from larva that are dependent upon woody, forest plants for survival. Destruction of this environment would hurt the bats through both the destruction of habitable areas as well as by lowering of the population of their prey.|$|E

50|$|American Shorthairs are {{intelligent}} cats who {{are interested}} in their surroundings. They will watch birds, other animals and any <b>outside</b> <b>activity</b> from a window perch. These cats are calm yet playful, and some enjoy sitting in laps. They get along with children, so they make good family pets. Even though they are social cats, they are still independent. These cats continue to use their hunting skills to catch insects or pests that come into the house. The American Shorthair Cat has a very strong play/prey instinct and they should have access to toys as an important part of their development. Being that they are working cats, cat play is extremely important.|$|E

Those women devoted their lifelong efforts in improving their social status and in fighting against poverty {{in their communities}} and their living regions. A woman named Kathy Selvage was a citizen lobbyist for years {{and worked in the}} fight against a proposal for a Wise County coal-fired plant. She says that Appalachian women are people of action. Lorelei Scarbro helped establish a community center in Whitesville, W.V. to encourage <b>outside</b> <b>activity</b> besides the home and workplace. This reunites them with togetherness and a place to convene about ideas and local build-up. Vivian Stockman is the face of the stand against mountaintop removal and has worked endlessly to spread the word through photos of the detrimental effects it has on the land that people call home. These women, among countless others have done everything they can to end the poverty and depression that has plagued their region for so long.|$|E

5000|$|Charles Cyril Lempriere (birth {{registered}} April→June 1870 [...] - [...] 24 January 1939) birth {{registered in}} Hull district, {{was a professional}} rugby league footballer who played in the 1890s, and 1900s, playing at representative level for Yorkshire, and at club level for Hull, as a , and was captain of Hull during the 1895-96 season, and 1897-98 season. In about 1899 he founded the Carteret School in Harrogate which, in 1902, moved to The Red House, Moor Monkton, near York. Initially he rented the premises from the Slingsby family of Scriven but, in 1916, he purchased the house and land adjacent. He believed the rural location was ideal for preparatory schoolboys, providing them with a healthy environment and space for <b>outside</b> <b>activity.</b> He included classics and science on the curriculum while also encouraging practical skills such as woodwork and gardening. The boys {{were involved in the}} running of a school farm which sold provisions to the school kitchen. In 1922 he retired but maintained a close contact with the school. His death was registered in Ely district.|$|E
5000|$|Kathleen Todd {{shared in}} the {{considerable}} wealth of the Todd family as her father {{made a point of}} spreading shareholdings amongst his children and to his wife (although the males got bigger parcels than the females). When Kathleen Todd and Moyra Todd were living in Hamstead their well-ordered household included servants and [...] "Brett the butler". Todd's personal interests included photography and gardening, which combined in her photographs of flowers. She {{was a member of the}} New Zealand Rhododendron Association, the Pukeiti Rhododendron Trust, and the New Zealand Camellia Society. Kathleen Todd read widely and was also interested in graphic arts and music. Entertaining guests with her sister, which had been a feature of London life, continued at Melling where she was known for her [...] "gentle but strong support, her great sense of fun and enjoyment in life, and the quiet hospitality of their lovely home". In 1963 Kathleen Todd underwent surgery, and all forms of <b>outside</b> <b>activity</b> were curtailed. Cared for by her two sisters, Moyra Todd and Sheila White, in her last years, she died at home on 21 March 1968.|$|E
5000|$|West Dallas {{originated}} as {{a community}} {{on the outskirts of}} Dallas. The community was founded in 1886. In 1909 the Thomas A. Edison School was built. Murphy Metals (later known as RSR Corporation), a secondary lead smelter processing company, opened a 63 acre facility and in 1934 started operations at the site. The process of secondary lead smelting melts the collected lead materials or, lead scrap, into metallic lead that can then be used to cast into molds. Significant lead emissions can occur from poorly controlled refining, casting, and drossing operations. The city of Dallas annexed West Dallas into the city limits in 1954. Before that year, many residents lived in an area lacking the basic services because they resided outside the city lines. Then in 1956 a 3,500-unit public housing complex was to be built just north of the RSR lead smelter facility. The southern edge of the public housing complex was located 50 ft from the lead smelter's property line. In 1968 the City of Dallas enacted an ordinance prohibiting more than 5 micrograms per cubic meter over a 30-day period. This act went unenforced because in the 1960s RSR Corp West Dallas facility released more than 269 tons of lead particles into the air each year. During that time few residents could afford the luxury of air conditioning, so in the summers they kept their doors and windows open to combat the heat, directly exposing them to the toxins in the air, even in their own homes. It wasn’t until 1972 that Dallas officials learned that lead could be finding its way into the bloodstreams of children who lived in West Dallas and the bordering community of East Oak Cliff. The Dallas Health Department then conducted a study of their own. They found children living near smelters had elevated levels of lead. Lead was able to reach their bloodstream through the air, soil and households in and around their living environments. In areas near smelters children had a 36 percent increase in blood lead levels. The city failed to take immediate action and in 1974 the city sued local smelters. The company agreed to pay $35,000 and install new pollution control equipment. This did little to resolve the problem because in 1983 the pollution equipment had still not been installed at RSR Corp. Pressure from the community on government agencies was beginning to rise. A citizens group appointed by the Dallas City Council, The Dallas Alliance Environmental Task Force, has this to say in a 1983 study “We believe the city had missed many opportunities to serve and protect the community at large and two neighborhoods in particular in relation to the lead problem we now address. It is clear that the State and Federal governments have also failed in their opportunity to regulate and industry of this type with regard to the general welfare of citizens.” Before that in 1981 public concern and pressure were raised after the West Dallas Boys Club had to suspend <b>outside</b> <b>activity</b> after one soil test showed the soil contained 36 times the level considered dangerous for children. The Club was later forced to close in 1983 due to high lead levels related to the years of operations of the RSR secondary lead smelter operation. After lengthy test and lawsuits and delayed clean-up action, partially government agencies fault, RSR Corp. was ordered by the Dallas Board of Adjusters to close the West Dallas facility. In the summer of 1985 an out-of-court settlement was reached between RSR Corp. and Fred Baron who represented 370 children and 40 property owners who were all affected by the lead emitted from RSR. The settlement was for 20 million dollars. However, with this settlement the land that the old RSR Corp facility used to sit on still contained large amounts of lead contamination dangerous to all ages of people. On May 1993 a proposal of the RSR Corp. site in West Dallas was sent to the National Priorities List, also named a Superfund site President Clinton’s administration then brought more publicity to the issue when in November 1993 an article written in The Progressive had this to say “West Dallas residents celebrated when the Clinton Administration declared last May that they live in the largest lead-contaminated Superfund site in the United States. Portions of one of the nation's biggest housing projects and five schools, all located within five square miles of a now-defunct lead smelter, are slated for cleanup (although Federal Environmental Protection Agency records indicate as much as sixteen square miles of West Dallas are contaminated)." [...] For the residents who had been pushing for years and decades to solve the problem could lay their case to rest on September 28, 1994, when the EPA signed Preliminary Close Out Report for the RSR Corp. Superfund site stating all clean-up for all the units had been completed. The EPA then signed a Ready For Reuse document in May 2005 declaring the site ready for reuse or redevelopment The EPA reported that the clean-up resulted in direct lower lead blood leaves of children. The community also benefited by having 400 properties 300 acre of commercial property eliminated of contamination.|$|E

50|$|Civic engagement, {{interpersonal}} trust, {{and television}} use - Social capital {{has been on}} the decline for years and Putman looked into why this is. One of the areas the study covered was television and its effects on social and civic engagements. Shah writes that Putnam found the more TV a person watches, the less they are active in <b>outside</b> <b>activities.</b> This is shown with the rise of TV in the 60s and the fall of civic engagements. They found that though news and educational programming can actually aide in a citizen's knowledge, but the lack of engaging in <b>outside</b> <b>activities</b> and social events hurts civic engagement in general.|$|R
