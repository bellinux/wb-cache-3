5|$|Long-standing rivalries {{result in}} {{numerous}} rematches, especially {{if one of}} the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> enforcers may fight {{at the beginning of a}} game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate the opponents. On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{achievements}} {{and support for}} Catholics were particularly praised by Bob Santamaria, the unofficial leader and guiding influence of the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). The DLP had broken away from the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the nation's main centre-left social democratic party. The split occurred in the 1950s during the McCarthyism scares, as the Catholic factions broke away to form the DLP {{on the basis that}} the ALP was too lenient towards communists. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> Menzies strongly backed Diệm was to gain further favour with the DLP and accentuate the divisions among his left wing opponents.|$|E

5|$|The {{issues of}} federalism, {{ethnicity}} {{in politics and}} state centralisation were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed {{to a decline in}} support for the concept of the state among Congolese people. Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism.|$|E

5|$|The {{aristocracy}} {{shared their}} power {{only with the}} Roman Catholic Church. The Church ruled by fear of damnation in the next life and of the Inquisition in the present, and consequently both upper and lower classes gave as generously as they could on all major saints' days. Many priests and bishops {{were members of the}} aristocracy. The wealth of the Church in Sicily was further enhanced by the tradition of pressing younger children of the aristocracy to enter monasteries and convents, in order to preserve the family estates from division; a large fee, or dowry, was usually paid to the Church to facilitate this, in the form of property, jewels, or money. Thus the wealth of certain religious orders grew out of all proportion to the economic growth of any other group at this time. This is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> so many of the Sicilian Baroque churches and monasteries, such as San Martino delle Scale, were rebuilt after 1693 on such a lavish scale.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the scope}} of a popular {{comparison}} that draws parallels between House and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Wilson is equivalent to Doctor Watson. In two-parts episodes such as Euphoria, Part 1 and Euphoria, Part 2, and House's Head and Wilson's Heart, Wilson's voice is heard narrating the story, while Dr. Watson is the character who narrates the stories in most of Sherlock Holmes novels. Leonard has said that his character and House were originally intended to play roles similar to Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes, respectively, in the series although he believes that House's team has {{assumed the role of}} Watson since the show has begun. Producer Katie Jacobs believes that Wilson and House both hide from mature relationships, which brings the two closer together. She has said that {{the difference between the two}} characters is that Wilson finds it hard to say no because he wants to please the other person. The similarities between Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson was also <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> made Leonard choose House over Numb3rs.|$|E
25|$|Geisel wrote most of {{his books}} in anapestic tetrameter, a poetic meter {{employed}} by many poets of the English literary canon. This is often suggested as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> Geisel's writing was so well received.|$|E
25|$|This is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> scuba {{regulators}} are generally constructed from brass, and chrome plated (for protection).

25|$|In 1962, Carleton S. Coon {{said that}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> Mongoloids have flatter faces than Caucasoids {{is due to}} the {{masseter}} and temporalis jaw muscles in the faces of Mongoloids being positioned more {{toward the front of the}} faces of Mongoloids relative to where these jaw muscles are positioned in the faces of Caucasoids.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> {{blood tests}} are not {{reliable}} for accurate peptic ulcer diagnosis {{on their own}} is their inability to differentiate between past exposure to the bacteria and current infection.

25|$|Size {{of youth}} {{population}}. “In 2010, {{more than a}} quarter of the world’s total population (27%) was under the age of 15.” Christian youth under 15 were the same as the 27% global average. But an even higher percentage of Muslims (34%) were younger than 15. This higher youth population is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> from 2010-2050 Muslims are projected to grow faster than Christians.|$|E

25|$|Trust law {{in civil}} law jurisdictions, {{generally}} including Continental Europe only {{exists in a}} limited number of jurisdictions (e.g. Curaçao, Liechtenstein and Sint Maarten). The trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in conflict of laws cases, for example within the Brussels regime (Europe) and the parties to the Hague Trust Convention. Tax avoidance concerns have historically been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> European countries with a civil law system have been reluctant to adopt trusts.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{base fabric}} {{on which the}} images are embroidered is a woven purple gauze, {{which may have been}} imported; the later replica sections are stitched onto purple twill or plain white silk. The embroidery threads of the original are z-twisted (right laid) and are sewn exclusively in backstitch while the replica uses looser s-twisted yarn and a variety of different stitches. The looser twist of the yarn may be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> the replica sections are less well-preserved.|$|E
25|$|If FID forces {{take part}} in combat, one of their first {{activities}} tends to be teaching HN personnel how to call for close air support and artillery fires. The actual fire may come from HN or FID resources, or a combination. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> fire direction is a priority is that experienced FID personnel will avoid firing at unknown targets, or firing at insurgents using civilian shields. Free-fire zones, such as used in Vietnam, can produce new insurgents faster than killing old ones.|$|E
25|$|The Reich {{education}} system {{is only for}} Germany; allied states and occupied territories control their own {{education system}}s.
