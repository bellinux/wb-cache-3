5|$|O'Connor {{stood for}} the Senate at the 1901 federal {{election}} in March and {{was elected in}} the fourth position, with 40% of the vote (electors cast six votes, with the six candidates with the highest totals winning election). The only Protectionist Senator from New South Wales, he was appointed Leader of the Government in the Senate, and {{was instrumental in the}} evolution <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>house</b> as subordinate to the House of Representatives, although he encouraged the introduction of legislation into the Senate.|$|E
5|$|These were no easy years, again, {{as former}} Afrikaner compatriots {{found each other}} on {{two sides of the}} {{political}} fence, in a rapidly changing world. As in his earlier life, Reitz remained a man of outspoken convictions, which he aired freely. As such, he came into conflict with the Smuts government, and in 1920 he was not re-appointed as president of the Senate. He did remain a member <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>House</b> until 1929, however.|$|E
5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. They said that if Hill's argument about {{the structure of the}} Act were correct, there would be the odd result that the court could hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements for candidates), but it {{would not be able to}} hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Constitution. They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it took for that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>house,</b> including passing laws and other activities.|$|E

5|$|If the Governor General of Canada {{is unable}} to give assent, {{it can be done}} by either the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada—the Chief Justice of Canada—or another justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. It is not {{actually}} necessary for the governor general to sign a bill passed by a legislature, the signature being merely an attestation. In each case, the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law. Two methods are available: the sovereign's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament; alternatively, each house may be notified separately, usually by the speaker <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>house.</b> However, though both houses must be notified on the same day, notice to the House of Commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the Journals of the House of Commons, whereas the Senate must be sitting and the governor general's letter read aloud by the speaker.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais studied under Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, the {{half-brother}} of {{the future}} William I of England, who was then Duke of Normandy. Other bishops educated at Bayeux around this time included Archbishop Thomas of York and Samson, Bishop of Worcester. Symeon of Durham considered St-Calais to be well-educated in classical literature and the scriptures; at some point St-Calais also acquired a knowledge of canon law. He became a Benedictine monk at Saint-Calais in Maine, where his father had become a monk, and soon became the prior <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>house.</b> He became abbot of St Vincent-des-Prés near Le Mans in Maine, sometime around 1078. As abbot, his only appearance in historical records is his upholding of the monasteries' right to some property, and his acceptance of a gift of property in the town.|$|E
5|$|Tatwine was a Mercian by birth. His {{epigraph}} at Canterbury {{stated that}} when he died he was in old age, so perhaps he was born around 670. He became a monk at the monastery at Breedon-on-the-Hill in the present-day County of Leicestershire, and then abbot <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>house.</b> Through the influence of King Æthelbald he was appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury in 731 and was consecrated on 10 June 731. He {{was one of a}} number of Mercians who were appointed to Canterbury during the 730s and 740s. Apart from his consecration of the Bishops of Lindsey and Selsey in 733, Tatwine's period as archbishop appears to have been uneventful. He died in office on 30 July 734. Later considered a saint, his feast day is 30 July.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} of Hanover {{was only about}} 10,000, and its provinciality eventually grated on Leibniz. Nevertheless, {{to be a major}} courtier to the House of Brunswick was quite an honor, {{especially in light of the}} meteoric rise in the prestige <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>House</b> during Leibniz's association with it. In 1692, the Duke of Brunswick became a hereditary Elector of the Holy Roman Empire. The British Act of Settlement 1701 designated the Electress Sophia and her descent as the royal family of England, once both King William III and his sister-in-law and successor, Queen Anne, were dead. Leibniz played a role in the initiatives and negotiations leading up to that Act, but not always an effective one. For example, something he published anonymously in England, thinking to promote the Brunswick cause, was formally censured by the British Parliament.|$|E
25|$|The four House dormitories have secret entrances, {{generally}} {{known only}} to members <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>house</b> and require a password (Gryffindor & Slytherin), riddle answer (Ravenclaw) or ritual (Hufflepuff) {{in order to gain}} entrance. Inside is the common room, which contains armchairs and sofas for the pupils and tables for studying and homework. There are fireplaces to keep the rooms warm, and students either relax here in the evenings or else complete their homework, but may complete their work in the bedroom. There are notice boards in each common room and at other strategic points throughout the school. The students sleep in their House dormitories, which branch off from the common rooms. Each dormitory gets at least two rooms; one for boys and one for girls (an enchantment prevents boys from entering the girls' area, although there is no spell to prevent the reverse from occurring). Each student sleeps in a large four-poster bed with bed covers and heavy curtains in the House colours, and thick white pillows. There is a bedside table for each bed, and each dormitory has a jug of water and goblets on a tray.|$|E
500|$|Born around 1080, Bethune was the {{youngest}} son of a knightly family, [...] whose name derives {{from the town of}} Béthune in Artois. His friend and biographer William of Wycombe said he and Robert came from nearby villages, which suggests that Robert grew up in Buckinghamshire, maybe at Wingrave where in 1086 the major landowner was the knight Gunfrid of Chocques, whose family came from the village of that name outside Béthune. Robert's eldest brother, also called Gunfrid, was a schoolmaster and trained his young brother in the same profession. However he died, and Robert had to make provision for his children. This done, he went to study theology under William of Champeaux and Anselm of Laon. He was a canon of Llanthony Priory before 1115, and was elected prior <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>house</b> in the middle 1120s. Before becoming prior, he was entrusted with establishing a cell of the priory at Weobley, which had been established by Hugh de Lacy shortly before Lacy's death around 1115.|$|E

500|$|Four Chinese constellations are {{contained}} {{in the area of}} the sky identified with Perseus in the West. Tiānchuán (天船), the Celestial Boat, was the third paranatellon (A star or constellation which rises at the same time as another star or object.) of the third house of the White Tiger of the West, representing the boats that Chinese people were reminded to build in case of a catastrophic flood season. Incorporating stars from the northern part of the constellation, it contained Mu, Delta, Psi, Alpha, Gamma and Eta Persei. Jīshuǐ (積水), the Swollen Waters, was the fourth paranatellon of the aforementioned house, representing the potential of unusually high floods during the end of August and beginning of September at the beginning of the flood season. Lambda and possibly Mu Persei lay within it. [...] Dàlíng (大陵), the Great Trench, was the fifth paranatellon <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>house,</b> representing the trenches where criminals executed en masse in August were interred. It was formed by Kappa, Omega, Rho, 24, 17 and 15 Persei. The pile of corpses prior to their interment was represented by Jīshī (積屍, Algol), the sixth paranatellon of the house. The Double Cluster, h and Chi Persei, had special significance in Chinese astronomy. Known as Hsi and Ho, the two clusters represented two astronomers who failed to predict a total solar eclipse and were subsequently beheaded.|$|E

2500|$|As Rivers {{notes in}} Instinct and the Unconscious, one manifestation of {{his lack of}} visual memory was his {{inability}} to visualise {{any part of the}} upper floor of the house he lived in until he was five. This visual blank is made even more significant by the fact that Rivers was able to describe the lower floors of that particular house with far more accuracy than {{he had been able to}} with any house since and, although images of later houses were faded and incomplete, no memory since had been as inaccessible as that of the upper floor of his early home. [...] With the evidence that he was presented with, Rivers was led to the conclusion that something had happened to him on the upper floor <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>house,</b> the memory of which was entirely suppressed because it [...] "interfered with [...] comfort and happiness". Indeed, not only was that specific memory rendered inaccessible but his sensory memory in general appears to have been severely handicapped from that moment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} addition, {{variation}} or repeal of {{any part of}} the constitution by the parliament under its constituent powers, is called amendment of the constitution.

In addition to this, certain amendments which pertain to the federal nature of the Constitution must be ratified by a majority of state legislatures. Unlike the ordinary bills under legislative powers of Parliament as per [...] (with exception to money bills), there is no provision for joint sitting of the two houses (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) of the parliament to pass a constitutional amendment bill. During recess of Parliament, President can not promulgate ordinances [...] under his legislative powers per [...] which needs constitutional amendment.
