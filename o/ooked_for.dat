Two modulation formats are studied, ON–OFF keying (OOK) and M-ary pulse-position modulation (PPM). The bit-error-rate performance improvement due to low-density parity-check coding is reported. <b>For</b> <b>OOK,</b> it is assumed that the coherent state signal has a random phase. For an average number of noise photons N = 0 : 1, the required number of signal photons per information bit is six in the case of coded quantum <b>OOK.</b> <b>For</b> the same level of noise (N = 0 : 1) and assuming that signal phase is known, coded 16 -ary PPM requires only 1. 21 of signal photons per information bit.

30|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} technique [7] that utilises on-off keying (<b>OOK)</b> <b>for</b> transmitting data using {{visible light}} is rather inflexible {{when it comes}} to sharing bandwidth among multiple competing users served by an AP that have variable rate requirements. The above shortcoming is addressed by utilising optical intensity modulation (IM)/direct detection (DD) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for data communication. Using OFDM technique [8, 9], the available bandwidth can be shared among multiple users by assigning each user a different amount of bandwidth corresponding to the user demand and the scheduling policies. Likewise, link adaptation can be carried out to scale the user throughput according to the prevalent channel conditions at the receiver. The composite baseband signal is modulated onto the optical carrier by varying the optical power proportional to the baseband signal amplitude in an optical IM/DD system. The fluctuation in instantaneous optical power is detected by a PD, which converts the received optical signal to an electrical signal, which can be decoded by the receiver. Even if LEDs that radiate in the visible light spectrum are used, the fluctuations in optical power are imperceptible to human eye but can be easily detected by a PD. As such, the LEDs can be used simultaneously for both lighting and data transmission.|$|R

Though still at an early stage, there have been growing interests and research efforts dedicated to this communication technology. It has been identified that diffusion-based communications {{is one of the most}} promising approaches for end-to-end communication between nanoscale devices in the near future. In this paper, the design of a binary digital communication system is proposed based on particle diffusion. Stochastic signaling through On-Off Keying (<b>OOK)</b> <b>for</b> random particle emission and a diffusion channel with memory is considered. The diffusion is considered in the cases of one, two, and three dimensions. The receiver detection problem is formulated by using an information-theoretic approach. The optimal decision threshold for the receiver detection is derived through mutual information maximization for two cases, namely, when the a priori probability of bit transmission is fixed and known to the receiver and when this probability is unknown to the receiver. Numerical results indicate that in the case of diffusion in one or two dimensions, the information of a priori probability plays a key role in optimizing the system performance, while it does not when considering the diffusion in three dimensions.

A small size and low power wireless active transponder implanted {{in the vicinity of}} the tumor with a magnetic tracking system placed outside the patient 2 ̆ 7 s body can be used to locate the position of the tumor during the {{radiation therapy}}. The wireless active transponder uses a magnetic sensor to sense the magnetic field generated by the magnetic tracking system, and then transmits the magnetic field information back to the computer wirelessly using on/off keying (<b>OOK)</b> <b>for</b> tumor tracking. One of the challenges faced by an implantable device is that the device must consume as little power as possible for prolonged battery lifetime or battery-less remote-powered operations. To significantly reduce the power consumption of the wireless transponder, various low-voltage low-power design techniques are proposed in this dissertation. These techniques include low-voltage designs, time-division scheme, a low-power low-area-penalty sensor front-end topology, and low-power voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). Using these low-power techniques, a wireless active transponder is implemented in 130 -nm CMOS technology. The developed wireless active transponder consumes only 912 μW, and does not use any area-intensive integrated inductors.

For phase stability, we use a quantum-dash mode-locked laser (QD-MLL) as a multi-wavelength source for the dual pumps, with tunability provided by the output filter. The significant sidelobes of the DPSK spectrum (relative to OOK) require the balancing of the pump proximity to the original signal (facilitating high conversion efficiency) with the signal degradation from the pump spectrum overlapping the converted DPSK signal.

This observation is indicative of a natural place to attempt a reduction in system power. Narrowband receivers in-particular can enjoy significant power reduction by employing high-Q bulk acoustic resonators as channel select filters directly at RF, allowing down-stream analog processing to be simplified, resulting in better energy efficiency. But for communications in the ISM bands, it is important to employ multiple frequency channels to permit frequency-division-multiplexing and provide frequency diversity in the face of narrowband interferers.
