5|$|Caligari did not {{immediately}} receive a wide distribution in France due to fears over the import of German films, but film director Louis Delluc organized a single screening <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> 14 November 1921, at the Colisée cinema in Paris {{as part of a}} benefit performance for the Spanish Red Cross. Afterward, the Cosmograph company bought the film's distribution rights and premiered it at the Ciné-Opéra on 2 March 1922. Caligari played in one Paris theatre for seven consecutive years, a record that remained intact until the release of Emmanuelle (1974). According to Janowitz, Caligari was also shown in such European cities as London, Rome, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels, Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Bucharest, as well as other countries like China, Japan, India, Turkey and South American nations.|$|E
5|$|Five {{individuals}} died in maritime {{accidents involving}} {{at least one}} catamaran. There was an accident involving a bus carrying evacuees, killing four people on board. Three people died on the offshore Ambergris Caye. Overall, 19 people perished in the country. Several injuries, mainly from flying debris, were reported in San Pedro, and there were 142 people who were injured in the storm. Throughout the country, approximately 3,279 homes were either damaged or destroyed. The damage total from Keith was initially estimated at $200 million, about half of which to tourism facilities; the remainder was roughly split between crop and infrastructure damage. About 75% of the crops in the country were damaged, including much of the corn harvest that was expected to begin in October. The damage total was later estimated at $280 million, most <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the offshore Ambergris Cay and Caye Caulker.|$|E

Reagan hosted two 2008 Republican presidential debates at the Reagan Presidential Library, {{the first in}} May 2007 and the second in January 2008. While she {{did not participate in}} the discussions, she sat in the front row and listened as the men vying to become the nation's 44th president claimed to be a rightful successor to her husband. Though some speculation arose as to whether Reagan might support New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a presidential bid, nothing came <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>On</b> March 25, she formally endorsed Senator John McCain, then the presumptive Republican party nominee for president, but McCain would go on to lose the election to Barack Obama.|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} {{employee}} empowerment {{is becoming increasingly}} important within the management literature. This paper examines the potential impact <b>of</b> emerging <b>ITs</b> <b>on</b> empowerment. <b>It</b> attempts to understand empowerment through the changes that it entails in an organization and to assess the role <b>of</b> <b>ITs</b> in relation to it. We argue that as empowerment is a conscious and highly political organizational choice, emerging ITs cannot be said to “empower ” employees. They should rather {{be seen as a}} support tool that can facilitate empowerment depending upon the larger organizational context and more specifically on the four main organizational variables; structure, culture, people and tasks and procedures. The form that these variables take in different organizations mediate the role <b>of</b> <b>ITs</b> and ultimately determine whether they will facilitate or inhibit empowerment. A conceptual framework describing the impact <b>of</b> <b>ITs</b> <b>on</b> empowerment is developed. From the framework we elicit some key indicators which can be useful in an assessment of the impact <b>of</b> <b>ITs</b> <b>on</b> a specific organization. 1...|$|R

5|$|M-114 was the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway and planned beltline in the US state of Michigan around the city of Grand Rapids. It was designated {{by the end of}} 1929 on various streets in adjoining cities and townships. By the 1940s, sections <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the west and south sides of Grand Rapids were given new designations and the segment along the east side of town was finished. By late 1945 the highway designation was completely decommissioned in favor of other numbers. M-114 split into two branches, one running east–west and the other running north–south. The east–west spur routing is now local streets while the rest is part of state highways.|$|E
5|$|After {{forcing a}} punt {{to open the}} second half, Alabama scored a {{touchdown}} on its opening possession with a 34-yard touchdown reception by Brad Smelley from McCarron. However, on the ensuing kickoff, Laron Scott returned it 95-yards for a touchdown to cut the lead again to 31–21. Alabama responded on the following drive with Richardson accounting for 46 yards <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> seven carries with a one-yard touchdown run for a 38–21 Alabama lead. In the fourth quarter, Alabama stopped the Eagles at the Crimson Tide eight-yard line after an incomplete Shaw pass on fourth down. From there the Alabama offense began a 15-play, 92-yard drive that took 8:36 to complete with McCarron throwing a four-yard touchdown pass to Smelley for the final points in their 45–21 win. For the game, Richardson had 175 yards {{on the ground with}} a pair of rushing touchdowns and one receiving. His one-yard touchdown run in the third quarter gave Richardson the Alabama single-season rushing touchdown record breaking the previous mark of 19 set by Shaun Alexander in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Fort 56 {{consisted}} of three wings, each surrounded by its own earthwork, stockades and a moat. Partially obscured by the trees of Brühl's Garden, the central wing was further reinforced by the St. Laurence's Church and the surrounding monastery. The fort, commanded by General Józef Sowiński, was manned by two battalions of the 8th Regiment of Line Infantry (1,200 men), with 40 sappers, 13 cannon, two Congreve rocket launchers, and a small detachment from the 14th Regiment of Line Infantry (170 men). Directly in front <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>on</b> a hill overlooking the battlefield, lay the smaller, irregularly-shaped Fort 57 manned by 300 men under Maj. Józef Krassowski, armed with four pieces of artillery and two Congreve rocket launchers. To the north lay Fort 59 (four cannon and 400 men under Maj. Józef Borzęcki), while to the south Fort 54 (up to 350 men under Maj. Ignacy Dobrzelewski and six guns under Lt. Julian Konstanty Ordon). Even though the remaining forts of Wola (Forts 55, 58, 60 and 61) were deprived of their garrisons to strengthen the defence, the most important Polish positions were still severely undermanned.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1942, the H-11, based on the H-3 was introduced. With the H-11, the Luftwaffe had at its {{disposal}} a powerful medium bomber with heavier armour and revised defensive armament. The drum-fed 7.92mm (.312in) MG 15 was replaced with a belt-fed 13mm (.51in) MG 131 in the now fully enclosed dorsal position (B-Stand); the gunner in the latter was now protected with armoured glass. The single MG 15 in the ventral C-Stand or Bola was also replaced, with a belt-fed 7.92mm (.312in) MG 81Z with much higher rate of fire. The beam positions originally retained the single MG 15s, but the H-11/R1 replaced these with twin MG 81Z as well; this latter arrangement was standardized in November 1942. The port internal ESAC bomb racks could be removed, and an 835L (221US gal) fuel tanks installed in its place. Many H-11s were equipped with a new PVC rack under the fuselage, which carried five 250kg (550lb) bombs. Additional armour plating was fitted around crew spaces, some <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the lower fuselage and could be jettisoned in an emergency. Engines were two 1,000kW (1,340hp) Junkers Jumo 211F-2, allowing this variant to carry a 2,000kg (4,410lb) payload {{to a range of}} 2,340km (1,450mi). Heinkel built 230 new aircraft of this type and converted 100 H-3s to H-11s by {{the summer of}} 1943.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, British ships {{continued}} to arrive. On August 1, 45 ships arrived with generals Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis, along with 3,000 troops. By August 12, 3,000 more British troops and another 8,000 Hessians had arrived. At this point, the British fleet numbered over 400 ships, including 73 war ships, and 32,000 troops were camped on Staten Island. Faced with this large force, Washington was unsure {{as to where}} the British would attack. Both Greene and Reed thought that the British would attack Long Island, but Washington felt that a British attack on Long Island might be a diversion for the main attack on Manhattan. He broke his army in half, stationing half <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> Manhattan, {{and the other half}} on Long Island; the army on Long Island was commanded by Greene. On August 20, Greene became ill and was forced to move to a house in Manhattan where he rested to recover. John Sullivan was placed in command until Greene was well enough to resume command.|$|E
5|$|Saladin besieged Tiberias in {{the eastern}} Galilee on 3 July 1187 and the Crusader army {{attempted}} to attack the Ayyubids by way of Kafr Kanna. After hearing of the Crusaders' march, Saladin led his guard back to their main camp at Kafr Sabt, leaving a small detachment at Tiberias. With {{a clear view of}} the Crusader army, Saladin ordered al-Muzaffar Umar to block the Crusaders' entry from Hattin by taking a position near Lubya, while Gökböri and his troops were stationed at a hill near al-Shajara. On 4 July the Crusaders advanced toward the Horns of Hattin and charged against the Muslim forces, but were overwhelmed and defeated decisively. Four days after the battle, Saladin invited al-Adil to join him in the reconquest of Palestine, Galilee and Lebanese coast. On 8 July the Crusader stronghold of Acre was captured by Saladin, while his forces seized Nazareth and Saffuriya; other brigades took Haifa, Caesarea, Sebastia and Nablus, while al-Adil conquered Mirabel and Jaffa. On 26 July, Saladin returned to the coast and received the surrender of Sarepta, Sidon, Beirut, and Jableh. In August, the Ayyubids conquered Ramla, Darum, Gaza, Bayt Jibrin, and Latrun. Ascalon was taken on 4 September. In September–October 1187, the Ayyubids besieged Jerusalem, taking possession <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> 2 October, after negotiations with Balian of Ibelin.|$|E
