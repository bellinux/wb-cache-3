5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race; these started the race fitted with the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. It was held in overcast weather conditions. Tyre degradation on the soft compound tyres was heavy; the drivers set their laps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> tyres during the first session and switched to softs for the two remaining sessions.|$|E

5|$|The {{threat of}} an Ottoman attack towards the Suez Canal had been {{considered}} by Lawrence in consultation with his divisional commanders, and a second defensive area was developed to address their concerns.

Any attempt to bypass Romani on the right flank would be open to attack from the garrison, which could send out infantry and mounted troops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> ground in the plain to the south-west. The New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade was stationed at Hill 70 at the end of June and the 5th Light Horse Regiment at Dueidar to prevent such an Ottoman force from reaching the Suez Canal.|$|E
5|$|Xbox One {{games are}} {{distributed}} at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store. All Xbox One games must be installed to the console's storage: users {{can begin to}} play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while {{the remainder of the}} game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer has access to the disc, the owner has the option of unlocking the install on their hard drive by purchasing it through Xbox Live; the installed game then acts as a game installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> drive.
