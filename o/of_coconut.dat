Kanak groups such as Bethela first made the recordings on cassette around 1975 or 1976.|$|E

5|$|Using her {{influence}} at The Miami Herald, Douglas wrote columns about poverty: You {{can have}} the most beautiful {{city in the world}} as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept... {{but if you have a}} weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part <b>of</b> <b>Coconut</b> Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents <b>of</b> <b>Coconut</b> Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.|$|E

5|$|The diet <b>of</b> <b>coconut</b> crabs {{consists}} {{primarily of}} fleshy fruits (particularly Ochrosia ackeringae, Arenga listeri, Pandanus elatus, P. christmatensis); nuts (Aleurites moluccanus), drupes (Cocos nucifera) and seeds (Annona reticulata); and the pith of fallen trees. However, {{as they are}} omnivores, they will consume other organic materials such as tortoise hatchlings and dead animals. They have been observed to prey upon crabs like Gecarcoidea natalis and Discoplax hirtipes, as well as scavenge on the carcasses of other coconut crabs. During a tagging experiment, one coconut crab was observed killing and eating a Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans). In 2016, a large coconut crab was observed climbing a tree in order to disable and consume a red-footed booby on the Chagos Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|The folk worship {{representation}} of Shashthi is a red-coloured stone {{about the size}} of a human head, typically placed beneath a banyan tree such as those usually found on the outskirts of villages. The banyan may be decorated with flowers or strewn with rice and other offerings. Shashthi is also commonly represented by planting a banyan tree or a small branch in the soil of a family's home garden. Other common representations of the goddess include a Shaligrama stone, an earthen water pitcher, or a Purna Ghata – a water vase with an arrangement <b>of</b> <b>coconut</b> and mango leaves – generally set beneath a banyan tree.|$|E
5|$|Adult coconut crabs have {{no known}} predators {{apart from other}} coconut crabs and humans. Its large size {{and the quality of}} its meat means that the coconut crab is {{extensively}} hunted and is very rare on islands with a human population. The coconut crab is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. While the coconut crab itself is not innately poisonous, it may become so depending on its diet, and cases <b>of</b> <b>coconut</b> crab poisoning have occurred. For instance, consumption of the sea mango Cerbera manghas by the coconut crab may make the coconut crab toxic due to the presence of cardiac cardenolides.|$|E

5|$|Amy was {{considered}} one of the worst typhoons to strike the Philippines on record. Making its initial landfall along with the concurrent eruption of Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin, the typhoon disrupted volcanic relief operations and forced the displacement of victims already displaced by the volcano. Cebu City suffered the worst impacts of Amy– most of the city's buildings were heavily damaged, and 29people died in the city. Strong winds and rainfall in the city associated with Amy also set records which still remain unbroken today. Damage there was estimated at 560million Philippine pesos. Along the east coast of Leyte, where Amy initially struck, ninety percent of homes were destroyed, and a large swath <b>of</b> <b>coconut</b> plantations were wiped out. In Panay, located on the western side of the Philippines, at least a thousand homes were destroyed in 41towns. Overall, Amy caused $30million in damage, and at least 556fatalities, though the final death toll may have been as high as 991, making the typhoon one of the deadliest in modern Philippine history. An additional 50,000people were displaced.|$|E
5|$|If we {{want more}} fish, we should shift that person who has a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out <b>of</b> <b>coconut</b> gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E

The marriage traditions include Soirik (betrothal), exchange of Paan Pod (betel leaves) during the marriage ceremony, which known as Badalchen (changing hands; formal acceptance of the promise made by the bride's father to the bridegroom's father that he will give his daughter in marriage). The bride is adorned with the Sado (wedding sari) and Pirduk (wedding necklace). Other rites include the Onpnni (giving away the bride formally by the father or the guardian of the bride), Porthoponn (re-invitation to the bride's house), and singing of Honvious (hymns).

5|$|On Samar, where Amy first struck, reports {{indicated}} that 27people died, despite initial reports that stated {{that there were}} no fatalities. In Iloilo City on Visayas, two people were killed and seventeenothers were injured. Property damage in Bacolod, Negros was estimated at $250,000, and 52people died, with an additional 2,250persons rendered homeless. Elsewhere on Negros, 30percent of the island's vital sugar crop was destroyed. On the east coast of Leyte, the typhoon was considered the worst in living memory, and ninety percent of homes there were destroyed. In Negros Oriental, schoolhouses in Canlaon, Vallehermoso, Negros Oriental, and Guihulngan were blown down. An aerial survey mission estimated that at least <b>of</b> <b>coconut</b> plantations were devastated; other coconut plantations throughout the Philippines also suffered considerable damage. Copra crops also suffered sizeable losses, though production was expected to remain at forecast levels. Tacloban's San Jose Airfield was severely damaged by the strong storm surge from Amy. In the Tacloban and Surigao Strait area, an estimated 146people were killed. In the Leytenian town of Abuyog, the mayor had announced that 176people were killed in the town alone. Another 135fatalities were confirmed in Sogod. More than 100persons were injured by falling coconuts and other airborne debris. On Leyte alone, damage was estimated at $8million. The Red Cross estimated over a thousand homes in 41towns on Panay were destroyed by the storm. More than 20percent of crops and infrastructure were destroyed. Four people were killed on the island. Upon looping in the South China Sea, Amy brought torrential rainfall to areas of Manila, though no damage was reported.|$|E
