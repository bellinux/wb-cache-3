25|$|They {{discover}} it {{on a nearby}} moon and destroy it by tricking the platforms to fire on their own power supply. On the station, Dax is visiting the Bajoran Temple to thank the Prophets for her pregnancy. Dukat, possessed by the Pah-wraith, suddenly transports in. Dax goes for her phaser but he hits her with bolts of energy from his hands and she collapses. He opens an orb of the prophets and the energy leaves his body, entering the orb which turns black. Outside the station, the Bajoran wormhole implodes. Dukat, back to his <b>old</b> <b>self,</b> apologises to Dax and departs the station. The crew of the Defiant are informed of the attack and rush back to the station. When they arrive, they are informed that the wormhole is gone and all the Bajoran orbs have turned dark. Bashir says {{that he was able}} to save the Dax symbiont but not Jadzia. She survives long enough to say goodbye to Worf. Over Jadzia's coffin, Sisko says that he has to leave the station and announces that he is returning to Earth.

25|$|When they arrive, {{they find}} a trail of dead rabbits is found leading to the camp, ending with Brindleface {{in front of the}} camp, who had been killed by Tigerstar. Fireheart orders a patrol {{to get rid of the}} rabbits. Brindleface's death shocks everyone, and after her burial, the camp is {{evacuated}} to Sunningrocks to protect ThunderClan. With Bluestar still mentally unstable, it is up to Fireheart to destroy the pack and protect ThunderClan. He and the senior warriors decide that a patrol of cats will lead the dogs to and over the nearby gorge, drowning the dogs. But, before he leaves, he apologizes to Sandstorm for not obeying Bluestar and they fall in love, but all they did was realize the existing love they had for each other. The plan works: each cat successfully leads the pack closer to the gorge, breaking away from the group once they lead the dogs to a certain spot, where a fresh runner lies in wait so they can lead the dogs to the next point. Fernpaw and Ashpaw, Brindleface's kits, took part in leading the dogs; they did it as revenge against Tigerstar for killing their mother. Fireheart, the last in line, keeps a good distance between him and the pack leader, until Tigerstar appears and pins Fireheart down. As the dog leader gets dangerously close, Tigerstar leaps away, leaving Fireheart to be killed by the pack. As Fireheart struggles against the dog, Bluestar, her <b>old</b> <b>self</b> returned once more, slams into the dog, releasing its grip on Fireheart and throwing the dog —and herself— over the side of the gorge.|$|E
25|$|Peter May took a well-deserved holiday {{with his}} fiancée, though the press {{did not think}} so, and Colin Cowdrey led the team against the weak Victorian team. He lost the toss {{and was forced to}} field in the 109°F/43°C heat and limited the fast bowlers Frank Tyson, Fred Trueman and Peter Loader to two over spells. Victoria did quite well and reached 270/5 in the day. A 21-year-old Bill Lawry opened the batting and made a slow 24 until he was bowled by Ted Dexter, the footballer Neil Crompton hit 73, Lindsay Hassett's nephew John Shaw 94 and Jack Potter 47. Trueman took 5/42 to dismiss Crompton and Shaw and {{returned}} in the morning to wrap up the innings for 286. The MCC responded poorly with 31/4, but Colin Cowdrey stroked 84 and Willie Watson 141 in a stand of 169. Watson looked much like his <b>old</b> <b>self</b> and batted with the tail, especially John Mortimore (32) and they finished on 313, the paceman Colin Guest taking 3/39. Victoria struggled in their second innings as Tyson (3/40) and Loader (3/29) found their form. Only Crompton (64) passed 22 and they were all out for 180. The MCC players were helped when the temperature dropped to 89°F/32°C half-way through the day. While knocking off the 156/1 to win Arthur Milton received a nasty ball on his glove which re-fractured his broken finger and he retired hurt for 35. Peter Richardson made 65 and 120 was added before the first wicket fell. Raman Subba Row and Ted Dexter both made 21 not out and the MCC won by 9 wickets.|$|E

The {{beginning of the}} song, implying that the singer destroyed her <b>old</b> <b>self</b> to become Gaga the artist, examines {{the loss of a}} private life and constant media scrutiny (noting that they are by choice). The track's central metaphor is a burqa as a [...] "veil of fame", sexualizing it with the line [...] "Do you wanna see me naked, lover?" [...] Montgomery said that criticism of Gaga's use of the word [...] "burqa" [...] is countered in the lyrics, when she sings [...] "Enigma popstar is fun, she wears burqa for fashion". [...] "Aura" [...] expresses Gaga's solidarity with what she considers her sisterhood.|$|E

Kenji Kamiyama stated that he felt the characters have obtained [...] "ghosts" [...] of their own and that Kusanagi needed a convincing story in order to return to Section 9. Shotaro Shuga noted that Kusanagi was more going back to her <b>old</b> <b>self</b> rather than showing the new strength she found when she left Section 9.|$|E

500|$|Lowell {{returned}} to the United States and began his duties at Harvard {{in the summer of}} 1856. Still grieving the loss of his wife, however, he avoided Elmwood, lodging instead in an area known as Professors' Row on Kirkland Street in Cambridge along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap. Lowell and Dunlap married in 1857. After the death of Lowell's father in January 1861 due to a heart attack, he moved back to Elmwood with his family. Despite avoiding the home for so long, he was pleased to be back. He wrote to his friend Charles Frederick Briggs: [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to feel more like my <b>old</b> <b>self</b> than I have these ten years". However, Elmwood's expenses drained him, with taxes at $1,000 a year. As early as 1867, he considered renting out Elmwood and moving into a smaller home elsewhere but never did. Instead, to ease his financial plight, he began to sell off land in 1870 until only two and a half acres remained.|$|E

500|$|Mac's {{redemption}} and self-improvement run {{parallel with}} his conversion to Christianity. Briley argues that [...] "the {{emphasis on the}} Christian family is stronger in this script {{than in any other}} Foote piece to this point." [...] At the urging of Rosa Lee, Mac begins to attend church regularly and is eventually baptized for the first time, along with Sonny. During a church scene, he also sings the hymn [...] "Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me", which serves as a symbol for his new direction in life. After they are baptized, Sonny asks Mac whether he feels any different, to which Mac responds, [...] "Not yet." [...] According to scholars, this response indicates Mac's belief that his reunion with God will lead to meaningful changes in his life. It is after this moment, Briley points out, that Mac is able to forge other relationships, such as those with his young bandmates, and [...] "develop his own potential for success as a man." [...] Briley also proposes that Mac's response — [...] "Yes, ma'am, I guess I was" [...] — to a fan who asks if he was really Mac Sledge suggests that he has washed away his <b>old</b> <b>self</b> through baptism.|$|E

The Fragrance Foundation's FiFi Awards named it the [...] "Celebrity Fragrance of the Year" [...] in June 2003. Several writers compared the theme of Still Jennifer Lopez's promotional campaign to her hit-song [...] "Jenny from the Block" [...] (2002), in which she declared [...] "I'm Still, I'm Still Jenny from the Block / Used to have a little now I have a lot / No matter where I go, I know where I came from." [...] Speaking about the fragrance's slogan, The New York Times wrote that it is [...] "a line that refers partly to her composure under the media glare but also serves as a pitch to potential consumers [...] It also evokes a song from her latest album, Jenny from the Block, in which she declares that despite fame, she is essentially her <b>old</b> <b>self</b> from South Bronx." ...|$|E

[...] This is quite the {{difference}} compared to the influence Ron's latest ex (Tammy 2) has over him. [...] While Tammy 1 has an ice cold personality and reduces Ron into submissiveness and quietude, Tammy 2 causes Ron to make highly irrational decisions that end up jeopardizing his position at the Parks office. [...] Tammy 2 also tries to assume control of Ron through using manipulation of her body. [...] Ron is saved from the grasp of Tammy 1 after his own mother, who is also ironically a Tammy- her name is Tamara (he refers to her as Tammy 0) to restore her son. [...] He snaps back to his <b>old</b> <b>self</b> after witnessing a drinking contest between Tammy 1 and Tammy 0. [...] They then drink in order to win control over Ron. Leslie also enters this competition in hopes of freeing him of the Tammys, however she ends up failing miserably due to the high alcohol content of Swanson family mash and is the first one out of the contest. In the end, Ron finally comes to his senses and stands up for himself and tells both Tammys to leave.|$|E

500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857, The Atlantic Monthly was established, and Lowell was its first editor. With its first issue in November of that year, he at once gave the {{magazine}} the stamp of high literature and of bold speech on public affairs. In January 1861, Lowell's father {{died of a heart}} attack, inspiring Lowell to move his family back to Elmwood. As he wrote to his friend Briggs, [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to feel more like my <b>old</b> <b>self</b> than I have these ten years." [...] Shortly thereafter, in May, he left The Atlantic Monthly when James Thomas Fields took over as editor; the magazine had been purchased by Ticknor and Fields for $10,000 two years before. Lowell returned to Elmwood by January 1861 but maintained an amicable relationship with the new owners of the journal, continuing to submit his poetry and prose {{for the rest of his}} life. His prose, however, was more abundantly presented in the pages of the North American Review during the years 1862–1872. For the Review, he served as a coeditor along with Charles Eliot Norton. Lowell's reviews for the journal covered a wide variety of literary releases of the day, though he was writing fewer poems.|$|E
500|$|Snyder's [...] "Death of the Family" [...] {{describes}} the Joker as {{in love with}} Batman, although not in a traditionally romantic way. The Joker believes that Batman has not killed him because he makes Batman better, and he loves the villain for that. Batman comic book writer Peter Tomasi concurred, stating that the Joker's main {{goal is to make}} Batman the best that he can be. The Joker and Batman represent opposites: the extroverted Joker wears colorful clothing and embraces chaos, while the introverted, monochromatic Batman represents order and discipline. The Joker is often depicted as defining his existence through his conflict with Batman. In 1994's [...] "Going Sane", the villain tries to lead a normal life after Batman's (apparent) death, only to become his <b>old</b> <b>self</b> again when Batman reappears; in [...] "Emperor Joker", an apparently omnipotent Joker cannot destroy Batman without undoing himself. Since the Joker is simply [...] "the Joker", he believes that Batman is [...] "Batman" [...] (with or without the costume) and has no interest in what is behind Batman's mask, ignoring opportunities to learn Batman's secret identity. Given the opportunity to kill Batman, the villain demurs; he believes that without their game, winning is pointless. The character has no desire for typical criminal goals like money or power; his criminality is designed only to continue his game with Batman.|$|E
