For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>colleagues</b> and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E

5|$|Despite their travails, Rejewski and Zygalski had {{fared better}} than some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>colleagues.</b> Cadix's Polish {{military}} chiefs, Langer and Ciężki, had also been captured by the Germans, {{as they tried to}} escape from France into Spain on the night of March 10–11, 1943 along with three other Poles: Antoni Palluth, Edward Fokczyński and Kazimierz Gaca. The first two became prisoners of war; the other three were sent as slave labourers to Germany, where Palluth and Fokczyński perished. Despite the varyingly dire circumstances in which they were held, none of them Stefan Mayer emphasizes betrayed the secret of Enigma's decryption, thus making it possible for the Allies to continue exploiting this vital intelligence resource.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the perceptual influence structure of school teachers in school organizations and to investigate the relationship perceptions of penetration and spread of principals' influence with teachers' evaluation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>colleague</b> group, task motivation, effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>their</b> educational activity and role expectation. The sample consisted of 53 school teachers. Main findings are as follows. First, teachers classified the principal centered influence style made their evaluation for <b>their</b> <b>colleague</b> group and effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>their</b> educational activity negatively. Second, teachers' perception on penetration of principals' influence correlated positively with <b>their</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>colleague</b> group, effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>their</b> educational activity and role expectation. The high magnitude of correlations obtained was interpreted as supporting the importance of interaction among members in schools...|$|R

5|$|Ever {{since the}} Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589), {{painting}} {{had become an}} art of high sophistication that {{was associated with the}} gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes, the others being calligraphy and poetry. During the Song dynasty there were avid art collectors that would often meet in groups to discuss their own paintings, as well as rate those <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>colleagues</b> and friends. The poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) and his accomplice Mi Fu (1051–1107) often partook in these affairs, borrowing art pieces to study and copy, or if they really admired a piece then an exchange was often proposed. The small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were often collected into albums as poets would write poems along the side to match the theme and mood of the painting.|$|E
5|$|However, the Americans {{were not}} {{counting}} on Thảo {{and his fellow}} Catholic Phát trying to seize power on an explicitly religious platform, claiming fidelity to slain former Catholic President Ngô Đình Diệm and promising to recall Khiêm from the US to lead the new regime. This caused alarm among the Buddhist majority, who had campaigned heavily against Diệm's discriminatory religious policies {{in the months leading}} up to his ouster in November 1963. Although they wanted Khánh gone, the Americans did not want Thảo and Phát to succeed, so they sought out Kỳ and Thi in an attempt to have them defeat the original coup and then depose Khánh. During the initial attack, Thảo and Phát tried to capture both Khánh and Kỳ, but both men escaped narrowly, although some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>colleagues</b> in the Armed Forces Council were arrested. Although the rebels were able to take control of Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the largest in the country and the military headquarters of South Vietnam, Kỳ was able to regroup quickly and retain control of the nearby Bien Hoa Air Base, using it to mobilize air power and stop the rebel advance with threats of bombing. Late in the night, Thảo and Phát met Kỳ in a meeting arranged by the Americans, where an agreement was reached for the coup to be ended in return for Khánh's ouster. By early next morning, the bloodless military action was over as Thảo and Phát went into hiding, and the junta voted to sack their leader Khánh, who was absent on a military inspection tour, thinking that Kỳ and Thi were on his side.|$|E

25|$|While psychiatrically {{oriented}} authors, {{when dealing}} with Hitler, were primarily endeavoring to diagnose him with a specific clinical disorder, some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>colleagues</b> who follow a depth psychological doctrine as the psychoanalytic school of Sigmund Freud, were first and foremost interested in explaining his monstrously destructive behavior. In accordance to these doctrines, they assumed that Hitler’s behavior {{and the development of}} his character were propelled by unconscious processes that were rooted in his earliest years. Pathographies that are inspired by depth psychology, typically attempt to reconstruct the scenario of Hitler's childhood and youth. Occasionally, authors such as Gerhard Vinnai started out with a depth psychological analysis, but then advanced far beyond the initial approach.|$|E

He intended to resign as Prime Minister, but only because it would automatically end the tenure of the other ministers: on reappointment he would form a new cabinet without Chipembere, Chiume and Chisiza, but with the addition of four new ministers loyal to him. On 1 September, he advised the Governor-general of his intention not to reappoint Chiume or Chisiza: he said Chipembere and Msonthi might also be dropped.|$|E

25|$|In 1853, the {{baritone}} Salas, {{explained that}} the works composed by Barbieri and Gaztambide, the former with 17 acts and the latter with 14, {{had been the most}} successful in comparison to those of Inzenga, Oudrid and Hernando, with 2, 9 and 3 acts respectively, which had resulted in failure or moderate success. Also, the evidence that Hernando and Inzenga were unfairly profiting from the work <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>colleagues,</b> together with the economic pressure from a few singers, forced an apport of extra capital and the restructuring of the society, being that Oudrid, Inzenga and Hernando were then excluded from it for not having sufficient assets {{to take care of the}} required capital. This situation cause Oudrid much resentment once he had fulfilled his task with relative success, that is, 9 acts in total. However, Oudrid's musical activity would continue, and years later he would give to the world about fifty zarzuelas more, among which were the El Postillón de la Rioja (1856), based on Adolphe Adam's comic opera Le postillon de Longjumeau, and El Molinero de Subiza (1870).|$|E

[...] Because all written accounts of the attack were by the French victims, their reports of cannibalism and parents being forced to throw their children onto burning fires may be exaggerated or apocryphal.
