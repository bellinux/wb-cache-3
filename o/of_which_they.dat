5|$|After {{the passage}} of the storm, four towns in New Zealand {{declared}} states of emergency. The New Zealand government provided about $80million (1988NZD) to the east coast region of the North Island for assisting in cyclone damage. $8million was used to create an East Coast Forestry Conservation Scheme, which was set to protect forests and prevent erosion. A study was taken five years after the storm, consisting of a group of 112people who were evacuated or received monetary assistance in response to the cyclone; the study showed 12% of the respondents as experiencing Posttraumatic stress disorder, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> reported a general lack of assistance and public support.|$|E

5|$|During the Kimmeridgian, Europe {{was covered}} by the shallow inland Tethys Ocean, with exposed landmasses being a series of {{scattered}} archipelagos. Highly variable sea levels supported a highly diverse insular crocodilian fauna, with biodiversity (that of atoposaurids in particular) being driven strongly by allopatric speciation. The two species of Knoetschkesuchus were part of similar faunas, in both <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> functioned as small predators ecologically partitioned from the other contemporary crocodilians; {{it is likely that}} these faunas originated through dispersal over larger landmasses. A similar faunal exchange occurred with the Wessex-Weald Basin of England.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E
5|$|Honeyeaters {{prefer to}} forage at {{individual}} flowers which have only just opened, as these {{offer the most}} nectar. As they probe for nectar, honeyeaters end up with large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their pollen within four hours of opening, and pollen is deposited on the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata end up with pollen lodged in the stigmatic groove, a prerequisite to fertilisation.|$|E

Those arrested are often not informed of the crime <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture {{if they do not}} confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that is, without the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E
5|$|In 121 BC, Rome {{came into}} contact with two Celtic tribes (from a region in modern France), both <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> {{defeated}} with apparent ease. The Cimbrian War (113–101 BC) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121 BC. The Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and the Teutons migrated from northern Europe into Rome's northern territories, and clashed with Rome and her allies. At the Battle of Aquae Sextiae and the Battle of Vercellae both tribes were virtually annihilated, which ended the threat.|$|E

They met in two finals, with Kuznetsova losing both: first in Berlin in 2007 and at Indian Wells in 2008, the latter <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> contested as the top two seeds.

When Socialist Action founded a campaign group, the Anti-Racist Alliance, Livingstone came to be closely associated with it.

5|$|The {{motivations for}} self-harm vary, {{as it may}} be used to fulfill a number of {{different}} functions.

There is also a positive statistical correlation between self-harm and emotional abuse. Self-harm may become a means of managing and controlling pain, in contrast to the pain experienced earlier in the person's life <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> had no control over (e.g., through abuse).|$|E
