40|$|SUMMARY- Thrombolysis with {{intravenous}} recombinant {{tissue plasminogen}} activator (rt-PA) is the first evidence based treatment for acute ischemic stroke, which aims to reduce the cere-brovascularlesion. At University Department ofNeurology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital, Zagreb, thrombolytic therapy with intravenous rtPA (alteplase) (Actrlyse") for acute ischemic stroke was introduced in 2004. We present our results referring to demographic, time logistics and clinical outcome data as part of SITS-MOST (Safe Implementation ofThrombolysis in Stroke- MOnito-ring STudy) and compare them with the results from other centers in Croatia and all other participa-ting centers. Up to now, 56 patients (61 % ofmale and 39 % offemale, average age 67 years) have been treated at our department with intravenous rt-PA (0. 9 mg/kg body weight, maximum 90 mg). with 10 % ofthe dose given as a bolus followed by 60 -minute infusion.

40|$|It is {{not easy}} to imagine that the essence of our being is {{enclosed}} in a single organ: the brain. In addition to its miraculous function, also the immensely delicate anatomical and chemical structure of the brain is astounding. In order to maintain its structure and function, the brain needs a constant supply of blood. If the blood flow is interrupted by the <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>artery,</b> the affected part of the brain immediately stops functioning. The brain tissue becomes irreversibly damaged within seconds and the area of irreversible brain damage expands in the course of several hours, resulting in what is called an ischemic stroke (figure 1). A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when blood leaks from an artery into the brain, which has the same detrimental effect on brain tissue as ischemia. Strokes usually take patients completely by surprise. In the normal brain, the input from all of our senses is collected, thoughts and emotions arise, and all voluntary body actions are initiated and coordinated, therefore all these functions can be affected by a stroke.

40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease {{that is the}} primary cause of myocardial infarction and stroke, which occur after sudden thrombotic <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>artery.</b> A growing body of evidence suggests that cannabinoid signalling plays a fundamental role in atherosclerosis development and its clinical manifestations. Thus, CB 2 receptors are protective in myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion and implicated in the modulation of chemotaxis, which is crucial for the recruitment of leukocytes during inflammation. Delta- 9 -Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -mediated activation has been shown to inhibit atherosclerotic plaque progression in a CB 2 dependent manner. Although CB 1 and CB 2 expression has been reported on platelets, their involvement in thrombus formation is still controversial. While several reports suggest that CB 1 receptors may have a relevant role in neuroprotection after ischaemic stroke, recent studies show the protective effects in various forms of neuroprotection are not related to CB 1 stimulation, and a protective role of CB 1 blockade has also been reported. In addition, vascular and myocardial CB 1 receptors contribute to the modulation of blood pressure and heart rate. It is tempting to suggest that pharmacological modulation of the endocannabinoid system is a potential novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of atherosclerosis. For these purposes, it is important to better understand the complex mechanisms of endocannabinoid signalling and potential consequences of its pharmacological modulation, as it may have both pro- and anti-atherosclerotic effects...|$|E

40|$|Cerebral {{ischemia}} {{has a high}} {{morbidity and}} mortality. It is thus a major challenge for physicians, society, and also for the research of underlying pathomechanisms and new therapy options. By definition, the cause {{of all forms of}} cerebral ischemia is a vessel stenosis or occlusion resulting in reduced perfusion of brain tissue. So vascular pathophysiological aspects and possible related therapy options have been investigated in various studies. 	For acute cerebral ischemia, which is mostly thrombembolic, cerebral blood flow measurements by PET and xenon computer tomography have long shown contradictory results about whether a hemodynamic penumbra is present a few hours after the occurrence of the stroke. The moderate spatial resolution of these investigative methods is problematic. Using indocyan-green video angiography with downstream calculation of relative cerebral blood flow indices and compilation of a blood flow mapping, we were able to demonstrate the penumbra with high-resolution in patients with decompressive craniectomy. Typical penumbra blood flow values were seen in 15 - 37 % of the exposed hemisphere. This method is also suitable for directly identifying critically perfused tissue intraoperatively, in order to monitor them specifically by means of various procedures (oxygen partial pressure measurement, microdialysis, cerebral blood flow measurement), and then to optimize the subsequent therapy. 	The induction of a focal cerebral ischemia by means of the thread occlusion method carries a 10 - 40 % risk for an undesired induction of a subarachnoid bleeding. By means of online recording of the regional cerebral blood flow by laser doppler flow measurement, we were able to detect an undesired subarachnoid bleeding (via a further drop of the cerebral blood flow) with high reliability. This enables early discontinuation of the protocol in therapy studies. Furthermore, three different occlusion models were compared: 1) tandem-occlusion of the Arteria cerebri media, Arteria communicans posterior, and Arteria carotis communis; 2) tandem-occlusion of the Arteria cerebri media and Arteria carotis communis; 3) selective occlusion of the Arteria cerebri media. We found high reproducability in all three models. The drop of regional cerebral bloodflow was less pronounced though in animals with selective occlusion of the Arteria cerebri media in peripheral regions, which led to a lesser development of ischemia in these animals. 	Improvement of perfusion by increasing arterial pressure or by improving the hemodynamics has never shown very promising results for treatment of focal ischemia. Stimulation of the collateral vessel growth also does not seem promising, due to the temporal limitation. So we investigated how much an increase of the intravasal oxygen transport capacity leads to a reduction of the ischemia volume. For this, we used a new, so-called 2 nd generation, perfuorocarbon emulsion that has a very high oxygen transport capacity. After treatment with 1 ml / 100 g body weight, the animals showed a ca. 15 % reduction of their stroke after permanent focal ischemia. 	In contrast to acute thrombembolic ischemias, the collateral network can be stimulated in chronic forms or in planned ischemias in the context of immanent operative or interventional invasions, in order to improve the hemodynamic situation. The only currently available technique for the induction of a collateral circulation is the surgical installation of an extracranial / intracranial bypass. The postoperative patency rate for a standard extracranial / intracranial bypass is reported between 90 % and 96 %. With the aid of the indocyan-green video angiography, we established a method that is cost-effective and simple to operate to precisely check the functioning of an extracranial / intracranial bypass intraoperatively. Through the possibility of a direct surgical revision, we attained an patency rate of 100 % in a total of 45 bypass procedures. Side-effects – such as allergic reactions – were not observed, so the method appears helpful for successful surgical revascularization for prevention of ischemia associated with the operation. 	As an alternative to the surgical procedure, the growth of a collateral vascular network can be endogenously stimulated. The protective effect of preconditioning has long been reported experimentally for patients with an immanent intervention that includes a temporal elimination of cerebral perfusion. In this, the cerebral tissue is exposed to a stimulus below the threshold for damage such as ischemia or hypoxia, and this then provides protection against subsequent damage. The primary protective mechanism has been ascribed to metabolic processes on the neuronal and glial level. Some more recent studies though were able to also show an effect on the hemodynamic level. So we investigated how much, after a hypoxic preconditioning, the leptomeningeal anastomoses are influenced, as they represent the main collateral supply after <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>artery</b> distal of the Circulus arteriosus Willisii. We found a clear increase of the vessel diameter yet without showing structural changes of the vessel wall. The structural changes found with increase of the vessel diameter of the leptomeningeal anastomoses tends toward collateralization and thereby contributes to better perfusion, as described after preconditions for focal ischemia. 	In the steno-occlusive cerebrovascular diseases, which are mostly arteriosclerotic, the cerebral vascular network undergoes constant adaptation, in order to adapt itself to the necessary blood demand. Besides angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, one of the decisive mechanisms here is arteriogenesis, which refers to the formation of a collateral network on the base of the pre-existing microvessels. The structural remodelling of the vessels here is induced primarily through changes of the shear-stress and an up-regulation of adhesion molecules. A key role in this has long been ascribed to macrophages, which secrete vasculotropic factors in the perivascular space. In a two-vessel occlusion model of chronic ischemia, we were able to show that the chronically reduced cerebrovascular reserve capacity completely recovers through stimulation of the number of circulating monocytes by means of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. These functional changes accompany an increase of the basal vessels of the Circulus arteriosus Willisii but above all also an increase of the leptomenigeal and intraparenchymal microvessels. These precapillary vessel segments constitute more than 50 % of the total peripheral resistance. Thus an increase of the collateral network and a decrease of the total peripheral resistance after treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor appears to be responsible for the restoration of the hemodynamic. 	A further special form of the cerebral ischemic lesions is related to the appearance of delayed ischemic deficits after subarachnoid bleeding. To date the appearance of these delayed ischemic deficits have been ascribed exclusively to the occurrence of a proximal vasospasm. Animal experiments have shown though that spontaneously occurring spreading depolarizations in connection with blood decomposition products in the subarachnoid space can induce a pronounced and lasting spasm of the microvessels. Using subdural 6 -contact stripe-electrodes, we were able to find a spontaneous occurrence of spreading depolarization after subarachnoid bleeding in 13 of 18 (72 %) patients examined. Frequently arising spreading depolarizations and above all a persistent extinction of electrocorticographic activity were associated here with clinical deterioration and the occurrence of delayed ischemia. The positive predictive value of spreading depolarizations for the occurrence of a delayed ischemic deficit was 85 %, which is clearly higher than the predictive value of transcranial doppler sonography or a digital subtraction angiography. So the occurrence of spreading depolarization after subarachnoid bleeding may, along with proximal vasospasm, very well be an important pathomechanism for the occurrence of delayed ischemic deficits...|$|E
