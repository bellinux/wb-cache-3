5|$|As {{a show of}} {{communist}} rule and Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were brought to trial in Moscow in June 1945. Their removal from the political scene precluded {{the possibility of a}} democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements. The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief.

5|$|Australia was {{particularly}} interested in developing atomic energy as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> with Britain on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share technical information with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} studies {{have investigated the}} territorial impact of Europe’s research policies, in particular {{the contribution of the}} European Framework Programmes to the integration of a European Research Area. This paper deepens the analysis on the integration and participation of peripheral regions, by focusing on the differences in intensity and determinants <b>of</b> inter-regional <b>collaborations</b> across three groups <b>of</b> <b>collaborations.</b> We consider collaborations among more developed regions, between more and less developed regions, and among less developed regions. Building on the recent spatial interaction literature, this paper investigates the effects of physical, institutional, social and technological proximity on the intensity <b>of</b> inter-regional research <b>collaboration</b> across heterogeneous European regions. We find that the impact of disparities in human capital and technological proximity on regional R&D cooperation is relevant and differs across subgroups <b>of</b> <b>collaborations.</b> Moreover, despite the efforts of integrating marginal actors, peripheral regions have lower rates <b>of</b> <b>collaborations.</b> JRC.

5|$|Matheos, Moore and Portnoy {{recorded}} the album at Carriage House Studios in Stamford, Connecticut from June 2 to June 9, 2002. Songs {{with a strong}} progressive metal influence were mostly written by Matheos, while Moore had greater influence over the vocal-driven tracks. Portnoy made minor arrangement suggestions but did not {{take part in the}} actual writing of the album. The album's recording sessions were the first time Moore and Portnoy collaborated since 1994 in their work in Dream Theater. In 2009, Portnoy recalled that he found the experience of making the record difficult, and that he was frustrated by the lack <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> between him and Moore. Differences between Moore and Portnoy led to his return on the follow-up album as a session drummer rather than full-time member.|$|E

In total, 40,000 Belgian soldiers and civilians were killed and 77,500 wounded during World War I.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin {{has written}} for the theatre, film and television, and in each medium his level <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> with other creators has varied.

He has a habit of chain smoking while he spends countless hours cooped up in his office plotting out his next scripts.

Several victims were ethnic Serbs suspected by the police <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> with Croatian authorities. Most of the victims' bodies were thrown into the Golubnjača Pit, a nearby karst cave.|$|E
5|$|Although it was series co-creator and {{producer}} Gerry Anderson's original plan to film with actual alligators, AP Films instead acquired {{a group of}} juvenile crocodiles from a private zoo in northern England; these would double as re-sized alligators on scale model sets and water tanks. With {{the exception of a}} five-foot (1.5m) specimen, which was too aggressive to be removed from its box, the animals were three feet (0.91m) long. The crew kept the on-set water tanks heated to a suitably warm temperature and used electric shocks to induce movement from the reptiles. They were unpredictable and very difficult to control and film, either bathing {{in the heat of the}} studio lights or disappearing into the tanks and remaining submerged for hours. To make the crocodiles more visible to the cameras, the crew fixed them to guiding rods and co-ordinated their movements. The heavy presence of the animals in both puppet and scale model shots resulted in a closer-than-normal degree <b>of</b> <b>collaboration</b> between the puppet and effects crews.|$|E
5|$|As the {{invasion}} began, the Germans pursued the fleeing Red Army, leaving a security vacuum. Reports surfaced of Soviet guerrilla {{activity in the}} area, with local Jews immediately suspected <b>of</b> <b>collaboration.</b> Heydrich ordered his officers to incite anti-Jewish pogroms in the newly occupied territories. Pogroms, {{some of which were}} orchestrated by the Einsatzgruppen, broke out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine. Within the first few weeks of Operation Barbarossa, 40 pogroms led to the deaths of 10,000 Jews, {{and by the end of}} 1941 some 60 pogroms had taken place, claiming as many as 24,000 victims. However, SS-Brigadeführer Franz Walter Stahlecker, commander of Einsatzgruppe A, reported to his superiors in mid-October that the residents of Kaunas were not spontaneously starting pogroms, and secret assistance by the Germans was required. A similar reticence was noted by Einsatzgruppe B in Russia and Belarus and Einsatzgruppe C in Ukraine; the further east the Einsatzgruppen travelled, the less likely the residents were to be prompted into killing their Jewish neighbours.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to give new {{explanations of the}} spatial patterns <b>of</b> <b>collaborations</b> focusing on the partners' connection process. Taking into account actors are embedded in an historical and socio-economical space, we first consider organizations can construct a new collaboration or renew an old one when they decide to build a research project with a partner. Then, {{going back to the}} moment when they initially connect with their partners through the analysis of the genesis <b>of</b> <b>collaborations,</b> we assume that they can turn to their interpersonal ties or to coordination resources. This process of connection may influence the spatial dimensions <b>of</b> <b>collaborations</b> regarding notably the literature linking the use of social ties and the spatial proximity effects observed in innovation activities. We test empirically these theoretical propositions through the collection of individual data about more than 200 histories of inter-company (IC) and science-industry (SI) partnerships. The qualitative and quantitative treatments of these data reveal the way partners connect each other and the spatial patterns <b>of</b> <b>collaborations</b> are significantly dependant {{to the nature of the}} partnerships. A strong regularity is nevertheless highlighted: for both partnerships (IC and SI ones), actors renewed prior collaborations in 57 % of the total <b>of</b> studied partnerships. <b>Collaborations,</b> Embeddedness, Spatial patterns, Social ties, Coordination...|$|R
