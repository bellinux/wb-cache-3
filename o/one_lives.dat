5|$|A story-driven game {{set in the}} 1960s, No <b>One</b> <b>Lives</b> Forever {{has been}} {{critically}} acclaimed for, among other things, its stylistic representation of the era {{in the spirit of}} many spy films and television series of that decade, as well as for its humor. Players control female protagonist Cate Archer, who works for a secret organization that watches over world peace. In addition to a range of firearms, the game contains several gadgets, which are disguised as ordinary female fashion items.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{interesting}} {{to pay attention}} to homilies from the doctrinal point of view and with the “gift of tongues”. For many faithful, the Sunday Holy Mass, with its Homily, is the only occasion where they will hear the message of Christ. With evermore renewed commitment, preaching will be very effective, above all if it is directed also at one’s own soul: if <b>one</b> <b>lives</b> what one says and preaches what <b>one</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is this {{commitment}} to man's dignity and relief of humanity that inspires the Ismā'īlī Imāmat's philanthropic institutions. Giving of one's competence, sharing one's time, material or intellectual ability with those among whom <b>one</b> <b>lives,</b> for {{the relief of}} hardship, pain or ignorance is a deeply ingrained tradition which shapes the social conscience of the Ismā'īlī Muslim community.|$|E

25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so much control is because he determines whether <b>one</b> <b>lives</b> or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control is because he is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much easier for him to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that makes it hard for them to leave.|$|E
25|$|The Ruta de Aventura connects ghost {{towns and}} {{abandoned}} mines with natural areas for hiking, mountain biking and ATV {{as well as}} other extreme sports such as paragliding. One of the ghost towns is Mineral de Pozos in the northeast of the state. The town still has its cobblestone streets with names such as Relámpago (lightning), Estrellas (stars) and Flores (Flowers). The houses here are abandoned, many in ruins and none with roofs. The town reached its height during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was called Ciudad Porfirio Díaz, but the mines later gave out and the population left. In 1982, the town was declared a Historic Monument Zone. Although no <b>one</b> <b>lives</b> there, tourism keeps a few businesses alive around the main square such as the Pozos cantina, which exhibits photographs and other memorabilia on its walls. Outside the town is the Santa Brigida mine which sustained the town until it gave out. It is marked by three large ovens with tall pyramid roofs. These were constructed by the Jesuits to work ore from the mine. The Ruta Arqueológica (Archeological Route) links the two pre-Hispanic sites of Plazuelas and Peralta which are currently open to visitors with two others which are scheduled to be opened sometime in the future: La Virgen de la Cañada in San Miguel de Allende and El Cóporo in Ocampo.|$|E
25|$|The {{natural law}} was {{inherently}} teleological, however, {{it is most}} assuredly not deontological. For Christians, natural law is how man manifests the divine image in his life. This mimicry of God's own life is impossible to accomplish except {{by means of the}} power of grace. Thus, whereas deontological systems merely require certain duties be performed, Christianity explicitly states that no one can, in fact, perform any duties if grace is lacking. For Christians, natural law flows not from divine commands, but from the fact that man is made in God's image, man is empowered by God's grace. Living the natural law is how man displays the gifts of life and grace, the gifts of all that is good. Consequences are in God's hands, consequences are generally not within man's control, thus in natural law, actions are judged by three things: (1) the person's intent, (2) the circumstances of the act and (3) the nature of the act. The apparent good or evil consequence resulting from the moral act is not relevant to the act itself. The specific content of the natural law is therefore determined by how each person's acts mirror God's internal life of love. Insofar as <b>one</b> <b>lives</b> the natural law, temporal satisfaction {{may or may not be}} attained, but salvation will be attained. The state, in being bound by the natural law, is conceived as an institution whose purpose is to assist in bringing its subjects to true happiness. True happiness derives from living in harmony with the mind of God as an image of the living God.|$|E

500|$|The Operative: No <b>One</b> <b>Lives</b> Forever is {{the first}} game in the No <b>One</b> <b>Lives</b> Forever series. It was {{followed}} by a sequel in 2002, entitled [...] In 2003, a spin-off of the first two game was released, entitled Contract J.A.C.K..

The game also focuses more on action gameplay, rather than on stealth.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, many reviewers felt that No <b>One</b> <b>Lives</b> Forever was the best first-person shooter since 1998's {{critically}} acclaimed Half-Life.

The Operative: No <b>One</b> <b>Lives</b> Forever was followed by a sequel entitled [...] released in 2002, and a spin-off that takes place during the time between the first two games entitled Contract J.A.C.K. released in 2003, both developed by Monolith.|$|E

[...] In an article written in 2009 (nine years after the game's release), Eurogamer states that the game has [...] "dated enormously but survives well", and that [...] "you simply couldn't make No <b>One</b> <b>Lives</b> Forever today.

[...] In a 2010 online PC Gamer feature titled [...] "Why you must replay No <b>One</b> <b>Lives</b> Forever", Tim Stone hailed the 10-year-old game's use of humor, and wrote that NOLF [...] "is every bit the amusing, inventive, life-affirming experience I remembered." ...|$|E
