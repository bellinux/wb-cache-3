During the liquefaction, cellulose, semi-cellulose and lignin are decomposed, which results in changes of acid value and hydroxyl value. The liquefied OPFW were characterized by Fourier Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The hydroxyl and acid values of the liquefied <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> <b>fruit</b> waste (OPFW) varied with the liquefied conditions. It was observed that {{with an increase in}} the liquefaction solvent (PA) amount in the mixture resulted in a high acid value and hydroxyl value for the OPFW. FT-IR spectroscopy analysis showed that the resulting biopolyol was suitable monomer for polyurethane (PU) synthesis for the production of PU foams...|$|R
40|$|The {{yield of}} Lentinus squarrosulus (Mont) singer was {{evaluated}} following its cultivation on sawdust from seven economic trees (Mansonia altissima, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Nesogordonia papaverifera, Combretodendron macrocarpum, Terminalia sp., Khaya ivorensis and Brachystegia nigerica). The sawdust {{in each case}} was supplemented with 20 % <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> <b>fruit</b> fibers. Good growth was observed in all the sawdust except Combretodendron macrocarpum. Between the control and each sample, differences in mean mycelial density were significant (p = 0. 05) but differences among the different supplemented sawdust media were not. Supplementation with 20 % <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> <b>fruit</b> fibers advanced the time of primordial emergence and enhanced the fresh weight and number of flushes of the mushroom. The sawdust giving the highest yield was Brachystegia nigerica while {{the one with the}} lowest was Combretodendron macrocarpum...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, effects of {{two types of}} natural fibres on {{mechanical}} properties of polyester composites were investigated at different volume fractions of fibre. Tensile, compression, and flexural properties of <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> bunch and <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> <b>fruit</b> fibres reinforced polyester composites were investigated. Additionally, tensile strength of the selected composites was calculated theoretically. Scanning electron microscope was used to observe the fracture mechanism of the specimens. Single fiber pull-out tests were carried out to determine the interfacial shear strength between polyester resin and both types of <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> fibre. As results, {{it was found that}} both types of <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> fibre enhanced the mechanical performance of polyester composites. At higher volume fraction (approximate to 41 %), tensile strength was improved, when polyester reinforced with <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> <b>fruit</b> fibres, i. e. 2. 5 folds improvement in the tensile strength value. Further, experimental tensile strength values of <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> bunch/polyester composites was found to be less varied compared to theoretical results. Flexural strength of polyester was worsened with <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> fibres at all of fibre volume fraction...|$|R

The research was conducted in one of the <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> estate in Putri Hijau, North Bengkulu from September to December 2005. The plantation lies on 75 m above sea level with physiographic of waving to hilly, 8 – 45...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Oil</b> <b>palm</b> (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is {{the highest}} {{producing}} oil seed crop on a per hectare basis in the world. Current estimates are that within the next decade, <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> will become the largest single oil traded globally. In this study, the stearyl–ACP desaturase gene (SAD) was cloned and thoroughly characterized in <b>oil</b> <b>palm.</b> Mesocarp tissue of <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> <b>fruit</b> at different developmental stages including 0, 30...|$|R
