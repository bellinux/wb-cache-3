40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{whether there are}} {{differences}} in the reliability of asset revaluations made by boards of directors versus independent (external) appraisers. We use a sample of recognized Australian asset revaluations. As a first step we examine the determinants of the choice between director-based revaluations and those undertaken by independent appraisers. We find that independent appraisers {{are more likely to be}} used for revaluations of land and buildings and directors are more likely for investments, plant and equipment and identifiable intangibles. We interpret this as evidence of firms harnessing directors’ knowledge of asset specificities. We also find that firms with less independent boards are more likely to use independent appraisers. We interpret this as evidence of substitutability between governance mechanisms. As for differences in reliability, we find that revaluations of plant and equipment that are made by independent appraisers are more reliable than those by directors. However, we are unable to detect a difference for <b>other</b> classes of <b>non-current</b> <b>assets.</b> We define reliability in terms of ex-post adjustments of recognized value increases. Reliability is determined by an examination of the extent to which upward revaluations are subsequently reversed. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the association between}} asset revaluations and discretionary accruals (a proxy for earnings management) using {{a sample of the}} largest 300 Australian companies. The results from this study indicate that the revaluation of <b>non-current</b> <b>assets</b> is positively associated with discretionary accruals. This finding is consistent with the argument that revaluation of assets reflects higher agency problems in the form of increased earnings management. Additional findings are that discretionary accruals are higher for firms reporting their <b>non-current</b> <b>assets</b> at fair values appraised by directors, than those of firms that use external appraisers. As well, the choice of auditors and the strength of corporate governance can constrain the opportunistic behaviour of managers in the accounting choice to revalue <b>non-current</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|R

30|$|Motor Freight Transportation: The WACC of the Motor Freight Transportation cluster was {{negatively}} influenced by intensity of investment and systematic risk and positively influenced by ROA. The Motor Freight companies show relatively low asset intensity 1. If, {{in the case}} of the Motor Freight Transportation cluster, LSPs’ share of <b>non-current</b> <b>assets</b> decreased (intensity of investment), CoC would then increase. A certain amount of <b>non-current</b> <b>assets</b> is inevitable to ensure the operation of an LSP. As described for all LSPs, systematic risk also negatively influenced CoC in this cluster. The positive influence of ROA on WACC is surprising but, compared with the other clusters, it could be ascribed to the “light” asset structure of LSPs in the Motor Freight Transportation cluster.|$|R

To achieve the above objective research questions were raised, hypotheses were formulated, and a review of related literature was made. In order to generate the necessary data for this study, data were sourced from the financial statements of banks and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statistical bulletin for a period of 15 years, i. e. 1995 – 2009. The data generated for the study were analyzed with the multiple regression analysis. Our findings indicated that, the unrealized gains arising from the classification of MS as current asset is a reduction to net income while the unrealized gains arising from the classification as <b>non-current</b> <b>asset</b> is a reduction to net asset. Based on the above findings, it was recommended that where marketable securities are debt instruments; they should be classified as current asset (temporary investment).
