We also discuss the main {{results on the}} spectrum problem on maximal partial <b>ovoids</b> and maximal partial spreads in classical finite polar spaces. 1 Classical finite polar spaces The classical finite polar spaces {{play an important role}} in incidence geometry. They consist of the non-singular quadrics, the non-singular hermitian varieties, and the symplectic spaces in projective spaces of odd dimension (see [7] and [27] for an introduction to polar spaces). The interest in these incidence structures follows first of all from the fact that they are classical geometrical objects. The study of substructures con-tained in these classical finite polar spaces also contributes to their geometrical importance. The substructures involved include (partial) <b>ovoids</b> and (partial) spreads. We survey the main results on these (partial) <b>ovoids</b> and (partial) spreads. The focus is first of all put on the known (non-) existence results on <b>ovoids</b> and spreads in classical finite polar spaces. Then the attention is drawn to the main results on large partial <b>ovoids</b> and large partial spreads. This is then followed by focusing on small maximal partial <b>ovoids</b> and small maximal partial spreads. After the discussion of these results, attention is paid to the spectrum prob-lem on maximal partial <b>ovoids</b> and maximal partial spreads. ∗The work on this survey article initiated while the first author was visiting the Justus...|$|R

5|$|Atrophic acne scars {{have lost}} {{collagen}} from the healing response {{and are the}} most common type of acne scar (account for approximately 75% of all acne scars). They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. Boxcar scars are round or <b>ovoid</b> indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Many of {{the known}} <b>ovoids</b> and spreads of finite polar spaces admit a {{transitive}} group of collineations, and in 1988, P.

Gunawardena has recently extended this classification by determining the <b>ovoids</b> of the seven-dimensional hyperbolic quadric which admit a primitive group. In this paper we classify the <b>ovoids</b> and spreads of finite polar spaces which are stabilised by an insoluble transitive group of collineations, {{as a corollary of}} a more general classification of m-systems admitting such groups. 1...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe free-surface and bottom-proximity {{effects on the}} added mass of Rankine <b>ovoids</b> of various length-to-diameter ratios were experimentally investigated by vertically oscillating the <b>ovoids</b> normal to their major axis. The results {{have shown that the}} bottom-proximity increases the added mass and the free-surface proximity decreases it. Furthermore, the added mass increases with increasing length-to-diameter ratio, i. e., for more cylinder-like <b>ovoids,</b> and approaches that predicted analytically for an infinitely long cylinder. Finally, an appropriate analysis based on the strip-method and the cylinder results has shown that the bottom-proximity effect on the added mass of Rankine <b>ovoids</b> may be predicted with sufficient accuracy. The prediction of the surface-proximity effect requires more refined methods. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

5|$|The basidiospores are {{ellipsoid}} {{and measure}} 12–16 by 8–9.5µm. Basidia are 20–35 by 7–15µm and usually four-spored, but sometimes two-spored basidia can occur. Pleurocystidia are 60–90 by 20–50µm with variable morphology: club-shaped, fusiform, <b>ovoid,</b> and sometimes {{with a small}} apical papilla. Cheilocystidia are 55–100 by 15–40µm with similar morphology to the pleurocystidia; they completely cover the gill edge. The cap cuticle (pileipellis) is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae wide embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia are sometimes present, measuring 70–180 by 10–25µm; they are mostly cylindrical. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The classic legionary scutum, a convex {{rectangular}} shield, also disappeared {{during the}} 3rd century. All troops except archers adopted large, wide, usually dished, <b>ovoid</b> (or sometimes round) shields. These shields were still called Scuta or Clipei, despite {{the difference in}} shape. Shields, from examples found at Dura Europos and Nydam, were of vertical plank construction, the planks glued, and mostly faced inside and out with painted leather. The edges of the shield were bound with stitched rawhide, which shrank as it dried improving structural cohesion.|$|E
5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{two pairs}} of glands usually positioned behind {{the left and right}} lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat <b>ovoid</b> that resembles a lentil seed, usually about 6mm long and 3 to 4mm wide, and 1 to 2mm anteroposteriorly. There are typically four parathyroid glands. The two parathyroid glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid glands, while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands. Healthy parathyroid glands generally weigh about 30mg in men and 35mg in women. These glands are not visible or able to be felt during examination of the neck.|$|E

5|$|The {{spore print}} is brown. Spores {{typically}} measure 8.0–9.0 by 4.0–5.5µm, {{and have an}} ellipsoid to oblong to <b>ovoid</b> shape, depending on the viewing angle. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 24–40 by 7–12µm. The cheilochrysocystidia (found on the gill edge) are club-shaped, measuring 30–55 by 4–40µm, with a neck that is 2–5µm wide. Pleurochrysocystidia (on the gill face) are 40–60 by 5–18µm with a 2–4µm-wide neck. Clamp connections are abundant in all tissues of S.caerulea. The fungus produces acanthocytes, which are spiny cells produced on short branches on the mycelium.|$|E
5|$|This group {{contains}} {{shallots and}} potato onions, {{also referred to}} as multiplier onions. The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly <b>ovoid</b> to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} ankylosaur osteoderms was {{published}} in 2000, and reviewed the armour of Struthiosaurinae. The group was represented by the single genus Struthiosaurus, known from head, cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal scutes. Only a few head osteoderms were identified, so it is unknown {{how much of the}} skull was armoured. Many cervical and dorsal scutes have been preserved alongside species of Struthiosaurus. They include cervical bands, which are groups of osteoderms fused together and attached to the vertebrae, and large spines found on the shoulders of nodosaurids like Sauropelta and Edmontonia, although it is not known if the spines were fused like the later of separate like the former. It is quite possible that small <b>ovoid</b> scutes found on Struthiosaurus could have formed a pelvic shield like polacanthids. The caudal scutes of struthiosaurines are small and rough. Even though osteoderms are well-known, it is not certain where they were positioned on the body.|$|E

5|$|All major moons {{comprise}} {{approximately equal}} amounts rock and ice, except Miranda, {{which is made}} primarily of ice. The ice component may include ammonia and carbon dioxide. Their surfaces are heavily cratered, though all of them (except Umbriel) show signs of endogenic resurfacing {{in the form of}} lineaments (canyons) and, in the case of Miranda, <b>ovoid</b> race-track like structures called coronae. Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are likely responsible for the origin of the coronae. Ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters, while Umbriel's appears oldest. A past 3:1 orbital resonance between Miranda and Umbriel and a past 4:1 resonance between Ariel and Titania are thought to be responsible for the heating that caused substantial endogenic activity on Miranda and Ariel.|$|E
5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more <b>ovoid</b> than circular, is another good example of the design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|Crocodylomorphs are {{abundant}} in the Mussentuchit deposits, being represented largely by teeth. The largest known teeth have been referred to the Pholidosauridae; they are broad with rounded bases, {{and some of them}} bear longitudinal ridges. These large crocodilians would have been capable of preying upon at least juvenile Eolambia at the water's edge. The abundance of juvenile Eolambia specimens in the lakeside fossil material supports this hypothesis; larger Eolambia would have been invulnerable to crocodilians. Smaller crocodilian teeth are also present, with two distinct morphotypes: an <b>ovoid</b> form bearing ridges, which has been referred to two different species of Bernissartia; and a compressed, triangular form bearing heavy ornamentation, which has been attributed to the Atoposauridae. However, given the uniform small size of these teeth, and the co-occurrence of these morphotypes in some crocodilians, they may belong to the same species.|$|E

5|$|He {{then set}} about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the {{geometrical}} rate law and assuming an egg-shaped <b>ovoid</b> orbit. After approximately 40 failed attempts, in early 1605 he at last hit upon {{the idea of}} an ellipse, which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked. Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data, he immediately concluded that all planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus—Kepler's first law of planetary motion. Because he employed no calculating assistants, however, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars. By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for Astronomia nova, though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs.|$|E
