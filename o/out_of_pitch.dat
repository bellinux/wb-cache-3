[...] Fascinated by the social world, his work ranges across many fields of study, from economics and politics to philosophy and psychology, and while he is considered a writer obsessed with dark themes, he is not himself a pessimist, saying, [...] "No artist, no creator, ever sets forth without hope, even if the thing they create appears to be carved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> black despair." ...|$|E
50|$|Early EMG pickup {{designs were}} made with a bar magnet inside for two reasons. The first {{reason is that the}} pole pieces had too much {{magnetism}} on the strings and could cause some lower notes to go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> in a Doppler effect. The second reason is that the pole pieces can make tuning and placement of the strings much more difficult. Using the bar magnet however gave the strings a more balanced output. The design of the bar magnet gives it a smoother distortion, better sustain through the amplifier, and have less fade onto the strings than the design of pole pieces.|$|E
5000|$|The natural horn {{has several}} gaps in its {{harmonic}} range. To play chromatically, {{in addition to}} crooking the instrument into the right key, two additional techniques are required: bending and hand-stopping. Bending a note is achieved by modifying the embouchure to raise or lower the pitch fractionally, and compensates for the slightly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> [...] "wolf tones" [...] which all brass instruments have. Hand-stopping is a technique whereby the player can modify the pitch of a note by up to a semitone (or sometimes slightly more) by inserting a cupped hand into the bell. Both change the timbre {{as well as the}} pitch.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{suggest that}} {{individuals}} {{are capable of}} automatically detecting a difference or anomaly in a melody such as an <b>out</b> <b>of</b> tune <b>pitch</b> which does not fit with their previous music experience. This automatic processing occurs in the secondary auditory cortex. Brattico, Tervaniemi, Naatanen, and Peretz (2006) performed one such study {{to determine if the}} detection of tones that do not fit an individual's expectations can occur automatically. They recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in nonmusicians as they were presented unfamiliar melodies with either an <b>out</b> <b>of</b> tune <b>pitch</b> or an <b>out</b> <b>of</b> key <b>pitch</b> while participants were either distracted from the sounds or attending to the melody. Both conditions revealed an early frontal negativity independent of where attention was directed. This negativity originated in the auditory cortex, more precisely in the supratemporal lobe (which corresponds with the secondary auditory cortex) with greater activity from the right hemisphere. The negativity response was larger for <b>pitch</b> that was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> tune than that which was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> key. Ratings of musical incongruity were higher for <b>out</b> <b>of</b> tune <b>pitch</b> melodies than for <b>out</b> <b>of</b> key <b>pitch.</b> In the focused attention condition, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> key and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> tune <b>pitches</b> produced late parietal positivity. The findings of Brattico et al. (2006) suggest that there is automatic and rapid processing of melodic properties in the secondary auditory cortex. The findings that pitch incongruities were detected automatically, even in processing unfamiliar melodies, suggests that there is an automatic comparison of incoming information with long term knowledge of musical scale properties, such as culturally influenced rules of musical properties (common chord progressions, scale patterns, etc.) and individual expectations of how the melody should proceed. The auditory area processes the sound of the music. The auditory area is located in the temporal lobe. The temporal lobe deals with the recognition and perception of auditory stimuli, memory, and speech (Kinser, 2012).|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} subroutine of self-monitoring during speech {{production is}} to detect any deviance between expected and actual auditory feedback. Here we investigated the associated neural dynamics using MEG recording in mental-imagery-of-speech paradigms. Participants covertly articulated the vowel /a/; their own (individually recorded) speech was played back, with parametric manipulation using four levels of pitch shift, crossed with four levels of onset delay. A nonmonotonic function {{was observed in}} early auditory responses when the onset delay was shorter than 100 msec: Suppression was observed for normal playback, but enhancement for pitch-shifted playback; however, the magnitude of enhancement decreased at the largest level of pitch shift that was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> range for normal conversion, as suggested in two behavioral experiments. No difference was observed among different types of playback when the onset delay was longer than 100 msec. These {{results suggest that the}} prediction suppresses the response to normal feedback, which mediates source monitoring. When auditory feedback does not match the prediction, an "error term" is generated, which underlies deviance detection. We argue that, based on the observed nonmonotonic function, a frequency window (addressing spectral difference) and a time window (constraining temporal difference) jointly regulate the comparison between prediction and feedback in speech...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for the {{statistical}} characterisation <b>of</b> melodic <b>pitch</b> contours, {{and apply it to}} automatic melody extraction from polyphonic music signals. Within the context <b>of</b> melody extraction, <b>pitch</b> contours represent time and frequency continuous sequences <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> candidates <b>out</b> <b>of</b> which the melody must be selected. In previous studies we presented a melody extraction algorithm in which contour features are used in a heuristic manner to filter out non-melodic contours. In our current work, we present a method for the statistical modelling of these features, and propose an algorithm for melody extraction based on the obtained model. The algorithm exploits the learned model to compute a “melodiness ” index for each pitch contour, which is then used to select the melody <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all <b>pitch</b> contours generated for an excerpt of polyphonic music. The proposed approach has the advantage that new contour features can be easily incorporated into the model without the need to manually devise rules to address each feature individually. The method is evaluated in the context of melody extraction and obtains promising results, performing comparably to a state-of-the-art heuristic-based algorithm. 1...|$|R
