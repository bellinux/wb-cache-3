5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E

40|$|This letter {{explains}} that density <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> mass <b>and</b> negative mass is almost uniformly {{throughout the whole}} universe, but density <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> mass <b>and</b> negative mass included in a random universe radius R can be different from each other. Like this, positive, zero, negative values of total gravitational potential energy are all possible due to density difference <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> mass <b>and</b> negative mass included in a random universe radius R. This letter is showing possibility in explaining the decelerating expansion and accelerating expansion due to density difference <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> mass <b>and</b> negative mass because negative mass <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> mass conducts different forms of movement depending on the density difference <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> mass <b>and</b> negative mass. As change of total gravitational potential energy sign occurs from UT= 0 and total gravitational potential energy oscillates based on 0.

5|$|Of {{the four}} {{fundamental}} interactions, gravitation is dominant at cosmological length scales, including galaxies and larger-scale structures. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, the effects <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on cosmological length scales. The remaining two interactions, {{the weak and}} strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia {{is often}} {{described}} in terms <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also typically related {{to the content of}} the delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} {{and range of}} the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a non-neutral plasma. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged particle beams, an electron cloud in a Penning trap and positron plasmas.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{the social}} {{interaction}} model, we examine the mediating role that the customer’s display <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> emotions plays {{on the relationship between}} the employee’s display <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> emotions <b>and</b> the employee’s <b>positive</b> mood. We also examine the moderating role that the customer’s personality traits—agreeableness, extraversion, and emotional stability—play on the relationship between the employee’s display <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> emotions <b>and</b> the customer’s display <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> emotions. The results show that the customer’s display <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> emotions mediates the relation-ship between the employee’s display <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> emotions <b>and</b> the employee’s <b>positive</b> mood. In addition, the customer’s personality traits moderate the relationship between the employee’s display <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> emotions <b>and</b> the customer’s display <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> emotions. The customer’s display <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> emotions depends less on the employee’s display <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> emotions when the customer has high levels of agreeableness and emotional stability than when the customer has low levels of agreeableness and emotional stability...|$|R

5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative {{in the case of}} a global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, {{in the case of a}} local alignment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1700s, Francis Hauksbee and French chemist Charles François de Fay {{independently}} discovered {{what they believed}} were two kinds of frictional electricity—one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, vitreous and resinous, that are separated by friction, and that neutralize each other when combined. American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion. A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (-). He gave them the modern charge nomenclature <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative respectively. Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive, {{but he did not}} correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the charge carrier, and which situation was a deficit.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed {{to know the}} use <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> reward <b>and</b> {{punishment}} conducted by the teachers in managing English classroom. The research questions of the study are {{to find out what}} kind <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> reward <b>and</b> punishment used, how the implementations, and what the outcomes <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> reward <b>and</b> punisment used in managing english classroom. The subject of this study is a teacher and students of MTs Jabal Noer Geluran Taman-Sidoarjo. This study used mixed method research. To collect the data, the study used classroom observation, student teacher’s interview, and documentation. Classroom observation checklist and student teacher’s interview are the instruments to collect the data. Some steps used to analyze the data; those are data reduction, data display¸ data transformation, data correlation, data consolidation, data comparison and data integration. The result of the study show that in managing classroom the teacher always used token reinforces as a kind <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> reward <b>and</b> fine/ penalty as the positive punishment. In the implementation <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> reward <b>and</b> punishment the teacher meet with some categories of good implementation such as deliver it fairly, timely, immediately and so on. As the outcomes <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> reward <b>and</b> punishment, the study shows that it gives many outcomes to students and the learning process. Some of the outcomes are <b>positive</b> reward <b>and</b> punishment could make the students be more discipline, responsible and motivated in learning English. It also gives the teacher a great help in managing the classroom...|$|R

25|$|Religion {{may also}} provide coping skills {{to deal with}} stressors, or demands {{perceived}} as straining. Pargament’s three primary styles of religious coping are 1) self-directing, characterized by self-reliance and acknowledgement of God, 2) deferring, {{in which a person}} passively attributes responsibility to God, and 3) collaborative, which involves an active partnership between the individual and God and is most commonly associated with positive adjustment. This model of religious coping has been criticized for its over-simplicity and failure to take into account other factors, such as level of religiosity, specific religion, and type of stressor. Additional work by Pargament involves a detailed delineation <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative forms of religious coping, captured in the BREIF-RCOPE questionnaire which have been linked to a range <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative psychological outcomes.|$|E

25|$|A general {{inability}} to control affective states may impair the conditioning of behaviour associated with rewards and punishment, may increase susceptibility to biasing by substance-related cues, and could tax self-regulatory capacity. Such conditions may render individuals unable to interrupt automatic drug-seeking behaviours. Abnormal levels <b>of</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative affect {{can be increased}} by low effortful control.
