40|$|<b>Optical</b> data <b>storage</b> is an {{important}} and critical part of optical information technology in which case photons rather than electrons are used for information generation, processing, transmission and storage. We have witnessed the revolution of photonics in optical communications. The advance in photonic chips will allow {{for the development of}} ultrafast optical signal generation and processing. While <b>optical</b> data <b>storage</b> such as the optical compact (CD) disk, digital video (DVD) disk and Blue-ray disk technologies has transformed our society in the last two decades, the development in this area has been slow down and seemingly become less active due to the fast development of flush memory and hard disks. However, the <b>optical</b> data <b>storage</b> technology has held its distinctive advantages of long lifetime, low-energy consumption, and ultra-secure encryption [1 - 3]. Nanophotonics that is the integration of photonics and nano-materials has extended <b>optical</b> data <b>storage</b> from three-dimensions to five dimensions or more [1, 2].

500|$|Firstly {{conceived}} and still used today for <b>optical</b> <b>storage</b> devices (CD-RW drives, DVD drives, etc.), several manufacturers offer external portable USB hard disk drives, or empty enclosures for disk drives.

These external drives typically include a [...] "translating device" [...] that bridges between a drive's interface to a USB interface port. Functionally, the drive appears to the user much like an internal drive. Other competing standards for external drive connectivity include eSATA, ExpressCard, FireWire (IEEE 1394), and most recently Thunderbolt.|$|E

2500|$|Diffraction {{can create}} [...] "rainbow" [...] colors when {{illuminated}} {{by a wide}} spectrum (e.g., continuous) light source. The sparkling effects from the closely spaced narrow tracks on <b>optical</b> <b>storage</b> disks such as CDs or DVDs are an example, while the similar rainbow effects caused by thin layers of oil (or gasoline, etc.) on water are not caused by a grating, but rather by interference effects in reflections from the closely spaced transmissive layers (see Examples, below). A grating has parallel lines, while a CD has a spiral of finely-spaced data tracks. Diffraction colors also appear when one looks at a bright point source through a translucent fine-pitch umbrella-fabric covering. Decorative patterned plastic films based on reflective grating patches are very inexpensive, and are commonplace.|$|E
2500|$|Recordable CDs {{with even}} greater capacity, {{compatible}} with existing infrastructure of CD-ROM drives, made the expensive new high-capacity floppy technologies obsolete. The floppy disk's remaining reusability advantage was then eliminated by re-writeable CDs. However, writing and rewriting CDs was never as fast or convenient as writing on floppy disks, when the data fits {{on one or}} two floppy disks. Networking, advancements in flash-based devices, and widespread adoption of USB provided another alternative that in turn made both floppy disks and <b>optical</b> <b>storage</b> obsolete for some purposes. The rise of file sharing and multi-megapixel digital photography encouraged the use of files larger than most 3½-inch disks, the largest-capacity standard disks, could hold. Floppy disks were commonly used as sneakernet carriers for file transfer, but the broad availability of LANs and fast Internet connections provided a simpler and faster method of transferring such files, where the air-gapping of a sneakernet is not an important benefit. Other removable storage devices have advantages in both capacity and performance when network connections are unavailable or when networks are inadequate.|$|E
2500|$|In {{applications}} {{where a small}} focused beam is needed, the waveguide must be made narrow, on {{the order}} of the optical wavelength. This way, only a single transverse mode is supported and one ends up with a diffraction-limited beam. Such single spatial mode devices are used for <b>optical</b> <b>storage,</b> laser pointers, and fiber optics. Note that these lasers may still support multiple longitudinal modes, and thus can lase at multiple wavelengths simultaneously. [...] The wavelength emitted {{is a function of the}} band-gap of the semiconductor material and the modes of the optical cavity. In general, the maximum gain will occur for photons with energy slightly above the band-gap energy, and the modes nearest the peak of the gain curve will lase most strongly. The width of the gain curve will determine the number of additional [...] "side modes" [...] that may also lase, depending on the operating conditions. [...] Single spatial mode lasers that can support multiple longitudinal modes are called Fabry Perot (FP) lasers. [...] An FP laser will lase at multiple cavity modes within the gain bandwidth of the lasing medium. [...] The number of lasing modes in an FP laser is usually unstable, and can fluctuate due to changes in current or temperature.|$|E

Bit-by-bit <b>optical</b> data <b>storage</b> uses photons to introduce a localized physical or chemical property change such as photoinduced fluorescence or reflectance modulation as information storing processes. When an optical disc is scanned, pre-stored information can be retrieved back by detecting the intensity variation of the reading beam. Researchers have pursued further research to explore the feasibility of three-dimensional (3 -D) <b>optical</b> data <b>storage,</b> such as double-layer DVDs and double-layer Blu-ray discs. They have also introduced the 2 P excitation technique into 3 -D <b>optical</b> data <b>storage</b> with two orthogonal beams intersecting inside the focuses of two objectives. Since 2 P absorption is a highly nonlinear process, a high-power pulsed laser is generally required to facilitate the 2 P process.

Since then, lasers have become a multibillion-dollar industry, finding utility in thousands of highly varied applications. The first application of lasers visible in {{the daily lives of}} the general population was the supermarket barcode scanner, introduced in 1974.

These <b>optical</b> <b>storage</b> devices use a semiconductor laser less than a millimetre wide to scan the surface of the disc for data retrieval. Fibre-optic communication relies on lasers to transmit large amounts of information at the speed of light. Other common applications of lasers include laser printers and laser pointers.
