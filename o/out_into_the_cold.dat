50|$|The tavern owners' daughter, thus a {{permanent}} resident of Pallahaxi, and Drove's first love: {{in the end}} he staggers <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> killing <b>cold</b> to try to find her, if she is still alive.|$|R
60|$|She {{went into}} the hall, where her hat, transfixed {{by a couple of}} hat-pins, hung above her jacket, assumed these garments, and let herself <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> grey street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I'll {{go in with}} you, after all. I'll just step <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> air, and see if I can harden {{my cheek}} for that interview. Your diffidence is infectious, Maxwell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now {{get your}} team--I wouldn't let you take her <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> only I know {{she ought to}} be where a doctor can be reached. The quicker you go the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; if I'd {{had my own}} way, I'd {{have left}} Harvard before this." [...] He could see that his bold {{assumption}} of difference, or indifference, told upon her. [...] "I couldn't get <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hard, <b>cold</b> world too soon." ...|$|R
60|$|After breakfast {{he put on}} his cap {{and coat}} and went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> clear, <b>cold</b> November air.

6000|$|She walked <b>out</b> slowly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> March daylight, to the leaden greys, the hurrying black shapes, {{the chaotic}} {{afternoon}} traffic of London.

60|$|Then Violet {{hung the}} wreath above the throne, and with weary foot went forth again, <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold,</b> dark gardens, {{and still the}} golden shadows {{followed}} her, and wherever they fell, flowers bloomed and green leaves rustled.|$|E
60|$|After breakfast {{he put on}} his cap and coat, {{and went}} <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> clear, <b>cold</b> November air.

60|$|They {{ran down}} the adit, with Devine in front {{swinging}} a blinking lamp, and crawled <b>out,</b> gasping, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> evening air as dusk was closing down. Then they sat around and waited until there was a crash and a muffled rumbling. Weston stood up, but Saunders made a sign of expostulation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it not self-indulgence, this {{giving way}} to grief? Who would know so well as you how to teach the lesson of {{endurance}} to others? Come, love. Lay down your hat.

6000|$|There {{was again}} {{silence for a}} few moments, after which Violet {{returned}} to the original subject of their conversation. [...] "It would be a thousand pities that Mr. Finn should be turned <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold.</b> Don't you think so?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> {{went the}} baker. His head was dazed, but he walked steadfastly to his shop. There {{was no need}} for him to go anywhere; to tell anybody anything. The man with the {{earrings}} would settle matters for himself soon enough.|$|E
60|$|And, {{at those}} unspoken words, {{he seemed to}} see her rise and move away, like {{a woman in a}} terrible dream, from which she was {{fighting}} to awake--rise and go <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark and <b>cold,</b> without a thought of him, without so much as the knowledge of his presence.|$|R
50|$|Young {{flounder}} {{that are}} 5-20 cm long migrate {{out with the}} ebb tide and inhabit the slightly deeper inshore channels. Once the flounders reach adulthood, they migrate further <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deeper and <b>colder</b> coastal waters. During spawning season {{in the winter and}} spring months, adults move offshore into coastal waters approximately 30-50m in depth to reproduce.|$|R
5000|$|On March 28, 1921, 1,500 people ventured <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{freezing}} <b>cold</b> temperatures {{to witness}} the new theatre's first production, William Faversham's adaptation of The Prince and the Pauper by Mark Twain. The lobby measured a little over twenty feet in each direction and {{was nothing in the}} way of spectacle compared to the State and Ohio Theatres, both of which had opened the previous month. At exactly 8:15 Cleveland orchestra director Max Faetkenheuer opened the show with the [...] "Star-Spangled Banner" [...] and the play began. During intermission, playwright Faversham gave an impromptu speech {{at the request of the}} theatre patrons.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir,' {{answered}} the quiet imperturbable voice {{from under the}} black straw brim. Alice went slowly down, but {{at the foot of}} the stairs, looking <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold,</b> blue, lamplit street she paused as if at a sudden recollection, and ran hastily up again.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have her}} here, and then we'll {{take her to}} Glenbogie. Now when I say it I mean it. You go and fetch her, and if you don't I will. I'm {{not going to have}} her turned <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> in that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} must take his chance. Well,--I'll get up now." [...] And {{then she took}} her first step <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> world beyond her bed. [...] "We must all take our chance. I have {{made up my mind}} that it will be at half-past eleven." ...|$|E
50|$|There is a {{traditional}} story (now perhaps discredited as a fictionalised account by Sir Walter Scott) that James was an especial enemy of the Regent's party because {{his wife and child}} were evicted from Woodhouselee. According to the story, Woodhouselee was given to Sir James Ballenden by James Hamilton in order to secure his freedom after Langside. Bellenden took possession of the property {{in the middle of the}} night, throwing James Hamilton's wife and newborn child <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bitter <b>cold</b> in just their night clothes. The ghosts of his tragic wife and child are said to still haunt the site of the old castle and her frenzied and terrifying screams have been heard by those dwelling nearby.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Deane {{put out his}} hand, {{with an air of}} {{friendly}} dismissal, and Tom had not courage to ask another question, especially in the presence of Mr. Spence. So he went <b>out</b> again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> damp air. He had to call at his uncle Glegg's about the money in the Savings Bank, {{and by the time he}} set out again the mist had thickened, and he could not see very far before him; but going along River Street again, he was startled, when he was within two yards of the projecting side of a shop-window, by the words [...] "Dorlcote Mill" [...] in large letters on a hand-bill, placed as if on purpose to stare at him. It was the catalogue of the sale to take place the next week; it was a reason for hurrying faster out of the town.|$|R
40|$|The {{excitations}} in superfluid(3) He have a dispersion {{curve in}} which the energy minimum does not coincide with the momentum minimum. As a result, when a mechanical resonator moves through a gas of such excitations, normal and Andreev scattering processes introduce a large asymmetry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> momentum exchange and the mechanical resonator experiences a very large drag force. A gas of such excitations is thus very easy to detect even at very low densities. We have exploited this effect to monitor the increase in excitation density in a small volume caused by a particle interaction. The working volume is filled with superfluid(3) He-B at around 100 mu K. A particle undergoing an interaction in the volume releases a shower of quasiparticle excitations which can be detected by the increase in damping on a vibrating wire resonator. A small hole in the container allows the excitations to leak <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> outside <b>colder</b> liquid to reset the working liquid to the resting state. Using an existing experiment we can detect nuclear recoil interactions depositing energies as low as 500 eV. Two simple modifications should allow us to detect interactions in the 10 eV range...|$|R
60|$|They did not swear, nor {{did they}} curse their leader. Somehow {{it seemed as if}} they had {{expected}} all along that the Englishman would evade their vengeance yet again, that he would lure them <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> and into the darkness, and then that he would mock them, fool them, and finally disappear into the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "The gentleman's room," [...] said Tetterby, [...] "is upstairs, sir. There's a more {{convenient}} private entrance; {{but as you}} have come in here, it will save your going <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold,</b> if you'll take this little staircase," [...] showing one communicating directly with the parlour, [...] "and go up to him that way, {{if you wish to}} see him." ...|$|E
60|$|So it {{came about}} {{in a little while}} that the young man found himself {{without so much as a}} single penny to bless himself withal. Then his fair-weather friends left him, and the {{creditors}} came and seized upon his house and his household goods, and turned him <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> wide world to get along as best he might with the other fools who lived there.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> {{increased}} {{until it}} grew numbing, {{and when the}} pain ceased, all feeling died out of the girl's hands and feet. She gradually grew drowsy, and, looking up now and then with heavy eyes, saw only the dim shapes of the horses projected against the bitter blueness of the night. Still, at times, they plunged into belts of shadow, {{where there was a}} crackling under the runners and a flitting by of ghostly trees that vanished when they once more swept <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> awful <b>cold</b> of <b>the</b> open. Now and then Leland called to the horses, but his voice was lost again next moment in the silence it had scarcely broken. A curious sense of the unreality of it all came upon the girl. She almost felt that, if she could cry out, he and the team would vanish, and all would be with her as it had been in England before she met him. Then the drumming of hoofs grew very faint, and with a half-conscious desire for warmth she crept still closer to the silent man, who looked down on her very compassionately, and then, setting his lips, gave his attention again to the team. She remembered nothing further until she roused herself at a pressure on her arm.|$|R
60|$|They were abominably cold, {{even in my}} pockets, and I had {{suffered}} past several places {{trying to think of}} an excuse to go in. I now asked the druggist if he had something which I felt pretty sure he had not, and this put him in the wrong, so that when we fell into talk he was very polite. We agreed admirably about the hard times, and he gave way respectfully when I doubted his opinion that the winters were getting milder. I made him reflect that {{there was no reason for}} this, and that it was probably an illusion from that deeper impression which all experiences made on us in the past, when we were younger; I ought to say that he was an elderly man, too. I said I fancied such a morning as this was not very mild for people that had no fires, and this brought me back again to Janssen and Marina, by way of the coke-cart. The thought of them rapt me so far from the druggist that I listened to his answer with a glazing eye, and did not know what he said. My hands had now got warm, and I bade him good-morning with a parting regret, which he civilly shared, that he had not the thing I had not wanted, and I pushed <b>out</b> again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold,</b> which I found not so bad as before.|$|R
50|$|Gio Cha is {{traditional}} foods of Vietnam, and Gio Cha is indispensable foods during the Tet holiday in Vietnam. According to artisan Duc Binh Nguyen, a gio cha maker {{in a long}} time, Gio Cha are making in Uoc Le village around 500 years ago. Historic records in village says that a concubine from palace, who was a villager, came back to build gate and teach the villagers how to make Gio Cha in the Mac Dynasty. Under feudalism, the dish was very noble, so the meal had Gio Cha was only for rich people. In the subsidy period, Gio Cha was being prohibited goods because it {{became more and more}} expensive. However, people of Uoc Le still remain and maintain th{{is traditional}} job, which ancestors descend to them until now.The elements that make up the Gio Cha Uoc Le brand is not only the deliciousness, safety, but also the creative tinkering of people to make this dish more and more delicious. In the past, Gio Cha was made by hand, and the makers kept the secret methods of pounding meat so that the meat is plastic and not sticky to the pestle. By the 1990s, people turned into using machines instead of using pestle. Despite of it, the makers also retained the tradition way of ancestors while packaging. Gio Cha was wrapped in large banana leaves unlike the packaging in different places using aluminum tubes. Boiling Gio Cha is required high skills and meticulousness. After the water is boiled, Gio Cha is let into pot and boiled for about one hour. After completing, the makers pick it <b>out,</b> and drop <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> water immediately. In the end, Gio Cha is made, and the eaters can cut into pieces with different shapes for decorating and enjoying it.Material for making Gio Cha is very simple, but to have a delicious product, procedure requires sophisticated selection about material and high meticulousness of makers:- Pork: fresh meat from the cleaned pigs which weigh about 40-50 kilograms, and the makers feel warm while handling the meat.- Fish sauce: fish sauce with high protein and sweet flavor.- Banana leaves: fresh and large leaves.- Other Spices: sugar, pepper and some sweeteners depending on different makers and regions.Nowadays, Gio Cha is not popular for daily meal in Vietnam, but it is beautiful traditional cuisine of Vietnam, and it is also served with many different foods such as stuffed pancake, round sticky rice cake, Steamed sticky rice.|$|R
