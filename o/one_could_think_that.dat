50|$|Enhancers or cis-regulatory modules/elements (CRM/CRE) are non-coding DNA {{sequences}} containing multiple activator and repressor binding sites. Enhancers {{range from}} 200 bp to 1 kb {{in length and}} can be either proximal, 5’ upstream to the promoter or within the first intron of the regulated gene, or distal, in introns of neighboring genes or intergenic regions {{far away from the}} locus. Through DNA looping, active enhancers contact the promoter dependently of the core DNA binding motif promoter specificity. Promoter-enhancer dichotomy provides the basis for the functional interaction between transcription factors and transcriptional core machinery to trigger RNA Pol II escape from the promoter. Whereas <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there is a 1:1 enhancer-promoter ratio, studies of the human genome predict that an active promoter interacts with 4 to 5 enhancers. Similarly, enhancers can regulate more than one gene without linkage restriction and are said to “skip” neighboring genes to regulate more distant ones. Even though infrequent, transcriptional regulation can involve elements located in a chromosome different to one where the promoter resides. More interestingly, proximal enhancers or promoters of neighboring genes can serve as platforms to recruit more distal elements.|$|E

40|$|University Latin American anthropology, in {{its early}} developments, had a clear {{nationalist}} mission. Instead of focusing on faraway cultures and societies, as did their Western European and North American counterparts, nineteenth- and twentieth-century Latin American anthropologists concentrated their efforts on interpreting their own nations. Although {{the degree to which}} this happened varied in different coun-tries, Latin American anthropologists {{played a key role in}} articulating national(ist) imaginaries, and their ideas have been disseminated through textbooks, rituals, museums, monuments, and popular culture. It is revealing that the discipline obtained its largest and most robust infrastructure precisely in those two coun-tries—Mexico and Brazil—where it has been most influential in the production of nationhood. Although this situation has changed considerably in the last few decades—again, in different degrees across the region—Latin America has long produced what Claudio Lomnitz (2001 : 228) has called “national anthropologies,” that is, “anthropological traditions that have been fostered by educational and cul-tural institutions for the development of studies of their own nation. ” <b>One</b> <b>could</b> thus <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> while Euro-American anthropologies traditionally have been concerned with “the other, ” Latin American anthropologists have been mostly interested in “the self ”—that is, the self of that imagined community that they helped construct. But the recursive character of the distinction between the other and the self is no secret, and much of classic Latin American anthropology has studied those domestic others—the oppressed and marginalized ethnic and racial groups that today we like to call subaltern—that were supposed to best rep-resent the authentic national self.

50|$|In mathematics, delay {{differential}} equations (DDEs) are {{a type of}} differential equation in which the derivative of the unknown function {{at a certain time}} is given in terms of the values of the function at previous times.DDEs are also called time-delay systems, systems with aftereffect or dead-time, hereditary systems, equations with deviating argument, or differential-difference equations. They belong to the class of systems with the functional state, i.e. partial {{differential equations}} (PDEs) which are infinite dimensional, as opposed to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) having a finite dimensional state vector. Four points may give a possible explanation of the popularity of DDEs. (1) Aftereffect is an applied problem: it is well known that, together with the increasing expectations of dynamic performances, engineers need their models to behave more like the real process. Many processes include aftereffect phenomena in their inner dynamics. In addition, actuators, sensors, communication networks that are now involved in feedback control loops introduce such delays. Finally, besides actual delays, time lags are frequently used to simplify very high order models. Then, the interest for DDEs keeps on growing in all scientific areas and, especially, in control engineering. (2) Delay systems are still resistant to many classical controllers: <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the simplest approach would consist in replacing them by some finite-dimensional approximations. Unfortunately, ignoring effects which are adequately represented by DDEs is not a general alternative: in the best situation (constant and known delays), it leads to the same degree of complexity in the control design. In worst cases (time-varying delays, for instance), it is potentially disastrous in terms of stability and oscillations. (3) Delay properties are also surprising since several studies have shown that voluntary introduction of delays can also benefit the control. (4) In spite of their complexity, DDEs however often appear as simple infinite-dimensional models in the very complex area of partial differential equations (PDEs).|$|E

40|$|This Essay {{will explore}} the {{durability}} of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), {{in terms of its}} judicial history. It will focus, in particular, on the Supreme Court's treatment of the APA as embodying statutory resolutions of procedural issues the courts might otherwise have to resolve unguided. Against the backdrop of change briefly sketched above, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> it astounding <b>that</b> the APA's procedural specifications, universals across government, have survived almost unaltered. This statute, like our four-times-older Constitution, thus raises a general question about interpretation in a particularly powerful form: To what extent has this 1946 statute been read to embody a frozen ("static") set of instructions about procedure, modifiable only by congressional action? And to what extent have courts interpreting it grounded their readings in current necessities, or in intervening developments that seem to have been generally accepted by the concerned communities? For a statute of such duration and generality, as for a constitution, flexible interpretation responsive to changing circumstances may be the very essence. And, as for a constitution, one might also expect such a practice to raise significant issues of legitimacy. The story is also one of lawyers' conventions [...] of what, reading the traces of their arguments, one can understand to have been the legal community's expectations about how a statute of this character should be understood...|$|R

Some of the most effective passages and the most celebrated and admired, like the frenzy of Juliet with her potion, were of the former sort; but it was the others she liked best.|$|R
40|$|Problem discussion:   Information Logistics {{has with}} the rising of the new {{technologies}} developed into a key is-sue for companies seeking competitive advantage. The birth and expansion of Internet has brought down the boundaries that kept business partners from sharing extensive informa-tion between each other (McClelland, 2003). The increase of information has yielded a bet-ter understanding of your business partners and <b>one</b> <b>could</b> perhaps <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is only positive outcomes derived from the increased information sharing. However, research show upon an extensive need for structuring the information flows which relates to an or-ganization. Gartner group (2003) presented an investigation present ting that managers spend over 49 minutes every day in their mailbox for reading and sending e-mails and Del-phi Group (2002) presented figures saying that executives spend over {{two hours a day}} searching for the right information (cited in Sandkuhl, 2005). Expected outcomes for im-proving the information logistics are however not only related to time savings activities, business partners could also expect enhanced improvement regarding business processes and operational efficiency. The need for structuring the information flow is therefore an in-teresting subject to investigate and will also be the focus of this thesis. For specifying and narrowing the theoretical framework the authors have chosen to focus upon information sharing based on a web-based system. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to analyze how a company can utilize a web-based system to share information with their first tier suppliers. Methodology: In order to fulfil the purpose a case study approach has been chosen whereas semi-structured telephone interviews have been complimented with face-to-face interviews for gathering material. The rationale for the chosen approach was because the information needed to fulfil the purpose was of the character to be found in a qualitative study by going in-depth into the field. Conclusion: The importance in utilizing a web-based system is for the buyer to facilitate user handiness and provide trustworthy information to suppliers. The shared information has to be cor-rect, easy accessible, and customized for suppliers. Information requested by the suppliers are, updated inventory levels, lead-time from Husqvarna to end customer, back orders, or-der fulfillment, on-time deliveries, complete orders, forecasts, and sell-through information. ...|$|R

60|$|The {{suburbs of}} New York are, {{by the nature}} of the localities, divided from the city by water. Jersey City and Hoboken are on the other side of the Hudson, and in another State. Williamsburg and Brooklyn are on Long Island, which is a part of the State of New York. But these places are as easily reached as Lambeth is reached from Westminster. Steam ferries ply every three or four minutes; and into these boats coaches, carts, and wagons of any size or weight are driven. In fact, they make no other {{stoppage}} to the commerce than that occasioned by the payment of a few cents. Such payment, no doubt, is a stoppage; and therefore it is that Jersey City, Brooklyn, and Williamsburg are, at any rate in appearance, very dull and uninviting. They are, however, very populous. Many of the quieter citizens prefer to live there; and I am told that the Brooklyn tea parties consider themselves to be, in esthetic feeling, very much ahead of anything of the kind in the more opulent centers of the city. In beauty of scenery Staten Island is very much the prettiest of the suburbs of New York. The view from the hillside in Staten Island down upon New York harbor is very lovely. It is the only really good view of that magnificent harbor which I have been able to find. As for appreciating such beauty when one is entering a port from sea or leaving it for sea, I do not believe in any such power. The ship creeps up or creeps out while the mind is engaged on other matters. The passenger is uneasy either with hopes or fears, and then the grease of the engines offends one's nostrils. But it is worth the tourist's while to look down upon New York harbor from the hillside in Staten Island. When I was there Fort Lafayette looked black in the center of the channel, and we knew that it was crowded with the victims of secession. Fort Tompkins was being built to guard the pass--worthy of a name of richer sound; and Fort something else was bristling with new cannon. Fort Hamilton, on Long Island, opposite, was frowning at us; and immediately around us a regiment of volunteers was receiving regimental stocks and boots from the hands of its officers. Everything was bristling with war; and <b>one</b> <b>could</b> not but <b>think</b> <b>that</b> not in this way had New York raised herself so quickly to her present greatness.|$|R

This result is interesting and surprising because for every k, the class of k-valued NL grammars has infinite elasticity and <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is not learnable, which is not true. Moreover, these classes are very close to unlearnable classes like k-valued associative Lambek grammars learned from function-argument sentences or k-valued non-associative Lambek calculus grammars learned from well-bracketed list of words or from strings. Thus, the k-valued non-associative Lambek grammars learned from function-argument sentences is at the frontier between learnable and unlearnable classes of languages...|$|E
30|$|In {{the light}} of the {{above-mentioned}} comments, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> interference alignment in the time domain is much more convenient than in the frequency domain in totally asynchronous scenarios, as interference leakage due to delays between transmitters and receivers can be completely avoided and, at the same time, synchronization tasks perform at higher SINR levels. However, for the 3 -user scenario under consideration, closed-form and computationally efficient solutions do exist for spatial interference alignment in the frequency domain but not in the time domain [1]. The solution presented in [18] for calculating optimum time-domain interference alignment precoders and decoders is computationally expensive, leading to much longer (and with larger variance) feedback times. A way to alleviate the problem consists in computing the IFFT of the frequency-domain solutions and truncating the resulting filters to achieve a good trade-off between interference suppression and ISI.|$|E
