5|$|Other Marxists, such as George Derwent Thomson and Neil Faulkner, {{have argued}} that Childe's archaeological work should not {{correctly}} be considered Marxist because he failed {{to take into account}} the existence of class struggle as an instrument <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>change,</b> something which was a core tenet of Marxist thought. While class struggle was not a factor he considered in his archaeological work, Childe did accept that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted the past through their own class interests, and that most of his contemporaries were producing studies with an innate bourgeois agenda. Childe also diverged from orthodox Marxism by not employing dialectics in his methodology. Furthermore, he denied Marxism's ability to predict the future development of human society, and did not consider humanity's development into pure communism to be inevitable, instead opining that society could fossilize or become extinct instead.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>change</b> from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E
5|$|Sledd's {{advocacy}} <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>change</b> and {{an evolving}} understanding of biblical texts {{came at a}} high personal price. Given his chosen career of minister and professor, he never accumulated much personal wealth. Sledd died deep in debt, having lost the family home to foreclosure after the salaries of Candler professors were cut when financial support of the school fell during the Great Depression in the 1930s. His creditors obtained a deficiency judgment for the unpaid portion of his debt after the foreclosure and, following his death, forced the sale {{of some of his}} furniture and parts of his personal library in partial satisfaction of his remaining debts.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> the 20 th {{century have}} had a {{significant}} impact on the traditional roles <b>of</b> grandparenting.

This paper arises out of a study that explored the impact these key <b>social</b> <b>changes</b> have had on the grandparent role of contemporary Australian grandparents. The paper discusses findings from interviews conducted with grandparents who reside in northern New South Wales. The findings have relevance to development of policies relating to childcare, grandparents raising grandchildren and divorce law reform.

25|$|Although {{the rhetoric}} {{surrounding}} lynchings frequently suggested {{they were to}} protect the virtue and safety of white women, the actions basically arose out of white attempts to maintain domination in a rapidly changing society and their fears <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>change.</b> Victims were the scapegoats for peoples' attempts to control agriculture, labor and education, {{as well as a}} reaction to economic stresses during downturns when cotton prices dropped, and larger disasters such as the boll weevil.|$|E

25|$|Terms like thesis novel, {{propaganda}} novel, industrial novel, working-class {{novel and}} problem novel {{are also used}} to describe this type of novel; a recent development in this genre is the young adult problem novel.

The social protest novel is a form of social novel which places an emphasis on the idea <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>change,</b> while the proletarian novel is a political form of the social protest novel which may emphasize revolution. While early examples are found in 18th century England, social novels have been written throughout Europe and the United States.|$|E
25|$|Freegans' {{rejection}} of veganism is often tied to their discovery of food waste, estimated as up to 40% {{of the food}} supply in the United States and other Western countries. For many, statistics about the ecological impacts of food waste—up to 12% of global cropland and 23% of global freshwater goes to produce food which is never consumed—serve as justification for a complete {{rejection of}} the capitalist food system. Moreover, the presence of food in supermarket dumpsters shows, according to some freegans, that the vegan theory <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>change</b> is flawed, because markets do not efficiently translate consumer preferences into changes in production.|$|E

25|$|Petals of Blood was Ngugi's {{first novel}} written whilst not in {{full-time}} education, instead written {{over a five-year}} period.

Petals of Blood was the last of Ngugi's novels to be written first in English.|$|E
25|$|Although {{concerns}} about shamateurism were widespread, {{the abolition of}} amateurism was actually the result of interaction by two irresistible forces. One was the tide <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>change</b> {{in the wake of}} the Second World War and the growth of a more egalitarian society in general. The other was the demand for dedicated professionalism in sports such as cricket and football that became increasingly conscious of their business obligations and the need to generate income through success on the field. An example of the latter is the way that cricket dropped the Gentlemen v Players fixture after amateurism was abolished in January 1963 and introduced the Gillette Cup limited overs knockout competition for primarily commercial reasons.|$|E
