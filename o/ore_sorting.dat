50|$|Precondition for the {{applicability}} of sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> {{is the presence of}} liberation at the particle size of interest. Before entering into sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> testing procedures there is the possibility to assess the degree of liberation through the inspection of drill cores, hand-counting and washability analysis. The quantification of liberation does not include any process efficiencies, but gives an estimate of the possible sorting result and can thus be applied for desktop financial feasibility analysis.Drill core analysisBoth for green-field and brown-field applications, inspection of drill core in combination with the grade distribution and mineralogical description is a good option for estimation of the liberation characteristics and the possible success of sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting.</b> In combination with the mining method and mine plan, an estimation of possible grade distribution in coarse particles can be done.|$|E

40|$|Visual {{inspection}} of bulk material is the thorough optical {{inspection of}} streams of granular material {{to assess their}} quality or to detect defective objects. Examples are found in mining (discovery of <b>ores),</b> recycling (<b>sorting</b> waste from reusable material) and food safety (detection of pathogens). In these applications, it is generally not feasible or even possible to provide an accurate and exhaustive training set of all the materials that can be encountered during the inspection. Instead, classification has to be performed in an open world setting, i. e., with the option to recognize and reject unknown objects. Despite the practical relevance, prior work on this topic is surprisingly sparse. Here, we present a method to augment bag of visual words object descriptors by an additional unknown word that encodes outliers. The method depends on only few parameters that have a clear interpretation and is suitable for the application in the field. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using two real-world datasets and compare it to a related method. The experiments show that our method significantly outperforms classification with a closed world assumption {{as well as the}} related method...|$|R

50|$|Sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> is the {{terminology}} used for sensor-based sorting in the mining industry. It is a coarse physical coarse particle separation technology usually {{applied in the}} size range for 25 - 100 mm. Aim is either to create a lumpy product in ferrous metals, coal or industrial minerals applications or to reject waste before it enters production bottlenecks and more expensive comminution and concentration steps in the process. In the majority of all mining processes, particles of sub-economic grade enter the traditional comminution, classification and concentration steps. If the amount of sub-economic material in the above-mentioned fraction is roughly 25% or more, there is good potential that sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> is a technically and financially viable option. High added value can be achieved with relatively low capital expenditure, especially when increasing the productivity through downstream processing of higher grade feed and through increased overal recovery when rejecting deleterious waste.|$|E

500|$|Although {{women and}} girls {{probably}} worked in mining since antiquity, the earliest known written references to female manual labourers in mining are in the 13th and 14thcentury records of the royal lead and silver mines at Bere Alston, {{on the border between}} Devon and Cornwall. (The mines were bordered on three sides by a loop of the River Tamar, since 936 the traditional boundary between Devon and Cornwall. The mines themselves were on the Devon side of the border at Bere Alston itself, but the surface-level smelters were on the Cornish side at Calstock as there was a readier supply of timber for use in the furnaces.) Although the mining itself was carried out by men, female workers were employed to <b>sort</b> <b>ore</b> for crushing, to prepare the bone ash used as a flux during the smelting process, and for general manual labour. An adult woman was paid up to one penny per day, and young girls between [...] and [...] of a penny. Miners and other skilled labourers at Bere Alston were recruited from throughout England and Wales, and from the evidence of surnames in the records it appears that many of the female labourers were the wives and daughters of these incomers rather than locally recruited women.|$|R
40|$|Most {{recent studies}} on the {{long-term}} supply of uranium make simplistic assumptions on the available resources and their production costs. Some consider the whole uranium quantities in the Earth's crust and then estimate the production costs based on the ore grade only, disregarding the size of ore bodies and the mining techniques. Other studies consider the resources reported by countries for a given cost category, disregarding undiscovered or unreported quantities. In both cases, the resource estimations are sorted following a cost merit order. In this paper, we describe a methodology based on “geological environments”. It provides a more detailed resource estimation and it is more flexible regarding cost modelling. The global uranium resource estimation introduced in this paper results from the sum of independent resource estimations from different geological environments. A geological environment is defined by its own geographical boundaries, resource dispersion (average grade and size of ore bodies and their variance), and cost function. With this definition, uranium resources are considered within ore bodies. The deposit breakdown of resources is modelled using a bivariate statistical approach where size and grade are the two random variables. This makes resource estimates possible for individual projects. Adding up all geological environments provides a repartition of all Earth's crust resources in which <b>ore</b> bodies are <b>sorted</b> by size and grade. This subset-based estimation is convenient to model specific cost structures...|$|R
50|$|Sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> is financially {{especially}} {{attractive for}} low grade or marginal ore or waste dump material. This described scenario describes that waste dump material or marginal ore is sorted {{and added to}} the run-of-mine production. The needed capacity for the sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> step is less in this case such as the costs involved. Requirement is that two crude material streams are fed in parallel, requiring two crushing stations. Alternatively, marginal and high grade ore can be buffered on an intermediate stockpile and dispatched in an alternating operation. The latter option has the disadvantage that the planned production time, the loading, of the sensor-based ore sorter is low, unless a significant intermediate stockpile or bunker is installed.Treating the marginal ore separately has the advantage that less equipment is needed since the processed material stream is lower, but it has the disadvantage that {{the potential of the}} technology is not unfolded for the higher grade material, where sensor-based sorting would also add benefit.|$|E
50|$|For higher grade {{applications}} such as ferrous metals, coal and industrial minerals, sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> {{can be applied to}} create a final product. Pre-condition is, that the liberation allows {{for the creation of a}} sellable product. Undersize material is usually bypassed as product, but can also be diverted to the waste fraction, if the composition does not meet the required specifications. This is case and application dependant.|$|E

40|$|Microwave {{treatment}} {{followed by}} infrared thermal imaging (MW–IRT) {{has been proposed}} as a potential excitation-discrimination technique to facilitate sorting of porphyry copper ores. A continuous, high throughput (up to 100 t/h), belt–based microwave cavity operating at up to 100 kW {{has been designed to}} interface directly with commercially available sorters at industrially relevant scales. In this paper, the fragment-by-fragment thermal response of 16 porphyry copper ore samples following microwave treatment in the bespoke system is evaluated to elucidate key performance criteria and identify likely candidate <b>ores</b> for microwave <b>sorting.</b> Microwave treatment energy dose was found to be {{the driving force behind the}} ultimate average temperature fragments experience, with other process variables (e. g. belt speed, power, belt mass loading, thermal equilibration time) having little effect on sortability performance. While fragment mineralogical texture and ore textural heterogeneity were shown to influence the average temperature rise of the fragment surface presented to the thermal camera, in most cases this variability did not adversely affect sortability performance. An abundance of microwave-heating gangue minerals (e. g. iron sulphides, iron oxides and hydrated clays) was shown to be the dominant source of deviation from intrinsic sortability. However, low average moisture content and co-mineralisation of copper and iron sulphides (or bulk sulphide sorting) was found to mitigate the deviation and provide better sortability performance. An attractive separation could be proposed for many of the ores tested, either to remove a large proportion of barren fragments from ore-grade material or concentrate a large proportion of copper values from waste-grade material...|$|R
5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to <b>sort</b> the <b>ore</b> ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing <b>sorted</b> <b>ore</b> to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|R

50|$|Sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> is in {{comparison}} to other coarse particle separation technologies relatively cheap. While the costs for the equipment itself are relatively high in capital expenditure and operating costs, the absence of extensive infrastructure in a system results in operating costs {{that are to be}} compared to jigging. The specific costs are very much depending on the average particle size of the feed and on the ease of the separation. Coarser particles imply higher capacity and thus less costs. Detailed costing can be conducted after the mini-bulk stage in the technical feasibility evaluation.Prejudice against waste rejection with sensor-based sorting widely spread, that the loss of valuables, thus the recovery penalty of this process, supersedes the potential downstream cost savings and is therefore economically not viable. It must be noted that for waste rejection the aim for the separation with sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> must be put onto maximum recovery, which means that only low grade or barren waste is rejected because the financial feasibility is very much sensitive to that factor. Nevertheless, through the rejection of waste before comminution and concentration steps, recovery can be often increased in the downstream process, meaning that the overall recovery is equal or even higher than the one in the base case, meaning that instead of losing product, additional product can be produced, which adds the additional revenue to the cost savings on the positive side in the cash flow.If the rejected material is replaced with additional higher grade material, the main economic benefit unfolds through the additional production. It implies, that in conjunction with sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting,</b> the capacity of the crushing station is increased, to allow for the additional mass-flow that is subsequently taken out by the sensor-based ore sorters as waste.|$|E
50|$|To {{cope with}} high volume mass flows and for application, where a {{changing}} physical {{location of the}} sensor-based sorting process is of no benefit for the financial feasibility of the operation, stationary installations are applied. Another reason for applying stationary installations are multistage (Rougher, Scavenger, Cleaner) sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> processes. Within stationary installations, sorters are usually located in parallel, which allows transport of the discharge fractions with one product and one waste belt respectively, which decreases plant footprint and amount of conveyors.|$|E
50|$|During {{the more}} than 80 years of {{technical}} development of sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> equipment, various types of machines have been developed. This includes the channel-type, bucket-wheel type and cone type sorters.The main machine types being installed in the mining industry today are belt-type and chute-type machines. Harbeck made a good comparison of both disadvantages and advantages of the systems for different sorting applications. The selection of a machine-type for an application depends various case-dependent factors, including the detection system applied, particle size, moisture, yield amongst others.|$|E
5000|$|The process {{efficiency}} of sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> {{is described in}} detail by C. Robben in 2014. [...] The total {{process efficiency}} is subdivided into the following sub-process efficiencies; Platform efficiency, preparation efficiency, presentation efficiency, detection efficiency and separation efficiency. All the sub-process contribute to the total process efficiency, of course {{in combination with the}} liberation characteristics of the bulk material that the technology is applied to. The detailed description of the sib-processes and their contribution to the total process efficiency {{can be found in the}} literature.|$|E
50|$|Most {{prominent}} {{example of}} the application of sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> is the rejection of barren waste before transporting and comminution. Waste rejection is also known under the term pre-concentration. A discrimination has been introduced by Robben. Rule of thumb is that at least 25% of liberated barren waste must {{be present in the}} fraction to be treated by sensor-based <b>ore</b> <b>sorting</b> to make waste rejection financially feasible.Reduction of waste before it enters comminution and grinding processes does not only reduce the costs in those processes, but also releases the capacity that can be filled with higher grade material and thus implies higher productivity of the system. A prejudice against the application of a waste rejection process is, that the valuable content lost in this process is a penalty higher than the savings that can be achieved. But it is reported in the literature that the overall recovery even increases through bringing higher grade material as feed into the mill. In addition, the higher productivity is an additional source of income. If noxious waste such as acid consuming calcite is removed, the downstream recovery increases and the downstream costs decrease disproportionally as reported for example by Bergmann. The coarse waste rejected can be an additional source of income if there is a local market for aggregates.|$|E
