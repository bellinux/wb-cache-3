40|$|AbstractThe {{kinetics}} of oxidation of some <b>organic</b> <b>diols</b> by tripropylammonium fluorochromate (TriPAFC) {{have been}} studied in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The main product of oxidation is the corresponding hydroxy aldehydes. The reaction is first order with respect to TriPAFC and exhibited Michaelis-Menten type kinetics with respect to <b>organic</b> <b>diols.</b> The reaction is catalyzed by hydrogen ions. The hydrogen ion dependence has the form: kobs=a+b[H+]. Various thermodynamic parameters for the oxidation have been reported and discussed along with the validity of isokinetic relationship. Oxidation of diols was studied in 18 different organic solvents. The rate data are showing satisfactory correlation with Kamlet–Taft solvotochromic parameters (α, β and π∗). A suitable mechanism of oxidation has been proposed...|$|R

The first metalcones were the “alucones ” based on trimethylaluminum and ethylene glycol (EG) 3 and the “zincones ” based on diethylzinc and EG. 4 Other metalcones can be fabricated with various properties using different metal precursors together with <b>organic</b> <b>diols.</b> This talk reports new metalcones known as the “zircones ” using zirconium tert-butoxide (ZTB) and EG.

50|$|In general, <b>organic</b> geminal <b>diols</b> readily {{dehydrate}} {{to form a}} carbonyl group. For example, {{carbonic acid}} ((HO)2C=O) is unstable and {{has a tendency to}} convert to carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). Nevertheless, in rare situations the chemical equilibrium is in favor of the geminal diol. For example, when formaldehyde (H2C=O) is dissolved in water, the geminal diol (H2C(OH)2, methanediol) is favored. Other examples are the cyclic geminal diols decahydroxycyclopentane (C5(OH)10) and dodecahydroxycyclohexane (C6(OH)12), which are stable, whereas the corresponding oxocarbons (C5O5 and C6O6) do not seem to be.|$|R
40|$|As viscous hydroxylic <b>organic</b> compounds, <b>diols</b> are of {{interest}} for their functional molecular conformation, {{which is based on}} inter- and intramolecular hydrogen (H) -bonds. By utilising steady-state electronic and vibrational spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, and computational analyses, we report the association of the hydroxyl groups of diols via intra- or intermolecular H-bonds to enhance their reactivity as a base. Whereas the formation of an intermolecularly H-bonded dimer is requisite for diols of weak intramolecular H-bond to extract a proton from a model strong photoacid, a well-configured single diol molecule with an optimised intramolecular H-bond is revealed to serve as an effective Brønsted base with increased basicity. This observation highlights the collective role of H-bonding in acid&# 8211;base reactions, and provides mechanistic backgrounds to understand the reactivity of polyols in the acid-catalysed dehydration for the synthesis of cyclic ethers at the molecular level...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} {{and safety of}} lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are dependent on interfacial processes at {{the positive and negative}} electrodes. For example, the surface layers that form on cathodes and anodes are known to affect the kinetics and capacity of LIBs. Interfacial reactions between the electrolyte and the electrodes are also known to initiate electrolyte combustion during thermal runaway events that compromise battery safety. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and molecular layer deposition (MLD) are thin film deposition techniques based on sequential, self-limiting surface reactions. ALD and MLD can deposit ultrathin and conformal films on high aspect ratio and porous substrates such as composite particulate electrodes in lithium-ion batteries. The effects of electrode surface modification via ALD and MLD are studied using a variety of techniques. It was found that sub-nm thick coatings of Al 2 O 3 deposited via ALD have beneficial effects on the stability of LIB anodes and cathodes. These same Al 2 O 3 ALD films were found to improve the safety of graphite based anodes through prevention of exothermic solid electrolyte interface (SEI) degradation at elevated temperatures. Ultrathin and conformal metal alkoxide polymer films known as “metalcones” were grown utilizing MLD techniques with trimethylaluminum (TMA) or titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) and <b>organic</b> <b>diols</b> or triols, such as ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol (GL) or hydroquinone (HQ), as the reactants. Pyrolysis of these metalcone films under inert gas conditions {{led to the development of}} conductive metal oxide/carbon composites. The composites were found to contain sp 2 carbon using micro-Raman spectroscopy in the pyrolyzed films with pyrolysis temperatures ≥ 600 °C. Four point probe measurements demonstrated that the graphitic sp 2 carbon domains in the metalcone films grown using GL and HQ led to significant conductivity. The pyrolysis of conformal MLD films to obtain conductive metal oxide/carbon composite films is presented as a method for enabling non-conductive, but possibly electrochemically active materials, to be used for electrochemical applications...|$|R

Under aqueous conditions, diol columns run as normal phase, but may exhibit reverse phase behavior at times. This application note explores those compounds and solvent conditions that cause reverse phase behavior in diol columns.

40|$|Asymmetric {{nucleophilic}} boronate reactions {{have been}} developed using <b>organic</b> chiral <b>diols,</b> specifically binaphthols, as catalysts. A highly enantioselective allylboration of acyl cyanides under solvent-free conditions was catalyzed by (S) -Br 2 BINOL. The reaction proceeds through single exchange of boronate with the chiral catalyst, promoted by tert-butanol. Allylation products were obtained in yields up to 97 % and enantioselectivities up to 99 : 1 er. Syn- and anti-crotylborations of benzoyl cyanide were also performed, and the corresponding a-methyl products were isolated in good yields and moderate to good enantioselectivities, with the E-boronate producing a single diastereomer. This methodology represents a new route to enantioenriched homoallylic cyanohydrins through nucleophilic addition of the allyl group to acyl cyanides. The enantioselective Petasis reaction of glycolaldehyde dimer to synthesize b- amino alcohols was also investigated. With commercially available aldehyde dimer, boronic acids, and amines, electron-rich a-arylglycinols were obtained in up to 92 % yield and up to 99. 5 : 0. 5 er. Direct inject mass spectrometry studies revealed a single exchange between p-methoxyphenylboronic acid and (S) -Br 2 BINOL, as well as coordination of the imine intermediate to the catalyst-boronate complex. This reaction was further optimized to include electron-deficient boronic acids. Addition of Lewis acidic triethylborate had a two-fold effect on the reactivity; it facilitated both the exchange of boronic acid with catalyst, {{and the formation of}} the imine intermediate. Using chloroform as the solvent, and (S) -Ph 2 BINOL, halogenated phenylboronic acids participated well in the Petasis reaction. This methodology is the first asymmetric Petasis reaction of glycolaldehyde to produce b-amino alcohols. 2018 - 12 - 06 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R
