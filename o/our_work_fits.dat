40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} idea of {{supporting}} metadata querying and restructuring using extensions of the SQL: 1999 facilities for integrity constraints and active databases. Our approach involves associating meta-functionality with federation relations by means of constraints, assertions, and triggers.

An advantage of the approach described {{here is that it}} provides intrinsic, database-driven support for dynamic restructuring and federated interoperability.

40|$|In this paper, we try {{to explain}} the {{observed}} correlation between the covering factor (CF) of hot dust and the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), e. g., the bolometric luminosity (L_bol) and black hole mass (M_BH). Combining the possible dust distribution in the torus, the angular dependence of the radiation of the accretion disc, and {{the relation between the}} critical angle of torus and the Eddington ratio, there are eight possible models investigated in <b>our</b> <b>work.</b> We <b>fit</b> the observed CF with these models to determine the parameters of them. As a result, clumpy torus models can generally explain the observed correlations of tori, while the smooth models fail to produce the required CFs. However, there is still significant scatter even for the best-fitting model, which is the combination of a clumpy torus illuminated by the anisotropic radiation of accretion disc in an AGN. Although some of the observed scatter is due to the uncertainties in measuring L_bol and M_BH, other factors are required in more realistic model. The models examined in this paper are not necessary to be the physical model of tori. However, the reasonable assumptions selected during this process should be helpful in constructing physical models of tori. Comment: 12 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables. To be published in MNRA...|$|R

In fact, {{no matter what kind}} of nonlinear predictor is utilized, a right object to fit is crucial for a good fitting performance.

40|$|There {{exists a}} class of two-legged {{machines}} for which walking is a natural dynamic mode. Once started on a shallow slope, a machine of this class will settle into a steady gait quite comparable to human walking, without active control or en-ergy input. Interpretation {{and analysis of the}} physics are straightforward; the walking cycle, its stability, and its sensi-tivity to parameter variations are easily calculated. Experi-merits with a test machine verify that the passive walking effect can be readily exploited in practice. The dynamics are most clearly demonstrated by a machine powered only by gravity, but they can be combined easily with active energy input to produce efficient and dextrous walking over a broad range of terrain. 1. Static vs. Dynamic Walking Research on legged locomotion is motivated partly by fundamental curiousity about its mechanics, and partly by the practical utility of machines capable of traversing uneven surfaces.

It also imposes a speed restriction, since cyclic accelerations must be limited in order to minimize inertial effects. Outstand-ing examples of static walkers are the Odex series (Russell 1983) and the Adaptive Suspension Vehicle (Waldron 1986).

40|$|Modern {{object-oriented}} languages support many {{techniques that}} simplify {{the work of}} a programmer. Among them is type genericity — an ability to create generic descriptions of algorithms and object structures that will be automatically specialised by supplying type information at run time. On the other hand, object-oriented technologies still suffer from bad effects of aliasing — a case of many objects in program’s memory referring to the same object via different references. Ownership types is one of the ways to tame aliasing — they provide information about who is allowed to access a particular object and who is not.

40|$|<b>Our</b> <b>work</b> <b>fits</b> in {{the context}} of {{symplectic}} geometry and, in particular, the aim of this work is to compute minimal symplectic atlases for classical Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type. A symplectic manifold (M,ω) is a 2 n-dimensional manifold M equipped with a closed and nondegenerate 2 -form ω. The basic example of symplectic manifold is R^ 2 n equipped with the standard symplectic form ω_ 0 =∑_jdx_j∧ dy_j. The first interesting result about symplectic geometry is that for all p in M there is a symplectic embedding f of the 2 n-dimensional ball equipped with the standard symplectic form (B^ 2 n(r),ω_ 0) in (M,ω) such that f(0) =p. This result gave rise to the introduction of an important symplectic invariant c_G called Gromov width: it is π(r) ^ 2 where r is the maximum radius of a ball which can be symplectically embedded in M. In [1] Rudyak-Schlenk introduced the invariant: S_B(M,ω) which is the minimal number of symplectic charts needed to cover (M,ω). An immediate lower bound for S_B(M,ω) is λ(M,ω) :=maxΓ(M,ω);B(M) where B(M) is the number of charts of a minimal (not necessarily symplectic) atlas and Γ(M,ω) :=Vol(M,ω) n!/c_G(M,ω) ^n + 1; the braket x denoting the maximal integer smaller than or equal to x. Their main result about minimal atlases in [1] is the following Theorem 1 i) If λ(M,ω) >= 2 n+ 1 then S_B(M,ω) =λ(M,ω). ii) If λ(M,ω) = 2 n then S_B(M,ω_M) =deg(F) + 1. In particular this corollary implies that for a projectively induced Kaehler manifold (M,ω_M) it is sufficient to know c_G(M,ω_M) and the degree of the embedding in order to compute the invariant S_B(M,ω_M). Unfortunately computing the Gromov width of a symplectic manifold is usually a very delicate problem. However in [2] Loi-Mossa-Zuddas calculated the Gromov width of Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type. In this thesis, using the above results, we prove the following Theorem 3 Let (M,ω) be an irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces of type I,II or III. Then S_B(M,ω_M) =deg(F) + 1 when the dimension of M is sufficiently large. Moreover, using the work of Loi-Mossa-Zuddas, we are able to extend this result to product of these spaces. Unfortunately the irreducible compact domain of type IV Q_n does not satisfy the hypothesis of corollary 2 thus we cannot compute S_B using the same arguments. Nevertheless, in {{the last part of the}} thesis, we provide an explicit construction of a full symplectic embedding of Q_n, namely a collection of symplectic embeddings f_i:B^ 2 n(1) → Q_n such that the closures of the images of these embeddings cover M.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is twofold. It sets out {{to contribute to the}} study of language attitudes on a methodological as well as a descriptive level. The main goal of the study is the methodological one. Notwithstanding some exceptions (e. g. Preston 1982), quantitative language attitude research has known little methodological innovation since the introduction of the matched-guise technique in the 1960 s (Lambert et al. 1960). This relative methodological stagnation forms a stark contrast with the recent explosion of new methods in social psychology. The latter field is heavily invested in the study of attitudes and has witnessed the development of a large amount of new attitude measures in the last few decades (Petty et al. 2009; Gawronski & De Houwer 2014). In this thesis, we investigate whether linguistic attitude research can take advantage of these recent developments in psychological attitude research: is it possible to use those new attitude measures to study the social meaning of language variation? The second goal of our research is a descriptive one. In the past decades, attitudes towards Dutch language variation have been relatively understudied. In the Netherlands, this situation is changing as more linguistic attitude studies are being carried out (cf. recent work by Grondelaers et al. 2009; Grondelaers & Van Hout 2010). By contrast, in Flanders, the Dutch speaking part of Belgium, there is still much work to be done. Against this background, we aim to make a contribution to the emerging picture of the language attitudinal landscape in Flanders. To accomplish these goals, three studies were conducted. These studies focus on three different social psychological attitude measures and feature five varieties of Belgian Dutch. The first study explores the Personalized Implicit Association Test (P-IAT, Olson & Fazio 2004) to measure attitudes towards Standard Belgian Dutch and two regional varieties of Belgian Dutch (Chapter 2). The P-IAT is compared to two other attitude measures in this study: a direct rating task and a second social psychological technique called affective priming (AP, Speelman et al. 2013). Following up on the successful implementation of the P-IAT as a language attitude measure in the first study, the second study continues the exploration of the P-IAT. Experimental methods like the P-IAT often decontextualise the attitude object. Given the abundant evidence in both the social psychological and sociolinguistic literature that context significantly influences attitudes (e. g. Gawronski & De Houwer 2014; Campbell-Kibler 2007; Soukup 2013 a), we set out to investigate whether we could introduce context cues {{in the design of the}} P-IAT. If successful, the method could be used to measure attitudes in a more contextualised way. In the final study, we investigate the potential of the Relational Responding Task (RRT, De Houwer et al. 2015) as a measure for language attitudes. The RRT is used to measure which social meaning listeners associate with Standard Belgian Dutch and Colloquial Belgian Dutch. To provide the necessary background for the studies, we first present a state of the art of attitude measurement in linguistics and social psychology. In addition to this overview, we discuss in detail how the social psychological measures under study (AP, the P-IAT and the RRT) function. This is followed by a comparative review of their procedural characteristics, which points out potential advantages and shortcomings in the light of their use in sociolinguistic attitude research. Overall, on the methodological level, the results are promising: we have been able to successfully implement the P-IAT and RRT to measure language attitudes. However, further research is required to obtain a more thorough understanding of certain procedural aspects of the methods, but also to investigate a number of theoretical issues, such as the categorization processes involved in language attitudes. From a descriptive perspective, the results of our studies corroborate a number of findings that have come out of previous research and add to them. For instance, language users hold very positive attitudes towards Standard Belgian Dutch. This variety is particularly associated with status and competence and formal usage contexts, although it is also perceived positively in informal situations. Supraregional varieties of Dutch, by contrast, are exclusively associated with informal situations. Speakers of these varieties are perceived as sounding dynamic and trendy. Contrary to previous research, we have been able to measure these associations with supraregional Dutch using a direct attitude measure. The final chapter of this thesis situates our research in a larger framework to illustrate its theoretical relevance. Although the main {{objective of}} this work is to provide novel tools for sociolinguistic research on language attitudes, it also goes beyond this methodological aim. That is to say, <b>our</b> <b>work</b> <b>fits</b> within the tradition of Cognitive Sociolinguistics. This emerging field aims to combine the strengths of sociolinguistics and Cognitive Linguistics, namely the empirical study of intralinguistic variation and the study of meaning (Geeraerts & Kristiansen 2015). That Cognitive Sociolinguistic project takes shape in this thesis through the study of the social meaning language users attribute to language variation. References: Campbell-Kibler, K. (2007).
