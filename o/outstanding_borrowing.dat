40|$|Carrying out a {{restructuring}} of obligations against which CDS has been issued {{can be extremely}} complex. There will likely be critical junctures throughout the process when the debtor and/or its stakeholders are required to make choices that may ultimately {{have a significant impact}} on recoveries under the CDS contracts. ” Restructuring companies in respect of which there exists a significant credit default swaps (CDS) market adds an additional level of complexity which the debtor and all stakeholders should consider and assess early on in the process, as it could determine the success or failure of {{a restructuring}} plan. Creditors across the capital structure can purchase CDS protection. Where junior creditors with CDS protection also have cross-holdings in the senior debt, these creditors may have sufficient bargaining power to dictate the manner in which a restructuring will proceed. Acting as a group, they may be capable of blocking any proposal that does not also trigger a Credit Event (see below: Credit Events) on the CDS, thus ensuring par recovery on their junior debt even where the restructuring proposal effects a compromise and/or release of that debt. Credit Events Settlement of a typical CDS contract referencing a European corporate will be triggered upon the occurrence of one of three events (each a Credit Event) : (i) a bankruptcy of the underlying corporate (the Reference Entity), (ii) a failure by the Reference Entity to make a payment on any of its <b>outstanding</b> <b>borrowed</b> money obligations or (iii) a restructuring of any <b>outstanding</b> <b>borrowed</b> money obligations of the Reference Entity. We examine below some of the complexities that may be faced by debtors and stakeholders where obligations against which CDS has been issued become the subject of a restructuring...|$|R

Thus, rationing of the formal credit is not the only factor inhibiting the spread of formal credit in the study villages. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} February 2008 auction rate {{security}} (ARS) market freeze {{to examine the}} spillover effects of an exogenous funding liquidity shock on the underlying asset markets. Consistent with theory, I find that the stocks held by closed-end funds (CEFs) that borrow from the ARS market experience larger declines in market liquidity and lower returns than other stocks after the ARS market freeze. These effects are more pronounced when (i) these ARS-levered CEFs hold a larger fraction of shares <b>outstanding,</b> (ii) the <b>borrowing</b> level from the ARS market is higher, and (iii) the stocks are less liquid before the ARS market freeze. The spillover effects of the ARS market freeze are temporary and diminish during the next 12 months. Further investigation shows that the spillover effects are indeed associated with the heavy selling behavior of the ARS-levered CEFs after experiencing the ARS market shock. Overall, this study provides evidence that a funding liquidity shock to financial institutions can cause a decline in both market liquidity and the prices of the underlying assets...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe curent {{explosive}} {{development of}} science and technology, the increase of the inter-cultural changes and the great deal of knowledge acquired in different activity fields determined the emergence and development of terminology. The concept terminology has two meanings: the interdisciplinary branch of knowledge {{and the number of}} terms specific to various terminologies (specialty languages) providing knowledge in different fields of professional activity. As a specialized language, terminology represents a linguistic system that uses certain terms and other linguistic means in order to eliminate ambiguity in a particular field. In different activity fields the specialists use certain linguistic systems – the functional styles of the language, each of them with its own specific features as well as with some common characteristics which create an “interference area”. There is an <b>outstanding</b> trend to <b>borrow</b> neological terms, especially the American-English ones hence careful attention should be paid while introducing them in the specialized languages, the linguistic and socio-linguistic criteria are therefore to be taken into account. The terminological,,bank” of every language is currently enlarged with more and more borrowings and they undertake rapid changes in order to continuously support the wide range of activities and the progress as such...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of the {{observed}} increased share of delegated capital for trading strategies and equilibrium prices by introducing delegation into a standard Lucas exchange economy. In equilibrium, some investors trade on their own account, but others decide to delegate trading to professional fund managers. Flow-performance incentive functions describe how much capital clients provide to funds at each date as a function of past performance. Convex flow-performance relations imply that the average fund outperforms the market in recessions and underperforms in expansions. When the share of capital that is delegated is low, all funds follow the same strategy. However, when the equilibrium share of delegated capital is high, funds with identical incentives employ heterogeneous trading strategies. A group of managers borrows to take on a levered position on the stock. Thus, fund returns are dispersed in the cross-section and the <b>outstanding</b> amounts of <b>borrowing</b> and lending increase. The relation between the share of delegated capital and the Sharpe ratio typically follows an inverse U-shaped pattern.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{companies}} with relatively high debt-to-asset (leverage) ratios exhibit more variability in investment and employment patterns. Other studies argue that high aggregate corporate leverage is associated with macroeconomic instability. This paper establishes and compares the evolution of aggregate corporate leverage trends in Canada and the United States from 1961 to 1996. Leverage has increased nearly 50 percent in both countries, and the majority of this increase is attributable to a greater use of short-term debt instruments. Although the magnitude of the increase is similar in both countries, the period harboring the lion's share of the increase is country-specific. Most of the increase in corporate leverage in Canada occurred between 1974 to 1983; a period associated with low real interest rates and rapid capital expansion in western Canada. The brunt of the increase in American corporate leverage occurred between 1982 and 1990. Over this period, U. S. companies {{were in the process of}} massive capital restructuring by purchasing <b>outstanding</b> equity with <b>borrowed</b> funds. This period was also associated with an increase in the number and value of U. S. leveraged buy-outs that aided in pushing financial leverage higher.

The Kyrgyz Republic’s good economic performance owes much to its macroeconomic policies.
