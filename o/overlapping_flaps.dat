50|$|The flex {{tongue is}} placed {{on the outside of the}} boot in front of the leg and over the foot. This is in {{addition}} to the internal padded tongue. This meant that the split between the right and left halves of the boot did not require the <b>overlapping</b> <b>flaps</b> of the conventional design that keep out the snow; in the Flexon, the flex plate served this purpose. With the <b>overlapping</b> <b>flaps</b> removed, in theory the boot was easier to put on and take off, as the lower shell was open to the sky once the buckles were released and the flex plate folded forward. However, the edges of the lower shell's opening were sharp and skiers learned to live with shell bite on the instep, at least in the early years of the Flexon's evolution.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{example of}} ejector nozzle is the fixed {{geometry}} cylindrical shroud surrounding the afterburning nozzle on the J85 installation in the T-38 Talon. More complex were the arrangements {{used for the}} J58(SR-71) and TF-30(F-111) installations. They both used tertiary blow-in doors (open at lower speeds) and free-floating <b>overlapping</b> <b>flaps</b> for a final nozzle. Both the blow-in doors and the final nozzle flaps are positioned by a balance of internal pressure from the engine exhaust and external pressure from the aircraft flowfield.|$|E
5000|$|The design {{closely resembles}} a {{conventional}} front-entry design, with separate foot and leg sections riveted at the ankle. However, the <b>overlapping</b> <b>flaps</b> of these designs are cut away, leaving a slot-like opening {{running down the}} front of the leg and over the foot. A separate plastic tongue is positioned over this opening {{on the front of the}} boot, and buckled down to close it. The open cuff (the [...] "throat") makes the boots easy to get on and off, and the shaping of the tongue allows complete control over the forward flex. A single shell can be used with different tongues to provide any needed flex pattern from racing-stiff to freestyle-soft.|$|E

5000|$|Three-piece (or [...] "open-throat") {{boots were}} first {{developed}} by Mel Dalebout (around 1969), who introduced a rigid magnesium boot shell {{in that year}} (Brixia {{did the same thing}} with their aluminum shell at around the same time). The big advantage was that the main shell was a single piece that was convex at all points, meaning it could be easily produced using a plug mould. Conventional boots with <b>overlapping</b> <b>flaps</b> required more complex moulding processes. Engineers at Henke, Heierling, Sanmarco and Caber saw the advantage for high-speed moulding, and plastic three-piece boots were on the market by 1972, when Roland Collombin won the Olympic downhill in the Henke Strato.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "envelopes" [...] {{produced}} by the Hill/De La Rue machine were not {{as we know them}} today. They were flat diamond, lozenge (or rhombus)-shaped sheets or [...] "blanks" [...] which had been precut to shape before being fed to the machine for creasing and made ready for folding to form a rectangular enclosure. The edges of the <b>overlapping</b> <b>flaps</b> treated with a paste or adhesive and the method of securing the envelope or wrapper was a user choice. The symmetrical flap arrangement meant that it could be held together with a single wax seal at the apex of the topmost flap. (That the flaps of an envelope can be held together by applying a seal at a single point is a classic design feature of an envelope.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Today's plastic {{ski boots}} evolved from leather designs {{that in turn}} evolved from {{conventional}} winter hiking boots. These all followed the same basic layout; the boot was built {{on top of a}} semi-stiff sole of leather or (for a stiffer boot) wood. The upper shell consisted of single layer or multiple layers of leather and stiffeners that were formed around a foot-like wooden block, the [...] "last". Some models were designed with a single piece of leather wrapped over the toe area of the last, with {{the two sides of the}} leather meeting at the back of the heel, where they were stitched together. The designs normally left a slot-like opening and <b>overlapping</b> <b>flaps</b> running from the instep and up in front of the ankle. Laces threaded across the split section allow the boot to be tightened over the foot, and a tongue below the split sealed it to prevent water or snow entering.|$|E

5000|$|Military attire {{was simply}} regular {{clothing}} {{with the addition}} of adornments depending on the number of “marks” a soldier had. These additions consisted of a spear, axe, sword, bow, shield, steel cap, helmet, an iron coat, or a linen or cloth tunic. During this era, soldiers carried either round or crescent shaped shields usually painted red. Higher-ranking officials decorated their swords with various colours and insignias. [...] In the middle half of the century, armor began to be made of leather and weapons were made light-weight. Previous mail tunics, found to be too heavy preventing the soldier from properly fighting, were replaced by the new leather armor, which consisted of <b>overlapping</b> <b>flaps,</b> cut like scales or leaves and each dyed a different colour. [...] In {{the latter half of the}} century, warriors shaved their heads to resemble the clergy in order to confuse foreign spies. The cowl, which was covered in rings, emerged during this time and was worn under the helmet, which also had a new addition, the nose piece. The ringed knee-length tunic was slit in the front and back to allow for more comfortable riding. The length of the trousers became shorter. “Mascled armor” began to replace the traditional ringed armory. These new iron pieces were assembled to look like mesh or nets but a combination of the two patterns have been found to be used. Another variation included covering the body in rings and removing the sleeves from the tunic. Planché mentions that a “square pectoral” was added to the breast of the armor as added protection and were “quilted or covered with rings”. [...] A yellow border was added to the pectorals, sleeves, and skirts. Shields had two new adjustments: one strap looped around the arm while a second strap circled around the neck, allowing the soldier the use of both his hands.|$|E

50|$|Beginning around 1960 Bob Lange {{experimented with}} ways to replace leather with plastic. Early {{examples}} used a lace-up design, but in 1964 he combined a new, more flexible polyurethane plastic with the <b>overlapping</b> <b>flap</b> and buckle system from Henke to produce the first recognizably modern ski boot. Production examples appeared in 1966, and when Nancy Greene started winning races on them, the plastic boot became a must-have item. Replacing leather with plastic dramatically improved stiffness and control, along with durability and warmth (leather boots {{had a way of}} soaking through, which led to wet, frozen feet). Over time the cuff around the leg evolved upward, starting just over the ankle like leather boots, but rising to a point about half way to the knee by the 1980s. Only minor changes have occurred to this basic design since then.|$|R

40|$|Point-based {{representations}} {{are becoming}} increasingly common in computer graphics, especially for visualizing data sets where the number of points is large relative {{to the number of}} pixels involved in their display. When dealing with sparse point sets, however, many traditional rendering algorithms for point data perform poorly, either by generating blurry or non-occluding surface representations or by requiring extensive pre-processing to yield good results. In this paper we present a novel method for point-based surface visualization that we call Voronoi rasterization. Voronoi rasterization uses modern programmable graphics hardware to generate occluding surface representations from sparse, oriented point sets without preprocessing. In particular, Voronoi rasterization clips away <b>overlapping</b> <b>flaps</b> between neighboring splats and generates an approximation of the Voronoi diagram of the points under the surface’s geodesic distance. To approximate smooth shading and texturing on top of this clipped surface, our method uses existing techniques to construct a smoothly blended screen-space attribute field that implicitly accounts for neighborhood relations between points. 1...|$|E
40|$|Recirculation {{of fluid}} and cells through lymphatic vessels {{plays a key}} role in normal tissue homeostasis, {{inflammatory}} diseases, and cancer. Despite recent advances in understanding lymphatic function (Alitalo, K., T. Tammela, and T. V. Petrova. 2005. Nature. 438 : 946 – 953), the cellular features responsible for entry of fluid and cells into lymphatics are incompletely understood. We report the presence of novel junctions between endothelial cells of initial lymphatics at likely sites of fluid entry. <b>Overlapping</b> <b>flaps</b> at borders of oak leaf–shaped endothelial cells of initial lymphatics lacked junctions at the tip but were anchored on the sides by discontinuous button-like junctions (buttons) that differed from conventional, continuous, zipper-like junctions (zippers) in collecting lymphatics and blood vessels. However, both buttons and zippers were composed of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and tight junction–associated proteins, including occludin, claudin- 5, zonula occludens– 1, junctional adhesion molecule–A, and endothelial cell–selective adhesion molecule. In C 57 BL/ 6 mice, VE-cadherin was required for maintenance of junctional integrity, but platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule– 1 was not. Growing tips of lymphatic sprouts had zippers, not buttons, suggesting that buttons are specialized junctions rather than immature ones. Our findings suggest that fluid enters throughout initial lymphatics via openings between buttons, which open and close without disrupting junctional integrity, but most leukocytes enter the proximal half of initial lymphatics...|$|E
40|$|Brachioplasty is surging in popularity. More than 15, 000 upper-arm lifts were {{performed}} in the United States in 2012. 1 The rate of bra-chioplasty procedures has risen by 4473 % in the past 12 years. 1 However, a common concern remains— the scar associated with conventional (longitudinal) brachioplasty. In a multicenter review of 96 patients who have undergone brachioplasty, {{it was found that}} the most common complication was hypertrophic scarring, which occurred in 24 % of patients and required re-visional surgery in some cases. 2 The scar often heals poorly and widens postoperatively, 2, 3 despite the sur-geon’s efforts to optimize its location and quality. Numerous attempts to improve surgical techniques have been introduced, including Lockwood’s 4 sug-gested suspension to the clavipectoral fascia and Goddio’s 5 use of deepithelialized <b>overlapping</b> <b>flaps.</b> However, scarring and revision rates remain high. 2, 5 Thus, alternatives that obviate or minimize the scar are highly desirable. Options include noninva-sive skin-tightening procedures and minimal-inci-sion brachioplasty (ie, axillary, horizontal). However, not all patients are candidates for these procedures, and therefore the desired aesthetic outcome may not be achievable. An important advancement in longitudinal bra-chioplasty is to place the incision more caudally (from medial epicondyle to caudal axilla) rather than in the bicipital groove. This preferential posi-tion is more effective for concealing the scar when the arms are elevated or are resting at the side of the body.

40|$|The new {{developments}} of the package types (Ruf carton box, Crystal Airbox and VG Nicolaus Peeltop system) {{as well as the}} new bag of Mühlers Mühle were main object of the investigations and proved to be rather effective. Especially the Ruf carton boxes, wich are produced on a Nordson machine fulfill the requirements of an insect and dust proof box. It is preparec without patches or other supporting aids. The Crystal Aibox contains patches. Besides the pelltop system showed this patented sealing procedure the best results. Within four test runs on different machines nearly all tested packages resistes the young larvae of Plodia interpunctella. The packages with peeltop system of VG Nicolaus were as the only water and pressure tight and insect proof. This is achieved by glueing a plastic membrane underneath the <b>overlapping</b> <b>flaps</b> of the package. Similar as with the Espresso system with a paper mebrane of the Effem company, insects may hide underneath the overlapping flapps outside the inte riour of the box. One bag series was tested as new development and found to be improved. For the first time, all tested rice packages of Müllers Mühle could not be penetrated by larvae. The test series with etheric oils ended without ab breakthrough. The tested chemicals showed either toxic or none effects whatsoever towards the tested insect larvae. An orienting experiment with Diethyl-toluamid reveald some hints as to weather chemical substances can be mixed up with the glue to prevent later invasion of larvae through crevices between the flaps for a while. More sceening and testing is necessary to identify substances and dosages. This should further be combined with micro encapsulation as a means of the right formulation for slow release of the proper repellent amounts...|$|E

40|$|Check valves {{are used}} {{frequently}} {{within the field}} of microfluidic MEMS, particularly in micropump applications. Check valves serve to limit the flow of a fluid to one direction through a channel. This project was an attempt to manufacture an efficient check microvalve using polysilicon as the valve cover material. Previous work on a microvalve at RIT has been unsuccessful, as the final KOH etch has attacked the polysilicon, thus removing the valves from the openings in the silicon. It was determined that pinholes in the LPCVD nitride were allowing KOH to penetrate the etch mask and attack the substrate surface and the polysilicon. In this attempt, black wax was used as a protective coating over the LPCVD nitride on the cover side of the substrate. A crucial part of this project was the testing of the produced microvalves. In this project, nine valve designs were patterned; with each valve differing in arm length and <b>flap</b> <b>overlap</b> across the substrate opening. Of these, one valve functioned correctly after processing. The remaining valves either failed to release during the final oxide etch or were etched through during KOH etching.

The configurations studied covered both optimum and non-optimum settings of the gap and <b>overlap</b> between the <b>flap</b> and the main wing. Results indicate features different from that observed in the 20 tests on GA(W) wing section and that the hysteresis loop size was observed to be smaller for the finite wing. It was observed that the trend in the data indicated decrease in the area of hysterisis loop as the slot flow angle is increased contrary to what was observed in 2 -D tests. Hystersis was also found to be very sensitive to the slo flow angle which determines its direction with respect to either the wing or the flap chord. The hysteresis loop size diminished when the data was acquired at a much slower rate indicating it to be a quasi-steady event. Both flow patterns from tuft flow visualization and the hot-film fluctuations revealed different flow fields in increasing and decreasing modes of incidence consistent with the observation from the aerodynamic loads...|$|R
40|$|Flaps in Japanese and flaps in American English {{are similar}} acoustically and articulatorily, though they operate in quite {{different}} phonological systems: Japanese flap contrasts with {d} {{but not with}} any lateral or retroflex phones, while American English flap in intervocalic position does contrast with /l/ and /r/ but not with {d}. ^ This study concerns both the production and perception of flaps in Japanese and American English by speakers of the two languages. In addition, the phonological roles of American English /r/ and /l/ and their phonetic relationship to Japanese /r/ or Japanese /d/, and similarly, the phonological role of Japanese /d/ and its phonetic relationship to American English flap or /d/ are considered.

The perceptual evidence involves judgments by a trained phonetician, judgments by native speakers of the languge produce, and judgments by native speakers of American English for Japanese productions and vice versa. This latter, cross-linguistic, area involves labelings in the native language writing systems of the subjects. In addition, waveform editing and synthesis techniques are employed to further test the perceptual effects of putative cues to flaps in the two languages. ^ The research revealed substantial articulatory, acoustic and perceptual similarities between Japanese flaps and American English flaps.
