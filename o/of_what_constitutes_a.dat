He received his bachelor's degree but financial problems {{after his father}} became ill prevented him obtaining a master's degree. He returned to Bahrain to find employment. During his college years, he remained independent of political affiliations. According to Rajab, despite lacking a clear understanding <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> culture of human rights or knowledge of human rights standards and norms, he was active within the general Bahraini students union, speaking out against all forms of injustice. He also became involved in international campaigning on specific issues.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E

25|$|Germany {{emphasizes}} must weights {{because its}} climate {{makes it a}} challenge to ripen grapes fully, but many vintners believe that the classification system does not improve wine quality.

25|$|The koinophilia {{hypothesis}} {{is supported by}} the findings of Judith Langlois and her co-workers. They found that the average of two human faces was more attractive than either of the faces from which that average was derived. The more faces (of the same gender and age) that were used in the averaging process the more attractive and appealing the average face became. This work into averageness supports koinophilia as an explanation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> beautiful face.|$|E

25|$|In the law {{regulating}} historic {{districts in}} the United States, a contributing property or contributing resource is any building, object, or structure which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make the historic district, listed locally or federally, significant. Government agencies, at the state, national, and local level in the United States, have differing definitions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> contributing property but there are common characteristics. Local laws often regulate the changes {{that can be made}} to contributing structures within designated historic districts. The first local ordinances dealing with the alteration of buildings within historic districts was in Charleston, South Carolina in 1931.|$|E
25|$|The {{quest for}} holism leads most anthropologists {{to study a}} people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and {{linguistic}} data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs. In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> culture, of how an observer knows where {{his or her own}} culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} not any {{official}} definition <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> Cinderella team, {{there does seem to}} be a consensus that such teams represent small schools, are usually low-seeded in the tournament, and achieves at least one unexpected win in the tournament. A recent example of this is Florida Gulf Coast University, a relatively new school that held its first classes in 1997 and became Division I postseason eligible in 2011. They made their first ever appearance in the 2013 tournament, winning two games to become the first ever #15 seed to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. The term was popularized as a result of City College of New York's successful run in the 1950 tournament.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the convergent evolution in perching and patrolling site preferences of Hemipepsis ustulata with other hilltopping insects of the Sonoran Desert. The high mountain ridges attract the males of various hilltopping insect species, including tarantula hawk wasps, various butterflies, and bot flies. Among these ridges, certain locations {{are much more}} likely to be occupied by territorial males. Additionally, these preferred territories appear to be stable from year to year, and different species appear to have similar preferences for available sites. Preferred territories tend to be large, visual targets, jutting high on mountain ridges. These observations were confirmed by a study using artificial landmarks. This similar ranking preference for territories suggests a widespread convergence among the capacity of hilltopping insects’ compound eyes in their perception <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> conspicuous landmark feature.|$|E
25|$|In September 2005, a {{petition}} was {{submitted to the}} towns of Queensbury and Fort Ann, citing taxes, unfair assessments, and callous indifference from officials of both towns as reasons for village incorporation. The map of the proposed village was deemed invalid, halting the incorporation process. In 2007, a second petition was submitted but ruled legally insufficient because certain petition signatures were not dated. In March 2009, a third petition was submitted and subsequently rejected because there weren't enough signatures from Fort Ann residents. Additionally, the town supervisors stated {{that a number of}} signatures appeared more than once or were improperly witnessed. It was noted that the petition did meet all of the requirements of the New York State Village Law, however, with respect to Queensbury's section of the proposed village. According to the Village Incorporation Committee spokesperson, a lawsuit was filed against the towns for the supervisors' refusal to approve the petition based on their interpretation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> 'resident'.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{the walls}} of a sukkah can be {{constructed}} from any material that will withstand a normally anticipated terrestrial wind. If the material is not rigid and therefore will sway in the wind, the sukkah is not kosher (Talmud, Sukkah 24b). Accordingly, there is a discussion among contemporary halakhic authorities whether canvas may be used for walls: Some, such as R. Ovadiah Yosef (Shu"t Yechaveh Da'at 3:46) hold that even the slightest degree of swaying in the wind will disqualify the sukkah walls, and thus canvas cannot realistically be employed. Others, such as the Chazon Ish, permit motion to and fro of less than three handbreadths, thereby facilitating the usage of canvas walls. The specific details <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> wall, the minimum and maximum wall heights, whether there can be spaces between the walls and the roof, and the exact material required for the s'chach (roofing) can be found in various exegetical texts.|$|E

500|$|Chinese has a {{large number}} of nominal classifiers; {{estimates}} of the number in Mandarin range from [...] "several dozen" [...] or [...] "about 50", to over 900. The range is so large because some of these estimates include all types of classifiers while others include only count-classifiers, and because the idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> [...] "classifier" [...] has changed over time. Today, regular dictionaries include 120 to 150 classifiers; the 8822-word Syllabus of Graded Words and Characters for Chinese Proficiency (...) lists 81; and a 2009 list compiled by Gao Ming and Barbara Malt includes 126. The number of classifiers that are in everyday, informal use, however, may be lower: linguist Mary Erbaugh has claimed that about two dozen [...] "core classifiers" [...] account for most classifier use. As a whole, though, the classifier system is so complex that specialized classifier dictionaries have been published.|$|E
