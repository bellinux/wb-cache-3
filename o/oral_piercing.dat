40|$|Objective. Specific {{regulations}} {{about education}} and training for body piercing licensure courses {{have to be considered}} due to the great increase in <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> practices. The aim of the present survey was to assess the local and systemic risk awareness in the practice of <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> and their prevention in a sample of Italian piercers. Materials and methods. An anonymous 20 -item questionnaire was administered to 30 body licensed piercers in a small town of central Italy. Licenses certificates were issued by Lazio Region after the completion of an approved training program for standard body piercing including 90 hours of course and a final examination as provided by regional law. The questionnaire surveyed on oral cavity anatomy, local and systemic risks as result of <b>oral</b> <b>piercing,</b> piercing maintenance and need of a dental visit. Results. Response rate was 66. 6 %. Only 20 % of respondents was aware about oral cavity anatomy and none had knowledge about tongue and gums anatomy. Only 10 % enlightened the need of a dental visit and 30 % was aware about piercingrelated temporary paralysis. The piercing maintenance was habitually proposed only by 40 % of respondents. Conclusion. The study participants showed a low level of awareness regarding the potential health risks of <b>oral</b> <b>piercing.</b> Poor knowledge of anatomy and local and systemic risks and poor awareness of the importance of piercing maintenance explanation.

40|$|Abstract: Background. The <b>oral</b> an {{perioral}} <b>piercing</b> has a {{long history}} as part of religious, tribal,cultural or sexual symbolism and nowdays there is a high incidence of <b>oral</b> and perioral <b>piercing</b> in the adolescent population. This practice {{has a long}} history as part of religious, tribal, cultural or sexual symbolism. This article reviews current knowledge on injuries or diseases that might be produced by <b>piercing</b> in the <b>oral</b> cavity. We propose a classification to diagnosed the pathologies related to <b>oral</b> an perioral <b>piercing</b> Methods. A search was conducted of articles in PubMed, Scielo published between 1997 and 2007, using the key words ``oral and perioral, piercing ´´, ``oral, piercing and disease”, ``recessions and oral piercing´´. It has reviewed about twentythree articles 17 were narrative reviews and 6 case series Results. A review was carried out on the origins of oral and perioral body piercing and its local implications, classifying the different alterations like recessions, systemic implications that it can produce in the oral and perioral cavity. Conclusion. Patients with <b>oral</b> and perioral <b>piercing</b> should be regularly followed up because of the possible development of different types of adverse effects. Clinical implications. Adverse effects of <b>oral</b> and perioral <b>piercing</b> can be systemic, with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis B or C, or can be local, with alteration of oral mucosae or even of dental structures.

40|$|Integuments play a {{key role}} for the {{integrity}} of the bodily tissues. Both teeth and <b>oral</b> implants <b>pierce</b> the gingiva or alveolar mucosa with an interface acting as a relative seal. The epithelia adhering by means a basal membrane to either the implant or a tooth are not keratinized. They both contain laminin- 5 with a similar structural relationship. The cytokeratins are strikingly similar in both instances. Il- 1 beta and TGF-beta 1, when overexpressed jeopardize the soft tissue healing and lead to fibrosis. Subepithelial bullous diseases may thus be a relative contra-indication. Although soft tissue innervation has been described, Merkel cells seem to be absent around artificial abutments. The subepithelial vascular supply with its characteristic loops is also found in both instances. Furthermore the stroma and the outflow crevicular fluid are strikingly similar from a quantitative and compositional viewpoint. When a biofilm accumulates on a tooth or an implant, the surrounding soft tissues demonstrate an inflammatory reaction, which cannot be distinguished from eachother. This will interact with the healing of blistering diseases as observed with the natural dentition. The non-plaque related pathologies of peri-implant gingival and alveolar mucosa are hardly documented but some case reports reveal a similar reaction. For example gingival cyclosporin also induces hyperplasia around implants. Few reports provide histological insights on the mucosal pathologies such as lichen planus or pemphigoid. This part of oral pathology merits more attention. At the clinical level periodontologists can meanwhile extrapolate their expertise to the peri-implant soft tissues. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to focus the {{awareness}} of complications of <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> among a group of adolescents and young Italian adults with intraoral piercings. Material and Methods: A total of 225 teenagers were asked to complete a questionnaire on the awareness of complications of <b>oral</b> <b>piercing.</b> An additional questionnaire was administered in case of <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> worn, based on site piercing, knowledge about piercer license, oral and systemic risks due to <b>oral</b> <b>piercing,</b> disinfection and sterilization of the material pierced, information by the piercer about piercing hygiene maintenance and post-piercing dentist check-up. After questionnaire all partecipants received a brochure with some information about risks and maintenance mode of piercing. Results: Data revealed that more than 50 % of teens surveyed was found to wear a piercing. Only 25. 3 % was aware of the risk of HCV cross-infection and only 17. 3 % reported of knowledge about risk of endocarditis. Only 17 % checked the piercer license and only 18 % sterilization and disinfection of the materials used. 53. 7 % did not received explanations about the risks associated with piercing. With regard to the maintenance mode of the piercing, it has been suggested to brush the piercing bar in 17 % of cases. The post piercing specialist visits have been suggested only in 7 % of cases. Conclusions: The general lack of awareness of complications and maintenance mode related to <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> needs to be addressed by some education programs performed at school and by dentists...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{comparative}} study was to analyze cytopathologically and chemico-physically the mucosa surrounding <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> to correlate results with adverse tissue signs. Materials and methods: The tongue superficial mucosa of 15 young subjects (control group) and the superficial mucosa surrounding <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> of 15 young subjects (test group, TG) were smeared on slides, Papanicolaou stained and analyzed under the optical microscope. Some smears were prepared for (back-scattered) scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray microanalysis to study piercing fragments. Results: Smears of TG displayed a variable extent of bacterial cytolysis of epithelial cells, fungi, hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, granulocyte infiltration, calcium formations and bacterial flora; the four last statistically significant (P < 0. 05). Foreign bodies surrounded by keratinocytes were detected under both light and SEM. X-ray microanalyses highlighted piercing alloy aggression, ion release and an inverse gradient of ion concentration inside keratinocytes. Conclusions: The pathological findings in smears correlated with adverse effects of <b>oral</b> <b>piercing.</b> Ion release {{may be related to}} direct toxic effects and belated reactions because of metal sensitization.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the knowledge of young adults on health risks and complications associated with the use of intraoral and perioral piercing. Material and methods: A descriptive transversal study using primary data. The study group comprised individuals with 18 years of age or more who were found in collective spaces, in the urban perimeter of Balneário Camboriu (Santa Catarina). The probabilistic sample was calculated as infinite population, defining a margin of error of 5 %. The survey data were collected through an in-person structured questionnaire. Results: 395 individuals (39. 5 % male; 60. 5 % female) participated in the research, with ages ranging from 18 to 26 years-old. Most of the individuals (74. 2 %) have medium level of education. Six percent (6 %) were or had been using <b>oral</b> <b>piercing.</b> Sixty-seven percent (67 %) did not have received any information about the possible implications for health, as a result of the use of oral piercing; however, 89. 7 % believed that the use of this accessory offered risks to health. The percentage of users of <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> in the group was 6 %, among which 93 % told that they had observed some type of alteration as a result of the use of <b>oral</b> <b>piercing.</b> Conclusion: Most of the participants of this research did not have suitable knowledge on the health risks, as a result of the use of an <b>oral</b> <b>piercing.</b> Therefore the accomplishment of information campaigns for general population is fundamental, in which the -dentist must play a significant role...|$|E

40|$|Although <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> {{has been}} an {{uncommon}} practice in the Western world, the insertion of metal objects into intra-oral and peri-oral pierced sites is growing in popularity. Tongue piercing is one such practice whereby a metal barbell is inserted into the tongue after piercing with a 14 - 16 gauge needle. Pain, swelling and infection are the most serious consequences associated with this procedure. Other adverse outcomes include mucosal or gingival trauma, chipped or fractured teeth, increased salivary flow, calculus build-up, and interference with speech, mastication and swallowing. This article presents a case report on tongue piercing and highlights the procedure involved. Special attention is given to complications and dental implications associated with such an unusual practice...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the current}} {{research}} {{was to assess the}} prevalence of gingival recession and to investigate possible associations among this condition, periodontal and epidemiological variables in a sample of young Greek adults in a general dental practice. Material and Methods: A total of 1, 430 young adults was examined clinically and interviewed regarding several periodontal and epidemiological variables. Collected data included demographic variables, oral hygiene habits and smoking status. Clinical examination included the recording of dental plaque, supragingival calculus presence, gingival status and buccal gingival recession. Multivariate logistic regression analysis model was performed to access the possible association between gingival recession and several periodontal and epidemiological variables as potential risk factors. Results: The overall prevalence of gingival recession was 63. 9 %. The statistical analysis indicated that higher edu - cational level [OR= 2. 12, 95 % CI= 0. 53 - 8. 51], cigarette smoking [OR= 1. 97, 95 % CI= 1. 48 - 7. 91], frequent tooth brushing [OR= 0. 98, 95 % CI= 0. 56 - 1. 96], presence of <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> [OR= 0. 92, 95 % CI= 0. 38 - 1. 58], presence of gingival inflammation [OR= 4. 54, 95 % CI= 1. 68 - 7. 16], presence of dental plaque [OR= 1. 67, 95 % CI= 0. 68 - 2. 83] and presence of supragingival calculus [OR= 1. 34, 95 % CI= 0. 59 - 1. 88], were the most important associated factors of gingival recession. Conclusions: The observations of the current research supported the results from previous authors that several periodontal factors, educational level and smoking were significantly associated with the presence of gingival re - cession, while presence of <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> was a new factor that was found to be associated with gingival recession...|$|E
40|$|Piercing of {{the tongue}} and {{perioral}} regions is an increasingly popular expression of body art, with more patients coming in for a routine check-up with tongue and/or lip piercings. Several complications of <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> have been reported, {{some of which are}} life-threatening. In the present clinical survey the prevalence of both tongue and lip piercing complications in oral health was assessed in a group of 50 patients. The most common dental problem registered was chipping of the teeth, especially in association with tongue piercing. Gingival recession was seen as a result of lip piercing with studs. Postprocedural complications included oedema, haemorrhage and infection. Therefore, dentists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons should be given more authority to advise patients with oral and facial piercings or those who plan to acquire this type of body art...|$|E
40|$|T he {{growing trend}} for body {{jewellery}} is amatter {{of concern for}} all dental professionals. Strictly speaking, the term “body jewellery” refers to jewellery {{that is designed to}} go through the body, rather than simply on the body. Examples of dental relevance include lip studs and rings, tongue bars, and rings placed through the uvula. As will be discussed in this article, there are multiple compli-cations from intra-oral piercing and from an ethical standpoint, all dental professionals should dis-courage <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> because of these risks. Most dental professionals are well aware of the common long term risks of intra-oral body jew-ellery, such as damaging teeth on tongue barbells while eating, sleeping, talking or chewing. Certain problems such as speech impairment from oral jew-ellery 1 and swallowed jewellery 2 are obvious complications. Thus the emphasis herein will be on the broader list of less obvious but nevertheless doc-umented problems, summarized in Tables 1 and 2. It is doubtful whether such a comprehensive listing of complications is considered by every person contemplating undergoing or performing intra-oral piercing. In this author’s view, patients should be actively discouraged from having piercings involving the oral cavity, while patients with existing piercings should be informed of all the long term complications and encouraged strenuously to remove their intra-oral body jewellery and allow the hole to close. If patients will not do this, they should remove tongue bars every time before they eat, sleep or engage in strenuous physical activity. Missing the point: The risks of intra-oral piercin...|$|E
40|$|Piercing is the {{practice}} of puncturing {{some parts of the}} body to apply ornamental objects. The presence of oral and perioral piercings are a risk factor for many acute and chronic complications, such as chipping of the dental enamel, periodontal lesions and infection. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the prevalence of Hp and tongue piercing complications in the dental and periodontal tissues in a sample of young adults. Twenty-five adult patients were examined (test group: 11 males and 14 females with an average age of 23. 4 ± 3. 6 years) who had had a minimum of one labial or tongue piercing for at least 1 year and were compared with 25 subjects (control group: 11 males - 44 %, and 14 females - 56 %) without any lingual or labial piercing. A questionnaire was compiled for each patient and a clinical examination was performed. The following parameters were examined by the same operator: abnormal toothwear, tooth chipping or cracking, clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing pocket depth (PD) and gingival recession (GR, classified by using Miller's classification). The data were analyzed using χ 2 or Fisher's exact test for small numbers and non-parametric Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests to examine for differences in continuity; the level of significance was p< 0. 05. According to the results found in the present study the prevalence of abnormal tooth wear and tooth chipping was higher in the subjects with labial or lingual piercing. Moreover, patients with tongue or labial piercing exhibited a higher GR in comparison to control subjects without any <b>oral</b> <b>piercing.</b> No differences were observed between the two groups as regards CAL and PD. A significant association between the duration of piercing and dental defects was found in the group of patients with piercings with greater prevalence of tooth and periodontal defects in the group of 13 subjects who had had the piercings for a period ≥ 4 years.

40|$|Piercing is the {{practice}} of puncturing {{some parts of the}} body, including the area of the stomach, to apply ornamental objects. The presence of oral and perioral piercings are a risk factor for numerous acute and chronic complications, such as chipping of the dental enamel, lesions of the gums and infection. The presence of piercings in the oral cavity may also act as a stimulant for inflammation and determine modifications in the components of the saliva. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate whether there is a variation in the inflammatory or immunitary components of the saliva of adult patients with labial and tongue piercings. Twenty-five adult patients were examined (11 males and 14 females with an average age of 23. 4 ± 3. 6 years) who had had a minimum of one labial or tongue piercing for at least 1 year. A questionnaire was compiled for each patient and the composition of the saliva was examined, before and for the 72 hours after removal of the piercings. The data was analyzed using the student's t-test for independent samples and the level of significance was placed at p< 0. 05. The examination of the saliva showed a statistically significant increase (p< 0. 05) of interleukin-l and - 8, of lysozyme and amylase. A more basic value of pH (p< 0. 05) was also found and a decrease in the immunoglobulins, in particular of IgA (p< 0. 05). After the removal of the piercings, the parameters of the saliva returned to the reference values, with the exception of the immunoglobulins, whose values remained the same as in the first saliva examination. The presence of piercings in labial areas or in the tongue is accompanied by chronic inflammation in the components of the saliva, with an increase in the level of the interleukins. Furthermore, in patients who have had an <b>oral</b> <b>piercing</b> for a longer period, the level of interleukins is even higher. This inflammatory situation, however, may recede in a few days after the removal of the irritating agent. Labial or tongue piercings also determine an increase in the flow of saliva, an increase in saliva enzymes, of lysozyme in particular, and a more basic pH value.
