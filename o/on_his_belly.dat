500|$|Born in Cleveland, Gedeon {{was a star}} athlete at Cleveland's West High School, {{where he}} was a member of the class of 1935. [...] He was a [...] athlete who excelled in American football, baseball, and track and field. While ice skating in Brookside Park in Cleveland as a youth, the ice gave way and Gedeon's cousin plunged through up to his neck. [...] The cousin later recalled: [...] "Elmer slid across the ice <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly</b> and pulled me out." [...] Gedeon's uncle, Joe Gedeon, was a Major League Baseball player who was implicated in the Chicago Black Sox scandal.|$|E
500|$|The Mahabharata {{describes}} him thus: Kabandha was [...] "as {{big as a}} mountain, dark as a black cloud, with pointed hairs {{all over}} his body and looked fierce with a voice as loud as thunder. He had an eye on his stomach, round and yellow, emitting a glare like a fire-name. Looking wicked he thrust his big tongue out of his huge mouth licking the sides." [...] The Ramayana presents a similar description of Kabandha. Kabandha had a broad chest and was without a head or neck. He had only one eye {{on his chest and}} a mouth <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly.</b> He used his long arms to draw his prey closer. Kabandha is often depicted as a tree.|$|E

500|$|The Ramayana narrates: Kabandha {{was born}} as a gandharva (celestial musician) named [...] Vishvavasu. He {{was the son}} of the gandharva Sri Vishvavasu or Sri and was also known as Danu (दनु). Vishvavasu {{performed}} penance and got the boon of immortality from the creator-god Brahma. He became arrogant due to his boon and attacked Indra, the god-king of heaven. Indra used his celestial weapon the Vajra (thunderbolt) and drove Vishvavasu's head and thighs into his body. Vishvavasu pleaded that he be given a way to find and eat food. Upon Vishvavasu's beseeching, Indra gave him two long arms and a mouth <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly.</b> Indra also decreed that Kabandha would regain his original form when Rama severs his arms.|$|E
500|$|The {{young are}} precocial and already covered in down when they {{emerge from the}} eggs. Soon after they are hatched the female leads the chicks {{to one of the}} many wadis that wind across the plains and there she teaches them to peck at and ingest seeds. It is four or five weeks before they are fledged and able to fly. Meanwhile, the problem of {{supplying}} them with water is solved by the male which has specially adapted, absorbent down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly.</b> While at the waterhole he immerses himself in the water to saturate the plumage which absorbs a quantity that is sufficient for the chicks to last them until the following day. When he leaves the waterhole with his water-laden feathers, the male emits a repeated high-pitched [...] "queet - queet - queet" [...] calls. When the female and chicks pick up the sounds of his approach, they reciprocate, and by this means the male can find his family even when they have moved away from the nest. On his arrival he assumes an upright posture and raises his wings, displaying the wet belly feathers. This is the sign for the chicks to approach and stand underneath him with their beaks upturned and suck the fluid from between the feathers.|$|E

Lucifer reappears {{in a second}} form, as a tap-dancing trombonist dressed as a torero with a black cape and hat, and the gremlin turns into a dragon. Michael gives battle and the dragon, wounded many times, sinks to the ground. Michael borrows the conductor's long baton to deliver the coup de grâce. The dragon tries one last time to rise, but falls <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly.</b> The trombonist, too, {{staggers}} and falls on his back, legs in the air.|$|E

2500|$|On 10 October, Beurling {{was testing}} his newly {{serviced}} Spitfire {{when he was}} vectored to intercept two Bf 109s, flying line abreast at 1,000ft over Filfla. He reported to have hit the [...] "starboard fellow" [...] in the engine: [...] "He pancaked right smack down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly</b> and flipped over onto his back." [...] The second BF 109 tried to fly away but he hit the gas tank: [...] "The ship blow up, complete with pilot." [...] Those [...] "kills" [...] brought Beurling's Malta tally to 21, plus another shared with two others. But {{there is no record}} of a Messerschmitt crashing on the island on 10 October 1942, nor any German losses. On the morning of 13 October, three miles north of St Paul’s Bay, Beurling, attacked a formation of Ju 88s, escorted by 30 Bf 109s. He claimed to have at first hit a bomber, then an oncoming Bf 109 that burst into flames. Seconds later, he shot at a second Messerschmitt, without observing strikes, “but pilot bailed out”. On 16 October he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the citation read: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another unusual {{feature is}} the slanted {{overhang}} of the frontal part of the chassis which has {{the form of a}} pointed nose, ending in a high obliquely protruding steel spur. It had been designed for cutting through and crushing down German barbed wire, thus opening passages for following French infantry, originally seen as the primary function of the system. This long overhang could cause the tank to ditch itself readily. [...] The major dimensions of the tank are a length of , a width of [...] and a height of [...] The design is of the early so-called [...] "box tank" [...] type, in which the crew, propulsion system and all manner of equipment are not clearly separated. As a result, there is no real fighting compartment. The room available to the crew, illuminated by three small electric lights, is entered through a double door {{in the back of the}} tank and is extremely cramped. The crew consisted of a commanding officer who was also the driver; an NCO who was the gunner, two machine gunners, a loader who assisted both the cannon and the machine guns and a mechanic who doubled as a machine gun loader. Four of these six men had, at their assigned position, to crouch inside a [...] high space between the roof and the tank's floor. [...] They then had to stand within two narrow troughs, one, behind the driver's seat, used by the gunner and a second square one more to the back, between the suspension elements, used by the cannon loader and the two machine gunners. [...] Most of the space however, had a height of just three feet between the roof and the covering of transmission and suspension: if the mechanic wanted to assist the right machine gun, he had to lie <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>belly</b> to load it. Part of each Schneider tank team were also three embedded riflemen who functioned as a sort of outside crew, during battle directly accompanying the vehicle. [...] All-around protection was provided by 11.4mm steel plate, later improved by a spaced armour of 5.4/5.5mm, raising the weight from 12.5 to 13.5 tonnes. The roof had 5.5mm armour. [...] The plates are partly riveted; the superstructure is largely bolted.|$|E

50|$|The {{story of}} Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln (d. 1255) {{said that after}} the boy was dead, his body {{was removed from the}} cross and laid <b>on</b> a table. <b>His</b> <b>belly</b> was cut open and his {{entrails}} were removed for some occult purpose, such as a divination ritual.
