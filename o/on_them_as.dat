Their match began as Rude {{attacked}} Junkyard Dog from behind, who retaliated by headbutting Rude several times. Subsequently, Rude climbed to the wrestling ring's top rope and pulled down his tights to reveal another pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl Roberts <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> <b>As</b> a result, Jake Roberts, Cheryl Roberts' husband, ran to the ring and attacked Rude, forcing the referee to disqualify the Junkyard Dog.|$|E

5|$|Mount Bailey {{is part of}} the High Cascades in {{the western}} United States. The High Cascades have long been glaciated, by both Pacific-bred storms and natural, elevation-caused, {{glaciation}}. In fact, glaciation probably formed <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> early as the late Miocene. Over time, as the range built up, newer activity diminished older Tertiary age rock. Creating lava plateaus, Pliocene activity, mostly basaltic and andesitic, was probably responsible for the original cones at Bailey, Thielsen, and Union Peak.|$|E

5|$|About January 1843, on {{the orders}} of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H. Stevenson, the slab was blown to pieces to clear and widen the {{passageway}} at the Singapore River mouth to make space for Fort Fullerton and the quarters of its commander. Some sources claim that the Superintendent of Public Works, George Drumgoole Coleman, {{was responsible for the}} Stone's destruction, but he was on leave and not in Singapore {{at the time of its}} blasting. Lieutenant-Colonel James Low had petitioned to have the sandstone slab spared, but had been told that it was in the way of a projected bungalow. On the explosion taking place, he crossed the river from his office and selected fragments that had letters <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> <b>As</b> the fragments were very bulky, he had them chiselled into small slabs by a Chinese man. He selected some of the smaller fragments bearing the most legible parts of the inscription and sent them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum in Calcutta (now known as the Indian Museum) for analysis, where they arrived in about June 1848.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> they tried {{to take pictures of}} the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|In Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks (1984), the Supreme Court summarily affirmed, {{without a}} written opinion, a lower court's {{decision}} that 1982 amendment to Section 2 is constitutional. Justice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger, dissented from the opinion. Their reasoning {{was that the}} case presented complex constitutional issues that should have warranted a full hearing. In later cases, the Supreme Court {{is more likely to}} disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a written opinion, but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> Supreme Court judgments with written opinions. Partially due to Brooks, the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 3 October 1944, the Partisan 28th Slavonia Division {{assaulted}} a squadron of the reconnaissance battalion at Janja close to the Drina on the eastern boundary of the security zone. As they broke out of the encirclement to the north, {{the rest of the}} reconnaissance battalion drove south from Bijeljina and stopped the Partisan advance at heavy cost. Rushing towards Janja from the east, III/27 came into contact with Partisans around Modran, reaching the Janja garrison at 10pm that night and received artillery reinforcement by 3/AR 13 during the night. At dawn the following day, an additional four Partisan brigades attacked the garrison in Janja, with fighting continuing throughout the day before the Partisans withdrew to the south. Jagdkommandos were sent after the fleeing enemy but were not able to inflict significant losses <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> they had already crossed the Drina into the German-occupied territory of Serbia. Following this battle, Army Group F concluded that the division's overall combat value was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{attained}} {{their greatest}} diversity during the Miocene, such as with baleen whales with over 20 recognized genera {{in comparison to}} only six extant genera. Such diversity presented an ideal setting to support a super-predator such as megalodon. However, {{by the end of}} the Miocene, many species of mysticetes had gone extinct; surviving species may have been faster swimmers and thus more elusive prey. Furthermore, after the closure of the Central American Seaway, tropical whales decreased in diversity and abundance. The extinction of megalodon correlates with the decline of many small mysticete lineages, and it is possible that it was quite dependent <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> a food source. Additionally, a marine megafauna extinction during the Pliocene was discovered to have eliminated 36% of all large marine species including 55% of marine mammals, 35% of seabirds, 9% of sharks, and 43% of sea turtles, likely aiding in its extinction; megalodon may have been too large to sustain itself on the declining tropical food supply. The cooling of the oceans during the Pliocene might have restricted the access of megalodon to the polar regions, depriving it of its food source of large whales which had migrated there.|$|E
5|$|The Cistercian monasteries in {{the north}} of England {{resisted}} the tax, claiming that they were immune to taxation. John put pressure <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> he was {{in the north}} when the tax was announced, but the various abbeys appealed to Hubert Walter, by then Chancellor. Walter secured from the abbeys the promise of a group payment of £1,000, but in June 1200 the King rejected the offer. In October, the King returned from Normandy and resumed pressure on the monasteries, ordering the confiscation of all Cistercian livestock on royal lands after two weeks if a settlement was not reached. At the end of November, through Walter's intercession, the King capitulated and agreed to a Cistercian immunity from this tax.|$|E

5|$|With the Viet Cong line of {{withdrawal}} carrying them past the Australian position, heavy fire was maintained <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> they attempted a partial retreat, resulting in further casualties. However, as daybreak neared the Viet Cong lingered, unwilling to commit to an all-out attack, but also unwilling to completely withdraw. Finally, the main Viet Cong attack began at 05:30. Earlier losses had been heavy, though, and {{they were unable to}} concentrate in sufficient numbers to mount a massed assault. Instead only a series of disjointed attacks followed, none more than 40 men strong. By 06:45 these attacks had been repelled by the Americans and the Viet Cong withdrew before dawn, avoiding the arrival of additional American air support.|$|E
5|$|Visual arts were practiced {{underground}} as well. Cafes, {{restaurants and}} private homes were turned into galleries or museums; some were closed, with their owners, staff and patrons harassed, arrested or even executed. Polish underground artists included Eryk Lipiński, Stanisław Miedza-Tomaszewski, Stanisław Ostoja-Chrostowski, and Konstanty Maria Sopoćko. Some artists worked directly for the Underground State, forging money and documents, and creating anti-Nazi art (satirical posters and caricatures) or Polish patriotic symbols (for example kotwica). These works were reprinted on underground presses, and those intended for public display were plastered to walls or painted <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> graffiti. Many {{of these activities}} were coordinated under the Action N Operation of Armia Krajowa's Bureau of Information and Propaganda. In 1944 three giant (6m, or 20ft) puppets, caricatures of Hitler and Benito Mussolini, were successfully displayed in public places in Warsaw. Some artists recorded life and death in occupied Poland; despite German bans on Poles using cameras, photographs and even films were taken. Although {{it was impossible to}} operate an underground radio station, underground auditions were recorded and introduced into German radios or loudspeaker systems. Underground postage stamps were designed and issued. Since the Germans also banned Polish sport activities, underground sport clubs were created; underground football matches and even tournaments were organized in Warsaw, Kraków and Poznań, although these were usually dispersed by the Germans. All of these activities were supported by the Underground State's Department of Culture.|$|E
