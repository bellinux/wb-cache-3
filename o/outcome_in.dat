5|$|Schizophrenia is a {{major cause}} of disability, with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate <b>outcome</b> <b>in</b> 35% and a poor <b>outcome</b> <b>in</b> 27%. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. These conclusions, however, have been questioned.|$|E

Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the effect of learning model toward learning <b>outcomes</b> <b>in</b> mathematics viewed from the reasoning ability. The learning models of this research were cooperative learning model of the GI with scientific, the cooperative learning model of the TPS with scientific, and the classical learning with scientific. This research used the quasi experimental research method with the factorial design of 3 x 3. Its population was all of the students in Grade VIII of State Junior Secondary Schools of Karanganyar. The samples of the research were taken by using the stratified cluster random sampling technique. The samples consisted of 280 students. The instruments used to gather the data were test of learning <b>outcomes</b> <b>in</b> mathematics and test of reasoning ability. The proposed hypotheses of the research were tested by using the two-way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The results of the research were as follows. 1) The students instructed with GI with scientific had a better learning <b>outcomes</b> <b>in</b> mathematics than those instructed TPS with scientific and those instructed the classical learning with scientific. Furthermore, the students instructed TPS with scientific had a better learning <b>outcomes</b> <b>in</b> mathematics than those instructed the classical learning model with scientific. 2) The learning <b>outcomes</b> <b>in</b> mathematics of the students with the high and moderate reasoning ability had a better than that of the students with the low reasoning ability. In addition, the students with the high reasoning ability had the same learning <b>outcomes</b> <b>in</b> mathematics as the students with the moderate reasoning ability. 3) On model of the GI with scientific, the students with the high and low reasoning ability had the same learning <b>outcomes</b> <b>in</b> mathematics as the students with the moderate reasoning ability.

5|$|Benzodiazepines, while {{useful in}} the {{management}} of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse <b>outcome</b> <b>in</b> alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management. Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting {{more than a quarter of}} people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Those who are long-term users of benzodiazepines should not be withdrawn rapidly, as severe anxiety and panic may develop, which are known risk factors for relapse into alcohol abuse. Taper regimes of 6–12 months have been found to be the most successful, with reduced intensity of withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Nablus {{came under}} Jordanian control. Thousands of Palestinian {{refugees}} fleeing from areas captured by Israel arrived in Nablus, settling {{in refugee camps}} {{in and around the}} city. Its population doubled and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps still located within the city limits today are Ein Beit al-Ma', Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian period, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. The 1967 Six-Day War ended in the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s.

5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating <b>outcome</b> <b>in</b> TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure. TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents. During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.|$|E

The estimate of 101 enemy dead officially provided by the U.S. military was likely much inflated to emphasize {{the scale of the}} 'American victory'. For retired U.S. Army Brigadier General James E. Shelton, who was then a major and served as an Operations Officer with the 2nd Battalion, the lack of reliable intelligence and overconfidence on the part of Allen as the battalion commander, were some of the factors that led to the disastrous <b>outcome</b> <b>in</b> the Ong Thanh battle. Furthermore, the American soldiers under Allen's command lacked fighting experience, whereas the Viet Cong soldiers of the 9th Division were tough and experienced light infantry.
