40|$|A {{limiting}} factor of tuneable diode laser spectroscopy (TDLS) with wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) {{is the presence}} of background residual amplitude modulation (RAM) on the recovered 1 st harmonic signal. The presence of this background term is due to direct modulation of the source laser power. This work presents a novel method to optically remove the unwanted background, with the major benefit being that measurement sensitivity can be increased.

40|$|The {{degree of}} impact-induced {{devolatilization}} of nonporous serpentine, porous serpentine, and deuterium-enriched serpentine was investigated using two independent experimental methods, the gas recovery method and the solid recovery method, yielding consistent results. The gas recovery method enables {{determination of the}} chemical and hydrogen isotopic composition of the <b>recovered</b> <b>gases.</b> Experiments on deuterium-enriched serpentine unambiguously identify the samples {{as the source of}} the <b>recovered</b> <b>gases,</b> as opposed to other possible contaminants. For shock pressures near incipient devolatilization (P_(initial) = 5. 0 GPa), the hydrogen isotopic composition of the evolved gas {{is similar to that of}} the starting material. For higher shock pressures the bulk evolved gas is significantly lower in deuterium than the starting material. There is also significant reduction of H_ 2 O to H_ 2 in <b>gases</b> <b>recovered</b> at higher shock pressures, probably caused by reaction of evolved H_ 2 O with the metal gas recovery fixture. The hydrogen isotopic fractionation between the evolved gas and the residual solid indicates nonequilibrium, kinetic control of gas-solid isotopic ratios. In contrast, gaseous H_ 2 O-H_ 2 isotopic fractionation suggests high temperature (800 – 1300 K) isotopic equilibrium between the gaseous species, indicating initiation of devolatilization at sites of greater than average energy deposition (i. e., shear bands). Impact-induced hydrogen isotopic fractionation of hydrous silicates during accretion can affect the distribution of hydrogen isotopes of planetary bodies during accretion, leaving the interiors enriched in deuterium. The significance of this process for planetary development depends on the models used for extrapolation of the observed isotopic fractionation to devolatilizations greater than those investigated experimentally and assumptions about timing and rates of protoatmosphere loss, frequency of multiple impacts, and rates of gas-solid or gas-melt isotopic re-equilibration. A simple model indicates that substantial planetary interior enrichments of D/H relative to that of the incident material can result from impact-induced hydrogen fractionation during accretion...|$|R

40|$|The Pilot-Scale Hydrate Simulator (PHS, 117. 8 L {{pressure}} vessel) is used {{to study}} the methane hydrate dissociation with dual horizontal wells using both the steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and the steam assisted anti-gravity drainage (SAAD) methods. This study {{is the first time}} to propose the evaluation and the comparisons of the methane hydrate dissociation using these two methods. Both SAGD and SAAD technique are suitable for <b>recovering</b> <b>gas</b> from the unconsolidated hydrate reservoirs with high permeability. The experimental results indicate that in SAGD, the steam chamber expands and the fluid (gas and water) production process can be divided into three stages: (1) the original water and gas in the vessel are driven towards the well, and only gas is produced, (2) the gas and the original water are produced simultaneously, and (3) the steam chamber expands to the production well, and the hot water is produced. The area with limited temperature increase during the steam injection process corresponds to the hydrate undissociated zone in the reservoir. The hydrate dissociation rate, the gas production rate and the energy efficiency ratio (EER) in both the cases of SAGD and SAAD decrease over time. Comparing with that in SAGD, gas is easier to be produced from the upper production well in SAAD, and the long-term EER in SAAD is also larger. In a word, as a gas-producing method, SAAD seems to be more suitable for <b>recovering</b> <b>gas</b> from the hydrate reservoir than SAGD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
