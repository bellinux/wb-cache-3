5|$|The {{different}} species of Eucteniza are distinguished by differences in body size, limb proportions, number of tibial spines, and shape of female sperm receptacles, as well as geographic location. Most species are known from male specimens only, but E. rosalia and E. panchovillai are known only from female specimens. Eucteniza species are distributed throughout central and northern Mexico, much of Texas, and {{the lower part of}} the Baja Peninsula. Many species are only known from the type locality, the site where the type specimen or specimens were originally collected. The species with the largest range is E. relata, although Bond and Godwin assert the species is actually composed of multiple as-yet-unnamed cryptic species (distinct species erroneously grouped into <b>one)</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> require additional morphological or genetic research to distinguish.|$|E
5|$|The media baron Elliot Carver soon {{begins his}} plans to use a stolen encoder {{obtained}} at the bazaar by his henchman, cyberterrorist Henry Gupta, to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom; he hopes to replace the Chinese government with <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> give him exclusive broadcasting rights. Meaconing the GPS signal using the encoder, Gupta sends the British frigate HMS Devonshire off-course into Chinese-held waters in the South China Sea, where Carver's stealth ship, commanded by Mr. Stamper, sinks it and steals one of its missiles, while shooting down a Chinese J-7 fighter jet and killing off the Devonshires survivors with Chinese weaponry. The British Minister of Defence orders Roebuck to deploy the British Fleet to recover the frigate, and possibly retaliate, while leaving M only 48 hours to investigate its sinking and avert a war.|$|E

5|$|The subpoenas are {{handed out}} in the hearing over Bartlet's {{concealment}} of his multiple sclerosis. The special prosecutor, Clement Rollins (Pryor), appears to be both fair and responsible, but C.J. believes the White House will be better served {{in the public eye}} if investigated by a partisan agent. She therefore decides—against the strong objections of White House counsel Oliver Babish—to present Rollins as an ally of the administration, thereby forcing Congress to take control over the investigation. Meanwhile Donna, unwittingly, becomes entangled in potential problems over the hearings. Ainsley Hayes sets her up on a date with the Republican House Government Oversight Committee counsel Clifford Calley, but even though the date seems to go well, Calley then leaves her quite abruptly {{in the middle of the}} street. Donna later realizes the reason: his congressional committee is the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> be in charge of the investigation, and a relationship between the two could constitute a conflict of interest.|$|E

With such knowledge, it is said that they have created a protective market, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> thrive if the ethnic composition of the neighborhood does not change.|$|E

The mission has been allotted 5,650 military personnel, 120 civilian police and about 1,000 international and local civilian personnel. The mission has been functioning well.

25|$|Measuring the {{percentage}} of applicants who were denied coverage does not capture any effect that occurs before an application is submitted. If individuals with serious health conditions never apply because they expect {{that they will be}} denied coverage, they will not show up in the declination rate. Conversely, if they apply with multiple insurers in hopes of finding <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> issue them a policy, they will be overrepresented in the declination rate. The 2001 Commonwealth Fund study found that a majority of adults reported that it was at least somewhat difficult to find an affordable health insurance policy. Among adults over 30, {{the percentage}} reporting difficulty did not vary significantly by age. Those with health problems were somewhat more likely to report having difficulty obtaining affordable health insurance (77% versus 64% of those in good health).|$|E

Reiner also commented positively on the soundtrack and that the game {{may not be the best}} wrestling game available, [...] "but it delivers what the cover advertises". GameSpot's Frank Provo said that [...] "wit" [...] and [...] "charm" [...] are the two most redeeming features of The Simpsons Wrestling, and in spite of the game's weak gameplay, it has [...] "plenty of laughs in store" [...] that devoted fans of The Simpsons will enjoy.

Tonally, Smith described the miniseries as possessing [...] "the feel of an old-school post-apocalyptic SF sagaa journey through a devastated-but-wondrous world, {{with a sense of}} danger and mystery detached from the Land of Ooo." [...] Smith's only complaint was that [...] "there's enough rich emotional material once the voyagers reach their destination that it feels like more time could be spent there". Matthew Jacobson of The Spectrum wrote that [...] "the story is masterful and imaginative" [...] and that [...] "if Islands is a litmus test, then the final season should be one heck of an adventure." ...|$|E
