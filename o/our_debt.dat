25|$|In August former Mudvayne bassist Shawn Barclay {{released}} his band Sprung's debut album, mastered by King's X guitarist Ty Tabor. That month rumors spread that Bullygoat Records would release We Pay <b>Our</b> <b>Debt</b> Sometimes: A Tribute to Alice In Chains, with performances by Mudvayne, Cold, Audioslave, Breaking Benjamin, Static-X and the surviving members of Alice in Chains. A spokesperson for Alice in Chains {{told the press}} that the band was unaware of any tribute album, and Mudvayne's manager said that reports of the album were only rumors.|$|E
25|$|When I {{returned}} to IP in 1962 {{as president and}} editor-in-chief the house faced bankruptcy. Its publishing program had practically ceased, its debt to the publishers' services was so great without any prospect of payment in sight that the printers refused to undertake new work and the binders refused to release our books in stock. Fortunately, Trachty had some reserve funds that I drew upon immediately. I also arranged small loans {{from a number of}} our devoted readers. I also sent out an unprecedented appeal for donations to keep the publishing house going. We were thus able to meet the payroll and office expenses, and also to pay off enough of <b>our</b> <b>debt</b> to resume publishing.|$|E

500|$|Historian Gilbert Chinard {{wrote in}} 1936: “Lafayette became a legendary figure and a symbol {{so early in}} his life, and {{successive}} generations have so willingly accepted the myth, that any attempt to deprive the young hero of his republican halo will probably be considered as little short of iconoclastic and sacrilegious.” That legend has been used politically: the name and image of Lafayette were repeatedly invoked in 1917 in seeking to gain popular support for America's entry into World WarI, culminating in the famous phrase, [...] "Lafayette, we are here". This occurred at some cost to Lafayette's image in America: veterans returned from the front singing [...] "We've paid <b>our</b> <b>debt</b> to Lafayette, who the hell do we owe now?" [...] A longer-term threat was the increasing sophistication of Americans and the lessened need for symbols of patriotism; by 1971, according to Anne C. Loveland, [...] "Lafayette no longer served as a national hero-symbol." [...] In 2002, however, Congress voted to grant Lafayette honorary citizenship.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 October 2016, 778 of the exhumed {{victims were}} {{transferred}} to the Dobrava cemetery near Maribor. The commemoration was attended by the Croatian leadership, including Prime Minister Andrej Plenković, President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović and Speaker Božo Petrov, Church dignitaries, and Slovenian President Borut Pahor. At a Croatian government session on the same day, Plenković said that [...] "the burial of victims of post-war communist terror in Huda Jama reminds us of <b>our</b> <b>debt</b> {{to the victims of}} totalitarianism".|$|E
2500|$|In Altneuland, Herzl {{outlined}} {{his vision}} for a new Jewish state in the Land of Israel. [...] He summed up his vision of an open society:"It is founded on the ideas which are a common product of all civilized nations ... It would be immoral if we would exclude anyone, whatever his origin, his descent, or his religion, from participating in our achievements. For we stand {{on the shoulders of}} other civilized peoples ... What we own we owe to the preparatory work of other peoples. Therefore, we have to repay <b>our</b> <b>debt.</b> There is only one way to do it, the highest tolerance. Our motto must therefore be, now and ever: 'Man, you are my brother.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|This is {{a concept}} similar to Anselm's that we owe a debt of honor to God, with a {{critical}} difference: While Anselm said we could never pay this because any good we could do was owed to God anyway, Aquinas says {{that in addition to}} our due of obedience we can make up for <b>our</b> <b>debt</b> through acts of penance [...] "man owes God all that he is able to give him...over and above which he can offer something by way of satisfaction". Unlike Anselm, Aquinas claims that we can make satisfaction for our own sin, and that our problem is not our personal sin, but original sin. [...] "Original sin...is an infection of human nature itself, so that, unlike actual sin, it could not be expiated by the satisfaction of a mere man." [...] Thus Christ, as the [...] "second Adam," [...] does penance in our place – paying the debt of our original sin. Why does he do that? By love. The whole of the work of redemption begins with God’s love: “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son” (Jn 3:16).|$|E
2500|$|The classic Anselmian {{formulation}} of the satisfaction view should be distinguished from penal substitution. Both are forms of satisfaction theory in that they speak of how Christ's death was satisfactory, but penal substitution and Anselmian satisfaction offer different understandings of how Christ's death was satisfactory. Anselm speaks of human sin as defrauding God of the honour he is due. Christ's death, the ultimate act of obedience, brings God great honour. As it was {{beyond the call of}} duty for Christ, it is more honour than he was obliged to give. Christ's surplus can therefore repay our deficit. Hence Christ's death is substitutionary; he pays the honour to the Father instead of us paying. Penal substitution differs in that it sees Christ's death not as repaying God for lost honour but rather paying the penalty of death that had always been the moral consequence for sin (e.g., [...] ). The key difference here is that for Anselm, satisfaction is an alternative to punishment, [...] "The honor taken away must be repaid, or punishment must follow." [...] By Christ satisfying <b>our</b> <b>debt</b> of honor to God, we avoid punishment. In Calvinist Penal Substitution, it is the punishment which satisfies the demands of justice.|$|E
