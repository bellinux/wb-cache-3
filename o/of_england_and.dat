5|$|Despite Hollies {{being able}} to trouble most of their batsmen, Australia {{completed}} the Test series with a convincing innings victory in the Fifth Test to complete a 4–0 result. The Fifth Test was the last international match, and Australia only had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil Bradman's aim of going through the tour undefeated. They secured three consecutive innings victories against Kent, the Gentlemen <b>of</b> <b>England</b> <b>and</b> Somerset. They proceeded to take first innings leads of more than 200 against the South <b>of</b> <b>England</b> <b>and</b> Leveson-Gower's XI, but both matches were washed out. The last two matches were two-day non-first-class matches against Scotland, both won by an innings. Bradman's men thus completed the tour undefeated, earning themselves the sobriquet The Invincibles.|$|E
