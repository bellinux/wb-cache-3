I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, 'Whatever you did for the least <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brothers...</b> you did it to me.' ...|$|E
500|$|According to Haggard's {{daughter}} Lilias, {{the phrase}} [...] "She-who-must-be-obeyed" [...] originated {{from his childhood}} and [...] "the particularly hideous aspect" [...] of one rag-doll: [...] "This doll {{was something of a}} fetish, and Rider, as a small child, was terrified of her, a fact soon discovered by an unscrupulous nurse who made full use of it to frighten him into obedience. Why or how it came to be called She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed he could not remember". Haggard wrote that [...] "the title She" [...] was taken [...] "from a certain rag doll, so named, which a nurse at Bradenham used to bring out of some dark recess in order to terrify those <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brothers</b> and sisters who were in her charge." ...|$|E
500|$|I am very {{grateful}} that my show was so well received {{all over the}} world. But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing. My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, [...] "Whatever you did for the least <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brothers...</b> you did it to me.' Please do not pass judgement without seeing my show.|$|E

Judge Hoffman became the favorite courtroom target of the Chicago Seven defendants, who frequently would insult the judge to his face. Abbie Hoffman told Judge Hoffman [...] "you are a 'shande fur de Goyim' [...] You would have served Hitler better." [...] He later added that [...] "your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room." [...] Both Davis and Rubin told the Judge [...] "this court is bullshit." [...] When Hoffman was asked in what state he resided, he replied the [...] "state of mind <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brothers</b> and sisters".|$|E
