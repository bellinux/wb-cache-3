5|$|At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the battle, {{the flag}} Moultrie had {{designed}} and raised over the fort was shot down. Sergeant William Jasper reportedly {{ran to the}} battlement and raised the flag again, holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided. He was credited by Moultrie with reviving the troops' spirits, and later given commendations for bravery. A painting of this event (pictured above) depicts Jasper's actions.|$|E
5|$|Following the match, {{the referee}} {{admitted}} that at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> {{the game the}} ball had passed the Blackburn goal line, but as Queen's Park {{did not attempt to}} claim the goal, it was not awarded. Queen's Park would ultimately become the only Scottish club to reach the final of the FA Cup, although they returned the following year where they again faced Blackburn Rovers.|$|E
5|$|The {{video of}} the {{performance}} was recorded using six cameras. At brief times during the performance, the video recorded a moment of white on camera or a dark screen, {{both of which were}} related to the use of strobe lights.

5|$|Contenders seeking {{designation}} {{as the new}} Capitol included Ann Arbor, Jackson, Grand Rapids, and Shiawassee Township in Shiawassee County. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the debate, Marshall {{officials were}} so certain of its selection that they built a governor's mansion. After extensive debate, State Senator Joseph H. Kilbourne of Ingham County proposed that the nearly uninhabited Lansing Township be made the seat of government. The legislature agreed, with the location north of Ann Arbor, west of Detroit, and east of Grand Rapids being deemed a suitable compromise. The legislature renamed it as the Town of Michigan, though by 1848 the original name of Lansing was restored.|$|E
5|$|During the 1927–28 season, Morenz {{became the}} first player in NHL history to score 50points in a single season. Morenz was the first NHL player to score a second Stanley Cup winning goal, with the Canadiens' victory in the 1930 Stanley Cup Finals over the Boston Bruins. The Bruins, who {{finished}} with a 38–5–1 record and at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the season went 23 games without a defeat, lost consecutive games to Montreal in the finals, 3–0 and 4–3. The Canadiens became the fourth team in Stanley Cup history to repeat as champions, defeating the Chicago Black Hawks in five games to capture the 1931 Stanley Cup Championship.|$|E

5|$|The 156th Fighter Air Corps of the 4th Air Army was {{the next}} unit to receive the La-7 in October 1944. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the month, they had {{fourteen}} aircraft simultaneously unserviceable with engine failures. By 1 January 1945 there were 398 La-7s in front-line service of which 107 were unserviceable. By 9 May 1945 this had increased to 967 aircraft, of which only 169 were unserviceable. For the invasion of Japanese Manchuria, 313 La-7s were assigned and only 28 of these were unserviceable on 9 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Astros {{promoted}} Robertson in 1998 to the class-A advanced affiliate Kissimmee Cobras of the Florida State League. In 28 {{games with}} the Cobras, Robertson pitched 175 total innings. He also had a 10–10 record, a 3.71 ERA, and 131 strikeouts. He was again promoted the following year to the Jackson Generals of the Texas League. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the season, he went six weeks without earning a victory. He rebounded from the drought and finished {{the season with a}} 15–7 record and a 3.06 ERA; his 15 wins led all pitchers in the league. After the season ended, the Houston Astros purchased his contract, effectively placing him on the 40-man roster.|$|E
5|$|The Dangerous Alliance was a {{dominant}} force in WCW. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> 1992, they held every title except the WCW World Title, {{which was held}} by their main opponent and arch enemy Sting. The war between the Dangerous Alliance and Sting and friends escalated until {{it was decided to}} settle it in a double ring War Games Match at WrestleWar 1992. Sting's team won when Sting forced Eaton to give up after Larry Zbyszko accidentally struck Eaton in the arm with a metal rod. This match would be given a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter.|$|E

30|$|Our study suffers some limitations. First, DIC {{cannot be}} defined by a {{specific}} score in a rat septic shock model. Even in clinical practice, DIC diagnosis is difficult using the available scores {{and there is no}} real gold standard yet [14]. Then, most of the parameters have been evaluated at <b>one</b> time <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the study, as rat volemia would not allow us iterative blood samplings.|$|R
5|$|The film {{attracted}} {{attention for}} {{the appearance of}} Orson Welles as Will Varner, the patriarch of the family. 20th Century Fox wanted to avoid the casting of Welles due to his temperament, but the studio was persuaded by Ritt, who considered him the right actor for the role. The director and the actor had several marked differences during the shooting of the movie, which included problems with {{the interpretation of the}} lines, costume design and the position of Welles while shooting the scenes. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the production, Welles informed Ritt {{that he did not want}} to memorize his lines, requesting instead that they be dubbed afterwards. Part of the cast was intimidated by Welles' temperamental attitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, shortened {{due to the}} 1994–95 labour dispute, {{he continued}} to split playing time between the NHL and IHL. In 14games with Pittsburgh, he scored two goals and four points, while recording seven points in seven games with Cleveland. He did {{not appear in the}} NHL playoffs for a second straight season, despite the Penguins qualifying. Instead, he was assigned to Cleveland for their playoff season, in which he recorded four points in four games.

5|$|The video {{features}} Beyoncé {{and her two}} companions dancing {{inside an}} infinity cove, which alternates {{between black and white}} and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.|$|E
25|$|O'Neal {{only made}} <b>one</b> three <b>point</b> shot <b>during</b> his entire career. He made the shot during the 1995–96 NBA {{season with the}} Orlando Magic. His career three point shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage).|$|R

5|$|While the Victor {{was never}} {{permanently}} based with any units stationed overseas, temporary deployments were frequently conducted, {{often in a}} ceremonial capacity or to participate in training exercises and competitions. Victor squadrons were dispatched on several extended deployments to the Far East, and short term deployments to Canada were also conducted for training purposes. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the early 1960s, South Africa showed considerable interest in the acquisition of several bomber-configured Victors; in the end, the Victor would not serve with any other operator other than the RAF.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Alvin Kass {{served as}} Rabbi from 1976-2014. Kass {{has also been}} a New York City Police Department {{chaplain}} for over 40 years, and had previously served as a United States Air Force chaplain for two years. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> his service as Police Department chaplain he and his family received months of 24-hour security after death threats, and at another he defused a hostage situation by providing the hostage taker with sandwiches from the Carnegie Deli. Kass, who teaches ethics at the Police Academy, was instrumental in getting Jewish police officers time off to observe the Sabbath. He also convinced the NYPD Shomrim Society (the fraternal organization of Jewish members of the New York City Police Department) to admit David Durk. Durk, along with the more famous Frank Serpico, had been the source of the allegations of police corruption that {{led to the formation of}} the Knapp Commission. In 2014, Rabbi Kass retired from the position of Rabbi at East Midwood Jewish Center and currently serves as Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{after the}} end of the war, Justice participated in the French naval {{intervention}} in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea, and was based in Sevastopol. On 19 April, a mutiny gripped the French fleet, starting on the battleship France, the squadron flagship. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the mutiny, the crew of Justice briefly flew the red flag, though they remained relatively calm. The situation worsened after a group of Greek soldiers fired into a crowd of demonstrators ashore; one French sailor was killed and another five were injured. Justices crew was enraged, and began discussing opening fire on the Greek battleship Kilkis, moored nearby. Justices captain ordered his ship's guns disabled by removing their breech blocks to prevent an attack. The situation was eventually defused by returning the French squadron back to France, one of the mutineers' primary demands. Ultimately, Justice was stricken from the naval register in 1922 and sold for scrap.|$|E
50|$|A mid table {{position}} of 11th {{was all that}} Stoke could have expected from an inconsistent season with 16 wins and 17 defeats. <b>One</b> key <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the season was manager Bob McGrory's decision to employ Frank Bowyer as an out-and-out centre forward and he scored 21 goals. Surprisingly, when the campaign ended Bowyer asked for a transfer which was accepted but he soon {{had a change of}} heart and would remain at the club until 1960.|$|R
40|$|Why was the Japanese {{consumer}} price index for rents so stable even {{during the period of}} housing bubble in the 1980 s? In addressing this question, we start from the analysis of microeconomic rigidity and then investigate its implications about aggregate price dynamics. We find that ninety percent of the units in our dataset had no change in rents per year, indicating that rent stickiness is three times as high as in the US. We also find that the probability of rent adjustment depends little on the deviation of the actual rent from its target level, suggesting that rent adjustments are not state dependent but time dependent. These two results indicate that both intensive and extensive margins of rent adjustments are very small, thus yielding a slow reponse of the CPI to aggregate shocks. We show that the CPI inflation rate would have been higher by <b>one</b> percentage <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the bubble period, and lower by more than <b>one</b> percentage <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the period of bubble bursting, if the Japanese housing rents were as flexible as in the US.

5|$|Promoted to {{sergeant}} on 28 July, Derrick led a six-man reconnaissance on 3 October, successfully pinpointing several German {{machine gun}} positions and strongholds; {{this information was}} to be vital for the upcoming Second Battle of El Alamein. The El Alamein offensive was launched on 23 October, with the 9th Australian Division taking part. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the engagement, Derrick jumped up onto an Allied gun carrier heading towards the Germans. Armed with a Thompson submachine gun and under intense heavy fire, Derrick attacked and knocked out three machine gun posts while standing in the carrier. He then had the driver reverse up to each post so he could ensure each position was silenced. By the following morning, Derrick's platoon occupied all three posts. The members of the 2/48th Battalion who witnessed Derrick's action were sure he would be awarded the Victoria Cross, though no recommendation was made.|$|E
5|$|Pundits {{and fans}} who opposed Kansas' {{selection}} {{pointed to the}} Jayhawks' strength of schedule, which at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the season was as low as 109th out of 119Division I teams. By {{the time of the}} BCS selection, however, Kansas's strength of schedule had climbed by a small amount, reaching 88th in the Sagarin rankings and 74th in the CBS rankings. The final rankings rated Kansas' schedule as more difficult than Hawaii, which was also selected to play in the BCS. Aggravating the situation was the fact that Kansas and Missouri had one of the most intense rivalries in college football. Known as the Border War, the roots of the rivalry dated to the years before the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The 1855 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured tropical cyclone landfalls in the Gulf Coast of the United States, the Greater Antilles, and Mexico, but none along the East Coast of the United States. It was inactive, with only five known tropical cyclones. Operationally, another tropical storm {{was believed to}} have existed offshore Atlantic Canada in late August and early September, but HURDAT – the official Atlantic hurricane database – now excludes this system. The first system, Hurricane One, was initially observed on August 6. The final storm, Hurricane Five, was last observed on September 17. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the season, two tropical cyclones existed simultaneously. Two of the cyclones only have a single known point in their tracks due to a sparsity of data, so storm summaries for those systems are unavailable.|$|E
2500|$|The 7- and 8-point {{systems are}} favored, because a tie game {{can result in}} each team getting <b>one</b> <b>point.</b> (In a 4-point system, half-points would be {{required}} for ties.) Throughout {{the course of a}} season, each team will usually face all of the other teams in scheduled competition. [...] "Position Rounds", where 1st place bowls against 2nd place, 3rd place bowls against 4th place, and so on, are often added at <b>one</b> or more <b>points</b> <b>during</b> the season.|$|R
50|$|The {{offensive}} {{team has}} the scoring advantage because {{of service and}} court points. However, either team {{has the opportunity to}} score from <b>one</b> to three <b>points</b> <b>during</b> any <b>one</b> play; under certain conditions, the defensive team can score <b>one</b> <b>point</b> plays, the server can score different types of two point plays, the goalies of either team can score two points, any player from either team can score a three-point goal, and there are different ways to win a set of play.|$|R
