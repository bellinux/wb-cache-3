6000|$|And {{why should}} I not {{investigate}} it? I see that under yesterday's date I said: [...] "If I could see something positive and <b>objective,</b> <b>I</b> {{might be tempted}} to approach it from the physiological aspect." [...] Well, I have got my test. I shall be as good as my word. The investigation would, I am sure, be of immense interest. Some of my colleagues might look askance at it, for science is full of unreasoning prejudices, but if Wilson has the courage of his convictions, I can afford to have it also. I shall go to him to-morrow morning--to him and to Miss Penclosa. If she can show us so much, it is probable that she can show us more.|$|E
60|$|What {{a fellow}} Wilson is! If I could only throw the same enthusiasm into {{physiology}} {{that he does}} into psychology, I should become a Claude Bernard at the least. His whole life and soul and energy work to one end. He drops to sleep collating his results of the past day, and he wakes to plan his researches for the coming one. And yet, outside the narrow circle who follow his proceedings, he gets so little credit for it. Physiology is a recognized science. If I add even a brick to the edifice, every one sees and applauds it. But Wilson is trying to dig the foundations for a science of the future. His work is underground and does not show. Yet he goes on uncomplainingly, corresponding with a hundred semi-maniacs {{in the hope of}} finding one reliable witness, sifting a hundred lies on the chance of gaining one little speck of truth, collating old books, devouring new ones, experimenting, lecturing, trying to light up in others the fiery interest which is consuming him. I am filled with wonder and admiration when I think of him, and yet, when he asks me to associate myself with his researches, I am compelled to tell him that, in their present state, they offer little attraction to a man who is devoted to exact science. If he could show me something positive and <b>objective,</b> <b>I</b> might then be tempted to approach the question from its physiological side. So long as half his subjects are tainted with charlatanerie and the other half with hysteria we physiologists must content ourselves with the body and leave the mind to our descendants.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} to Tehelka, Varma talked {{about his relationship with}} his parents and the reasons behind his decision to become a filmmaker. From my parents' perspective, I looked like a useless bum. It was the truth. I had no <b>objective.</b> <b>I</b> was just fascinated by people, so I used to study their behaviour. I was most fascinated by the bullies in my classroom. They were like gangsters for me. They had the guts to push around people, do things I couldn't— perhaps did not even want to do myself. But I'd want a friend like that (laughs). I used to adulate them like heroes. That was my first touch with anti-socialism. Over a period of time, I developed a low-angle fascination for larger than life people. I was always a loner - not because I was unhappy, but because I live away from myself, not just others. I like to study myself - the way I am walking, talking, behaving. My constant obsession with studying myself and other people is perhaps the primary motivation for me to be a filmmaker.|$|E
