40|$|Safety {{analysis}} of the roads through the accident rates {{which is one of}} the widely used tools has been resulted from the direct <b>exposure</b> <b>method</b> which is based on the ratio of the vehicle-kilometers traveled and vehicle-travel time. However, due to some fundamental flaws in its theories and difficulties in gaining access to the data required such as traffic volume, distance and duration of the trip, and various problems in determining the exposure in a specific time, place, and individual categories, there is a need for an algorithm for prioritizing the road safety so that with a new <b>exposure</b> <b>method,</b> the problems of the previous approaches would be resolved. In this way, an efficient application may lead to have more realistic comparisons and the new method would be applicable to a wider range of time, place, and individual categories. Therefore, an algorithm was introduced to prioritize the safety of roads using the quasi-induced <b>exposure</b> <b>method</b> and utilizing the analytical hierarchy process. For this research, 11 provinces of Iran were chosen as case study locations. A rural accidents database was created for these provinces, the validity of quasi-induced <b>exposure</b> <b>method</b> for Iran’s accidents database was explored, and the involvement ratio for different characteristics of the drivers and the vehicles was measured. Results showed that the quasi-induced <b>exposure</b> <b>method</b> was valid in determining the real exposure in the provinces under study. Results also showed a significant difference in the prioritization based on the new and traditional approaches. This difference mostly would stem from the perspective of the quasi-induced <b>exposure</b> <b>method</b> in determining the exposure, opinion of experts, and the quantity of accidents data. Overall, the results for this research showed that prioritization based on the new approach is more comprehensive and reliable compared to the prioritization in the traditional approach which is dependent on various parameters including the driver-vehicle characteristics...|$|R

International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether a refined assessment {{of exposure to}} bitumen fume among workers in the European asphalt industry within a nested case-control study resulted in a different interpretation pertaining to risk of lung cancer mortality compared with the cohort study. METHODS: Pearson correlation coefficients between refined and original estimates were calculated. Logistic regression and generalised additive models (penalised splines) were fitted to estimate ORs for exposure to bitumen fume using the refined and <b>original</b> <b>exposure</b> estimates, respectively, while adjusting for potential confounding. RESULTS: 1555 subjects included in the nested case-control study had both refined and <b>original</b> estimates for <b>exposure</b> to bitumen fume. Exposure assessment in the nested case-control study (compared with the cohort phase) {{increased the number of}} subjects never-exposed to bitumen fume from 18 % to 32 %. From the 1282 subjects originally considered exposed in the cohort phase, 309 (24 %) became unexposed after the nested case-control exposure assessment. From the 273 subjects originally considered non-exposed in the cohort phase, 87 (32 %) became exposed in the nested case-control study. The majority (75 %) of subjects however did not change exposure status and changes were similar among cases and controls. Correlation coefficients between refined and <b>original</b> <b>exposure</b> estimates were moderate overall (range 0. 42 - 0. 46), but varied considerably among countries. The ORs and exposure-response curves for exposure to bitumen fume were not meaningfully different between analyses that used refined and <b>original</b> <b>exposure</b> estimates. Adjustment for tobacco smoking and exposure to coal tar did not change these patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that more detailed data collection and exposure assessment in the nested case-control study compared with the cohort study did change exposure status of many subjects, but did not alter results of the exposure-response analysis.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: One of {{the most}} widely used in vitro {{particulate}} matter (PM) <b>exposures</b> <b>methods</b> is the collection of PM on filters, followed by resuspension in a liquid medium, with subsequent addition onto a cell culture. To avoid disruption of equilibria between gases and PM, we have developed a direct in vitro sampling and <b>exposure</b> <b>method</b> (DSEM) capable of PM-only exposures. We hypothesize that the separation of phases and post-treatment of filter-collected PM significantly modifies the toxicity of the PM compared to direct deposition, resulting in a distorted view of the potential PM health effects. Controlled test environments were created in a chamber that combined diesel exhaust with an urban-like mixture. The complex mixture was analyzed using both the DSEM and concurrently collected filter samples. The DSEM showed that PM from test atmospheres produced significant inflammatory response, while the resuspension exposures at the same exposure concentration did not...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the concordance of irritancy rank order of 4 anionic detergents tested by 3 different <b>exposure</b> <b>methods,</b> namely one-time occlusive. repeated short-time occlusive and repeated short-time open tests. These detergents were sodium cocoyl isethionate (ISE), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), soap and disodium lauryl 3 -ethoxysulfosuccinate (SUC). The reactions were evaluated by visual scoring and by transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement. When scored visually, the rank order in the one-time test was: SOAP greater than or equal to SLS greater than or equal to ISE >SUC. The other test methods yielded a different order: SLS >ISE greater than or equal to SOAP >SUC. A similar rank order was obtained with TEWL measurement for all <b>exposure</b> <b>methods.</b> Generally, the concordance among the different <b>exposure</b> <b>methods</b> was high when evaluated by TEWL. The concordance was lower when evaluation was performed by visual scoring. The present study demonstrates that the choice of exposure model and evaluation method may be important variables influencing the outcome of irritancy testing. It is proposed that the repeated open test is the best way to simulate most in-use situations when the uncovered skin is exposed to detergents. The repeated occlusive test or the one-time patch test may be better to simulate situations in which the skin is occluded after irritation by detergents...|$|R

Not only cell viability could be assessed but also sub lethal biological endpoints such as DNA damage and interleukin expressions. An advantage of the HD exposure system is that bioavailability and cell concentrations can be derived from published physicochemical properties using a four compartment mass balance model.

40|$|Concerns for {{the toxic}} effects of {{airborne}} nanoparticles {{have been raised}} along with the increasing production of nanostructured materials. However, the health risks of nanoparticle exposure are currently not fully understood. The most commonly used techniques to study nanoparticle toxicity, both in vivo and in vitro, have several limitations. These include for example challenges regarding dosimetry {{or the lack of}} similarity of overall exposure conditions and the physico-chemical particle characteristics. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} more advanced methods to study the pulmonary toxicity of airborne nanoparticles. This thesis presents the use of air-liquid interface (ALI) systems as a possible approach to this challenge. While utilizing the direct deposition of airborne nanoparticles on lung cell cultures, the ALI approach can more realistically mimic the characteristics of the human respiratory tract and the interactions of airborne particles with lung cells. This allows for a better understanding of the health risks posed by inhalation exposure to nanoparticles. Two different ALI systems were investigated and their use was compared to submerged <b>exposure</b> <b>methods.</b> One of the ALI exposure systems utilizes electrostatic force in order to make the deposition of charged airborne nanoparticles more efficient, while the other system operates by the diffusion of airborne nanoparticles. ALI and submerged <b>exposure</b> <b>methods</b> were used for investigating the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of Ni-containing nanoparticles as well as the cytotoxicity and inflammatory potential of CeO 2 -nanoparticles. While Ag-nanoparticles were used as a test material during the development of the electrostatic ALI system, their cytotoxicity was investigated in ALI exposure. In conclusion, the ALI <b>exposure</b> <b>methods</b> provide more realistic conditions and make the particle dosimetry more controllable.

40|$|Background: Recently, much {{progress}} has been made to develop more physiologic in vitro models of the respiratory system and improve in vitro simulation of particle exposure through inhalation. Nevertheless, the field of nanotoxicology still suffers from a lack of relevant in vitro models and <b>exposure</b> <b>methods</b> to predict accurately the effects observed in vivo, especially after respiratory exposure. In this context, the aim of our study was to evaluate if exposing pulmonary cells at the air-liquid interface to aerosols of inhalable and poorly soluble nanomaterials generates different toxicity patterns and/or biological activation levels compared to classic submerged exposures to suspensions. Three nano-TiO 2 and one nano-CeO 2 were used. An exposure system was set up using VitroCell® devices to expose pulmonary cells at the air-liquid interface to aerosols. A 549 alveolar cells in monocultures or in co-cultures with THP- 1 macrophages were exposed to aerosols in inserts or to suspensions in inserts and in plates. Submerged exposures in inserts were performed, using similar culture conditions and exposure kinetics to the air-liquid interface, to provide accurate comparisons between the <b>methods.</b> <b>Exposure</b> in plates using classical culture and exposure conditions was performed to provide comparable results with classical submerged exposure studies. The biological activity of the cells (inflammation, cell viability, oxidative stress) was assessed at 24 h and comparisons of the nanomaterial toxicities between <b>exposure</b> <b>methods</b> were performed. Results: Deposited doses of nanomaterials achieved using our aerosol exposure system were sufficient to observe adverse effects. Co-cultures were more sensitive than monocultures and biological responses were usually observed at lower doses at the air-liquid interface than in submerged conditions. Nevertheless, the general ranking of the nanomaterials according to their toxicity was similar across the different <b>exposure</b> <b>methods</b> used. Conclusions: We showed that exposure of cells at the air-liquid interface represents a valid and sensitive method to assess the toxicity of several poorly soluble nanomaterials. We underlined the importance of the cellular model used and offer the possibility to deal with low deposition doses by using more sensitive and physiologic cellular models.
