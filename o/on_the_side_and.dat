5|$|CSF pressure, as {{measured}} by lumbar puncture, is 10–18 cmH2O (8–15 mmHg or 1.1–2 kPa) with the patient lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> 20–30 cmH2O (16–24 mmHg or 2.1–3.2 kPa) with the patient sitting up. In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3mmHg or 0.78–0.98kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture {{is similar to the}} intracranial pressure.|$|E
5|$|Early in Ahmedabad's history, under Ahmed Shah, {{builders}} fused Hindu craftsmanship with Persian architecture, {{giving rise}} to the Indo-Saracenic style.

It is entirely arched and has ten stone latticework windows or jali <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> rear arches. Private mansions or haveli from this era have carvings. A Pol is a typical housing cluster of Old Ahmedabad.|$|E
5|$|Males {{engage in}} mate {{guarding}} {{during the period}} females are most vulnerable to successful extra pair copulations. They usually stay close to their social mate, singing slowly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> following the mate while she is foraging or searching for a nesting site. The guarding behavior, though, may conflict with males’ pursuit of extra-pair fertilizations. It {{is not yet clear}} to what extent a male will prefer mate guarding over extra-pair fertilizations. Male retention studies have shown that removal of a male increases the chance of extra-pair offspring in the brood, suggesting that mate guarding reduces extra-pair fertilization attempts. The extra-pair fertilization rate nonetheless cannot be eliminated even if males are allowed to stay near their social mates during fertility risk period. Several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon: females may be able to manage extra-pair mating even while its social mate is guarding it, or females may reject extra-pair copulation attempts by other males in the absence of male guarding.|$|E

5|$|Nests {{built in}} the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant {{material}}s. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, the hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass {{with a cup of}} soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are simply given a soft lining. The nest entrance is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.|$|E

Garcia Moreno, therefore set into effect laws which enforced rigid monastic and clerical discipline.

25|$|Following {{the work}} of John Hughlings Jackson (1835–1911) and David Ferrier (1843–1924) on {{neurological}} mapping of functions in the brain, Macewen demonstrated in 1876 {{that it was possible}} to use a precise clinical examination to determine the possible site of a tumor or lesion in the brain, by observing its effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> extension of alterations in motor and sensory functions. Thus, in 1876 he diagnosed an abscess in the frontal lobe of a boy, but the family refused permission to operate. When the patient died his diagnosis and localisation were found to be correct.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{introduced}} on the EM/ET class sets, {{several of}} the DM/D sets refurbished for the Johnsonville Branch were later repainted in this livery during the late 1980s. The car body was repainted in olive green with a grey roof and black underfloor equipment and running gear. A white band surrounded the windows {{on the sides of}} the car, ending between the first passenger window and the driver's cab window. The doors and ends were painted yellow with white block numbers and classification letters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> black numbers on the '1' and '2' ends of the train. The cab windows and headlight mounting were painted with a black surround.|$|E
25|$|With the {{delivery}} of the Class SS starting 1914, the older Class S trains became less popular due to their limit size and comfort. However, they were still technically suited for service. Nos. 48, 49 and 66 were converted to trailers in 1916, being renumbered 247–249. By 1918 the class was removed from regular service. That year no. 57 collided and KSS decided to rebuild it. The body was removed and the undercarriage and motors were used to construct a snowplow unit. The plow itself came out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> could be maneuvered from within. This allowed it to plow the tracks and the section from the tracks to the sidewalk. It remained in operation until 1950.|$|E
