25|$|Trotskyism must {{be rooted}} {{out of the}} proletarian ranks <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Party</b> as one roots out {{poisonous}} weeds. The Trotskyists must be rooted out and disposed of like wild beasts, for otherwise every time our men wish {{to go on the}} offensive {{we will not be able}} to do so due to lawlessness caused by the Trotskyists in the rear. An end must be put to these traitors once and for all so that our men on the front lines can fight without fear of being stabbed in the back.|$|E
500|$|At the 5th National Congress, Lê Duẩn reaffirmed Vietnam's {{relations}} with the USSR. He stated, [...] "Solidarity and co-operation with the USSR: such is the corner stone of the external policy <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Party</b> and of our State." [...] He further noted that their alliance was [...] "a guarantee of {{the victory of the}} defense of the motherland and the socialist edification of our people." [...] Soviet official Mikhail Gorbachev echoed Lê Duẩn's sentiments and said [...] "Vietnam can count on the solidarity and the support of the USSR." ...|$|E

500|$|The Chinese {{government}} subsequently repudiated the Cultural Revolution. A major document {{presented at}} the September 1979 Fourth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee, gave a [...] "preliminary assessment" [...] of the entire 30-year period of Communist rule. At the plenum, party Vice Chairman Ye Jianying declared the Cultural Revolution [...] "an appalling catastrophe" [...] and [...] "the most severe setback to [...] socialist cause since [...]" [...] The Chinese government's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Party</b> Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This stated that [...] "Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist. It is true that he made gross mistakes during the [...] "cultural revolution", but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary and his errors secondary." ...|$|E
500|$|During the June 1964 National Governors' Conference, 13 of 16 Republican {{governors}} present {{were opposed}} to Goldwater; their leaders were Jim Rhodes of Ohio, Nelson Rockefeller of New York (whose own campaign had just stalled out with a loss to Goldwater in the California primary), William Scranton of Pennsylvania, and Romney. [...] In an unusual Sunday press conference, Romney declared, [...] "If [...] views deviate as indicated from the heritage <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>party,</b> I will do everything within my power {{to keep him from}} becoming the party's presidential nominee." [...] Romney had, however, previously vowed to Michigan voters that he would not run for president in 1964. [...] Detroit newspapers indicated they would not support him in any such bid, and Romney quickly decided to honor his pledge {{to stay out of the}} contest. [...] Scranton entered instead, but Goldwater prevailed decisively at the 1964 Republican National Convention. [...] Romney's name was entered into nomination as a favorite son by U.S. Representative Gerald Ford of Michigan (who had not wanted to choose between candidates during the primary campaign) and he received the votes of 41delegates in the roll call (40 of Michigan's 48 and one from Kansas).|$|E
500|$|In October 1857, an {{expedition}} led by Edward Fitzgerald Beale was tasked with establishing a trade route along the 35th parallel from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Los Angeles, California. The wagon road began at Fort Smith and continued through Fort Defiance, Arizona before crossing the Colorado River near present-day Needles, California. The location where Beale crossed the river, {{en route to}} California, became known as Beale's Crossing. Beale described the route, [...] "It is the shortest from our western frontier by , being nearly directly west. It is the most level: our wagons only double-teaming once in the entire distance, and that at a short hill, and over a surface heretofore unbroken by wheels or trail on any kind. It is well-watered: our greatest distance without water at any time being [...] It is well-timbered, and in many places the growth is far beyond that of {{any part of the}} world I have ever seen. It is temperate in climate, passing for the most part over an elevated region. It is salubrious: not one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>party</b> requiring the slightest medical attendance from the time of our leaving to our arrival... It crosses the great desert (which must be crossed by any road to California) at its narrowest point." ...|$|E
60|$|After that {{we moved}} northwards in detachments, instead of keeping {{together}} {{as we should}} have done, {{with the result that}} several <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>parties</b> were fallen upon and murdered by the warriors <b>of</b> Moselikatse. <b>Our</b> line <b>of</b> march was between where Bloemfontein and Winburg now stand in the Orange Free State, and it was south of the Vaal, not far from the Rhenoster River that Moselikatse attacked us.|$|R
60|$|The enemy often {{appeared}} and alarmed us, and once fell on one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>parties,</b> and killed {{us about a}} hundred men; but we were too many for them to pretend to fight us, so we came to Bolton, beat the troops of the enemy near Warrington, where I got a cut with a halberd in my face, and arrived at Chester the beginning of August.|$|R

500|$|From November 325 Enver Hoxha {{headed the}} Albanian {{delegation}} which would present its {{case at the}} Second International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties together with Kapo, Alia, and others. [...] Alia later noted, [...] "The Soviets' aim was to ensure that Comrade Enver did not speak openly in Moscow, that, at the most, he should restrict himself to general criticisms on a theoretical plane... they brought all-sided pressure to bear on our delegation... even us the official reception for the celebration of November 7 against our delegation for these purposes." [...] On November 5 a 125-page letter was sent from the Central Committee of the CPSU to its Chinese counterpart ignoring the existence of Albania as a socialist country and [...] "malign the Party of Labour of Albania." [...] Later noting this letter in regards to China, Hoxha wrote that, [...] "They distributed this voluminous material against China before the meeting, in order to prepare the terrain and to brainwash the delegations of other parties, and to intimidate the Chinese, to compel them to take a moderate stand, if they would not submit. This anti-Chinese material did not surprise us, but it strengthened the conviction {{we had in the}} correctness of the line and the Marxist-Leninist stands <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Party</b> in defence of the Communist Party of China." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Declaration of Principles {{has brought}} to the surface divergences which are deep, antagonisms which make <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>party</b> not a {{coherent}} political organization working harmoniously for a common objective but a battle ground of internecine strife." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Comrades, I {{have gone}} {{through a number of}} splits in this party. It was not always a fight against anarchism in the past.

2500|$|To {{make sense}} of the mass chaos caused by Mao's {{leadership}} in the Cultural Revolution while preserving the Party's authority and legitimacy, Mao's successors needed to lend the event a [...] "proper" [...] historical judgment. On June 27, 1981, the Central Committee adopted the [...] "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Party</b> Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China," [...] an official assessment of major historical events since 1949.|$|E
2500|$|William Morris was {{disappointed}} by the slow growth of the organisation. After six months, the Socialist League only had eight branches and 230 members. Morris wrote to a friend: [...] "I am in low spirits about the prospects <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>party,</b> if I can dignify a little knot of men by such a word. You see we are such a few, and hard as we work we don't seem to pick up people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Naming the Russian nation the primus inter pares {{was a total}} turnabout from Stalin's {{declaration}} 20 {{years earlier}} (heralding the korenizatsiya policy) that [...] "the first immediate task <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Party</b> is vigorously to combat the survivals of Great-Russian chauvinism." [...] Although the official literature on nationalities and languages in subsequent years continued to speak of there being 130 equal languages in the USSR, in practice a hierarchy was endorsed in which some nationalities and languages were given special roles or viewed as having different long-term futures.|$|E
60|$|In general {{therefore}} I must {{note that}} the wisest Men I found in the Moon, when they understood the Notes I had made as above, of the sub-divisions <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Parties,</b> {{told me that it}} was the greatest Happiness that could ha' been obtained to our Country, for that if <b>our</b> <b>Parties</b> had not been thus divided, the Nation had been undone. They own'd that had not their Solunarian Party been divided among themselves, the Crolians had been undone, and all the Moon had been involv'd in Persecution, and been very probably subjected to the Gallunarian Monarch.|$|R

Soviet statisticians must proceed from these principal goals in their theoretical and practical work. ...|$|R

2500|$|Great-Russian chauvinist spirit, {{which is}} {{becoming}} stronger and stronger {{owing to the}} N.E.P., [...] [...] [...] [...] expression in an arrogantly disdainful and heartlessly bureaucratic attitude {{on the part of}} Russian Soviet officials towards the needs and requirements of the national republics. [...] The multi-national Soviet state can become really durable, and the co-operation of the peoples within it really fraternal, only if these survivals are vigorously and irrevocably eradicated from the practice of our state institutions. Hence, the first immediate task <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Party</b> is vigorously to combat the survivals of Great-Russian chauvinism.|$|E
2500|$|While {{running for}} mayor in 1993, Coleman {{wrote in a}} letter to the City Convention Delegates: [...] "I have never sought any other {{political}} office. I have no other ambition other than to be mayor." [...] In the letter he said:I am a lifelong Democrat. Some accuse me of being the fiscal conservative in this race—I plead guilty! I'm not afraid to be tight with your tax dollars. Yet, my fiscal conservatism does not mean I am any less progressive in my Democratic ideals.

In response to these comments, Martin, with the support of National Liberal Caucus chair Andy Savoy, expelled her from caucus, saying, [...] "Even though I respect her right to express her viewpoint, I cannot, as leader <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>party</b> and of our caucus, tolerate her behaviour." ...|$|E

5000|$|A review <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Party's</b> 70-plus-year history elicits an {{important}} conclusion: <b>our</b> <b>Party</b> earned the people's support during the historical periods of revolution, construction and reform {{because it always}} represented the requirements for developing China's advanced productive forces, the orientation of China's advanced culture and the fundamental interests of {{the overwhelming majority of}} the Chinese people. The Party also earned popular support because it fought tirelessly to realize the fundamental interests of the country and the people by formulating a correct line, principles and policies. Today, humanity once again stands at the beginning of a new century and a new millennium. How <b>our</b> <b>Party</b> can better effectuate the Three Represents under the new historical conditions is a major issue all Party comrades, especially high-ranking Party cadres, must consider deeply.|$|R

2500|$|In July 2007, Hagel was one {{of three}} Republican Senators who {{supported}} Democratic-proposed legislation requiring a troop withdrawal from Iraq to begin within 120 days. He told Robert D. Novak [...] "This thing is really coming undone quickly, and [...] Maliki's government is weaker by the day. The police are corrupt, top to bottom. The oil problem is a huge problem. They still can't get anything through the parliament—no hydrocarbon law, no de-Baathification law, no provincial elections." [...] In 2008, along with then-Senator (and presumptive Democratic nominee for president) Barack Obama, and Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), Hagel visited Iraq in a congressional delegation trip, meeting with U.S. service members, General David Petraeus, and the Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki. While talking to reporters in Iraq, Hagel said, [...] "Each one of us who has a responsibility of helping lead this country needs to reflect on what we think is in the interests of our country, not the interest <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>party</b> or our president." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Whig grandees such as Portland and Fitzwilliam privately {{agreed with}} Burke's Appeal, they {{wished he had}} used more {{moderate}} language. Fitzwilliam saw the Appeal as containing [...] "the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since". Francis Basset, a backbench Whig MP, wrote to Burke: [...] "...though for reasons which I will not now detail I did not then deliver my sentiments, I most perfectly differ from Mr. Fox & from the great Body of opposition on the French Revolution". Burke sent {{a copy of the}} Appeal to the king and the king requested a friend to communicate to Burke that he had read it [...] "with great Satisfaction". Burke wrote of its reception: [...] "Not one word from one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>party.</b> They are secretly galled. They agree with me to a title; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting Fox. ... They leave me to myself; they see that I can do myself justice". Charles Burney viewed it as [...] "a most admirable book—the best & most useful on political subjects that I have ever seen" [...] but believed the differences in the Whig Party between Burke and Fox should not be aired publicly.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the book}} {{attracted}} negative publicity during McAuliffe's 2013 gubernatorial race.
