40|$|Abstract—The {{variability}} <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> accumulation <b>and</b> melting {{is one of}} {{the most}} important interactions of the Earth’s surface with atmosphere through energy transmission and mass balance. In this paper, the effects <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> accumulation <b>and</b> melting together with bare soil <b>and</b> fixed <b>snow</b> depth on the reflected global position-ing system (GPS) signals are investigated using GPS antenna gains and multipath signal. The reflected GPS signals are modeled and employed to analyze the interactions <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> accumulation, snow melting, bare soil, <b>and</b> fixed <b>snow</b> depth at BAKE and KUUJ GPS stations in Northern Canada. The results show the clear indepen-dency <b>of</b> the <b>snow</b> accumulation <b>and</b> melting variations with bare soil <b>and</b> fixed <b>snow</b> depth, which are validated from GPS-reflected signals as well. The modeled reflected GPS signals indicate the higher frequency <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> accumulation <b>and</b> <b>snow</b> melting than that of bare soil <b>and</b> fixed <b>snow</b> depth, while the estimated powe...|$|R

5|$|Shocks of magnitude3.2 {{or greater}} {{occurred}} at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude4 or above per day in early April, and eightperday the week before May 18. Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice were reported from aerial observations.|$|E
5|$|Wet snow {{avalanches}} are a low-velocity suspension <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> water, {{with the}} flow confined {{to the surface of}} the pathway. The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.|$|E
5|$|According to Dallas, {{it rained}} on days that were {{supposed}} to be sunny, while other days of production lacked rain when {{they were supposed to be}} rainy. Goodwin added that the scene <b>of</b> <b>Snow</b> <b>and</b> Charming releasing the birds was freezing because of the heavy rain. Their scene in the cabin took place on the first day of the episode's production. Her near-death scene involved a real cliff, though the height was exaggerated later using CGI and a green screen; a stunt double stood in for some of the shots.|$|E

5|$|Earth has {{undergone}} periodic climate {{shifts in the}} past, including four major ice ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include {{the positions of the}} continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia itself, the {{combination}} <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> sleet closed {{many of the}} schools, delayed flights, trains and buses. The school district parochial schools were closed on the 14th, as were the regional and central administrative offices. During the midday hours on the 14th, giant slabs of ice slid off tops of buildings in Center City and crashed to the ground. Chunks of ice as large as three feet wide {{made their way to}} the pavement from high up. Police started to block off areas where the ice was falling, however one man was hit in the head by the falling ice and was knocked to the ground.|$|E

It is regularly closed in winter because <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> <b>and</b> has seen several longer-term closures owing to subsidence following heavy rain. The road remains a popular route for tourists and motorcycles, however, and sections {{have been used for}} semi-professional cycling races such as the Tour of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Lillehammer Olympics, {{there was}} no {{bobsleigh}} and luge track in Norway. During the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Korketrekkeren had been built as a temporary venue, but it was made <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> was not reused after the Olympics. In its bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics, Lillehammer had proposed placing the bobsleigh and luge track next to Balbergbakken in Fåberg. By May 1989, plans {{for most of the}} venues were being reshuffled and the track was then proposed located at Kanthaugen as part of an Olympic Park at Stampesletta. The Kanthaugen proposal was estimated to cost NOK231 million.|$|E
5|$|Properly {{equipped}} {{aircraft are}} able to fly through snowstorms under Instrument Flight Rules. Prior to takeoff, during snowstorms they require deicing fluid to prevent accumulation and freezing <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> other precipitation on wings and fuselages, which may compromise {{the safety of the}} aircraft and its occupants. In flight, aircraft rely on a variety of mechanisms to avoid rime and other types of icing in clouds, these include pulsing pneumatic boots, electro-thermal areas that generate heat, and fluid deicers that bleed onto the surface.|$|E

5|$|Trade winds blow {{from east}} to west across the Hawaiian islands, and the {{presence}} of Mauna Loa strongly affects the local climate. At low elevations, the eastern (windward) side of the volcano receives heavy rain; the city of Hilo is the wettest in the United States. The rainfall supports extensive forestation. The western (leeward) side has a much drier climate. At higher elevations, the amount of precipitation decreases, and skies are very often clear. Very low temperatures mean that precipitation often occurs in the form <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> <b>and</b> the summit of Mauna Loa is described as a periglacial region, where freezing and thawing {{play a significant role in}} shaping the landscape.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{interacts with}} {{vegetation}} in two principal ways, vegetation {{can influence the}} deposition and retention <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and,</b> conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth {{is dependent on the}} departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The Exeter Township snow emergency, {{which was}} {{declared}} on the 14th, was extended through 4 PM on the 15th. Several {{schools across the}} county were closed on the 14th, with some also closed on the 15th. Across the Lehigh Valley: In Lehigh County, The city of Allentown declared a snow emergency early on the 14th, which was then lifted at 8 PM on the 14th. The weight <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice, on the 14th, brought down the dome over the swimming pool at the West End Racquet and Fitness Club in South Whitehall Township. The dome itself was destroyed. Also, the Brookside Country Club in Wescosville also reported dome damage {{as a result of}} the snow and ice. In Northampton County, an 83-year-old woman was found dead on the rear porch of her home from hypothermia. Also in Bethlehem, a pedestrian was hospitalized after a private snowplow operator backed over him while clearing the Sheetz gas station parking lot at 3201 Schoenersville Road on the 14th. County Emergency Dispatch officials reported about a dozen or so minor vehicle accidents due to the slippery conditions. The snow and ice was too much on the 15th for a dome covering a soccer field at the Iron Lakes Sports Club on Shankweiler Road in North Whitehall that it collapsed.|$|E

25|$|The {{initiation}} of a snowball Earth event would involve some initial cooling mechanism, which {{would result in}} an increase in Earth's coverage <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice. The increase in Earth's coverage <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice would in turn increase Earth's albedo, which would result in positive feedback for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, run-away cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where solar radiation is most direct.|$|E
