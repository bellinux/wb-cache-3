50|$|The He 176 {{was built}} to utilise {{one of the new}} Walter engines. It was a tiny, simple aircraft, built almost entirely out of wood, but did possess an advanced, totally {{enclosed}} cockpit, with a frameless single-piece clear nose, through which the pilot's rudder pedal mounts were visible, and a flush upper cockpit glazing which was removable for entering the aircraft, making the cockpit fit completely within the forward, bullet-like contours of the fuselage. The landing gear was a combination of conventional and tricycle gear designs, with the main gear's struts intended to retract rearwards into the fuselage, with a fixed, aerodynamically faired nose wheel and strut, and a retractable tail wheel. A unique feature of the He 176 was its jettisonable nose escape system. Compressed air was used to separate the nose from the aircraft. A drogue chute was used to reduce the <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> required. After the drogue was deployed, the flush-fitting cockpit canopy was released and a conventional pilot/parachute bailout occurred.|$|E

Subjects and methods: Subjects were 36 healthy elderly individuals aged ≥ 65  years without dysphagia (16 men and 20 women; mean age 75. 5  years, range 65 – 88  years). Videofluorographic images during the swallowing of 10  mL of 40 % (w/v) barium sulfate were obtained and the degrees of anterior, superior, and hypotenuse displacements of the hyoid bone and maximum/resting hyoid position were evaluated. Jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> was measured three times using a jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> sthenometer; the mean of these three measurements was used for analysis. Results: In men, there was a positive correlation between jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> and resting hyoid position and negative correlations among all the degrees of anterior, superior, and hypotenuse displacements of the hyoid bone. In women, there was no statistically significant correlation between jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> and any of the measurement items. There was no statistically significant correlation between jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> and maximum hyoid position in either men or women. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that low jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> leads to low resting hyoid position only in elderly men, and a lower hyoid position in healthy elderly men results in a larger total amount of hyoid displacement during swallowing. Moreover, a maximum hyoid position in healthy individuals of either gender does not differ depending on their jaw <b>opening</b> <b>force.</b> Keywords: aging, deglutition disorders, dysphasia, gender difference...|$|E

Testing consisted of both static compression and cyclic compression evaluation of 10. 2 by 15. 2 by 0. 5 cm (4 by 6 by 0. 2 in) laminates with circular holes, simulated delaminations, and low velocity impact. Damage growth under steadily increasing compression and cyclic compression loading was monitored. Damage size and impact-induced failures for the three materials were compared.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical–experimental analysis of damage engineering {{applied to a}} well-known industrial problem. Many food cans are manually opened by raising a tab on the lid, thus initiating a crack, which is propagated along acircumferential groove. The influence of the groove geometry and depth on the <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> and the resistance againstpremature opening is investigated for some packaging materials, by making use of dedicated experimental techniquesand an operator-split damage-plasticity framework. Attention is focused on {{a small part of}} the groove at a location halfwaythe circular crack-path, 900 from the crack initiation point. First, the groovemanufacturing is analyzed by pressing a punchinto a thin sheet of the material. Grooved specimens are loaded in tension, simulating the internal pressure during sterilization,and in shear, simulating the opening. Experiments have been carried out using a miniaturized tensile/compressionstage located in the objective field of an opticalmicroscope. For the computational analysis, an operator-split damage-plasticitymodel is proposed, where ductile damage is easily operated in conjunction with standard plasticity models. Simulationsare done within a geometrically non-linear context, using a hypo-elasto-plastic material model with non-linearhardening and a contact algorithm to simulate the contact bodies in the groove forming process. An arbitrary–Lagrange–Euler (ALE) technique and adaptive remeshing are used to assuremesh quality during the large deformation process. The operator-split procedure used for the solution of the governing equations, allows to make easy use of a non-localdamage operator as an extra feature within a commercial FEMpackage. Experimental results reveal that a reduction up to 20 % for the <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> with unchanged pre-opening resistance can be reached with the use of an asymmetric punch forthe groove forming. Numerical and experimental results are in good agreement. Simulations show that the industrial processof can lid production can be optimized considerably by controlling damage evolution in the first stage of the process...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} the film stiffness of dry gas seal, and keep a low leakage rate at the same time, {{a great deal of}} numerical and experimental study on groove structure and parameter optimization of DGS under varying operation conditions have been carried out. The effect of geometry parameters of groove, such as spiral angle, groove-dam ratio and groove depth, on the performance of a S-DGS, such as <b>opening</b> <b>force,</b> film stiffness, leakage rate and stiffness-leakage ratio, are numerically analyzed by Zirkelback et al. [8], Liu et al. [9], Peng et al. [10]. The optimum structural parameters of groove with different objective functions in different operating conditions are presented. In recent years, the effect of groove structural optimization on performance improvement of DGS has attracted more and more researchers’ attention because the limitation of performance enhancement by optimum design of groove geometry parameters of S-DGS simply. Recently, a parametric study and performance evaluation of typical bidirectional dry gas seals with modified surface were presented by Su et al. [11, 12] and Blasiaka and Zahorulko [13]. Hashimoto and Ochiai [14 – 16] presented an entirely new optimum design methodology, in which the groove geometry can be flexibly changed by using the spline function, {{to maximize the}} stiffness of gas films for grooved thrust bearings. The film stiffness and load-capacity of the optimized bearing are higher than that of common spiral groove bearing and herringbone bearing, which were both theoretically and experimentally verified. The sealing performance of the spiral groove DGS with an inner annular groove (AS-DGS) [17] was numerically analyzed by Peng et al. [18], which was invented by Flowserve Corporation. The results show that the <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> and film stiffness of AS-DGS is larger than that of the common S-DGS at the condition of low-speed and high-pressure, while the leakage is a little larger. Dresser-Rand Corporation presented a patented pattern of short grooves in combination with the longer grooves to provide excellent lift-off effect and optimum gas film stiffness at low speed as well as high speed. During operation, the short grooves could create obvious high pressure to separate the mating rings at slow speed, while the longer grooves contribute to creating a stable gas film between the two rings at high speed. The uni-directional V groove with the combined radial-circumferential tapered groove bottom [19], which was invented by Burgmann Corporation, causes a reduction in the <b>opening</b> <b>force</b> and leakage rate. Despite that there are only few researchers pay attention to the experiment of the sealing performance test of DGS, most of the researchers only focus on the numerical simulation and analysis of groove structure and geometry parameters optimization as the subject to improve the gas film stiffness and reduce the fluid leakage of DGS.|$|E

Dental impressions and casts were made for one patient with complete upper and lower dental arches including the third molars and class II bite proportions. A setup based on Frasaco ANA- 4 models was also used. Two protrusive positions of the mandible were investigated: 3 mm and 8 mm, representing respectively 25 % and 65 % of the maximal protrusion. The forces required to remove the BluePro® device from the carriers were recorded continuously over 730 cycles (= 365 days, twice a day) to simulate 1 year of clinical use. At 8 mm protrusion the BluePro® device showed retentive forces of ~ 27 N. There was a slight but non-significant decrease in retentive forces in the tests on the epoxified carriers which was not found on the ANA- 4 carriers.
