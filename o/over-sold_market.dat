40|$|The third-quarter 2002 {{default rate}} for high yield bonds was 4. 95 %, based on $ 37. 48 billion of defaults. The {{quarterly}} default rate {{is the highest}} in history, surpassing {{the first quarter of}} 1991 rate of 4. 80 %. One massive default, WorldCom, accounted for $ 28. 30 billion of defaults (76 %). Without WorldCom, the third quarter default rate would have only been 1. 2 %. The dollar weighted default rate for the first three quarters has already broken the record for a single calendar year reaching 10. 98 %. And, the latest four-quarters’ default rate of 15. 01 % has also set a record. Again, WorldCom’s huge default contributed about 4 % of this record total. The persistently high default rate through the third quarter has resulted in a near record yield spread of 10. 10 % [...] second only to 1990 ’s 10. 50 %. The current yield spread is more than 5 % above the historical average. We believe the default rate has peaked in Q 3 - 2002 and {{depending on the size of}} the decline, we believe the huge yield spread could reflect an <b>over-sold</b> <b>market.</b> Counting WorldCom ($ 46. 0 billion in liabilities), there were more than $ 197 billion in liabilities of firms which filed for Chapter 11 protection through the third quarter and 26 firms had liabilities greater than $ 1 billion. The count was 22 firms through the first-half of the year, so the third-quarter number was "only" four, including WorldCom. There were 39 of such firms in 2001 - - a record year. ...|$|E
