50|$|A 1987 {{quantitative}} {{review of}} 141 studies on 16 different personality traits failed {{to support the}} opinion, held by theorists including Alfred Adler, that <b>only</b> <b>children</b> {{are more likely to}} be maladjusted due to pampering. The study found no evidence of any greater prevalence of maladjustment in <b>only</b> <b>children.</b> The <b>only</b> statistically significant difference discovered was that <b>only</b> <b>children</b> possessed a higher achievement motivation, which Polit and Falbo attributed to their greater share of parental resources, expectations, and scrutiny exposing them to a greater degree of reward, and greater likelihood of punishment for falling short. A second analysis by the authors revealed that <b>only</b> <b>children,</b> <b>children</b> with <b>only</b> one sibling, and first-borns in general, score higher on tests of verbal ability than later-borns and children with multiple siblings.|$|R
40|$|Research {{consistently}} {{shows that}} children with siblings live at a greater distance from their parents than do <b>only</b> <b>children.</b> We extend this literature by assessing whether this difference varies {{as a function of}} parental need. Multinomial logistic regression analyses of German Ageing Survey data enriched with indicators at the district (NUTS 3) level (n = 2, 028) show that, in general, children with a sibling are less likely than <b>only</b> <b>children</b> to share a household with a parent. We do not find {{that children with}} a sibling are more likely than <b>only</b> <b>children</b> to live at great distance, i. e. more than two hours away, from their parents. The differences between <b>only</b> <b>children</b> and children with siblings in parent-child proximity are most pronounced when parents are coping with severe health limitations. It is well-established that <b>only</b> <b>children</b> are more likely than children with siblings to provide support and care to ageing parents.

40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that young <b>only</b> <b>children</b> {{are more likely}} than those with siblings to have egocentric tendencies. Egocentrism is a maladaptive behavior from a lack of Theory of Mind understanding, which is the ability to take on the perspectives of others and to discern emotional cues. The current study determines whether or not <b>only</b> <b>children</b> are more likely respond negatively to teacher criticism. <b>Only</b> <b>children</b> (N= 100) and those with siblings (N= 100) aged six years were be tested on tasks measuring egocentrism, ToM understanding, and their response to teacher constructive criticism. <b>Only</b> <b>children</b> are expected to have lower ToM task scores, respond more negatively to criticism, and to be more likely to display traits of egocentrism than those with siblings. These potential results {{indicate that}} there is something developmentally beneficial in having a sibling(s), which promotes social and emotional competency in young children that is not necessarily prevalent for <b>only</b> <b>children.</b> Further research should examine children at an even younger age to determine when and how the difference in ToM understanding occurs...|$|R

40|$|Objective: It is {{hypothesised}} that firstborn <b>children</b> and <b>only</b> <b>children</b> {{are more}} intelligent with higher intelligence scores having {{been observed in}} firstborn or <b>only</b> <b>children.</b> Evidence of the increased intelligence has been suggested {{by the fact that}} 21 / 23 (91 %) of US astronauts, 23 / 43 (53 %) of US presi-dents and between 75 and 80 % of students at Harvard are firstborn or <b>only</b> <b>children.</b> It is of interest to investigate, therefore, whether a high achieving career such as medicine has a disproportionate number of firstborn or <b>only</b> <b>children.</b> Design: A survey of medical students. Setting: The University of Sheffield Medical School. Participants: All students studying medicine in the aca-demic year 2011 – 2012. Main outcome measures: The proportion of firstborn or <b>only</b> <b>children.</b> Results: There was a disproportionate number of students who were firstborn or only children: 53 % (95 % CI 49 to 58 %). The expected percentage is 39. 8 % and therefore we can reject the null hypothesis. The results were consistent across all phases of study. Conclusions: There is a higher than expected proportion of medical students at the University of Sheffield who are firstborn or <b>only</b> <b>children.</b> The data though highlight the issue of comparing populations. Here we are comparing a population of medical students with a general population.

The parenting of <b>only</b> <b>children</b> in urban China was predominantly authoritative rather than authoritarian. The parenting strategies and beliefs were child-centered, egalitarian, and warmth-oriented rather than control-oriented. Chinese parents encouraged prosocial assertiveness and discouraged behavioral constraint and modesty. The parenting of <b>only</b> <b>children</b> was also gender egalitarian in that there were few gender differences in child social behaviors and little gender differential parenting and socialization of these <b>only</b> <b>children.</b> Together with other recent studies, these findings and conclusions challenge the traditionalist view of Chinese parenting and beliefs and behaviors about child socialization.

40|$|Based on the One-percent Population Survey in China in 2005 (NPS 05), {{we study}} the {{differences}} between <b>only</b> <b>children</b> and non-only children in their choice of labor migration, which can be decomposed into a departure choice from the rural areas at the upper level and a destination choice of interprovincial migration at the lower level. Results from the departure model show that the likelihood of migration is in general not so much different between only- and non-only children. Except in the western regions, female <b>only</b> <b>children</b> are {{much less likely to}} make labor migration than their non-only counterparts. Odds-ratio from the destination choice model show that <b>only</b> <b>children</b> in less developed regions are much less likely to make interprovincial migration than do non-only children, indicating that the destination choice of <b>only</b> <b>children</b> are much more confined within the province. With a growing share of <b>only</b> <b>children</b> in the rural areas entering into labor markets, our findings help explain the emerging labor shortage in the affluent coastal regions, whose development relies much on labor migration from the less developed regions. The policy implications of the finding are twofold: (1) relaxation of the one-child policy and (2) the training and settlement of labor migrants can help to alleviate the labor shortage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInvestigations {{regarding}} the differences between Chinese <b>only</b> and non-only <b>children</b> primarily examine children's social behaviors, which {{are closely related to}} their early relationships with mothers and teachers. In recent years, the number of non-only children born in urban areas has increased because of the softening of the One-Child Policy, which leads to the distribution of non-only children shifting from being primarily in rural areas to being in both urban and rural areas. The present study investigates the current characteristics and influences of mother–child and teacher–child relationships on Chinese only and non-only children's early social behaviors from the perspective of urban and rural differences. Data were obtained from 126 rural <b>only</b> <b>children,</b> 94 rural non-only <b>children,</b> 168 urban <b>only</b> <b>children</b> and 155 urban non-only children from 38 semi-urban kindergartens in Beijing, China. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses found that mother–child closeness positively predicted children's social skills particularly in non-only children, whereas mother–child conflict positively predicted internalizing behavior problems in all four groups. Teacher–child conflict negatively predicted children's social skills most strongly in urban <b>only</b> <b>children.</b> Teacher–child conflict aggravated rural only children's, urban only children's and non-only children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, but mother–child closeness buffered rural only children's externalizing behavior problems. Findings underscore the importance for mothers to improve closeness, especially with rural <b>only</b> <b>children,</b> and for teachers to avoid conflict with both urban <b>only</b> and non-only <b>children,</b> as well as with rural <b>only</b> <b>children...</b>|$|R
