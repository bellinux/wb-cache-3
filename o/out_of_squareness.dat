Magnetic oscillations with toroidal mode number n {approx} 2 [...] 9 and a fast growth time {gamma}{sup {minus} 1 } = 20 [...] 150 {micro}s are often observed prior to the first giant type 1 ELM in discharges with moderate squareness. High n ideal ballooning second stability access encourages edge instabilities by facilitating the buildup of the edge pressure gradient and bootstrap current density which destabilize the intermediate to low n modes.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{crystalline}} orientation can be modified by deposition conditions such as the choice of potentiostatic and pulsed potential deposition [23]. In particular, pulsed deposition is a powerful technique to improve uniform growth avoiding the formation of large and randomly oriented crystallites [23]. Furthermore, the low pH value of the electrolyte should be considered. As discussed above, fabrication of Fe nanowires is preceded by the simultaneous reduction of hydronium ions, which results in local pH changes inside the pores of the AAO membrane [24]. Moreover, hydrogen can be easily absorbed in the deposit, significantly influencing its crystallinity [25]. In this case, the metal Fe deposition rate might be considerably reduced. It {{is well known}} that the hard axis for the magnetization of bcc Fe is in the < 110 > direction, which results in reduction <b>of</b> the <b>squareness</b> in magnetization. This uniaxial magnetization behavior of Fe nanowire arrays was confirmed in this study. Yang et al. reported that Fe nanowires, which were fabricated using potentiostatic electrodeposition at a constant cell voltage of 1.5  V, had a random orientation without texture [11]. Irfan et al. also reported that Fe nanowires, which were potentiostatically electrodeposited at −[*] 1.1  V vs. SCE, exhibited a non-textured orientation and the coercive force of ca. 0.5  kOe [12]. Cornejo et al. also reported that Fe nanowires, which were prepared using AC electrodeposition at a cell voltage of 15  V, had a random orientation without texture and the <b>squareness</b> <b>of</b> ca. 0.5 [13]. In the current study, Fe nanowires with an aspect ratio of 2000, which were electrodeposited using a rectangular-pulsed potential deposition technique to control the crystal orientation, had a strong texture with (200) orientation. The textured Fe nanowires exhibited the coercive force of ca. 1.4  kOe and the <b>squareness</b> <b>of</b> ca. 0.95. Hence, we demonstrated that the rectangular-pulsed potential deposition technique can control the crystal orientation and aspect ratio of Fe nanowires, leading to excellent magnetic properties.|$|R
