The two men were barely on speaking terms as Lucan was married to one of Cardigan's sisters and, as Cardigan believed, did not treat her well. The order had been conveyed by Captain Louis Nolan, who died in the charge, and both Lucan and Cardigan blamed him for passing on the order incorrectly. Cardigan's first action on his return from the charge was to report the undisciplined behaviour of Captain Nolan (whom he did not know to be dead) in riding ahead of him at the start of the attack.|$|E

40|$|Individualisation as {{a general}} trend in society is related to {{increased}} personal mobility, and delocalisations of social networks, which appears to have major influences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> meaning a village acquires {{in the life of}} its inhabitants. Earlier research conceptualized a rather narrow and disembodied notion of place meaning in a rural context. Therefore this study aims to present the emotional driving forces for the constitution of place meaning by investigating the role of the locations of daily performances and social networks, following a postphenomenological approach which allows for incorporating entities that are both materially and relationally present in the village, mapping spatial negotiations of extending the self and erecting emotional boundaries, initiated by emotional associations and affective atmospheres. From semistructured interviews with villagers from a merely individualised and a merely collectivist village it appears that meanings of villages are shaped through and within affective atmospheres are conceived and the way emotional associations are made with the entities of spaces of the everyday, including the home, urban places, natural areas surrounding the village and public places in <b>the</b> village itself. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> one hand, more individualist, spatially and socially not confined villagers tend to base their meaning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> village can provide in absence of strongly defined atmospheres and associations with collectivist lifestyles. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, more collectivist, spatially and socially relatively confined to the village tend to base their meaning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> village can provide in absence of undefined atmospheres and associations with unfamiliar lifestyles...|$|R

A longitudinal study in the United States of over 4000 women followed for 3 years found that the national rape related pregnancy rate was 5.0% per rape among victims aged 12–45 years, producing over 32,000 pregnancies nationally among women from rape each year.

25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the need to}} uphold constitutional supremacy and the principle of rigidity, the Constitution is also a living document that can be amended where necessary. As the Constitution does not appear to place restrictions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> its provisions may be amended, the question of whether there are any implied restrictions on Parliament's power to amend the Constitution arises. If such limitations exist, they would serve as a safeguard against unrestrained amendment by the legislature and protect the essential constitutional features and structure. India takes this stand – the Supreme Court held in Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala (1973) that there are certain implied basic features of the Indian Constitution that are not amenable to changes and amendment by Parliament. On the other hand, in Singapore it has been established that there are no implied limitations on Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Trotskyists differ <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> {{this is true}} today, {{but even}} the most {{orthodox}} tend to recognise {{in the late twentieth century}} a new development in the revolts of the rural poor, the self-organising struggles of the landless, and many other struggles which in some ways reflect the militant united organised struggles of the working class, and which to various degrees do not bear the marks of class divisions typical of the heroic peasant struggles of previous epochs. However, orthodox Trotskyists today still argue that the town and city based working class struggle is central to the task of a successful socialist revolution, linked to these struggles of the rural poor. They argue that the working class learns of necessity to conduct a collective struggle, for instance in trade unions, arising from its social conditions in the factories and workplaces, and that the collective consciousness it achieves as a result is an essential ingredient of the socialist reconstruction of society.|$|E

25|$|Since the Chinese state {{continues}} to exert {{a considerable amount}} of control over media, public support for domestic reporting has {{come as a surprise to}} many observers. Not much is known about the extent to which the Chinese citizenry believe the official statements of the CPC, nor about which media sources they perceive as credible and why. So far, research on the media in China has focused on the changing relationship between media outlets and the state during the reform era. Nor is much known about how China's changing media environment has affected the government's ability to persuade media audiences. Research on political trust reveals that exposure to the media correlates positively with support for the government in some instances, and negatively in others. The research has been cited as evidence that the Chinese public believes propaganda transmitted to them through the news media, but also that they disbelieve it. These contradictory results can be explained by realizing that ordinary citizens consider media sources to be credible to a greater or lesser degree, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> media outlets have undergone reform.|$|E
25|$|Problems in {{communities}} or cultures, including poverty, unemployment or underemployment, {{lack of social}} cohesion, and migration, {{have been associated with}} the development of mental disorders. Stresses and strains related to socioeconomic position (socioeconomic status (SES) or social class) have been linked to the occurrence of major mental disorders, with a lower or more insecure educational, occupational, economic or social position generally linked to more mental disorders. There have been mixed findings {{on the nature of the}} links and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> pre-existing personal characteristics influence the links. Both personal resources and community factors have been implicated, as well as interactions between individual-level and regional-level income levels. The causal role of different socioeconomic factors may vary by country. Socioeconomic deprivation in neighborhoods can cause worse mental health, even after accounting for genetic factors. In addition, minority ethnic groups, including first or second-generation immigrants, have been found to be at greater risk for developing mental disorders, which has been attributed to various kinds of life insecurities and disadvantages, including racism. The direction of causality is sometimes unclear, and alternative hypotheses such as the Drift Hypothesis sometimes need to be discounted.|$|E
25|$|Since the Cabinet Crisis of 1964, {{there has}} been {{disagreement}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> rivalries within the MCP in the early 1960s reflected generational and ideological tensions between Dr Banda and his younger ministers or regional divisions. Following {{the release of the}} Chisiza brothers and Chipembere in October 1960, the influence of northerners appeared to grow, reaching a peak in September 1961 when Yatuta Chisiza was appointed the party's Administrative Secretary alongside his brother, Dunduzu, the Secretary General; Chiume was Publicity Secretary; Orton Chirwa was Legal Adviser; and Rose Chibambo, the only woman on the party's National Executive, was Chairman of the Woman's League. This apparent northern dominance, masked divisions and politicians born in the north pursued various personal and ideological agendas and did not act as a regional bloc. After the Lancaster House conference made it clear that independence would be achieved, MCP became a more divided party. The focus moved away from achieving independence towards the allocation of resources between ministries and regions. Resentment of the hold that better-educated northerners had on scarce jobs was used by Banda to assert his authority by playing ministers off against one another, but {{there is no evidence of}} him adopting a pro-Chewa, anti-northern stance before the 1964 crisis. None of the ministers who resigning in 1964 drew attention to regional distinctions, but Banda's allies from the Central Region accused northern politician in general and Chiume in particular of favouritism, and voiced Chewa resentment against senior civil servants from the north, many of whom had demonstrated in favour of the former ministers. Rose Chibambo came in for particularly violent abuse, probably because of anti-female as well as anti-northern prejudice.|$|E
