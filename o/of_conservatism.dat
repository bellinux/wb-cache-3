5|$|During Sa'ad Zaghloul's term as {{minister}} of education, {{before he went}} on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. While a bastion <b>of</b> <b>conservatism</b> in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, especially as espoused by the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928. The school attracted students from throughout the world, including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, providing a counterbalance to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{prominent}} philosophers of the Enlightenment were John Locke, Thomas Paine, Samuel Johnson and Jeremy Bentham. More radical elements were later countered by Edmund Burke who is regarded as the founder <b>of</b> <b>conservatism.</b> The poet Alexander Pope with his satirical verse became well regarded. The English {{played a significant role in}} romanticism: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, John Keats, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Blake and William Wordsworth were major figures.|$|E
5|$|Heliade Rădulescu is {{considered}} one of the foremost champions of Romanian culture from the first half of the 19th century, having first risen to prominence through his association with Gheorghe Lazăr and his support of Lazăr's drive for discontinuing education in Greek. Over the following decades, he had a major role in shaping the modern Romanian language, but caused controversy when he advocated the massive introduction of Italian neologisms into the Romanian lexis. A Romantic nationalist landowner siding with moderate liberals, Heliade was among the leaders of the 1848 Wallachian revolution, after which he was forced to spend several years in exile. Adopting an original form <b>of</b> <b>conservatism,</b> which emphasized the role of the aristocratic boyars in Romanian history, he was rewarded for supporting the Ottoman Empire and clashed with the radical wing of the 1848 revolutionaries.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates how {{the degree}} <b>of</b> {{accounting}} <b>conservatism</b> {{in the financial}} statements of European companies evolves over time during period 1996 - 2005. This study concludes that the financial statement information of European companies shows a certain degree <b>of</b> balance sheet <b>conservatism</b> and earnings conservatism during period 1991 - 2005; this degree <b>of</b> balance sheet <b>conservatism</b> and earnings conservatism evolves over time. The research findings do not indicate that the introduction of IFRS has reduced {{the differences in the}} degree <b>of</b> balance sheet <b>conservatism</b> and earnings conservatism between European companies reporting according to IFRS. Finally, the research findings indicate that IAS/IFRS based accounting standards have their own characteristics; this cause that the degree <b>of</b> accounting <b>conservatism</b> in financial statements differ importantly per accounting regulation...|$|R
5|$|The {{contributors}} to Seara and Libertatea were, in general, outspoken {{social and cultural}} critics, with diverse grievances against the establishment. Historian Lucian Boia argues that, even though Bogdan-Pitești was on the German payroll, his switch from the Francophiles {{could have been a}} genuine form <b>of</b> <b>conservatism.</b> Boia thus notes that Seara was supportive of the Central Powers from the 1914 build-up to the war, that is even before Cantacuzino had come to decide which side he liked best. The core group of Seara men included socialists of various hues: Arghezi, who claimed that Serbian nationalism was the spark of the war; Felix Aderca, who depicted the German Empire as the more progressive belligerent; and Rodion, who rendered the complains of Germanophile intellectuals from Moldavia. Others were left-wing refugees from the Russian Empire, who wanted Romania to join the Central Powers and help liberate Bessarabia: Alexis Nour, from the Poporanist faction, and the old anarchist Zamfir Arbore. Seara was also a platform for some disgruntled Romanians from Transylvania region, a Romanian irredenta under Austro-Hungarian rule. They included a mainstream Conservative commentator, Ilie Bărbulescu, who advised Romanians to not to focus on Transylvania, and prioritized action against the Russians. Two distinct voices were those of poet Dumitru Karnabatt, who identified the Entente Powers with Pan-Slavism or British imperialism; and Ion Gorun, the Transylvanian writer and Habsburg loyalist. Beyond politics, Seara came out with news on culture, selected for publishing by Ion Vinea and poet Jacques G. Costin.|$|E

25|$|The General Staff, {{from that}} point, became a bastion <b>of</b> <b>conservatism,</b> causing a {{build-up}} of troubles that later became critical. The reform plan advocated {{a change from}} an Army-Division-Regiment structure to a Corps-Brigade arrangement. The new structures were to be more capable in a situation with no front line, and more capable of independent action at all levels. Cutting out a level of command, omitting {{two out of three}} higher echelons between the theatre headquarters and the fighting battalions, would produce economies, increase flexibility, and simplify command-and-control arrangements.|$|E
25|$|In late 2000, Sullivan {{began his}} blog, The Daily Dish. The core {{principle}} of the blog has been the style <b>of</b> <b>conservatism</b> he views as traditional. This includes fiscal conservatism, limited government, and classic libertarianism on social issues. Sullivan opposes government involvement with respect to sexual and consensual matters between adults, {{such as the use}} of marijuana and prostitution. He believes recognition of same-sex marriage is a civil-rights issue but expressed willingness to promote it on a state-by-state legislative federalism basis, rather than trying to judicially impose the change. Most of Sullivan's disputes with other conservatives have been over social issues and the handling of postwar Iraq.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, a {{conservative}} {{backlash against the}} kind of liberalism championed by Roosevelt and Kennedy developed in the Republican Party. This brand <b>of</b> <b>conservatism</b> primarily reacted against the cultural and political upheavals of the 1960s. It helped launch into power such presidents as Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump. Economic woes in the early 21st century led to a resurgence of social liberalism {{with the election of}} Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, along with countervailing and partly reactive conservative populism and nativism embodied in the Tea Party movement and the election of Donald Trump.|$|E

40|$|LaFond and Watts (2008) provide {{evidence}} that information asymmetry might be a determinant <b>of</b> accounting <b>conservatism.</b> One implication <b>of</b> their paper is that regulators trying to reduce information asymmetry by lowering the level <b>of</b> accounting <b>conservatism</b> might be wrong. However, there is a trend in moving away from conservative accounting. The typical example is IFRS adoption. Therefore, this paper studies information asymmetry and accounting conservatism under IFRS adoption. The {{results show that the}} level <b>of</b> accounting <b>conservatism</b> decreases after mandatory IFRS adoption, but the adoption of IFRS is likely to weaken the relationship between information asymmetry and accounting conservatism. Moreover, this paper investigates how the change <b>of</b> accounting <b>conservatism</b> under IFRS is related to the change in information environment. The finding shows that accounting conservatism increases information environment, supporting the idea that, by providing comparatively credible information, conservative accounting is beneficial to the information environment...|$|R

25|$|Also in 1903, Nicolae Iorga {{became one}} of the {{managers}} of Sămănătorul review. The moment brought Iorga's emancipation from Maiorescu's influence, his break with mainstream Junimism, and his affiliation to the traditionalist, ethno-nationalist and neoromantic current encouraged by the magazine. The Sămănătorist school was by then also grouping other former or active Junimists, and Maiorescu's progressive withdrawal from literary life also created a bridge with Convorbiri Literare: its new editor, Simion Mehedinți, was himself a theorist of traditionalism. A circle of Junimists more sympathetic to Maiorescu's version <b>of</b> <b>conservatism</b> reacted against this realignment by founding its own venue, Convorbiri Critice, edited by Mihail Dragomirescu.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{the maximum}} {{depth of the}} water is known, and is quite shallow, a diver must monitor the depth and {{duration}} of a dive to avoid decompression sickness. Traditionally this was done by using a depth gauge and a diving watch, but electronic dive computers are now in general use, as they are programmed to do real-time modelling of decompression requirements for the dive, and automatically allow for surface interval. Many can be set for the gas mixture to be used on the dive, and some can accept changes in the gas mix during the dive. Most dive computers provide a fairly conservative decompression model, and the level <b>of</b> <b>conservatism</b> may be selected by the user within limits. Most decompression computers can also be set for altitude compensation to some degree.|$|E
25|$|During the Nixon years (and {{through the}} 1970s), the liberal {{consensus}} {{began to come}} apart {{with the election of}} Ronald Reagan marking the election of the first non-Keynsian administration and the first application of supply-side economics. The alliance with white Southern Democrats had been lost in the Civil Rights era. While the steady enfranchisement of African Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough {{to make up for the}} loss of some Southern Democrats. A tide <b>of</b> <b>conservatism</b> rose in response to perceived failures of liberal policies. Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the US and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it.|$|E
