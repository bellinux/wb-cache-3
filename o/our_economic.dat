In a letter to Pillsbury chairman Phillip L. Smith, franchise representative Bill N.

Leslie's The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction. Weisman concludes the book considering {{a new version of the}} one-child policy. While he admits it is a [...] "draconian measure", he states, [...] "The bottom line is that any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash. Limiting our reproduction would be damn hard, but limiting our consumptive instincts may be even harder."

2500|$|Economist Alan B. Krueger {{wrote in}} 2012: [...] "The rise in {{inequality}} in the United States {{over the last}} three decades has reached the point that inequality in incomes is causing an unhealthy division in opportunities, and is a threat to <b>our</b> <b>economic</b> growth. Restoring a greater degree of fairness to the U.S. job market would be good for businesses, good for the economy, and good for the country." [...] Krueger wrote that the significant shift in the share of income accruing to the top 1% over the 1979 to 2007 period represented nearly $1.1 trillion in annual income. Since the wealthy tend to save nearly 50% of their marginal income while the remainder of the population saves roughly 10%, other things equal this would reduce annual consumption (the largest component of GDP) by as much as 5%. Krueger wrote that borrowing likely helped many households make up for this shift, which became more difficult {{in the wake of the}} 2007–2009 recession.|$|E
