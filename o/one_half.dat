5|$|This {{station is}} unusual in that its {{mezzanine}} is split in two halves.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have been implicated, including {{high levels of}} dust in coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from welding.

Silica dust and fiberglass dust exposure {{can also lead to}} COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis. The negative effects of dust exposure and cigarette smoke exposure appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.|$|E

5|$|Basiliscus fled in {{the heat}} of the battle. <b>One</b> <b>half</b> of the Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and the other half {{followed}} the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.|$|E
