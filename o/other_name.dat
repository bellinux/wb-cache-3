25|$|In the Netherlands, a Dutch oven {{is called}} a , which {{literally}} translates to frying pan or roasting pan. An <b>other</b> <b>name</b> for it is sudderpan, which literally translates to 'simmerpan' or 'simmering pot'. The design most used today is a black (with blue inside) enameled steel pan, that is suitable for gas and induction heating. The model was introduced in 1891 by BK, a well known Dutch manufacturer of cookware. Cheaper and lighter in weight than cast iron, {{it proved to be}} a revolution in the kitchen. A braadpan is mainly used for frying meat only, {{but it can also be}} used for making traditional stews such as hachée. Cast-iron models exist, but are used less frequently.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with this}} period, {{the upper class}} and the elites in the Ottoman Empire started to use the open and public areas frequently. The traditional, {{introverted}} manner of the society began to change. Fountains and waterside residences such as the Aynalıkavak Kasrı became popular. A water canal (<b>other</b> <b>name</b> is Cetvel-i Sim) and a picnic area (Kağıthane) were established as recreational areas. Although the Tulip period ended with the Patrona Halil uprising, it became a model for attitudes of Westernization. During the years 17201890, Ottoman architecture deviated from the principles of classical times. With Ahmed III's deposition, Mahmud I took the throne (17301754). It was during this period that Baroque-style mosques were starting to be constructed.|$|E
25|$|In Java, Dharanindra's {{successor}} was Samaragrawira (r. 800—819), {{mentioned in}} Nalanda inscription (dated 860) {{as the father}} of Balaputradewa, and the son of Śailendravamsatilaka (the jewel of Śailendra family) with stylised name Śrīviravairimathana (the slayer of heroic enemy), which refer to Dharanindra. Unlike his predecessor the expansive warlike Dharanindra, Samaragrawira seems to be a pacifist by enjoying a peaceful prosperity of interior Java in Kedu Plain and being more interested on completing the Borobudur project. He appointed Khmer Prince Jayavarman as the governor of Indrapura in the Mekong delta under Sailendran rule. This decision was proven as a mistake, as Jayavarman later revolted, moved his capital further inland north from Tonle Sap to Mahendraparvata, severed the link and proclaimed Cambodian independence from Java in 802. Samaragrawira was mentioned as the king of Java that married Tārā, daughter of Dharmasetu. He was mentioned as his <b>other</b> <b>name</b> Rakai Warak in Mantyasih inscription.|$|E
