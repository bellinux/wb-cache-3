Ukrainians, who have faced a series of defeats <b>on</b> <b>hands</b> of both Poles and Soviets, decided {{that the only way}} to preserve some form of independence was to ally themselves with one faction and majority of Ukrainian leaders chose Poland as the less imperialistic of their enemies. Petliura had, after his government's defeat by the Bolsheviks, found asylum in Poland and now headed a new Ukrainian Army. The Polish–Ukrainian War ended around July 1919 and from September both Polish and Ukrainians fought together against the Soviets.|$|E
25|$|The nail {{is often}} {{considered}} an impermeable barrier, {{but this is}} not true. In fact, it is much more permeable than the skin, and the composition of the nail includes 7–12% water. This permeability has implications for penetration by harmful and medicinal substances; in particular cosmetics applied to the nails can pose a risk. Water can penetrate the nail as can many other substances including paraquat, a fast acting herbicide that is harmful to humans, urea which is often an ingredient in creams and lotions meant for use <b>on</b> <b>hands</b> and fingers, and several fungicidal agents such as salicylic acid, miconazole branded Monistat, natamycin; and sodium hypochlorite which is the active ingredient in common household bleach (but usually only in 2–3% concentration).|$|E

25|$|Catholic social {{teaching}} {{is based on}} the teaching of Jesus and commits Catholics to the welfare of others. Although the Catholic Church operates numerous social ministries throughout the world, individual Catholics are also required to practice spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Corporal works of mercy include feeding the hungry, welcoming strangers, immigrants or refugees, clothing the naked, taking care of the sick and visiting those in prison. Spiritual works require the Catholic to share their knowledge with others, to give advice to those who need it, comfort those who suffer, have patience, forgive those who hurt them, give correction to those who need it, and pray for the living and the dead. The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick, however, is performed by a priest, who will anoint with oil the head and hands of the ill person and pray a special prayer for them while laying <b>on</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E

Bogdan Enache, the band's drummer, died on 8 November, shortly after the plane that transported him from Burn Hospital to a clinic in Zurich, Switzerland, returned on Otopeni airport, because he had entered into cardiopulmonary arrest. Bassist Alex Pascu was hospitalized in serious condition with burns on 70% of the body at Floreasca Hospital, where he was intubated and underwent two surgeries. On 11 November he was transferred to a medical unit in France, but died at the airport in Paris.

2500|$|Zoologists often label behaviors, {{including}} bipedalism, as [...] "facultative" [...] (i.e. optional) or [...] "obligate" [...] (the animal has no reasonable alternative).

There are even reports of humans who normally walk on all fours with their feet but not their knees on the ground, but these cases {{are a result of}} conditions such as Uner Tan syndrome — very rare genetic neurological disorders rather than normal behavior. Even if one ignores exceptions caused by some kind of injury or illness, there are many unclear cases, including the fact that [...] "normal" [...] humans can crawl <b>on</b> <b>hands</b> and knees.

2500|$|Jesus is {{sometimes}} shown performing miracles {{by means of}} a wand, as on the doors of Santa Sabina in Rome (430–32). [...] He uses the wand to change water to wine, multiply the bread and fishes, and raise Lazarus. When pictured healing, he only lays <b>on</b> <b>hands.</b> The wand is thought to be a symbol of power. The bare-faced youth with the wand may indicate that Jesus was thought of as a user of magic or wonder worker by some of the early Christians. No art has been found picturing Jesus with a wand before the 2nd century. Some scholars suggest that the Gospel of Mark, the Secret Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John (the so-called Signs Gospel), portray such a wonder worker, user of magic, a magician or a Divine man.
