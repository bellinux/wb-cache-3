In September 1945, Pierlot {{was appointed to the}} honorary role of Minister of State by Charles and, shortly after the 1946 election, was awarded the title of Count. Because he was considered an anti-Leopoldist during the crisis surrounding the Royal Question, he was ostracised by the pro-Leopoldist successor to the Catholic Party, the Christian Social Party (Parti social-chrétien or PSC-CVP).|$|E
5|$|For the old Diefenbaker {{was in full}} cry. All {{the agony}} of the {{disintegration}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> was gone, {{and he seemed to}} be a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker's finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam {{refused to}} use the title Leader of the Opposition between the {{dismissal}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> in November 1975 and {{the first meeting of}} the new parliament in February 1976.

5|$|Henry assumed {{formal control}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> in January 1227, {{although}} some contemporaries {{argued that he}} was legally still a minor until his 21st birthday the following year. The King richly rewarded Hubert de Burgh for his service during his minority years, making him the Earl of Kent and giving him extensive lands across England and Wales. Despite coming of age, Henry remained heavily influenced by his advisers {{for the first few}} years of his rule and retained Hubert as his justiciar to run the government, granting him the position for life.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's {{calls to}} forgive {{and forget the}} past was a {{keystone}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>government.</b> He preserved various elements of the old colonial order in his administration, particularly on issues of law and order. The police and military structures were left largely intact. White Kenyans were left in senior positions within the judiciary, civil service, and parliament, with the white Kenyans Bruce Mackenzie and Humphrey Slade being among Kenyatta's top officials.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam {{stepped down}} after losing {{again at the}} 1977 election, and retired from {{parliament}} in 1978. Upon {{the election of the}} Hawke Government in 1983, he was appointed as Ambassador to UNESCO, a position he filled with distinction, and was elected a member of the UNESCO Executive Board. He remained active into his nineties. The circumstances of his dismissal and the legacy <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> remain a large part of Australian political discourse.|$|E

5|$|Williams' {{popularity}} {{is said to}} be unmatched in Canadian political history; his high approval ratings lasted right up until his retirement. Although Williams' premiership was considered quite controversial in Canada at large, except for his first year in office, his own provincial approval ratings and those <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> have been consistently in the seventy to eighty percent range {{for the majority of the}} time he was in office. According to polling organisation Corporate Research Associates (CRA), Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{voted in}} the United Nations condemning the human rights {{violations}} in Cuba, but refused to send military forces to Afghanistan and Iraq. Still, Duhalde proposed to send peacekeeping troops, and strongly criticized the regime of Saddam Hussein and international terrorism. Duhalde increased his criticism of the United States during the final years <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>government,</b> and changed the vote in relation to Cuba to an abstention. Those changes were motivated by the upcoming 2003 elections. Menem, who was running for a third term as president, supported the vote condemning Cuba and the military aid to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Despite being neutral at {{the start}} of World War II, Belgium and its colonial {{possessions}} found themselves at war after the country was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting in which Belgian forces were pushed back into a small pocket in the north-east of the country, the Belgian military surrendered to the Germans, beginning an occupation that would endure until 1944. The surrender of 28 May was ordered by King Leopold III without the consultation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> and sparked a political crisis after the war. Despite the capitulation, many Belgians managed to escape to the United Kingdom where they formed a government and army-in-exile on the Allied side.|$|E

5|$|Dunstan saw {{reform of}} the Legislative Council as an {{important}} goal, and later a prime achievement, <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>Government.</b> Labor, {{as a matter of}} party policy, wanted to see the Legislative Council abolished. Dunstan, seeing this as unfeasible in his term, set about to reform it instead. Two bills were prepared for Legislative Council reform; one to lower the voting age to 18 and introduce universal suffrage, and another to make councillors elected from a single statewide electorate under a system of proportional representation. The LCL initially blocked both bills, stating that it would only accept them if modifications were made to the second one. Changes were conceded; unlike the House of Assembly, voting would not be compulsory and the preference system was to be slightly altered. Once the amendments were made, the legislation was passed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to purges, banishments and censorship, Rosas took measures against {{the opposition and}} anyone else he deemed a threat that historians have considered state terrorism. Terror was a tool used to intimidate dissident voices, to shore up support among his own partisans and to exterminate his foes. His targets were denounced, sometimes inaccurately, as having ties to Unitarians. Those victimised included members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> and party who were suspected of being insufficiently loyal. If actual opponents were not at hand, the regime found other targets that were punished to make an example. A climate of fear was used to create unquestioning conformity to Rosas' dictates.|$|E
5|$|Khánh {{selected}} a cabinet of thirteen ministers and two Secretaries of State at ministerial level, and chose new provincial and district chiefs. He originally tried to include {{members of a}} variety of political and religious groups including representatives of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo sects, who still had remnants of their private armies intact after their defeat by Diệm in 1955. Although Khánh insisted that he had no party affiliation, the orientation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> was toward the Đại Việt, who held many of the key posts in the government. This provoked bitterness from other anti-communist nationalists and groups that were banned under Diệm and were seeking a greater role in public life, as well as from a younger generation who felt that the established nationalist parties were responsible for dividing the people.|$|E

5|$|Morales {{announced}} {{that one of}} the top priorities <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> was to eliminate racism against the country's indigenous population. To do this, he {{announced that}} all civil servants were required to learn one of Bolivia's three indigenous languages, Quechua, Aymara, or Guaraní, within two years. His government encouraged the development of indigenous cultural projects, and sought to encourage more indigenous people to attend university; by 2008, it was estimated that half of the students enrolled in Bolivia's 11 public universities were indigenous, while three indigenous-specific universities had been established, offering subsidized education. In 2009, a Vice Ministry for Decolonization was established, which proceeded to pass the 2010 Law against Racism and Discrimination banning the espousal of racist views in private or public institutions.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 1940, Leopold met senior representatives <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>Government</b> for a {{final time}} at the Kasteel van Wijnendale in West Flanders. The meeting is {{frequently}} cited as {{the start of the}} Royal Question and the moment of the decisive break between King and Government. Four ministers of the Government were present: Hubert Pierlot, Paul-Henri Spaak, Henri Denis and Arthur Vanderpoorten. By the time of the meeting, {{against the backdrop of the}} bloody Battle of the Lys, the Belgian government was preparing to continue the fight against Germany from exile in France. They urged the King to join them, following the examples of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. The King rejected their arguments and hardened his own position. He refused to leave Belgian territory and his army in Flanders at any cost. The ministers suspected that Leopold's aides were already negotiating with the Germans. The meeting broke up with no agreement and the Belgian Government left for France.|$|E

He selected two men as his primary representatives: James D. Bulloch and Lieutenant James H. North of the Confederate States Navy. North was a disappointment, but Bulloch proved to be one of the most effective agents for the Confederacy in Europe. He sought diligently and discreetly in England to acquire ships for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>government</b> while working within or around the framework of the neutrality laws of the host nation.|$|E
