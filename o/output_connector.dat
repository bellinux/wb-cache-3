2500|$|The {{original}} Japanese Famicom {{hardware features}} an RF modulator audio/video <b>output</b> <b>connector,</b> but more Japanese television sets had dropped RF connectors {{in favor of}} higher-quality RCA composite video output by the early 1990s. A revised Famicom (HVC-101 model), often referred to unofficially as the AV Famicom, was released in Japan in 1993, largely to address this problem. It borrowed some design cues from the Super NES. The HVC-101 model replaced the original HVC-001 model's RF modulator with RCA composite cables, eliminated the hardwired controllers, and features a new, more compact case design. Retailing for ¥4,800 to ¥7,200 (equivalent to approximately $42 to $60 USD), the HVC-101 model remained in production {{for almost a decade}} before being finally discontinued in 2003. The case design of the AV Famicom was adopted for a subsequent North American rerelease of the NES. The NES-101 model (sometimes referred to unofficially as the [...] "NES 2", and nicknamed the [...] "top-loading model" [...] or the [...] "Top Loader") differs from the Japanese HVC-101 model in that it omitted the RCA composite output connectors that had been included in the original NES-001 model, and sports only RF output capabilities.|$|E
2500|$|Mad Catz based the Fender Mustang Pro-Guitar MIDI 102-button {{controller}} on {{the actual}} Fender Mustang bass guitar, for the game software's Pro mode, {{as a way for}} 5-button players to have an intermediary step up to a real guitar using a combination of buttons and strings. [...] Instead of five colored buttons, the Mustang has 6 buttons across 17 different frets, for a total of 102 buttons; the player needs to strike the corresponding buttons on the right frets similar to guitar strings. The player uses the [...] "string box" [...] that contains six stainless-steel strings which can detect which strings are being strummed, in place of a [...] "strum bar" [...] from the typical legacy [...] "5 button" [...] controller. Though modeled after a bass guitar which only has 4 strings, Mad Catz gave it 6 strings in order for it to also be used for pro lead guitar play. [...] In addition to Pro mode use, the Mustang can be used to play the game in Basic mode, and it functions as a full MIDI guitar, with a MIDI <b>output</b> <b>connector</b> providing compatibility with MIDI software sequencers and hardware devices. [...] For use in gaming mode, each Mustang controller can only be used with the game console it is designed for (except unofficially if you connect through a MIDI-Pro Adapter, then any console's Mustang can be used with any console for Pro mode game play, although direction pad buttons, overdrive detection and Basic 5-button game play will be disabled). [...] The Mustang Pro-Guitar is only a few inches smaller in length than the actual Mustang bass guitar, and being made of plastic, is much lighter to hold than an actual guitar. The neck is removable from the body for easier storage and transport.|$|E

50|$|A dual-polarized signal thus carries two {{independent}} data streams to a receiving antenna, which can itself be a single-polarized one, for receiving {{only one of}} the two streams at a time, or a dual-polarized model, again relaying its received signal to two single-polarization <b>output</b> <b>connectors</b> (via an OMT if in waveguide).|$|R
50|$|It {{includes}} USB 2.0 ports, a headphone jack, {{and a large}} knob used {{to control}} various settings such as overclocking. The screen tells the user information such as the GPU's clock and memory speeds, fan speeds, temperature, master volume, and FPS.

50|$|The {{controller}} features several <b>output</b> <b>connectors.</b> A stereo {{headphone jack}} supports {{the connection of}} regular earphones or a headset to allow a user to speak and hear audio simultaneously. A micro-USB and extension port, {{as well as a}} mono speaker are also included. The controller can be charged three ways: via micro-USB, a dedicated charging station, or the console, even while powered off.|$|R
50|$|An ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) tuner, {{often called}} an ATSC {{receiver}} or HDTV tuner {{is a type}} of television tuner that allows reception of digital television (DTV) television channels transmitted by television stations in North America, parts of Central America and South Korea that use ATSC standards. Such tuners may be integrated into a television set, VCR, digital video recorder (DVR), or set-top box that provides audio/video <b>output</b> <b>connectors</b> of various types.|$|R
40|$|A {{handheld}} device for rendering the signals produced by individual photons {{is presented in}} this paper. Electric pulses produced by individual photons in a photomultiplier are made audible by a small loudspeaker built into the housing. <b>Output</b> <b>connectors</b> allow the pulse signals to be displayed by an external amplifier/loudspeaker system, an oscilloscope, or to be further processed by pulse counting electronics.

50|$|All {{standard}} guitars {{like the}} J1, J2 and SG models are switchable for mono, stereo and anti-phase-mono operation, wired to a stereo phono <b>output</b> <b>connector.</b> The guitars were standard-supplied with a 25 ft. stereo split cable (1977).|$|E
50|$|A block may {{optionally}} also pass a value (only one!) {{to another}} block. These blocks have colored output connectors. Only if {{the colors of}} the input and the <b>output</b> <b>connector</b> are the same, these blocks can be connected.|$|E
5000|$|Because AWGs {{synthesize}} the waveforms using {{digital signal}} processing techniques, their maximum frequency is usually limited {{to no more than}} a few gigahertz. The <b>output</b> <b>connector</b> from the device is usually a BNC connector and requires a 50 or 75 ohm termination.|$|E
5000|$|The smaller {{capacity}} 256-bit (128 by 2 bits) [...] "production" [...] {{device was}} in a similar vacuum-tube envelope. It was built with two storage arrays of discrete [...] "eyelets" [...] on a rectangular plate, separated by a row of eight cathodes. The pin count was reduced from 44 for the 4096-bit device down to 31 pins and two coaxial signal <b>output</b> <b>connectors.</b> This version included visible green phosphors in each eyeletneeded so that the bit status could also be read by eye.|$|R
50|$|A {{sound card}} mixer is the analog {{part of a}} sound card that routes and mixes sound signals. This circuit {{receives}} inputs from both external connectors and the sound card's digital-to-analog converters. It selects or mutes, amplifies (with variable gain) these signals, adds them together, and finally routes the result to both external <b>output</b> <b>connectors</b> and the sound card's analog-to-digital converters. Different mixing schemes are in use, but the ones implemented in most IBM-PC compatible computers today are variants of a scheme defined in Intel's AC'97 Audio Component Specification.|$|R
50|$|A word clock or wordclock (sometimes sample clock, {{which can}} have a broader meaning) is a clock signal used to {{synchronise}} other devices, such as digital audio tape machines and compact disc players, which interconnect via digital audio. S/PDIF, AES/EBU, ADAT, and TDIF {{are some of the}} formats that use a word clock. Various audio over Ethernet systems use broadcast packets to distribute the word clock. The device which generates the word clock - usually with multiple <b>output</b> <b>connectors</b> - is the only master clock source for all the slave audio devices.|$|R
50|$|AirPlay {{receiver}} devices include AirPort Express (which {{includes a}} combined analog and optical S/PDIF audio <b>output</b> <b>connector),</b> Apple TV, HomePod and other third party speakers. With the open source implementations of the AirPlay protocol any computer {{can now be}} turned into an AirPlay receiver.|$|E
5000|$|Electric guitars. Almost all {{electric}} guitars use a [...] in mono jack (socket) {{as their}} <b>output</b> <b>connector.</b> Some makes (such as Shergold) use a stereo jack instead for stereo output, or a second stereo jack, {{in addition to}} a mono jack (as with Rickenbacker).|$|E
50|$|Multiple tuners {{may also}} be fed from an SCR or Unicable LNB in a single cable {{distribution}} system. A Unicable LNB has one <b>output</b> <b>connector</b> but operates {{in a different way}} to standard LNBs so it can feed multiple tuners daisy-chained along a single coax cable.|$|E
50|$|The Game Boy also {{contains}} optional input and/or <b>output</b> <b>connectors.</b> On {{the left side}} of the system is an external 3.5mm × 1.35mm DC power supply jack that allows users to use an external rechargeable battery pack or AC adapter (sold separately) instead of four AA batteries. The Game Boy requires 6 V DC of at least 150 mA. A 3.5 mm stereo headphone jack is located on the bottom side of the unit which allows users to listen to the audio with the bundled headphones or external speakers.|$|R
50|$|The N1512 model offered {{composite}} video {{input and}} <b>output</b> <b>connectors,</b> but was otherwise {{the same as}} the N1502. The VCR-LP model N1700 was closely related to the later N1502 variant. Other, rarer Philips models included stereo sound and editing capabilities.Circuitry and internal layout was much more modular than the first generation Philips VCRs. Used quiet DC motors (First generation VCR's used hefty synchronous AC mains motors). Basically this model was {{the same as the}} Philips N1502 with an extra board for video in / out. Channel button 8 selected video in.|$|R

5000|$|Professional soundcards {{are usually}} {{described}} as [...] "audio interfaces", and sometimes have {{the form of}} external rack-mountable units using USB, FireWire, or an optical interface, to offer sufficient data rates. The emphasis in these products is, in general, on multiple input and <b>output</b> <b>connectors,</b> direct hardware support for multiple input and output sound channels, as well as higher sampling rates and fidelity {{as compared to the}} usual consumer soundcard. In that respect, their role and intended purpose is more similar to a specialized multi-channel data recorder and real-time audio mixer and processor, roles which are possible only to a limited degree with typical consumer soundcards.|$|R
50|$|The E5000 Ultra was £1500 {{unlike the}} e6400 and had fewer <b>outputs</b> and <b>connectors</b> though {{these could be}} {{addressed}} unlike the previous entry level machine, the e64 (though not the number of voices which remained at 64).|$|R
5000|$|Hobbit {{was also}} briefly marketed in the U.K., {{targeted}} mainly at the existing ZX Spectrum fans willing to lay {{their hands on}} a better computer compatible with the familiar architecture.

Such models always had both the EGA and the TV <b>output</b> <b>connectors</b> operational, {{as well as the}} AY8910 sound chip. Domestic models often did not include either the TV output converter or the internal speaker or both. The AY8910 for the domestic models was sold separately as an external extension module, hanging off the same extension bus as the optional external disk drive.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the block}} {{different}} values can be passed to a block. The type of the value can be identified by the colored compounds (called including »connectors«) of a block. In the chapter »block category« {{you can see the}} different values a block may have. Only if the colors of the input and the <b>output</b> <b>connector</b> match, these blocks can be connected.|$|E
50|$|The {{display adapter}} was {{composed}} of three physical circuit boards (one with the on-board microprocessor, firmware ROMs and video <b>output</b> <b>connector,</b> one providing CGA emulation, and the third mostly carrying RAM) and occupied two adjacent expansion slots on the XT or AT motherboard; the third card was located in between the two slots. The PGC {{could not be used}} in the original IBM PC without modification due to the different spacing of its slots.|$|E
5000|$|Under S2K {{the same}} task is {{separated}} {{out to make}} it easier to understand. The user first creates two separate [...] "sheetlettes" [...] containing one column each, types the input numbers into them, and then connects the two together with the addition function, represented by an icon. The addition icon also has an <b>output</b> <b>connector,</b> and when this is connected to a third sheetlette, the results of the addition appear there automatically. The user could also connect the output to a sheetlette containing a single cell, in which case the addition function would sum all of the cells and display the single result.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{calculus}} of circuits X, as first presented in [13] and studied {{in detail in}} [5]. We will present {{a number of new}} implementations of X using term graph rewriting techniques, which are improvements of the technique used in [6]. We will show that alpha conversion can be dealt with ‘on the fly’, and that explicit copying can be avoided, by presenting, discussing and comparing a number of solutions to these problems. We will define a notion of type assignment on circuits by labelling input and <b>output</b> <b>connectors</b> with types. This notion is then used to define a non-standard notion of type assignment on term graph rewriting. We will show that this system has a principal type property...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of professional audio equipment uses TS jacks {{as the standard}} unbalanced input or <b>output</b> line-level <b>connector.</b> TRS jacks are sometimes used for balanced connections, the latter often alongside (or sometimes in the middle of) and {{as an alternative to}} an XLR balanced line connector.|$|R
