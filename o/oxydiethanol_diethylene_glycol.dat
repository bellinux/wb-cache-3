40|$|Abstract. <b>Diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (DEG) is the {{by-product}} of the hydration of ethylene oxide. With the rapid development of China's ethylene {{industry and the}} increased production of <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> taking {{full advantage of the}} <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> resources to develop downstream products and expanding the use of <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{is becoming more and more}} important. In this paper, we introduce the applications and manufacturing methods of <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> and elaborate the advantages and disadvantages of various methods. Furthermore, we present a new approach to synthesis industrial raw material <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> by ethylene glycol as raw material and ionic liquids as catalyst...|$|R
40|$|Samples of {{preparations}} {{contaminated by}} <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (DEG), <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{raw materials and}} laboratory prepared solutions were measured to get NIR spectra. Then the identification models were developed using the collected spectra and the spectra of distilled water, propylene glycol and the preparations without <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> Besides, the quantification model was also established for determining the concentration of <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> in the preparations. Validation results show the identification and quantification models have ideal prediction performance. The emergency NIR models are rapid, {{easy to use and}} accurate, and can be implemented for identifying <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> raw material, screening the preparations contaminated by <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> in the markets and analyzing the concentrations of DEG...|$|R

50|$|<b>Diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of unsaturated polyester resins, polyurethanes, and plasticizers. DEG is used as a building block in organic synthesis, e.g. of morpholine and 1,4-dioxane. It is a solvent for nitrocellulose, resins, dyes, oils, and other organic compounds. It is a humectant for tobacco, cork, printing ink, and glue. It is also a component in brake fluid, lubricants, wallpaper strippers, artificial fog and haze solutions, and heating/cooking fuel. In personal care products (e.g. skin cream and lotions, deodorants), DEG is often replaced by selected <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> ethers. A dilute solution of <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> can also be used as a cryoprotectant; however, ethylene glycol is much more commonly used. Most ethylene glycol antifreeze contains a few percent <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> present as an byproduct of ethylene glycol production.|$|R
