5|$|Some species build complex nests called polycalic nests; this {{habitat is}} called polycalism. Polycalic species of {{termites}} form multiple nests, or calies, connected by subterranean chambers. The termite genera Apicotermes and Trinervitermes {{are known to}} have polycalic species. Polycalic nests appear to be less frequent in mound-building species although polycalic arboreal nests have been <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few species of Nasutitermes.|$|E

5|$|Aberrations in {{the shape}} of {{operculum}} have been <b>observed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> specimen from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro, a double rib was present, but the rib shield was reduced; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake, only the rib shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by the rib and the rib shield. The rib shield, and consequently a rib pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, a peg, which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes are large and black; the foot is whitish.|$|E
5|$|At 05:30 on 22 May, the Anglo-Egyptian advance continued, but {{the nature}} of the country, which {{consisted}} mainly of rolling low level sand-hills, with plenty of concealed ground and scattered bushes, reduced visibility down to just a few hundred yards. From the start, large groups of Fur camaliers and cavalry were observed. So instead of sending out his scouts Kelly formed an advance guard of the mounted infantry, a camel company and four Maxim machine guns. At 10:30, the Fur troops were <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strong entrenched position around the village of Beringia.|$|E
5|$|Chorioactis geaster has a disjunct distribution, and {{has only}} been {{collected}} from Texas and Japan. The first reported collection in Japan was in Kyushu in 1937, {{and then it was}} not collected again in that location until thirty-six years later. In 2006, it was <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> humid forest near Kawakami, Nara Prefecture. The fungus's natural habitat in Japan is disappearing because of the practice of deforestation and replanting with Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica). This rare mushroom has been put on the list of threatened species in Japan. In Texas, the fungus has been reported in Collin, Hays, Travis, Dallas, Denton, Guadalupe, Tarrant and Hunt counties. Travis, Hays, and Guadalupe counties are in central Texas, while the remainder are clustered together in the northeastern part of the state. Although the species is considered rare due to its globally restricted distribution, it may be locally abundant.|$|E

5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} do {{not provide}} an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can. Lipid bilayers cannot {{be seen in a}} traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different wavelength, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer.|$|E

The identity of the bacterial agent remains unknown. Vitamin E, fluoride, and iodide protect against bone loss associated with this disease in the rice rat and a high-sucrose diet increases the severity of periodontitis.

5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} {{as they were}} in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (<b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded supernova, SN 185, {{was viewed}} by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD. The brightest recorded supernova was SN 1006, which occurred in 1006 AD and {{was described in}} detail by Chinese and Islamic astronomers. The widely observed supernova SN 1054 produced the Crab Nebula. Supernovae SN 1572 and SN 1604, the latest to be observed {{with the naked eye}} in the Milky Way galaxy, had notable effects on the development of astronomy in Europe because they were used to argue against the Aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the Moon and planets was static and unchanging. Johannes Kepler began observing SN 1604 at its peak on October 17, 1604, and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later. It was the second supernova to be <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> generation (after SN 1572 seen by Tycho Brahe in Cassiopeia).|$|E
5|$|The website asserts to its {{visitors}} {{that all}} performers engaged in sexual activities {{depicted in the}} videos appear of their own volition and feel bliss and gratification from the experience. The majority of new entrants to the adult film industry enjoyed their work with Fucking Machines because they discovered it was more socially acceptable to perform with a sexual device, rather than a human partner.

5|$|With maximum {{sustained}} {{winds of}} 215mph (345km/h) and a minimum pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg), Hurricane Patricia is the second-most intense tropical cyclone ever observed, {{just shy of}} Typhoon Tip in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870mbar (hPa; 25.69inHg). It is also the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere. It exceeded the previous sustained wind record of 190mph (305km/h) set by Hurricane Allen in 1980 and the pressure record of 882mbar (hPa; 26.05inHg) set by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, both in the Atlantic basin. In the Eastern Pacific basin, north of the equator and east of the International Dateline, the previous basin record-holder was Hurricane Linda in 1997 with winds of 185mph (295km/h) and a pressure of 902mbar (hPa; 26.64inHg).

5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> natural colony was 102 days old. Queens {{typically}} live 6 {{times longer than}} the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
5|$|At three {{sites on}} Hull Creek, the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) Taxa Richness ranged from 4.00 to 16.00 in a 2013 study. The Total Taxa Richness ranged from 7.00 to 24.00. The Taxa Richness and the EPT Taxa Richness are {{the total number}} of macroinvertebrate taxa <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sample and {{the total number of}} those taxa that are in the three {{aforementioned}} orders, respectively. The Percent Intolerance Index ranged from 2.5% to 53% and the Beck's Index value ranged from 10.00 to 26.00.
