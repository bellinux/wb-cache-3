The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology.

In a cold occlusion, the air mass <b>overtaking</b> the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass <b>overtaking</b> the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel.
