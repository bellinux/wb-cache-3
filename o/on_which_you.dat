25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "And I {{appeared}} to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob," [...] in [...] a Midrash taught that God thus told Moses that God longed {{for those who}} were gone and could not be replaced – the three Patriarchs. The Midrash said that God told Moses that many times, God had revealed God's Self to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty ( [...] , El Shadai), and God had not made known to them that God's name is the Lord ( [...] , the Tetragrammaton). But still they did not criticize God's ways. To Abraham, God said in [...] "Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for to you will I give it," [...] yet when Abraham wanted to bury Sarah, he found no plot of ground until he had purchased one; still, he did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Isaac in [...] "Sojourn in this land [...] [...] [...] for to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands." [...] Yet when Isaac sought water to drink, he found none; instead (as [...] reports), [...] "The herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying: ‘The water is ours.'" [...] Still Isaac did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Jacob in [...] "The land <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed." [...] Yet when he sought a place to pitch his tent, he found none until he purchased one for a hundred kesitah (as reported in [...] ). And still Jacob did not complain at God's ways. The Patriarchs did not ask God, as Moses did in [...] what God's name was. In contrast, at the commencement of God's commission of Moses, Moses inquired of God's name. And in [...] Moses told God, [...] "For since I came to Pharaoh [...] [...] [...] he has dealt ill with this people; neither have You delivered Your people." [...] On this account, the Midrash taught, God said in [...] "And I have also established my covenant with them," [...] the Patriarchs, to give them the land, and they never complained of God's ways. And God said in [...] "I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel," [...] because they did not complain against God. Although the Israelites of that generation did not conduct themselves righteously, yet God heard their cry on account of the covenant that God had made with the Patriarchs. Hence, it says in [...] "And I have remembered My covenant. Therefore, say to the children of Israel." [...] The Midrash taught that the word [...] "therefore" [...] ( [...] , lachein) in [...] implies an oath, as it does in [...] where God says, [...] "And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli." [...] Thus, the Midrash taught that God swore to Moses that God would redeem the Israelites, so that Moses would have no reason to fear that the Attribute of Justice would retard their redemption.|$|E
