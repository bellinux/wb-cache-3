5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the entire map is obscured until explored by the player. The map consists of a landlocked sea with several islands, wreckage, sea creatures, enemy ships, ports, and whirlpools. The player can sometimes encounter message bottles that clear away fog of war <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> to reveal hidden ports.Sea creatures and enemy ships appear randomly and challenge the player for gold or commodities in a card minigame. Ports are trading and safe zones where the player can sell commodities, buy upgrades for the ship, and take on sidequests. Whirlpools teleport the player's ship to a random location <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, a wave of Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} (in the appearance of Balkenkreuz sprites <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map)</b> will cross the English Channel and proceed to bomb various cities, air bases and radar installations. In response, RAF squadrons are automatically scrambled and will await orders to either engage invading Luftwaffe fighters or to defend key cities from bombers. When a RAF squadron has successfully engaged a Luftwaffe unit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> the game will shift to a first-person shooter perspective, in which the point of view is portrayed from a cockpit of either a Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109, depending on the side chosen. During the dogfight sequence, the number of Luftwaffe casualties will depend on how many aircraft the player was able to shoot down.|$|E

5|$|It {{was also}} {{important}} for time to be standardized across time zones so that the information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> should accurately represent the weather at a given time.

Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear how big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong Country uses {{a series}} of map screens to track the players' progress. Between each level, players control their {{character}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> screen, navigating {{to the next level}} they want to play. Each level <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> is marked with an icon: unfinished levels are marked by Kremlings (the game's main enemy), while friendly areas are marked by members of the Kong family. Every individual world map screen has one boss enemy {{at the end of the}} course, which must be defeated to travel back to the main map screen of the whole island. It is possible to access previous world maps without defeating the boss by finding Funky Kong and borrowing his barrel plane. Players use this ability to select the world from the main screen, then the level within it. During play the game interface hides most game-related information, such as the number of bananas, letters, and animal tokens collected, as well as the number of lives remaining. When an item is collected, the relevant information briefly appears on the screen.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the iron}} or steel {{included}} in the bridges and the water tower, the structures are built in brick or stone. The stone is almost invariably red sandstone, obtained from local quarries in the Runcorn, Weston, and Halton areas. Unless stated otherwise, the buildings (except the bridges and the water tower) are constructed in local red sandstone with slate roofs. Their locations can be found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> of all coordinates.|$|E

5|$|In Oracle of Ages, {{the central}} item is the Harp of Ages, which Link uses to {{manipulate}} time and travel between {{the past and}} the present. In the course of the game, Link learns three tunes to play on the harp. The Tune of Echoes activates Time Portals at fixed locations; the Tune of Currents enables Link to travel from the past to the present without a Time Portal; the Tune of Ages allows Link to switch between the two time periods at almost any location <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the USA, The Smithsonian Institution {{developed}} {{its network}} of observers {{over much of}} the central and eastern United States between the 1840s and 1860s once Joseph Henry took the helm. The U.S. Army Signal Corps inherited this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress, and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards. At first, not all the data <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> was used {{due to a lack of}} time standardization. The United States fully adopted time zones in 1905, when Detroit finally established standard time.|$|E
5|$|Pegasus Bridge {{features}} ten {{different types}} of terrain, which affect {{the movement of the}} troops and the defensibility of certain areas. If units are situated in towns or woodland areas, their attacks will be less effective. High wind speeds will also render British parachuting troops temporarily ineffective. Units <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> are presented as small squares and can be stacked together to increase defence. While British forces may destroy various bridges throughout the game, certain bridges such as those over the Caen Canal and Orne river must be preserved in order to win the game.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of {{the game}} were {{generally}} positive. Critics focused primarily on the visuals, music and atmosphere as particularly praiseworthy. Additional positive comments were made about the controls and gameplay, while critiques centered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> system and a limited variety of objectives. The game won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize from the Independent Games Festival in March 2007.|$|E
5|$|Slither.io is a massively {{multiplayer}} browser game {{developed by}} Steve Howse. Players control an avatar resembling a snake, which consumes multicolored pellets, both from other players and ones that naturally spawn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> in the game, {{to grow in}} size. The objective {{of the game is}} to grow the longest snake in the server. Slither.io is similar in concept to the popular 2015 web game Agar.io and is reminiscent of the classic arcade game Snake.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Reserve publishes data on {{premature}} death rates by county, {{defined as those}} dying below age 74. According to the Kaiser Foundation, expanding Medicaid in the remaining 19 states would cover up to 4.5 million persons. Since expanding Medicaid expands coverage and expanding coverage reduces mortality, therefore expanding Medicaid reduces mortality by syllogism. Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Missouri and South Carolina, indicated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> at right as having many counties with high premature mortality rates could therefore reduce mortality by expanding Medicaid, other things equal.|$|E

5|$|The Great Salt Lake entered written European history {{through the}} records of Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, who learned of its {{existence}} from the Timpanogos Utes in 1776. No European name was given to it at the time, {{and it was not}} shown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> by Bernardo Miera y Pacheco, the cartographer for the expedition. In 1824, it was observed, apparently independently, by Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost. Shortly thereafter other trappers saw it and walked around it.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{dates of}} {{construction}} of the barn, gas station, and bunkhouse are unknown, but the American Craftsman style of architecture indicates it was between 1910 to 1916, when this was popular.

5|$|Additional game modes are {{available}} to the player in The Age of Kings. One mode, random map, generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for {{a certain amount of}} time, or by obtaining control of all relics <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> for a set amount of time. Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the regicide mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing all of the other monarchs.|$|E
