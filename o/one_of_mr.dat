500|$|Another 1901 piece led to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dooley's {{most famous}} quotations. A number of {{lawsuits}} {{brought in the}} wake of the 1898 war dealt with the issue of whether the Constitution applied with full force in the former Spanish colonies annexed by the United States, none of which had been granted an organized government by Congress. This question was known as whether the Constitution follows the flag. In 1901, the United States Supreme Court decided these lawsuits, known as the Insular Cases. The justices' written opinions were difficult to understand, and the court deeply divided, but the net effect was to hold that the Constitution did not follow the flag. The decisions gave Mr. Dooley an opportunity to puncture the court's ivory-tower reputation, [...] "no matter whether the constitution follows the flag or not, the Supreme Court follows the election returns". The phrase has often been quoted, sometimes by people who have never heard of Mr. Dooley.|$|E

500|$|The Blackstone was {{managed by}} Harry J.

[...] The Blackstone's first productions featured some of that era's best known performers and playwrights—for example, after [...] "U.S. Minister Bedloe" [...] came a David Belasco production, [...] "The Return of Peter Grimm", starring David Warfield. [...] Many of the productions had already been well received in New York before coming to the Blackstone, such as another play that featured comic actor William H. Crane, [...] "The Senator Keeps House." [...] But while some of these productions were the equal of the version that played in New York, Tribune theatre critic Hammond observed on several occasions that the Chicago companies lacked the biggest stars. Despite this, the touring companies that performed at the Blackstone tended {{to do a good job}} and Hammond praised them for their [...] "effective" [...] productions. This trend of presenting touring company versions would continue in later years, when most of the performances at the Blackstone were plays which had already won the Pulitzer Prize or the Tony Award, and were presented by touring companies from New York.|$|E
500|$|Episode 2 [...] Part Two: A sycophantic clergyman named Mr. William Collins visits his cousins, the Bennets. He is the entailed heir {{of their}} home and estate, Longbourn, and intends to marry <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bennet's daughters. This is meant, on his part, {{as an act of}} benign {{goodwill}} towards the Bennets, because Mrs. Bennet and her unwed daughters will be rendered homeless once Mr. Bennet dies and Mr. Collins inherits the estate. He therefore invites himself for a two-week visit, {{to get to know the}} Bennets better and select a wife from among the daughters of the family. However, the Bennet girls judge Mr. Collins to be a rather ridiculous man, an [...] "oddity" [...] with many peculiarities of speech and deportment. They are nevertheless civil to him, and take him to balls and social events in Meryton. One day, while on a walk around Meryton village, they meet members of a newly arrived militia, including a Mr George Wickham. At a social event, Wickham befriends Elizabeth and tells her that Darcy, who is the son of Wickham's late father's employer, has denied Wickham a living (a curacy) which had been assured to him by Mr. Darcy's father. At another social event, Darcy surprises Elizabeth with a dance offer at a ball at Netherfield, which she grudgingly but politely accepts. Mr Collins proposes to Elizabeth the next day, but she resoundingly rejects him. While Mrs Bennet disagrees about Elizabeth's decision, her close friend Charlotte Lucas invites Mr Collins to stay at Lucas Lodge.|$|E

2500|$|When a [...] bombing {{took place}} in central {{district}} of Nijrab killed four French soldiers on June 2012, within France the bombing resonated deeply: while President Hollande had before indicated that he might keep some French troops {{in the country to}} help with the training mission, he later announced a full withdrawal by July.

[...] The field judge Beacham did not see Pattengill call for the fair catch and did not call interference. [...] Michigan protested, but the protest was overruled.
