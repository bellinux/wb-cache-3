5|$|Barcelona {{kicked the}} match off, but Manchester United showed their intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward and {{went out for a}} goal kick.|$|E
5|$|General Archibald Wavell—the {{commander-in-chief}} of the British Middle East Command—conceived Operation Brevity as a rapid blow in the Sollum area. Wavell {{intended to}} create advantageous conditions {{from which to}} launch Operation Battleaxe, the main offensive that he was planning for June. Operation Brevity's primary objectives were to recapture the Halfaya Pass, to drive the enemy from the Sollum and Capuzzo areas, and to deplete Rommel's forces. A secondary objective was to advance toward Tobruk, although <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as supplies would allow, and without risking the force committed to the operation.|$|E

The remains were found to be of a 30 year-old woman who grew up in East Sussex, but had genetic heritage from sub-Saharan Africa, giving her black skin and an African skeletal structure.

5|$|The Confederate {{government}} of Kentucky was a shadow government {{established for the}} Commonwealth of Kentucky by a self-constituted group of Confederate sympathizers during the American Civil War. The shadow government never replaced the elected government in Frankfort, which had strong Union sympathies. Neither was it able to gain the whole support of Kentucky's citizens; its jurisdiction extended <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Confederate battle lines in the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, the provisional government was recognized by the Confederate States of America, and Kentucky {{was admitted to the}} Confederacy on December 10, 1861. Kentucky was represented by the central star on the Confederate battle flag.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{insisted that}} its {{purchase}} also included most of West Florida {{and all of}} Texas. Thomas Jefferson claimed that Louisiana stretched west to the Rocky Mountains and included the entire watershed of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and their tributaries, and that the southern border was the Rio Grande.

5|$|The species's range may be relictual in nature: while Oryzomys is {{currently}} found {{along the eastern}} coast of the Gulf of California <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> north as coastal southern Sonora, the past distribution of the genus may have extended further northward, perhaps even into the southwestern United States, and from there south into Baja California. Subsequent disappearance of Oryzomys from the northern regions would have led to its observed disjunct distribution, with O.peninsulae isolated on the peninsula. This possibility {{is supported by the}} relatively close resemblance between O.peninsulae and O.couesi mexicanus, from coastal western Mexico.|$|E
5|$|To limit {{development}} costs, {{the program}} shared engine development with the North American XB-70 Valkyrie strategic bomber program, {{and used a}} number of elements of earlier interceptor projects. The program had progressed <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as {{the construction of a}} single wooden mockup when it was cancelled in 1959, due to a shortage of funds and the Soviets' adoption of ballistic missiles as their primary means of nuclear attack. Had it flown, the F-108 would have been the heaviest fighter of its era.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the suburbs of the left bank were the quickest growing areas of Rouen, in {{particular}} the communes of Sotteville (a large railway town) and Grand-Quevilly, but these towns did not have good enough public transport. Although the CTR had constructed some lines, they did not well serve residents wishing for rapid transit between the suburbs and the city centre. Line 4 of the CTR, with its central terminus at Place Beauvoisine, ran <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as the Trianon roundabout {{at the edge of the}} Jardin des Plantes. A southern extension was planned to the Bruyères roundabout, a meeting-point of several roads to the new districts, and to the racecourse where major horse racing events took place each Thursday. But it was always delayed.|$|E
5|$|Despite his meager {{political}} experience—having previously {{served only}} {{three years in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives—Johnson labored vehemently to ensure the success of the shadow government. Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861, but the shadow government's influence in the Commonwealth extended <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as the Confederate Army advanced. When Albert Sidney Johnston abandoned the Confederate capital of Bowling Green, Governor Johnson and the other government officials accompanied him. Despite his advanced age and a crippled arm, Johnson volunteered for military service in General Johnston's army. Johnson was killed at the Battle of Shiloh, making him the only state governor, Union or Confederate, to fall in battle during the Civil War. He was succeeded by Richard Hawes, the second and last governor of Confederate Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to assert the {{legitimacy}} of the fledgling government, but to no avail. Its jurisdiction extended <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as the area controlled by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, back at Cape Evans, the Terra Nova {{arrived at}} the {{beginning}} of February, and Atkinson decided to unload the supplies from the ship with his own men rather than set out south with the dogs to meet Scott as ordered. When Atkinson belatedly left for the planned rendezvous with Scott, he encountered the scurvy-ridden Edward ("Teddy") Evans who needed urgent medical attention. Atkinson therefore tried to send the experienced navigator Wright south to meet Scott, but chief meteorologist Simpson declared he needed Wright for scientific work. Atkinson then decided to send the short-sighted Cherry-Garrard on 25 February, who was not able to navigate, <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as One Ton depot (which is within sight of Mount Erebus), effectively cancelling Scott's orders for meeting him at latitude 82 or 82.30 on 1 March.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the match, Lauren {{committed}} several fouls on Ronaldo, and {{confronted the}} Portuguese winger {{early in the}} second half, before finally being booked for persistent fouling in the 62nd minute. Ronaldo took the free kick himself but put it just over the bar from 30 yards. In the 64th minute, Arsenal were awarded a free kick for an O'Shea foul on Reyes; Bergkamp took the kick, which was headed away by Ferdinand, but <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Pirès, whose side-footed volley went over the bar. The free kick was to be Bergkamp's last contribution to the final, as he was then substituted by Ljungberg in the 65th minute.|$|E

Two minutes later Cardiff {{had a chance to}} extend their lead; Whittingham went past Agger and passed to Don Cowie, who back heeled the ball to Miller, his subsequent shot went wide of the Liverpool goal. Henderson received the first yellow card of the match after his tackle on Mason was deemed to be too high. Cardiff had another chance in the 56th minute; a Gunnarsson long throw was punched away by Reina, but the clearance fell to Hudson, who headed the ball into the Liverpool penalty area to Gestede, his subsequent header was blocked by the Liverpool goalkeeper. Liverpool made the first substitution of the match a minute later when Henderson was replaced by Craig Bellamy. Two minutes after the substitution, Liverpool equalised. Downing took a corner kick, which was headed on by Carroll to Suárez, whose header hit the post, it rebounded to Škrtel; his shot went into the Cardiff goal to level the match at 1–1. Cardiff {{had the first}} chance after Liverpool's goal, but Mason's shot was saved by Reina.|$|E

To the south was the US 24th Infantry Regiment and west of Chindong-ni, the 5th Regimental Combat Team was on the {{division}}'s left flank. On division orders, the 5th Regimental Combat Team first held the ground above the Chindong-ni coastal road <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Yaban-san. Kean soon decided, however, that the 5th RCT should close the gap northward between it and the 24th Infantry. When the 5th sent a South Korean unit of 100 men under American officers to the higher slope of Sobuk-san, North Korean troops already there drove them back. Kean then ordered the 5th RCT to take this ground, but it was too late.|$|E
5|$|The Chesham {{branch is}} a {{single-track}} railway branch line in Buckinghamshire, England, {{owned and operated}} by the London Underground. It runs from a junction at Chalfont & Latimer station on the Metropolitan line for 3.89miles (6.26km) northwest to Chesham. The line was built as part of Edward Watkin's scheme to turn his Metropolitan Railway (MR) into a direct rail route between London and Manchester, and it was envisaged initially that a station outside Chesham would be an intermediate stop on a through route running north to connect with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Deteriorating relations between the MR and LNWR led to the MR instead expanding to the northwest via Aylesbury, and the scheme to connect with the LNWR was abandoned. By this time much of the land needed for the section of line as far as Chesham had been bought. As Chesham was at the time the only significant town near the MR's new route, it was decided to build the route <b>only</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Chesham, and to complete the connection with the LNWR at a future date if it proved desirable. Local residents were unhappy at the proposed station site outside Chesham, and a public subscription raised the necessary additional funds to extend the railway into the centre of the town. The Chesham branch opened in 1889.|$|E
