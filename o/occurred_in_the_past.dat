5|$|Although Mars has no {{evidence}} of a structured global magnetic field, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field have <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.|$|E
5|$|Both {{hunting and}} egging {{continue}} today, although {{not at the}} levels that <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> and generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have done for centuries, using traditional methods (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, {{giving rise to}} many impacts {{over a period of}} a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> This scenario may have occurred on Earth {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart.|$|E

5|$|The {{conjunction}} of several planets which Brad Dourif's character Dennis Hoffman speaks about was reliably predicted {{at the time}} of the episode's broadcast. The effects of such an alignment had been debated for some time, with studies both linking conjunction to several major earthquakes and debunking the theory entirely. Several similar alignments have <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> without resulting in any additional natural activity on Earth. The predicted conjunction did occur in May 2000, with no consequence on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Shooting for {{the film}} was {{conducted}} in Kota, Jakarta, and Semarang, Central Java, {{over a period of}} one month. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that the most difficult scenes to shoot were those which happened in modern times, especially the riots; for set design, however, Indra Tamoron Musu found those that <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> to be the most difficult, owing to the research necessary. The scenes at the house were shot separately; those occurring in 1998 were shot first and those occurring in the past were shot after the crew had spent a week renovating the house. Hasiholan later recalled that Soeriaatmadja was a controlling director who told the actors exactly what he wanted in a clear manner. However, cinematographer Ical Tanjung said that Soeriaatmadja was still open to feedback from the cast and crew. Editing, which was done by Waluyo Ichwandiardono, took another three months.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is typical of past volcanism elsewhere in the Garibaldi Belt. Large earthquakes would occur under the volcanic field weeks to years in advance as molten rock intrudes through the Earth's rocky lithosphere. The extent of earthquakes and the local seismographs in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and possibly cause an upgrade in monitoring. While molten rock breaks through the crust, {{the size of the}} volcano vulnerable to an eruption would probably swell and the area would rupture, creating much more hydrothermal activity at the regional hot springs and the formation of new springs or fumaroles. Small and probably significant rock avalanches may result and could dam the nearby Squamish River for a limited amount of time, such as those that <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> without seismic activity and deformation related to magmatic activity. At some point the subsurface magma will produce phreatic eruptions and lahars. At this time Highway 99 would be out of service and the residents of Squamish would have to travel away from the eruptive zone.|$|E

There have been at least five identified Holocene eruptions with a VEI of 7. There are also 58 plinian eruptions, and 13 caldera-forming eruptions, of large, but unknown magnitudes.

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to characterize the historic food web of the San Francisco Estuary because of the dramatic changes in geography, hydrology, and species composition that have <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> century. However, monitoring begun in the 1970s gives some information about the historic dynamics of the foodweb. Prior to the 1980s the LSZ was dominated by a phytoplankton-driven foodweb, a stable mesoplankton population dominated by the copepod Eurytemora affinis, and large macrozooplankton typified by San Francisco bay shrimp and mysid shrimps. These provided nutrition and energy to native filter feeders such as the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), and planktivores such as delta smelt and juvenile salmon.|$|E

25|$|Explosive eruptions and ash falls are {{the major}} threat to humans from Lascar.

Such ash falls could potentially affect the towns of San Pedro de Atacama, Talabre and Toconao {{as well as the}} Llano de Chajnantor Observatory and the San Pedro de Atacama–Paso de Jama–Jujuy international road. Past eruptions caused ash fall in Argentina and disruption of air travel.

25|$|Several {{incidents}} have <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> {{involving the}} base. In 1999, two drunken soldiers, Denis Popov and Alexander Kamenev, armed with AK-74 assault rifles, went into Gyumri {{and started a}} gunfire, killing two men, Vaghinak Simonyan and David Soghomonyan, and injuring 14. The two men were tried in Armenia; Popov was sentenced to 14 {{years in prison and}} Kamenev to 15. Whether or not the two served their entire terms in Armenia is unclear and little is known about this court’s investigation and punishment. In an interview published on January 16 with News.am, Popov’s lawyer, Tamara Yailoyan, claimed that her former client had been transferred to Russia “after two to three years,” and, “we later learned, set free.” In 2013, two children were killed by a mine on the training field {{in the vicinity of the}} military base.
