40|$|The study {{concentrates}} {{on the effects of}} structural parameters of an electronic fuel injector on its dynamic response (the opening delay and the closing delay). The injector was developed for a marine medium-speed diesel engine. The dynamic response {{from the start of the}} control signal to the end of the needle valve closing were investigated. Firstly, a complete and detailed model of the electronic fuel injector was built and integrated into an optimisation model, where a MOGA was applied. Secondly, the importance and effects of main structural parameters on dynamic response were examined, as were their interactions. Finally, a Pareto optimum was obtained through scattering charts and comparisons were made between the baseline design and the optimal design. Results show that the control piston diameter, fuel <b>oil</b> <b>inlet</b> passage diameter, fuel oil outlet passage diameter and their interactions are influential factors to the opening delay, while the fuel <b>oil</b> <b>inlet</b> passage diameter has the dominant effect on the closing delay.

50|$|Since all pumps require {{well-developed}} {{inlet flow}} {{to meet their}} potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the <b>inlet</b> <b>flange.</b> When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller.

Unbalance tests consisted of applying a midspan unbalance. Effects of <b>oil</b> <b>inlet</b> flowrate and <b>oil</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature are examined. The measured peak responses are compared to the theoretical in five measurement planes. Stability tests consisted of running the balanced rotor up in speed to provide a high flexibility ration and reduced logarithmic decrement.

Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations with FLUENT software are carried out to investigate the temperature field. And effects of <b>oil</b> <b>inlet</b> rate, <b>oil</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature, and erosion reduced thickness are examined. The presence of erosion pit brings about the obvious fluctuation of temperature drop along the extrados of bend. And the minimum temperature drop presents at the most severe erosion point. Small inlet temperature or large inlet velocity can lead to small temperature drop, while shallow erosion pit causes great temperature drop. The dimensionless minimum temperature drop is analyzed and the fitting formula is obtained. Using the formula we can calculate the erosion reduced thickness, which is only needed to monitor the outer surface temperature of bend pipe.

Fires were also ignited using the rub mechanism with the only test lubricant evaluated, Esso 4040. Major parameters controlling ignitions were: Sump configuration; Bearing and oil temperatures, hot air temperature and flow and bearing speed.

An analytical study was performed to determine the effect of various parameters on the generation rate of oil vapor from oil droplets in a hot air stream flowing in a cylindrical tube.

The experimental investigation demonstrated that fires would be ignited by a spark ignitor over the full range of air and oil flow rates and air temperatures evaluated. However, no fires could be ignited when the <b>oil</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature was maintained below 41. 7 K (290 F). The severity of the fires ignited were found to be directly proportional to the hot air flow rate. Reasonably good correlation was found between the mixture temperature in the sump at the ignitor location and the flammability limits as defined by flammability theory; thus a fairly reliable experimental method of determining flammable conditions within a sump was demonstrated.

40|$|Flow boiling in mini-channels {{has been}} the most recent trend in high {{performance}} cooling techniques, in spite of an increased pressure drop. An experimental study of pressure and heat transfer characteristics of water in mini-channel evaporators was carried out in this study. The test section consisted of 6, U-shape, parallel, mini-channels. The mini-channels were formed by brazing an etched, flat, stainless steel plate. The hydraulic diameter of a single mini-channel was 0. 725 mm. Distilled water, used as the fluid medium, flowed in the mini-channels; while the heating oil flowed on the outside of mini-channel. The inlet temperature of the water was maintained at room temperature and the outlet pressure was ambient pressure. The mass flux was in the range of 87. 36 kg/m~ s to 656. 75 kg/m 2 In order to enhance the heat transfer of the oil side, offset-strip fins were applied on the stainless steel surface of the oil side channel. Parafherm heat transfer oil, the fluid medium, was used on the <b>oil</b> side. The <b>inlet</b> temperature of the oil channel was varied through a range of 100 C to 275 C. The heat transfer and pressure drop results were obtained as a function of water flow rate and <b>inlet</b> <b>oil</b> temperature. The results indicate that the heat transfer coefficient on the water side was a function of the water mass flow rate, the outlet steam quality, and the <b>oil</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature. The pressure drop of the water side increased with decreasing <b>oil</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature and increasing water mass flow rate in the single-phase flow region. In the two-phase flow region, the pressure drop behavior was more complex since a higher water mass flow resulted in a lower average quality in the evaporator. The vapor generation phenomena associated with boiling and the resultant two-phase flow gives the pressure drop and heat transfer 2 - 10 fold. The study of two-phase heat transfer visualization gives more detail of the mechanism of two-phase flow and heat transfer. The capillary phenomena play a very important role in the small size channel.

Inner- and outer-race cooling-correlation curves were obtained for the turbojet-engine turbine-roller bearing with the same inner- and outer-race correlation parameters and exponents as those determined for the laboratory test-rig bearing.

In-depth temperature measurements were made across the face width and at the axial end of the gear mesh. Supply power measurements were made at varying speeds and loads up to 5000 hp and 15000 rpm (pitch line velocity to 24000 feet per minute). Test results from the parametric studies and the superfinishing process are presented. The tests indicated that superfinishing offered no improvement in performance due to the high lubricant film thickness generated by the extremely high pitch line velocity {{that the majority of}} the tests were conducted. Increasing lubricant inlet temperature had the most dramatic effect on performance improvement...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} on a V- 1650 - 7 engine to determine the cylinder temperatures and the coolant and oil heat rejections over a range of coolant flows (50 to 200 gal/min) and <b>oil</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures (160 to 2150 F) for two values of coolant outlet temperature (250 deg and 275 F) at each of four power conditions ranging from approximately 1100 to 2000 brake horsepower. Data were obtained for several values of block-outlet pressure {{at each of the}} two coolant outlet temperatures. A mixture of 30 percent by volume of ethylene glycol and 70 -percent water was used as the coolant. The effect of varying coolant flow, coolant outlet temperature, and coolant outlet pressure over the ranges investigated on cylinder-head temperatures was small (0 deg to 25 F) whereas the effect of increasing the engine power condition from ll 00 to 2000 brake horsepower was large (maximum head-temperature increase, 110 F) ...|$|R
