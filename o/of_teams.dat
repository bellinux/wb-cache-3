5|$|Despite heavy loss of form, {{which also}} saw the team fall outside the top ten in the FIFA rankings, Croatia {{were placed in the}} top tier <b>of</b> <b>teams</b> for the UEFA Euro 2012 {{qualifying}} draw; Croatia was previously a candidate to co-host the tournament with Hungary which would have allowed the team to qualify automatically, but UEFA eventually chose Poland and Ukraine as hosts instead. Despite being top-seeds in their qualifying group, Croatia finished second behind Greece, settling for a play-off against Euro 2008 rivals Turkey. Croatia proceeded to beat Turkey 3–0 on aggregate, with all three goals coming in the away leg in Istanbul, thereby qualifying for the 2012 European championship. In the proceeding group-stage draw for the tournament, Croatia were placed in the third tier <b>of</b> <b>teams,</b> and were eventually grouped with Ireland, Italy and defending champions Spain.|$|E

5|$|From 1958, the Danish {{championship}} {{was arranged}} through one calendar year, and the 1956–57 season lasted 18 months with the teams playing each other thrice for a 27 games total. From 1958 to 1974, the tournament was expanded to 12 teams, playing each other twice for 22 games per season each, {{but now the}} bottom two teams faced relegation. The number <b>of</b> <b>teams</b> was increased to 16 for the 1975 season, which resulted in 30 games per season.

5|$|In January 2009 the International Baseball Federation {{created a}} ranking {{system so that}} the nations {{involved}} in international competition could be compared independently. Teams receive points based on the position they finish {{at the end of}} tournaments. The system takes into account results not only of the senior men's teams but also of junior teams. Weightings that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are based on the number <b>of</b> <b>teams</b> competing, the number of continents represented (or eligible to be represented), {{and in the case of}} continental tournaments such as the Oceania Baseball Championship the relative strength <b>of</b> <b>teams</b> eligible. Only results within the previous four years are used, so points are added and removed over time. Since the system began, the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process; the most recent was the 2009 Baseball World Cup.|$|E

5|$|American {{football}} {{was introduced to}} the United Kingdom during {{the early part of the}} 20th century by American servicemen stationed in the country. The first recorded match took place on 23 November 1910 at Crystal Palace, London, where a team made up of the crew from USS Idaho defeated their counterparts from USS Vermont 19–0. During the Second World War, matches were played by American and Canadian servicemen stationed in the UK at venues throughout the country. This included the 'Tea Bowl' game played at the White City Stadium in 1944, and this was followed by the creation of the United States Armed Forces Europe (USAFE) league in 1946. This league consisted <b>of</b> <b>teams</b> from American military bases throughout Europe, with one of the league's three conferences made up <b>of</b> <b>teams</b> based in the UK – teams from this conference won the league championship thirteen times until the competition ceased in 1993.|$|E

Brown, by contrast, hired a full-time staff of assistants, tested his players on their intelligence and their knowledge of plays, instituted strict organization of practices and analyzed game film to get an edge on opponents. Brown created a detailed system for scouting college talent as a means to improve the Browns' college draft.|$|E
