For EEG and MEG, the former orresponds to the simultaneously separated and temporally over-lapping signals for ontinuous non-averaged data; the latter orresponds to the set of attenuations from the sour es to the sensors. These sensor proje tion ve-tors give information on the spatial lo ations of the sour es. Here we use standard Neuromag dipole-tting software to lo alize BSS-separated omponents of MEG data olle ted in several tasks in whi h visual, audi-tory, and somatosensory stimuli all play a role. We found that BSS-separated omponents with stimulus-or motor-lo ked responses an be lo alized to physio-logi al and anatomi ally meaningful lo ations within the brain. 1...|$|R

These systems demand multiple simultaneous quality of servi e (QoS) properties. A key enabler in re ent su esses {{in the development}} of su h systems has been middleware, whi h omprises reusable building blo ks. Typi ally, a large number of onguration options are available for ea h building blo k when <b>omposing</b> <b>a</b> system end-to-end.

Currently, the effe t of these hoi es an be determined only very late in the life y le, whi h an be detrimental to system development osts and s hedules. In order to enable the right design hoi es, a systemati methodology to analyze the performan e of these systems at design time is ne essary.
