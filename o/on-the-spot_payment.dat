25|$|The {{club has}} always been noted for its wealthy members, grand banquets and boisterous rituals, such as vandalising ('trashing') of {{restaurants}} and college rooms, complemented by a tradition of <b>on-the-spot</b> <b>payment</b> for damage. Its ostentatious display of wealth attracts controversy, since many ex-members have moved up to high political posts, most notably former British Prime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. A number of episodes over many decades have provided anecdotal evidence of the Club's behaviour. Infamously on 12 May 1894, after dinner, Bullingdon members smashed almost all {{the glass of the}} lights and 468 windows in Peckwater Quad of Christ Church, along with the blinds and doors of the building, and again on 20 February 1927. As a result, the Club was banned from meeting within 15 miles of Oxford.|$|E
