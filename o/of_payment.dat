5|$|Physicians: There are {{multiple}} aspects as to why, financially, hospice care {{may be difficult}} to access. The first would relate to physician reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in hospice, the patient transitions from their primary insurance to having most of their care managed directly by the hospice. As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by the hospice. Additionally, reimbursement for physician visits can be complicated and result in non-payment to physicians. Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> for visits can be reasons for non-referral from a physician.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{macroeconomic}} {{determinants of}} the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> in Namibia for the period 1999 to 2009. The investigation was conducted through cointegrated vector autoregression methods. The investigation reveals that fiscal balance, GDP and interest rate are the main determinants <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> in Namibia. Increase in GDP and interest rate causes an improvement in the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> The positive effect of GDP on balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> suggests that expansion of export has {{a positive impact on}} current account and the overall balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> More increased export potential through the development of new products and services should be encouraged. The positive impact of interest rate on balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> suggests that interest rate {{can be used as a}} policy tool to ensure favourable capital account and for improved balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> An improvement in the fiscal balance is also associated with an improvement in the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> This implies that policymakers need to assess the forecast of SACU receipts in order to ensure readiness proactively when these receipts decline to avoid a possible macroeconomic, fiscal and balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> instability. </p...|$|R

5|$|In 1198, Pope Innocent III {{broached}} {{the subject of}} a new crusade through legates and encyclical letters. The stated intent of the crusade was to conquer Egypt, now the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army that arrived at Venice in the summer of 1202 was somewhat smaller than had been anticipated, and there were not sufficient funds to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the ageing and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> they assist the Venetians in the capture of the (Christian) port of Zara in Dalmatia (vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186). The city fell in November 1202 after a brief siege. Innocent tried to forbid this political attack on a Christian city, but was ignored. Reluctant to jeopardise his own agenda for the Crusade, he gave conditional absolution to the crusaders—not, however, to the Venetians.|$|E

Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win {{public support for the}} agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.|$|E

An appeal based on jury-tampering and judicial misconduct issues {{was rejected by the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August 1989.

The appeal was denied, though Nickell and her team continue to assert her innocence. She claimed that her daughter Cynthia lied about Nickell's involvement in the case in order to reap the $300,000 of reward money being offered. Cynthia Hamilton eventually collected $250,000 of that money. Nickell also alleges, among other things, that the evidence actually points to another person as the killer, and that the testimony about various smaller details in the case, such as the store owner who testified about her having purchased Algae Destroyer, was influenced by promises <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|E

The soldiers in Florida praised the new weapon, but the unusual hammerless design, sixty years ahead of its time, led to difficulty in training men who were used to exposed-hammer guns.

Colt soon reworked his design to leave the firing hammer exposed, but problems continued.
