5|$|In La Paz, a {{town that}} at that time had a {{population}} of approximately85,000, 20,000were left homeless (nearly {{one third of the}} towns population), and an additional 4,000were injured. It is estimated that <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> homes were destroyed in the city. Widespread flooding was reported throughout the city with mud filling up the first floor of many houses. This flash flooding led to many homes and automobiles being destroyed. Several roofs fell off of homes and landed deep in the mud. Many roads were blocked due to fallen trees while numerous homes were pushed off their foundation; some cars were also abandoned when Hurricane Liza struck. Some cars were reportedly piled against damaged building and debris. Nine people died when a car was swept away in the floodwaters.|$|E

2500|$|Dave Simpson of The Guardian {{gave the}} album only <b>one</b> star <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> and said, [...] "The 'songs' (a {{relative}} concept on planet Mars Volta) {{sound as though}} they are competing to unleash as many prog-rock cliches as possible: portentous guitar riffs and twiddly bits are interspersed with all manner of atonal wind instruments and sonic pomposities." [...] Dave Hughes of Slant Magazine also gave the album a score <b>of</b> <b>one</b> star <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> and said that it sadly [...] "takes sound and fury, signifying nothing, to new depths." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{population}} of the island {{is believed to have}} varied from 40,000 to 60,000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid-19th century. During that time, cold winters, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, and bubonic plagues adversely affected the population several times. There were 37 famine years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804. The first census was carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population was then 50,358. After the destructive volcanic eruptions of the Laki volcano during 1783–1784, the population reached a low of about 40,000. Improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid-19th century—from about 60,000 in 1850 to 320,000 in 2008. Iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country, with <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> people being 14years old or younger. With a fertility rate of 2.1, Iceland is one of only a few European countries with a birth rate sufficient for long-term population growth (see table on the left).|$|E
25|$|One {{option is}} to trade off an intact sexual {{function}} {{for the possibility of}} a prolonged life expectancy by not having curative treatment. The choice involves a trade-off so it is of central importance for the person and the physician to have access to information on established treatment benefits and side effects. A Swedish study found that the willingness {{to do this kind of}} trade-off varied considerably among men. While six out of ten were willing to consider a trade-off between life expectancy and intact sexual function, given the present knowledge of treatment benefits for clinically localized prostate cancer, four out of ten stated that they would under all circumstances choose treatment irrespective of the risk for waning sexual function. Access to valid empirical information is crucial for such decision making. Key factors here are an individual’s feeling towards the illness, their emotional values and religious beliefs. A substantial proportion of people and physicians, experience stress in judging the trade-off between different treatment options and treatment side-effects which adds to the stress of cancer diagnosed, a situation made worse in that eight out of ten people with prostate cancer have no one to confide in except their spouse and <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> live in total emotional isolation.|$|E

500|$|Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{gave the}} album <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> stars, calling it [...] "the cheapest-sounding record in recent memory; {{it sounds as}} if it was {{recorded}} in less time that it takes to play." [...] He did note Hung's improvement as a vocalist, saying that [...] "he sings with more confidence and at least vaguely sings something resembling the melody." [...] The New York Daily News called the album a cult classic.|$|E
500|$|Cleaver Patterson was {{similarly}} critical {{in his review}} on the Cine-Vue website, awarding the film <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> stars. He questioned {{the purpose of the}} film, arguing that it will only serve to alienate the gay population by portraying them as [...] "sad, perverted and ultimately lonely individuals." [...] More positively, he praised the appearance of the film with its [...] "muted colours of the shingle beaches and piercing blue skies".|$|E
500|$|On the contrary, Jason Bustard of THEM Anime {{rated the}} series <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> stars and accused Gonzo of {{attempting}} to [...] "rip off Power Rangers as a last resort".

[...] "If they were trying for some sort of grand social statement here, they succeeded instead in making the vast majority of Japan simply look stupid", Bustard charged.|$|E

[...] "Embarrassment" [...] reached number 4 in the charts, and the {{instrumental}} song [...] "The Return of the Los Palmas 7" [...] climbed to number 7. Although the album reviews were generally less enthusiastic than those of One Step Beyond..., they were mostly positive. Robert Christgau gave the album a favourable B- grade, but Rolling Stone awarded the album just <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> stars. Rolling Stone was particularly scathing of the ska revival in general, stating that [...] "The Specials wasn't very good" [...] and Madness were simply [...] "the Blues Brothers with English accents".|$|E
500|$|Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier {{deemed the}} anti-Semitism a [...] "sad moment" [...] in the series, {{awarding}} the story <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> stars. Nevertheless, {{they felt that}} the [...] "pre-apocalyptic ambiance is stark and believable", and that the giant mushrooms on the meteorite were a [...] "strange anticipation" [...] of the mushroom-clouds produced by the atomic bombings in 1945. Focusing on the characters of Professor Phostle and Philippulus, they asserted that both resembled Sophocles Sarcophagus from Cigars of the Pharaoh and that the former was [...] "in the Jules Verne tradition" [...] of eccentric professors. According to philosopher Pascal Bruckner, Tintin experts find Philippulus a caricature of Marshal of France Philippe Pétain, who demanded the French repent imaginary sins when he took power. Philippe Goddin stated that the strips for this story [...] "kept the reader daily on tenterhooks in a story replete with new twists and humour".|$|E

500|$|Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News {{gave the}} film <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> stars. She criticized {{the lack of}} Bell's screentime saying, [...] "What the filmmakers {{of the last four}} Saw movies have somehow {{overlooked}} is that Tobin Bell's Jigsaw is the linchpin of these films. It's right there in the title, so you'd think they'd realize what they lost when they killed him off in Saw III. But it's been downhill ever since, and we hit bottom today". She admitted that the performances have become [...] "painfully stilted" [...] and called the script [...] "a jumble of nothing punctuated by barely-trying death traps". She went on to say, [...] "It's also disappointing to watch a once-original franchise morph into a generic slasher series, in which random people are killed in banal ways just to up the body count" [...] and closed her review with, [...] "No matter how much money The Final Chapter makes over Halloween weekend, it's time to acknowledge that this game is over".|$|E
500|$|However, {{the film}} {{received}} more critical reviews. The A.V. Club graded it a B− {{and stated that}} U2's performance was less thrilling than the 3D effects. Online magazine FilmSlash criticized The New York Times statement about U2 3D being the first IMAX art film, stating {{that some of the}} first IMAX titles were [...] "experimental works of art". Music critic Joel Selvin wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle that seeing U2 on the big screen was [...] "more distracting than illuminating", and Time Out London criticized Bono's political statements, stating he [...] "should refrain from ramming his preachy political meanderings down our throats and let the music do the talking". The Daily Telegraph favored Rattle and Hum over U2 3D and called U2's performance [...] "unexciting", criticizing how [...] "the cameras, not the band, are doing all the work". The Guardian, which gave a rating of <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> stars, claimed that U2 appeared to be [...] "four conceited billionaires who are further up themselves than ever".|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel {{gave the}} film <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> stars saying, [...] "It's all bunk {{and has been}} for years. These are all no-win scenarios. Whatever moral lessons were {{presented}} in the earliest Saw films seem to have been dispensed with as the movies grow more and more gruesome, with filmmakers caught up in 'What would it look like if somebody's jaw was ripped out, or their skin was glued to a car seat?' Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' crowd has made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise". [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times called the film the most [...] "straightforward" [...] of the series and the [...] "most consistently (though not inventively) violent". He ended his review saying, [...] "If you see the film in a theater equipped with RealD 3D and Dolby sound, you'll come away with {{a pretty good idea of}} what it would feel like to have flying body parts hit you in the face".|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} by the moniker KJB {{watched the}} episode for IGN, giving it <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> stars. He {{said it was}} [...] "like watching a television episode made up {{of all the things}} from the 'Stuff We've Tried That Doesn't Work on Star Trek list." [...] Criticism was directed at the introduction of the MACOs, which were described as Starship Troopers clones, and at the modification to the theme tune. The Xindi themselves were described as [...] "bad Farscape knock offs", and the reviewer said that they set a poor tone {{for the rest of the}} season. Michelle Erica Green said she was in a [...] "double mind" [...] about [...] "The Xindi" [...] in her review at TrekNation as there were both good and bad elements. She praised the action sequences, the make-up and McHattie as the alien foreman. Green enjoyed the twist at the end with the Xindi homeworld being already destroyed, and felt that the Xindi races would be interesting. On the other hand, she thought that the MACO scenes were too dark and that the T'Pol nude scenes were unnecessary.|$|E

[...] Lamar Hafildason of the BBC gave the film <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five</b> stars, saying: [...] "Sadly, the BBC does not pay out for one-word reviews. If it did, then this review would read simply: 'tiresome'." [...] In 2001, Matt Brunson from Creative Loafing gave the film one and a half stars out of four concluding: [...] "a rockin' soundtrack... and a peek at Watts early in her career are the only ingredients saving this from a bomb rating." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars. While praising the film's ambition and energy, he said he could not [...] "care about it for much more than a moment at a time, and after a while its manic energy wore [...] down." ...|$|E
500|$|GameSpots Jeff Gerstmann {{gave it a}} 5.8 out of 10 and {{although}} describing it as weird and poorly made, he concluded that [...] "Sneak King is a one-trick pony that is an interesting curiosity with a subversive sense of humor." [...] IGN's Brudvig noted that the game's [...] price point made it the cheapest Xbox Live game. Although noting the presence of game-breaking bugs, he said the budget game was worth purchasing because of its food delivery dances. Brudvig {{also noted that the}} graphics were impressive for the cost of the game, but the interactive maps were found to be quite limited and environmentally sparse. X-Play rated the game as <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>five,</b> but noted that [...] "his is the game that really got the buzz going about BK's whole foray into gaming, thanks mostly to screenshots of the Burger King hiding in a garbage can, lying in wait for {{what appeared to be a}} college-age woman walking toward him.
