25|$|The {{maximum output}} {{frequency}} (controlled signal) {{is limited by}} the parasitic capacitance of a RO, which originates from the electrodes formed {{on the surface of the}} photoresistor and shunts the <b>output</b> <b>circuit.</b> A typical value of this capacitance is tens of picofarads that practically limits the output frequency to approximately 100kHz.|$|E
25|$|One set of classifications for {{amplifiers}} {{is based}} on which device terminal is common to both the input and the <b>output</b> <b>circuit.</b> In the case of bipolar junction transistors, the three classes are common emitter, common base, and common collector. For field-effect transistors, the corresponding configurations are common source, common gate, and common drain; for vacuum tubes, common cathode, common grid, and common plate.|$|E

5000|$|A {{parallel}} {{resonant circuit}} {{can be used}} as load impedance in <b>output</b> <b>circuits</b> of RF amplifiers. Due to high impedance, the gain of amplifier is maximum at resonant frequency.|$|R
50|$|Any {{electromagnetic}} relay {{has a certain}} level of isolation between the input and <b>output</b> <b>circuits.</b> However, in ordinary relays, this function is not prevalent and, hence, not considered in the existing system of relay classification. In interface relays, however, the property of galvanic isolation (decoupling) between the input and <b>output</b> <b>circuits</b> is significantly bolstered, and parameters of the galvanic isolation have an utmost importance from standpoint of the functions performed by this relay. On the other hand, the parameters associated with switching capacity are secondary and can significantly vary in interface relays with the same level of galvanic decoupling.|$|R
25|$|More complex {{electronic}} ballasts use programmed start. The {{output frequency}} is started above the resonance {{frequency of the}} <b>output</b> <b>circuit</b> of the ballast; and after the filaments are heated, the frequency is rapidly decreased. If the frequency approaches the resonant frequency of the ballast, the output voltage will increase {{so much that the}} lamp will ignite. If the lamp does not ignite, an electronic circuit stops the operation of the ballast.|$|E
25|$|The first guitar {{amplifier}} with a tremolo {{effect was}} produced by Fender in 1955. In that amplifier, the tremolo generator controlled the bias of an amplifier cascade located near the <b>output</b> <b>circuit,</b> and its harmonics were leaking to the output signal. In the early 1960s, Fender and Gibson used a RO as a modulator. Its photoresistor was connected via a blocking capacitor and a controlling potentiometer between {{the output of the}} preamplifier and the earth, and shunted the preamplifier when triggered. In this scheme, the control signal did not leak to the output. Modulation depth was regulated by a low-impedance potentiometer placed on the front panel. The potentiometer significantly reduced the gain of the previous stage, and thus the preamplifier had to have reserves by amplification.|$|E
2500|$|For smaller photon fluxes, the {{photomultiplier}} can {{be operated}} in photon-counting, or Geiger, mode (see also Single-photon avalanche diode). In Geiger mode the photomultiplier gain is set so high (using high voltage) {{that a single}} photo-electron resulting from a single photon incident on the primary surface generates a very large current at the <b>output</b> <b>circuit.</b> However, owing to the avalanche of current, a reset of the photomultiplier is required. In either case, the photomultiplier can detect individual photons. The drawback, however, is that not every photon incident on the primary surface is counted either because of less-than-perfect efficiency of the photomultiplier, or because a second photon can arrive at the photomultiplier during the [...] "dead time" [...] associated with a first photon and never be noticed.|$|E
50|$|A non-isolated {{differential}} amplifier {{does not provide}} isolation between input and <b>output</b> <b>circuits.</b> They share a power supply and a DC path can exist between input and output.

50|$|A loudspeaker's flyback {{current is}} not only {{dissipated}} through the amplifier <b>output</b> <b>circuit,</b> but also through the internal resistance of the loudspeaker itself. Therefore the choice of different loudspeakers will lead to different damping factors when coupled with the same amplifier.|$|E

50|$|As a {{practical}} matter, phantom powering allows the same two-conductor shielded cables {{to be used}} for both dynamic microphones and condenser microphones, while being harmless to balanced microphones that aren't designed to consume it, since the circuit balance prevents any substantial DC from flowing through the <b>output</b> <b>circuit</b> of those microphones.|$|E

50|$|A {{so-called}} ultra-linear {{push-pull amplifier}} uses either pentodes or tetrodes with their screen grid fed from {{a percentage of}} the primary voltage on the output transformer.

50|$|Opto-isolators using field-effect {{transistors}} (FETs) as sensors {{are rare}} and, like vactrols, {{can be used}} as remote-controlled analog potentiometers provided that the voltage across the FET's output terminal does not exceed a few hundred mV. Opto-FETs turn on without injecting switching charge in the <b>output</b> <b>circuit,</b> which is particularly useful in sample and hold circuits.|$|E
50|$|The {{more recent}} and more {{successful}} OTL circuits employ an <b>output</b> <b>circuit</b> generally {{known as a}} Circlotron. The Circlotron has about one-half the output impedance of the Futterman-style (totem-pole) circuits. The Circlotron is fully symmetrical and does not require large amounts of feedback to reduce output impedance and distortion. Successful embodiments use the 6AS7G and the Russian 6C33-CB power triodes.|$|E
50|$|The {{control section}} {{monitors}} all the parameters in the load circuit, the inverter and supplies switching pulses {{at the appropriate}} time to supply energy to the <b>output</b> <b>circuit.</b> Early systems featured discrete electronics with variable potentiometers to adjust switching times, current limits, voltage limits and frequency trips. However, with the advent of microcontroller technology, the majority of advanced systems now feature digital control.|$|E
5000|$|Triodes {{have a lower}} {{internal}} anode resistance, {{and hence}} higher damping factor when used in audio <b>output</b> <b>circuits,</b> compared with pentodes, when negative feedback is absent. That also reduces the potential voltage amplification obtainable from a triode compared with a pentode of the same transconductance, and usually means a more efficient output stage can be made using pentodes, with a lower power drive signal.|$|R

5000|$|An {{exception}} to the general rule may {{be made in the}} case of [...] "push-pull", or balanced circuits. A pair of tubes, driven by identical signals 180 degrees out of phase, may share a common unbypassed cathode resistor. Slight differences in tube conduction are then dynamically balanced by bias variations that tend to reduce distortion. This technique is useful in the input circuits of balanced line receivers or push-pull power <b>output</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{also named}} common- emitter {{amplifier}} because the emitter of the transistor {{is common to}} both the input circuit and <b>output</b> <b>circuit.</b> The input signal is applied across {{the ground and the}} base circuit of the transistor. The output signal appears across ground and the collector of the transistor. Since the emitter is connected to the ground, it is common to signals, input and output.|$|E
