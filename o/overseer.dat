40|$|<b>Overseers</b> have seldom {{been the}} focus of {{historical}} scholarship. Although mentioned occasionally by historians of the elite planter class and slavery, these historians often only distort the overseers' image, and a negative stereotype has overshadowed the image of all <b>overseers.</b> With a review of period literature such as novels, slave narratives, and newspapers, one can begin to trace the origins of the ""bad overseer"" image. The plantation records of Robert Ruffin Barrow, Walter Wade, Benjamin Covington Wailes, Charles Manigault, and James K. Polk reveal that the ""bad overseer"" image does not fully explain the lives and character of all <b>overseers.</b> <b>Overseers</b> were essential to the plantation operations in the South. The stereotype of the ""bad overseer"" does not tell the whole story. <b>Overseers</b> were a mixed lot and there were a variety of <b>overseers.</b> They differed in character, length of tenure, skill, and ability. It seems then that the image of the ""bad overseer"" serves a function for both the historians of slavery and the elite planter class. <b>Overseers</b> are scapegoats for all of the wrongdoing in the South. From cruelty, immorality, to crop failures, and other plantation failures, <b>overseer's</b> shouldered the blame for everything. The ""bad overseer"" stereotype diverts attention away from the truth in Southern history and it portrays <b>overseers</b> inaccurately. What is important to note is that <b>overseers</b> were a mixed lot. Our understanding of the overseeing profession and the men in it cannot be determined by generalizations and stereotype...|$|R

50|$|In 1890, CSR started leasing its estates to {{plantation}} {{managers and}} others with capital. At {{this time there was}} a general belief that cane plantations were economically viable due to improved cultivation methods and CSR tenants generally paid less rent than other contractors. From 1905 the CSR came under increasing pressure, by <b>overseers,</b> to lease its large estates because the <b>overseers</b> wanted a share in the profit of the sugar industry. In 1908, the management of CSR decided to divide its estates into 400 to 1000 acre (1.6 to 4 km²) lots and lease them to its <b>overseers</b> because it was noted that relationship between tenants and their labourers were better than between the company <b>overseers</b> and its Indian labourers. By 1914, most of the CSR's cane was bought from these tenants. One negative effect this had on CSR was that while all the experienced <b>overseers</b> had become tenants, it was left with inexperienced <b>overseers,</b> which led to labour troubles.|$|R
