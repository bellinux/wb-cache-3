We give {{a method}} of {{constructing}} maps between tubular groups inductively according to a finite set <b>of</b> <b>strategies.</b> This map will be a quasiisometry exactly when the set <b>of</b> <b>strategies</b> satisfies certain consistency criteria.

For two given tubular groups there are only finitely many candidate sets <b>of</b> <b>strategies</b> to consider, so it is possible in finite time to either produce a consistent set <b>of</b> <b>strategies</b> or decide that such a set does not exist.

5|$|The Blitz game mode was {{the result}} of experimenting with ideas for a fast-paced and {{accessible}} variation of RTS gameplay. The development team wanted to streamline mechanics, such as base building and resource management, that players typically viewed as being complex and intimidating. The initial design of Blitz involved players having an army roster, like in tabletop war games. After playtesting this version, they realized that the scale of battles would shrink and become less appealing {{over the course of the}} match. They revised the mode by implementing a card-and-deck system for unit deployment and introducing randomly spawning resources on the maps. Blitz was influenced by the Warzone game mode from Halo 5: Guardians and Blizzard Entertainment's collectible card game Hearthstone, taking design cues from the card collecting and deck building systems. 343 Industries' head <b>of</b> <b>strategy</b> games Dan Ayoub cited the multiplayer online battle arena genre as impactful on the design of Blitz, since games in the genre replaced resource management with individual unit combat.|$|E

5|$|The games {{introduce}} Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, {{some new}} types of legendary Pokémon that wander around Johto, changing locations frequently. They can be tracked by the Pokédex once encountered, and will always attempt to flee, but will retain HP loss. In addition {{there is the possibility}} of encountering a shiny Pokémon, which have a different coloration than normal Pokémon of their species, and appear very rarely. Two new Pokémon types were added, the Steel-type and the Dark-type. Steel-type Pokémon are immune to Poison-type moves, and they have very high defense and resistance to other types, while Dark-type Pokémon are immune to Psychic-type moves and are strong against Psychic-type Pokémon, as well as having few weaknesses. In Gold and Silver, new moves were added, but Pokémon knowing these moves are not allowed to be traded to the first generation games. To solve this, a move deleter was introduced, capable of erasing moves known by the Pokémon. Another major change was the splitting of the Special stat into Special Attack and Special Defense, which increased aspects <b>of</b> <b>strategy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Theo Osterkamp {{pointed to}} the massed {{formations}} used by the British (Big Wing), and put their use down to the ineffectiveness of the 15 September raids.

However, the Germans had not realised this stratagem was by no means the uniform strategy in Fighter Command. Nevertheless, the OKL were still confident of victory. It blamed the bad weather and RAF's last-minute change <b>of</b> <b>strategy</b> for prolonging summer operations. Still, the Luftwaffe bomber crews were ordered to prepare winter quarters. The campaign turned to London for the duration of 1940. It would witness some large-scale daylight air battles, but it gradually turned to a campaign by night. It would become known as The Blitz.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{gameplay}} is its focus on guns over swords and magic. When deciding upon the game's basics, the team {{wanted to create a}} cinematic feeling in battles. If they had gone with a more traditional battle system, then it would have quickly lost its cinematic quality due to the prevalence of close combat. Likewise, they wanted the cinematic feel to persist throughout the whole game rather than restricted to cutscenes. A major challenge was {{to strike a balance between}} accessibility and difficulty when developing for a player base that might be made of up of both action game and RPG players. This resulted in the addition <b>of</b> <b>strategy</b> elements. Another wish was to create something new and fresh in the RPG market. When creating the gameplay style, the team looked at action movies such as The Matrix and Rebellion during their research. Despite its fast-paced action, the game relies heavily upon strategic, turn-based gameplay. During early development, the game was based on a real-time system and meant for only one character to be controlled by the player; the other two would have been handled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). After some testing, they decided that this would create unwanted difficulties in gameplay such as characters dying off-screen without the player noticing or the AI not directing them properly.|$|E

In strategies that increase dummy sample, the strategy that increases the dummy support vector sample precedes to the strategy that increases dummy ordinary sample.

5|$|In 1968, the MCC was {{involved}} in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa, which was then under apartheid. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England team because of his colour. The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead. The Shadow Foreign Secretary and former MCC President Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances. Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, {{but that it was}} likely no protest would be made. Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer. They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team, but their change <b>of</b> <b>strategy</b> meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the change <b>of</b> <b>strategy</b> towards Scotland was {{a growing concern for}} the {{relationship}} between England and France. As long as Scotland and France were in an alliance, the English were {{faced with the prospect of}} fighting a war on two fronts. The French carried out raids on English coastal towns, leading to rumours in England of a full-scale French invasion. In 1337, Philip VI confiscated the English king's Duchy of Aquitaine and the county of Ponthieu. Instead of seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict by paying homage to the French king, as his father had done, Edward responded by laying claim to the French crown as the grandson of Philip IV. The French rejected this based on the precedents for agnatic succession set in 1316 and 1322. Instead, they upheld the rights of PhilipIV's nephew, King Philip VI (an agnatic descendant of the House of France), thereby setting the stage for the Hundred Years' War (see family tree below). In the early stages of the war, Edward's strategy was to build alliances with other Continental princes. In 1338, LouisIV named Edward vicar-general of the Holy Roman Empire and promised his support. As late as 1373, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 established an Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. These measures produced few results; the only major military victory in this phase of the war was the English naval victory at Sluys on 24 June 1340, which secured English control of the Channel.|$|E
5|$|The course {{focuses on}} the {{strategic}} and political aspects of war and educationally prepares students for assignments as strategic leaders. The academic year runs from late June through late May.

The program includes classroom studies <b>of</b> <b>strategy,</b> regional studies, joint operations, strategic leadership, and twentieth-century conflict. Students also research and write a publishable-quality monograph of 10,000- 12,000 words on a suitable subject. ASLSP includes an extensive field studies program, with approximately eight weeks of TDY, to reinforce and expand classroom studies and meet with senior leaders across JIIM organizations. Field Studies include interactions with several agencies in the National Capital Region, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and CONUS-based combatant commands, and visits to various military and civilian governmental agencies. Normally, six US Army officers and the USMC, Canadian, and German officers remain for a second year to serve as seminar leaders as seminar leaders in the AMSP course, while one US Army officer joins {{the faculty of the}} ASLSP as the military faculty member.
