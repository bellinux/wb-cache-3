40|$|This book {{presents}} a distinctive theoretical {{approach to the}} problem <b>of</b> <b>borders</b> {{in the study of}} global politics. It turns from current debates about the presence or absence <b>of</b> <b>borders</b> between states to consider the possibility that the concept <b>of</b> the <b>border</b> <b>of</b> the state is being reconfigured in contemporary political life. The author uses critical resources found in poststructuralist thought to think in new ways about the relationship between borders, security and sovereign power, drawing on a range of thinkers including Agamben, Derrida and Foucault. He highlights the necessity of a more pluralized and radicalised view <b>of</b> what <b>borders</b> are and where they might be found and uses the problem <b>of</b> <b>borders</b> to critically explore the innovations and limits of poststructuralist scholarship...|$|R

In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania.|$|E
40|$|The {{concepts}} of 'citizenship' and 'border' have rarely been systematically brought together. New Border and Citizenship Politics challenges this, examining the intersections and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>bordering</b> processes and citizenship politics. Case-studies from the United States, Europe, the Mediterranean and Australia illuminate the connections, exploring the politics <b>of</b> redesigning <b>borders,</b> technologies <b>of</b> <b>bordering</b> and citizenship as border politics. The collection offers comprehensive coverage <b>of</b> <b>bordering</b> dynamics by transcending a state-centered perspective {{and taking the}} political agency of migrants into account, approaching the subject <b>of</b> <b>borders</b> as a genuine political and socially constructed phenomenon, focusing on its dynamic, conflictive and productive character. Arguing that international borders are key sites of regulation and struggles about belonging and mobility, the contributors stress the contested politics around borders and citizenship, and migrants themselves become both subjects and objects of politics...|$|R

5|$|A day later, {{the owners}} of the {{previous}} bridge — the International Railway Company (IRC) — as well as the Minister of Highways Thomas Baker McQuesten announced intentions to construct a new span; a long political battle ensued for several years over the merits of private or public ownership <b>of</b> <b>border</b> crossings.

5|$|After World War II, Berlin {{had been}} {{divided into four}} sectors {{controlled}} by the Allies: the US, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France. The sector borders inside the city could in general be used freely for passage out of the German Democratic Republic, even after {{the border between the}} Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR had been continually closed off, starting in 1952. The outer border of West Berlin, which was also the border between West-Berlin and the GDR, had also been closed down in 1952. During the night of 12 to 13 August 1961 the National People's Army, the German Border Police, the Volkspolizei and the Combat Groups of the Working Class locked down all passages between the Soviet sector and the three West sectors; construction <b>of</b> <b>border</b> protection facilities began.|$|E

The front along the border with Italy was relatively quiet, with only patrol clashes occurring, some sporadic artillery bombardments <b>of</b> <b>border</b> fortifications, and an unsuccessful raid by the Italians on Mount Blegoš.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to stave off the}} Civil War, Dixon participated in a {{convention}} <b>of</b> <b>border</b> states and a peace convention in Frankfort, Kentucky, both in 1861. Both conventions were unsuccessful. At the outset of the war, the Kentucky General Assembly elected six arbiters to recommend a course of action for the Commonwealth. Dixon represented the pro-Union position along with John J. Crittenden and Samuel S. Nicholas. Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin, John C. Breckinridge, and Richard Hawes represented the southern sympathizers. The arbiters met on May 11, 1861. After the pro-Union men defeated a proposal to call a sovereignty convention, the six arbiters recommended a position of neutrality, which the General Assembly adopted.|$|E

5|$|One way of {{addressing}} carbon leakage {{is to give}} sectors vulnerable to international competition free emission permits (Carbon Trust, 2009). This acts as a subsidy for the sector in question. Free allocation of permits was opposed by the Garnaut Climate Change Review as it considered there were no circumstances that justify it and that governments could deal with market failure or claims for compensation more transparently with the revenue from full auctioning of permits. The economically efficient option would, however, be border adjustments (Neuhoff, 2009; Newbery, 2009). Border adjustments work by setting a tariff on imported goods from less regulated countries. A problem with border adjustments is {{that they might be}} used as a disguise for trade protectionism. Some types <b>of</b> <b>border</b> adjustment may also not prevent emissions leakage.|$|E
5|$|Savage {{performed}} his Army tasks but {{was unhappy}} with the narrowly defined role. He tendered his resignation on December 31, 1870. Through President Grant, he went to Marseilles and Rome as an American vice-consul. In 1871, Savage traveled to Egypt to act with the rank of captain for one year as secretary to Charles Pomeroy Stone, a former American general in the Egyptian Army, serving under Khedive Isma'il Pasha. Following an honorable discharge from the Egyptian Army, Savage returned to the U.S. and was tasked by Grant to serve as one of three commissioners investigating a series <b>of</b> <b>border</b> incidents between the U.S. and Mexico 1872–74. At the same time, he worked with Richard King and the nascent Corpus Christi & Rio Grande Railroad as chief surveyor for the route to Laredo.|$|E

This was however denied by the second Foreign Minister of Brunei Lim Jock Seng, stating the issue was never discussed during the meeting. James Shoal (Betting Serupai) and the Luconia Shoals (Betting Raja Jarum/Patinggi Ali), islands in the South China Sea, fall within Sarawak's exclusive economic zone, but concerns have been raised about Chinese incursions.
