5|$|A {{nationalist}} {{movement in the}} Belgian Congo demanding the end of colonial rule led to the country's independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many issues, such as the questions of federalism and ethnicity, remained unresolved. In {{the first week of}} July, a mutiny broke out in the army and violence erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites and two areas of the country, Katanga and South Kasai, seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest and violence, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers, but the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld refused to use these troops to help the central government in Léopoldville fight the secessionists. Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted by calling for assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisors and <b>other</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E

5|$|After January 1943 {{as part of}} the Southern Front, {{that became}} the 4th Ukrainian Front on 20 October 1943, the 51st Army took part in the Rostov, Donbass (August–September 1943), Melitopol (September–November 1943) and the 1944 Crimean {{offensive}} operation. On 1 April 1944, 51st Army included the 1st Guards Rifle Corps (33rd Guards, 91st and 346th Rifle Divisions), 10th Rifle Corps (216th, 257th, and 279th Rifle Divisions), 63rd Rifle Corps (263rd, 267th, and 417th Rifle Divisions), the 77th Rifle Division, the 78th Fortified Region, artillery, armor and <b>other</b> <b>support</b> units.

5|$|Commanded by Generalmajor Richard Heidrich, the 1st Parachute Division {{consisted}} of the 1st, 3rd and 4th Parachute Regiments, with an artillery regiment, tank-destroyer, anti-aircraft, and engineer battalions, and <b>other</b> <b>support</b> units. The division was the successor of the original German airborne force, the 7th Air Division, and was highly experienced. It had spearheaded the German invasion in the west in 1940, and fought in the battles of Greece and Crete, and in the Soviet Union. Withdrawn from the Soviet Union in 1943, the division had already fought against British paratroops during operations in Sicily. However, on 9 September only three combat battalions and the headquarters were in Apulia.|$|E

5|$|In October 2008, the brigade's leaders {{attended}} a conference at Joint Base Balad. Hosted by the 3rd Sustainment Command (Expeditionary), {{the conference was}} attended by the 1st, 7th, 16th, 55th, and 371st Sustainment Brigades, {{as well as the}} 76th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. They discussed streamlining and coordinating sustainment throughout the region. Among the brigade's operations was a water project in the Ninewa province. The brigade operated with US Air Force and Iraqi Army engineers to repair infrastructure that brought water from the Tigris River to the entire province, including the base. The brigade has also undertaken several <b>other</b> <b>support</b> duties for units operating throughout northern Iraq.|$|E
5|$|In the engagement, seven battalions of U.S. Marine and Army troops {{under the}} overall command of Alexander Vandegrift and {{tactical}} command of Merritt A. Edson, {{following up on}} the U.S. victory in the Battle for Henderson Field, crossed the Matanikau River and attacked Japanese Army units between the river and Point Cruz, on the northern Guadalcanal coast. The area was defended by the Japanese Army's 4th Infantry Regiment under Nomasu Nakaguma along with various <b>other</b> <b>support</b> troops, under the overall command of Harukichi Hyakutake. After inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese defenders, U.S. forces halted the offensive and temporarily withdrew because of a perceived threat from Japanese forces elsewhere in the Guadalcanal area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} option, the North Vietnamese could avoid the {{outlying}} South Vietnamese installations and strike directly at their primary target of Ban Me Thuot. For the first option to be successful, the North Vietnamese had to secure Highways 14, 19, and 21 to isolate Ban Me Thuot, and stop potential South Vietnamese reinforcements. The North Vietnamese favoured the first option, {{because it would}} give the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and <b>other</b> <b>support</b> units little or no time to respond. At the same time, the first option would have enabled a quick victory without inflicting large-scale damage on the civilian population of Ban Me Thuot.|$|E

5|$|Prompted by the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, the CRNC officially {{left the}} control of the RNC by reconstituting as a 527 group, {{allowing}} it to operate independently and raise unlimited amount of money for issue-advocacy work. As a 527 group, the organization is prohibited from coordinating directly with a particular campaign and its recent focus has turned towards developing volunteers and <b>other</b> <b>support</b> activities rather than outright campaigning. The shift has allowed the CRNC to vastly expand its fundraising efforts. During its first two years, the CRNC raised $17.3 million, most going to pay fundraising costs and other administrative costs, while leaving more than $2 million to expand the field representative program and to improve pay for the full-time positions.|$|E

The brigade is assigned as the sustainment unit of the 1st Infantry Division, however it can also operate independently, being assigned other units and other missions independent of the division.|$|E
5|$|The Forty-fifth Division {{was under}} Omar Bradley's II Corps, {{which in turn}} was {{subordinate}} to Patton's Seventh Army. Overall command of the Sicilian invasion, called Operation Husky, was with British General Sir Harold Alexander, and the British forces were organized under the British Eighth Army commanded by General Bernard Montgomery. The Forty-fifth Division consisted of three infantry regiments, the 157th, 179th and 180th, and numerous other elements. Fighting alongside the Forty-fifth Division were the First Infantry Division, Third Infantry Division, and the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) (with the 3rd Battalion of the 504th PIR and numerous <b>other</b> <b>support</b> units attached), part of the 82nd Airborne Division.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. wind {{industry}} generates tens {{of thousands}} of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity. Wind projects provide local taxes, or payments in lieu of taxes and strengthen the economy of rural communities by providing income to farmers with wind turbines on their land. Wind energy in many jurisdictions receives financial or <b>other</b> <b>support</b> to encourage its development. Wind energy benefits from subsidies in many jurisdictions, either to increase its attractiveness, or to compensate for subsidies received by other forms of production which have significant negative externalities.|$|E
5|$|The World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Conservation Union (IUCN) are {{non-profit}} {{organizations that}} provide funding and <b>other</b> <b>support</b> to off site and on site conservation efforts. The wise use of crop genetic diversity in plant breeding and genetic modification can also {{contribute significantly to}} protecting the biodiversity in crops. Crop varieties can be genetically modified to resist specific pests and diseases. For example, a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces a natural insecticide toxin. Genes from Bt can be inserted into crop plants to make them capable of producing an insecticidal toxin and therefore a resistance to certain pests. Bt corn (maize) can however adversely affect non-target insects {{closely related to the}} target pest, as with the monarch butterfly.|$|E
5|$|The {{search and}} rescue efforts for Holloway began immediately. Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined in the effort.

Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline. Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided <b>other</b> <b>support</b> to aid volunteer search teams. Beth Twitty was provided with housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she coincidentally stayed in the same room her daughter had occupied.
