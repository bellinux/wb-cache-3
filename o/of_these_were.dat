5|$|Several Indian trails {{spanned the}} state along the general {{path of the}} modern freeway. After statehood, several <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> {{converted}} into plank roads that later became {{some of the first}} state highways. In the 1920s, five <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>were</b> added to the United States Numbered Highway System: US Highway2 (US2), US10, US24, US25, and US27. In the 1950s, a Michigan Turnpike was proposed as a tolled, controlled-access highway in the Lower Peninsula. After passage of the Federal Highway Act of 1956, this turnpike proposal was shelved as a free Interstate Highway was planned. Construction started in 1957, signs went up in 1959, and I-75 was completed in 1973.
