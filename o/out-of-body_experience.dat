Mulder is waiting with his gun at his apartment when Melissa arrives. Although he initially refuses to leave, Melissa is able to convince Mulder to see Scully. While being with Scully, Mulder holds Scully's left hand and talks to her. Returning home to find his apartment trashed, Mulder sits on the floor and cries.|$|E

40|$|Alterations of {{consciousness}} are critical {{factors in the}} diagnosis of epileptic seizures. With these alterations in consciousness, some persons report sensations of separating from the physical body, experiences that may in rare cases resemble spontaneous <b>out-of-body</b> <b>experiences.</b> This {{study was designed to}} identify and characterize these out-of-body-like subjective experiences associated with seizure activity. 55 % of the patients in this study recalled some subjective experience in association with their seizures. Among our sample of 100 patients, 7 reported <b>out-of-body</b> <b>experiences</b> associated with their seizures. We found no differentiating traits that were associated with patients’ reports of <b>out-of-body</b> <b>experiences,</b> in terms of either demographics; medical history, including age of onset and duration of seizure disorder, and seizure frequency; seizure characteristics, including localization, lateralization, etiology, and type of seizure, and epilepsy syndrome; or ability to recall any subjective experiences associated with their seizures. Reporting <b>out-of-body</b> <b>experiences</b> in association with seizures did not affect epilepsy-related quality of life. It should be noted that even in those patients who report <b>out-of-body</b> <b>experiences,</b> such sensations are extremely rare events that do not occur routinely with their seizures. Most patients who reported <b>out-of-body</b> <b>experiences</b> described one or two experiences that occurred an indeterminate number of years ago, which precludes the possibility of associating the experience with the particular characteristics of that one seizure or with medications taken or other conditions at the time...|$|R

[...] Regarding the lyrics, Powers said that Williams [...] "focuses hard on the <b>out-of-body</b> <b>experience</b> of the everyday." [...] She said that the production on the album is [...] "gorgeous" [...] and that [...] "Williams benefits greatly from the gifts of the producer's longtime team, including the arranger Anne Dudley." [...] Mikael Wood from Spin gave the album a 7/10 rating.

[...] We promise to return him in one piece." [...] The younger Weinberg began playing during segments of the tour's shows, and got a very positive response from audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band.

Dean has an <b>out-of-body</b> <b>experience</b> in [...] "In My Time of Dying", and some scenes feature him looking at his own body in a hospital bed. To forgo the use of visual effects, the special effects department sculpted a full gelatin face from Ackles, and applied it to a body double. To depict a woman burning {{to death in the}} episode [...] "Simon Said", the actress was sealed inside a full body silicone designed to look like her, and was doused with fire accelerant. She was required to breathe through a straw, as well as don underwear soaked in ice-cold fire-retardant gel. Prior to [...] "Heart", Kripke had not wanted to include werewolves in the series, as he felt that the budget would only allow for [...] "a guy with fur glued to his face". As he prefers to have monsters be able to walk among humans, production made the transformation subtle—the character's eyes change, and her canine teeth and fingernails grow. However, writer Sera Gamble believes that they [...] "dropped the ball" [...] in the design, feeling that the creature looked too similar to a vampire.|$|E

500|$|Stratton tried {{variations}} of the experiment {{over the next few}} years. First he wore the glasses for eight days, back at Berkeley. The first day he was nauseated and the inverted landscape felt unreal, but by the second day just his own body position seemed strange, and by day seven, things felt normal. A sense of strangeness returned when the glasses were taken out, though the world looked straight side up; he found himself reaching out with the right hand when he should have used the left, and the other way around. Then he tried the experiment outdoors. [...] He also tried another experiment disrupting the mental link between touch and sight. There he wore a set of mirrors attached to a harness as shown in the figure allowing, and forcing, him to see his body from above. He found the senses adapted in a similar way over three days. His interpretation was that we build up an association between sight and touch by associational learning over a period of time. During certain periods, the disconnect between vision and touch made him feel as if his body was not where his touch and proprioceptive feeling told him it was. This <b>out-of-body</b> <b>experience,</b> caused by an altered but normal sensory perception, vanished when he attended to the issue critically, focusing on the disconnect.|$|E
500|$|Unable {{to pursue}} his {{scientific}} career, without his wife and devoid of friendship, Parsons {{decided to return to}} occultism and embarked on sexually based magical operations with prostitutes. He was intent, informally following the ritualistic practice of Thelemite organization the A∴A∴, on performing [...] "the Crossing of the Abyss", [...] attaining union with the universal consciousness, or [...] "All" [...] as understood in Thelemic mysticism, and becoming the [...] "Master of the Temple". Following his apparent success in doing so, Parsons recounted having an <b>out-of-body</b> <b>experience</b> invoked by Babalon, who astrally transported him to the biblical City of Chorazin, an experience he referred to as a [...] "Black Pilgrimage". Accompanying Parsons' [...] "Oath of the Abyss" [...] was his own [...] "Oath of the AntiChrist", which was witnessed by Wilfred Talbot Smith. In this oath, Parsons professed to embody an entity named Belarion Armillus Al Dajjal, the Antichrist [...] "who am come [...] to fulfill the law of the Beast 666 [...] ". Viewing these oaths as the completion of the Babalon Working, Parsons wrote an illeist autobiography titled Analysis by a Master of the Temple and an occult text titled The Book of AntiChrist. In the latter work, Parsons (writing as Belarion) prophesied that within nine years Babalon would manifest on Earth and supersede the dominance of the Abrahamic religions.|$|E
500|$|Jay Weinberg {{appeared}} {{at a number}} of shows on the first, North American leg, drumming on anywhere from four songs to half the show. [...] He had been a fan of heavy metal music for much of his life, and in playing with Springsteen he integrated a polyrhythmic approach influenced by metal bands such as Lamb of God, Mastodon, and Slipknot with the E Street drumming style derived from big bands and early rock and roll. [...] He received a very positive reaction from both audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band, with his vigorous, long-hair-flying style inviting comparisons to Dave Grohl and his potential for replacing his father drawing allusions to Wally Pipp. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote, [...] "All hail Jay Weinberg. ... With [...] the band’s chemistry was slightly unsettled for the better. ... His fills during 'Radio Nowhere' kicked the song, and the concert, into a higher gear, and galvanized a band that was starting to pace itself." [...] Jay Weinberg said [...] "it's a summer job that anybody would want," [...] while Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total <b>out-of-body</b> <b>experience.</b> For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able {{to go out in the}} audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] Jay Weinberg played his first full show on May 14 at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York, as Max Weinberg was in California to prepare test runs for The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien start. [...] Springsteen said of the occasion, “This is the first night in 35 years that somebody else sat at the drums.” Overall, Modern Drummer magazine's editor said that a college freshman playing on one of the year's biggest rock tours was [...] "certainly a unique story". [...] For the final Meadowlands Arena shows of the first leg, Jay Weinberg did the first but his father took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E
