5|$|L'Homme-Rivière is {{a statue}} {{representing}} a log driver at work. The logs are heavily stylized, reduced {{to little more}} than cylinders. The driver and his hook, however, are shown as transforming into a wooden plant. Its location, in a tight space between two tall buildings, gives the sculpture the appearance of travelling down a river gorge. L'Homme-Rivière is highly dynamic, and has been described as looking as though it is about to spill <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> The log driver is a symbolic figure in the history and culture of Quebec, thanks notably to Félix-Antoine Savard's famous novel Menaud, maître draveur.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of September 5, 1972, the Munich Massacre began. Eight Palestinian terrorists {{carrying}} rifles, who were members of the Black September faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, broke into the Israeli quarters in the Olympic Village to take the Israeli Olympic delegation athletes and coaches hostage. The terrorists captured wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg. They shot and killed Weinberg, and threw his body out a window <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b>|$|E
25|$|On June 23, 2008, a bus loading {{passengers}} {{was struck}} by an out-of-control dump truck {{at the corner of}} Bowery and Canal Street in New York’s Chinatown. The force of the impact pushed the bus <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> and into a bank. As the result of the accident, a sign attached to a light pole fell, injuring a 57-year-old woman; the woman later died {{as the result of a}} heart attack. Several people, including two police officers, were treated for minor injuries. State Department of Transportation inspectors found that the dump truck, owned by CPQ Freight Systems, had eight mechanical issues including faulty brakes which led to the accident.|$|E

50|$|Commerce: Around August 2015, {{teams of}} {{officers}} physically removed nearly all illegal structures used for {{business in the}} city (a province-wide campaign). These structures were commonly made of corrugated metal or cinderblocks and were shop extensions or simply unused space that had been built upon. Street vendors were banned (most of whom sold vegetables or fruit), as was the night operation of roadside BBQ sites and the placement of tables <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> by restaurants. These night time food operations were once common throughout the city.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, GSA {{estimated}} {{the costs of}} renovating the Hoover Building at between $850 million to $1.1 billion. Additional problems also became apparent that same year. A piece of the concrete façade came loose and fell <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> on busy Pennsylvania Avenue NW. A contractor was hired to remove loose concrete from the exterior. Construction netting was hung around the upper floors to prevent additional pieces of concrete from crashing to the ground. The {{total cost of the}} concrete removal and safety netting installation was $5.9 million. In 2007, an architectural design and planning consultant reported that the cost of these renovations and the disruption to FBI work and staff were not justifiable. The consultant recommended building a new FBI headquarters.|$|E
500|$|In Bishop, {{windows were}} {{shattered}} and ceiling tiles fell in several buildings, and {{a portion of}} the brick facade at the First Sierra bank building fell <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> A Burger King restaurant had part of its ceiling come down. Northwest of Bishop, a portion of U.S. Route 395 was blocked temporarily by a landslide. Campers were briefly trapped at the Pleasant Valley Reservoir when a [...] section of an access road was destroyed as a result of land movement. Both injuries that were reported (minor cuts and injuries from falling objects) occurred to the north in Chalfant Valley where 53 mobile homes were knocked off their foundations and two homes were destroyed. Nearly all the buildings in that small town were affected, with water and sewer lines broken there as well.|$|E

50|$|February 15, 1979, was a cold, cloudy day. At 12:37 p.m., the bank’s branch at the Rotunda, {{located in}} the strict city centre at the {{intersection}} of Marszałkowska Street and Aleje Jerozolimskie, was full of people. The explosion took place twenty minutes {{before the end of the}} first shift. At that time, there were 170 PKO employees and around 300 customers in the building. Suddenly, as witnesses later stated, the Rotunda floated in the air like a soap bubble, and then broke into pieces. All the glass walls were shattered, and hundreds of pieces of glass fell <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks.</b> Inside <b>the</b> building, floors collapsed into the basement. The explosion was so loud that it was heard by thousands of Varsovians.|$|R
2500|$|The {{police car}} and Schneerson's {{automobile}} crossed Utica Avenue on {{a green light}} and proceeded along President Street at a normal speed. But Lifsh's vehicle had fallen behind. Not wishing {{to lose sight of}} Schneerson's car, Lifsh's vehicle either crossed Utica Avenue on a yellow light or ran a red light. There was no indication of the exact speed of Lifsh's vehicle. Lifsh's vehicle struck a car being driven on Utica Avenue, veered <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> knocked a 600-pound (275kg) stone building pillar down and pinned two children against an iron grate covering the window of a first-floor apartment in a four-story brick building (...) [...] Seven-year-old Gavin Cato, the son of Guyanese immigrants, who was on the sidewalk near his apartment on President Street, repairing his bicycle chain, died instantly. His seven-year-old cousin Angela Cato, who was playing nearby, survived but was severely injured.|$|E
2500|$|The Crown Heights riot {{began on}} August 19, 1991, after a car {{driven by a}} Jewish man, {{and part of a}} {{procession}} led by an unmarked police car, went through an intersection and was struck by another vehicle causing it to veer <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> where it accidentally struck and killed a seven-year-old Guyanese boy named Gavin Cato and severely injured his cousin Angela. Witnesses could not agree upon the speed and could not agree whether the light was yellow or red. One of the factors that sparked the riot was the arrival of a private ambulance, which was later discovered to be on the orders of a police officer who was worried for the Jewish driver's safety, removed him from the scene while Cato lay pinned under his car. After being removed from under the car, Cato and his cousin were treated soon after by a city ambulance (without visibly Jewish EMTs). Caribbean-American and African-American residents of the neighborhood rioted for four consecutive days fueled by rumors that the private ambulance had refused to treat Cato. During the riot black youths looted stores, beat Jews in the street, and clashed with groups of Jews, hurling rocks and bottles at one another after Yankel Rosenbaum, a visiting student from Australia, was stabbed and killed by a member of a mob while some chanted [...] "Kill the Jew", and [...] "get the Jews out".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Victoria Gardens {{lifestyle}} center", {{built in}} {{the eastern end of}} the city, is located at the intersection of Foothill and Day Creek Boulevards. Since the city had never developed a traditional commercial downtown like neighboring cities Ontario and Upland had, efforts were made in the design of Victoria Gardens to bring elements of more traditional and urban town design to what had historically been a suburban city. While retaining many characteristics of traditional shopping malls, such as large anchor stores, a food court, and vast parking lots and garages, the smaller stores are arranged as city blocks in a grid of two-lane streets, featuring lush landscaping and metered [...] "teaser parking" [...] in front of the stores, which open <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> There are two [...] "Main Streets", which run from west to east across the center. Running from north to south between them is a pedestrian axis leading from one of the Macy's anchor stores, through a [...] "town square" [...] between a pair of mixed-use office buildings, to the Victoria Gardens Cultural Center, which contains a 570-seat theater and a city library. There are restaurants throughout the center, both well-known chains and unique eateries including California Pizza Kitchen, N7 Creamery, Fleming's, Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ Dining, Harry's Pacific Grill, Johnny Rockets, King's Fish House, Lucille's BBQ, P.F. Chang's China Bistro, Richie's Diner, T.G.I. Friday's, and Yard House. The center features a 12 screen AMC Theatre. Foothills Crossing is a shopping center located at Foothill Blvd just west of Interstate 15.|$|E
50|$|In 1889-90 the {{building}} was doubled in size using the adjacent lot on its north (Park Avenue) side, in an expansion designed by the original architects, which included a basement entrance at 1820 Park Avenue. In 1912, architect Frank A. Rooke removed the front stoops and stairs, which projected <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> public <b>sidewalk,</b> and rebuilt <b>the</b> entranceways.|$|R

5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, moving it <b>onto</b> from <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street. This was because designs for entrances inside the building failed to both satisfy the building's residents as well as meet the MTA's engineering requirements. With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction is finished, the MTA could widen <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> {{to make room for the}} entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|R

The parallel trail transitions to Pratt Street and continues eastward to Market Street, where it ends; the Jones Falls Trail then turns north onto Market Street on a wide <b>sidewalk.</b> <b>The</b> trail then turns east <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> north <b>sidewalk</b> of Lombard Street, then north again along the west bank of the namesake Jones Falls. As it then meets President Street, it turns north once again after crossing said street, continuing on <b>the</b> eastern <b>sidewalk.</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} critically {{the most}} important restrictions placed {{on the right to}} peaceful demonstration in Canada. Protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as a matter of constitutional law, the right is limited by a network of civil and penal sanctions in such a way that, in practice, its exercise is considerably restricted. Firstly, the protection afforded to owners of land under the law of property excludes all peaceful demonstration on private property without permission of the owner. Tossed as it is into <b>the</b> street and <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> <b>the</b> activity may also be seen to disturb other interests protected by law in the public domain. It is not infrequent that injunctions are brought against peaceful demonstrations {{on the grounds that they}} disrupt public order, that they harm the economic interests of private parties, or that they are the occasion for mischief or damage to property. In addition to the limits that originate in the law of civil liability, peaceful demonstration is restricted by criminal law, in particular the prohibition against unlawful assemblies, which permits the police to exercise a control over a demonstration and to intervene in order to prevent anticipated outbursts. The rules relating to the infraction of unlawful assembly allow the authorities to disperse the demonstrators at the first sign of tension in what amounts to a willful confusion, by the legislature, between acts of protest and acts of violence. Overall, the scope of this network of civil and penal sanctions is such as to suggest that the right to peaceful demonstration is something of a false promise...|$|R

A woman got out of the car, shouting at one of them, asking where he'd been all day, that he had left her alone with the kids. The man suddenly was alone and his buddies walked away. Chastened, he got in the car as the woman told him before pulling away: [...] "And one more thing, you're getting no sugar tonight". The words stuck in Bachman's memory.|$|R

5000|$|Lizbeth Amanda Zaragoza: (voiced by Melanie Tonello) The Captain's best friend, sidekick, and not-so-secret Chinese-Filipino admirer, Lizbeth {{is focused}} and organized, however, she's just {{a puddle of}} {{emotions}} {{when it comes to}} Milo Powell, her favourite square shaped boy. She's a devoted follower and chronicler of his heroics, and, unbeknownst to him, is the voice of the [...] "birdbrain" [...] that often inspires the Captain to save the day. Lizbeth is strong and smart but a bit of a loner because of it. Her best friend, besides Milo, is her monocled stuffed elephant confidante, Chester. Lizbeth is secure in the knowledge that girls mature faster than boys, so she knows one day Milo will catch up and appreciate her. So, for now, she's willing to guide him along and wait patiently for that special day. She acts so because Milo saved her life when they were babies, when Lizbeth nearly fell out of <b>the</b> sandbox <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> concrete <b>sidewalk</b> and Milo threw himself in front of her to save her, and never forgets about it (although witnesses say that what really happened was that Milo became distracted by a butterfly, and, unable to concentrate and keep himself up at the same time, fell down into a heap, unintentionally saving her).|$|R
5000|$|In 1989 stones from <b>the</b> facade fell <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Lexington Avenue <b>sidewalk.</b> No one was injured, but {{the church}} had to erect a wooden shelter to protect {{pedestrians}} from potential future incidents. That led to {{the restoration of the}} exterior over the next year, part of a $6 million campaign that began in 1987. Work on the stained glass windows proved particularly challenging because the original installers had forced them into spaces too small for them, making them hard to remove. It was necessary to hire more than the usual number of restorers, work overtime and locate the workshop in the dome rather than offsite {{in order to meet the}} church's fall 1997 deadlines. For several months during that time services were held in a nearby school auditorium. [...] The renovations were overseen by the firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer.|$|R
