In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT), began a civil war. Tombalbaye was overthrown and killed in 1975, but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions led by Hissène Habré took the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.|$|E

Despite the dissolution order, Nasser was the only RCC member who still favored holding parliamentary elections, according to his fellow officer Abdel Latif Boghdadi. Although outvoted, he still advocated holding elections by 1956. In March 1953, Nasser led the Egyptian delegation negotiating a British withdrawal from the Suez Canal.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{clamping}} down on {{the protests}} was a loss of legitimacy, {{and the emergence of}} Amin al-Hafiz as the first Ba'athist military strongman. The traditional elite, consisting of the upper classes, who had been overthrown from political power by the Ba'athists, felt threatened by the Ba'ath Party's socialist policies. The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was a historical rival of the Syrian Regional Branch, and it felt threatened by the party's secular nature.

5|$|One of {{the main}} impacts of the {{revolution}} in Zanzibar was to break {{the power of the}} Arab/Asian ruling class, who had held it for around 200 years. Despite the merger with Tanganyika, Zanzibar retained a Revolutionary Council and House of Representatives which was, until 1992, run on a <b>one-party</b> <b>system</b> and has power over domestic matters. The domestic government is led by the President of Zanzibar, Karume being the first holder of this office. This government used the success of the revolution to implement reforms across the island. Many of these involved the removal of power from Arabs. The Zanzibar civil service, for example, became an almost entirely African organisation, and land was redistributed from Arabs to Africans. The revolutionary government also instituted social reforms such as free healthcare and opening up the education system to African students (who had occupied only 12% of secondary school places before the revolution).|$|E

5000|$|African leaders {{consistently}} viewed socialism as {{a direct}} rejection of the colonial system and, in turn, dismissed the notion of creating independent capitalist systems throughout the continent. Instead, the leaders attempted to infuse various forms of socialism—some Marxist, some democratic—into tailored ideologies specific to each country. Once these systems were in place, countries developed towards a [...] "focal institutional" [...] society, per sociologist William Friedland.

40|$|Our paper {{addresses}} {{one of the}} {{key issues}} that confront emerging democracies in Africa: how can we explain the emergence and endurance of <b>one-party</b> dominant party <b>system</b> in African democracies? Experts were worried that the adoption of democracy would lead to highly fragmented party systems in Africa, because of the deep ethnic divisions on this continent. However, this did not happen. In contrast, party systems with one major dominant party emerged and have prevailed in many new African democracies. Our paper focuses on the actual explanations of emergence and endurance of dominant <b>one-party</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on previous research, we will distinguish six different explanations: historical legacy, social cleavages and types of fragmentation, access to state-resources, political culture, regime performance and institutional factors. By comparing different countries, we aim to detect the most convincing explanations in the African context...|$|R
25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, Mexico was {{dominated}} by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Discontent with this <b>one-party</b> <b>system</b> became prominent in the northern states of Mexico, including Sonora. As early as 1967, a competing party, the National Action Party (PAN), won control of the city government of Sonora's capital, Hermosillo. PAN won important municipal victories {{in the state in}} 1983, which President de la Madrid refused to officially recognize but was forced to let stand. PAN's growing strength by the 1980s forced the PRI to nominate candidates who were similar to PAN, successful business executives who favored economic liberalization over traditional Mexican statism, preferred in the north of the country. Institutional Revolutionary Party won the Sonoran gubernatorial race in 1985, but it was heavily contested with obvious problems of fraud. By the 1990s, PRI operatives caught manipulating election results were actually prosecuted by the Sonoran state attorney. This along with other events in the country eventually led {{to the end of the}} <b>one-party</b> <b>system</b> when Vicente Fox was elected president in 2000. PAN has since dominated most of the north of the country, but Sonora did not have its first PAN governor until 2009, with the election of Guillermo Padrés Elías.|$|E

25|$|Although the Second Republic {{was inaugurated}} in December 1972, the National Assembly {{did not approve}} the new {{constitution}} until August 1973.

The liberal recommendations would also have required electoral competition for the post of President, and prevented him from vetoing parliamentary candidates. Although many of the report's recommendations were ignored, it had a lasting influence: it was cited during the debate on the return to multi-party democracy in 1990–91, and again during the campaign to stop President Frederick Chiluba running for a third term in 2001.|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, while a global pivot towards {{democracy}} was slowly accepted into civil society, authoritarian regimes began losing legitimacy. Paradoxically, {{the spread of}} democracy was accompanied by the insurgence of patriarchal one-party autocracies. This phenomenon catalyzed my interest to research into gender parity and one-party rule, the differences between a one-party state and a <b>one-party</b> dominant <b>system,</b> and the overall implications of adding gender quotas in party and state politics. The paper focuses {{on the relationship between}} women’s political participation in legislatures and <b>one-party</b> <b>systems</b> in three countries: China, Turkey and South Africa. The aim of the research is to uncover the impact and trend of one-party rule on women representation in legislature. As a result, the research will clarify whether there are differences in political treatment of women in a one-party state in China and one-party dominant state like South Africa. Another layer of the research will illustrate the impact of women’s participation in legislature where a democratic state begins to show signs of one-party dominance like Turkey. I qualitatively and quantitatively depict how each unique system identifies women’s political participation {{and whether or not they}} use democratic tactics to increase the number of women in their legislature...|$|R

40|$|After 1989 the {{countries}} of Eastern Europe embarked upon new directions away from central economies and <b>one-party</b> <b>systems</b> towards market economies and democratic systems.

In particular, those regimes which suffered from greater political divisiveness and significant economic problems {{were more likely to be}} confronted with a crisis of legitimacy. In this paper, the legitimation crisis theory is examined for postcommunist Czechoslovakia and Hungary. It is found that the developments in Czechoslovakia and Hungary during this early transition period support the hypothesis, and, in addition, they hold implications for the survival of other transitional regimes as well as those in the West which have increasingly been confronted with questions of legitimacy. ...|$|R

Bernard Kolélas, leader of the Mouvement Congolais pour la Démocratie et la Développement Integral (MCDDI) party, formed the Ninjas, recruiting from his party. After the disputed 1993 elections, violent conflict between the militias began. In this conflict, which lasted until 1994, the Ninjas were allied with Sassou Nguesso's Cobras against Lissouba's Cocoyes. In December 1995, the parties in the conflict signed a peace treaty where they agreed that militiamen aged 18–24 would be integrated into the national gendarmerie and police force. UNESCO also launched a plan to disarm the militias. These programs to pacify the country were controversial and unsuccessful, and the militias survived. In peacetime, the morale among the Ninjas suffered due to lack of payments.|$|E
