Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians.

This article reports on a Washington State project that studied docu-mentation <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> school nurse interventions, the scope of the school nurse role, and the infrastructure necessary to report <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> school nursing. A literature review about <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> school nursing was conducted. Twenty-two leaders in school nurse issues were interviewed. The literature review yielded 15 articles documenting positive <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> school nursing. Inter-view analysis revealed leader ideas about important <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> school nurse services and the infrastructure needed to document the impact of school nursing. The existing literature on posi-tive outcomes addresses a limited portion of the school nurse role. Components of infrastructure necessary to document outcomes are delineated. Resources for infrastructure development are discussed...|$|R

The study sorted out the general grounds for applying the <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> task-related detecting operation at criminal trial, namely: a) by their relevance for immediate investigation, or preliminary inquiry or court trial; b) by their form of presentation (in writing, orally); c) depending on transcripts available upon {{the sources of}} information received. The study considered several issues <b>of</b> applying the <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> the carried task-related detecting operations {{that should not be}} subject to transcripts, and particularly emphasized that generally such outcomes to apply for tactical purposes, while setting out leads.   The author presented the survey upon statistics data showing the <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> study conducted on implementation by task force officers of a task-related detecting operation named «interrogatories». Thus, 39 % of respondents explained that «interrogatories» gave rise to taking statements for using them in criminal trial, 37 % made use of statements taken for task-related purposes, 13 % conduct «interrogatories» for preparing and carrying out other TRDO, 11 % use TRDO «interrogatories» for tactical purposes. Finally, the paper examined a contribution made by the «Instructions on a procedure <b>of</b> presenting the <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> the task-related detecting operation to a body of immediate investigation, to a preliminary inquiry officer or in court» in completing criminal proceedings with the <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> task-related detecting operation data.   </p...|$|R
