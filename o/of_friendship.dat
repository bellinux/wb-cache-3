5|$|Just {{north of}} the town line, NY275 enters the hamlet of Nile, where it becomes a two-lane {{residential}} street named Pennsylvania Avenue. In {{the center of the}} community, the route meets the east end of CR1 (Fifth Avenue). From here, NY275 bends back to the north, crossing through rural sections of the town <b>of</b> <b>Friendship</b> mostly populated by farms. The rural surroundings end ahead of the hamlet <b>of</b> <b>Friendship,</b> where NY275 heads through the residential western portion of the community. Near the center <b>of</b> <b>Friendship,</b> the highway intersects CR20 (West Main Street), the primary east–west street through the hamlet. NY275 continues on, crossing over the Norfolk Southern Railway's Southern Tier Line (formerly the Erie Railroad's Main Line) to reach exit29 of the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and NY17). NY275 ends at the exit ramp leading away from the westbound direction of the freeway; however, NY275's right-of-way continues north to NY19 in Belfast as CR17.|$|E

5|$|When the Ba'ath Party nationalised the Iraq Petroleum Company, the Iraqi Government sent Saddam Hussein, the Vice President of Iraq, to {{negotiate}} a trade agreement with the Soviet Union to soften the anticipated loss of revenue. When Hussein visited the Soviet Union, {{he managed to get}} a trade agreement and a treaty <b>of</b> <b>friendship.</b> When Kosygin visited Iraq in 1972, he and Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, the President of Iraq signed and ratified the Iraqi–Soviet Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Friendship</b> and Co-operation. The alliance also forced the Iraqi Ba'athist government to temporarily stop their prosecution of the Iraqi Communist Party (ICP). The ICP was even given two ministerships following the establishment of an alliance between the Soviet Union and Iraq. The following year, in 1973, al-Bakr went on a state visit to the Soviet Union, and met Brezhnev personally. Relations between the two countries only soured in 1976 when the Iraq Ba'athist regime started a mass campaign against the ICP and other communists.
