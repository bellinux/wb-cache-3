500|$|K. K. Senthil Kumar scouted for {{locations}} in Gujarat, looking for dry, open lands {{to shoot the}} chariot race sequence. They found salt lands with white sands in Dholavira. To shoot the sequence there, they wanted a light weight vehicle to follow the horses; they bought a Maruti van, removed the vehicle's top and mounted the camera along with a jimmy jib atop it. A part of the song Dheera Dheera was also shot there, requiring filmmakers to plant a dry tree {{and a couple of}} oxen for use in the song's backdrop. An item number featuring Kim Sharma and Ram Charan was shot in late June 2008 in a specially erected fisherman colony. It was set up {{on the first floor of}} Annapurna Studios and cost less than 3 million. Ravinder explained, [...] "The set should look like an outdoor location, but need to be constructed in an indoor floor. I constructed exteriors of around 28 houses in that floor with detailed interior plan for the house of Srihari. I also constructed a small boat and a big wheeled fish with thermocol. When director wanted smoke-effect for a shot I held the heavy smoke machine <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> in a low angle for the required effect." ...|$|E
500|$|Strindberg wooed Bosse {{by sending}} her books about {{theosophy}} and the occult, {{by attempting to}} mould her mind, and by furthering her career. Throwing himself into writing plays with central parts he considered suitable for her, he tried to persuade her to act them, and the Dramaten management to cast her in them. [...] Bosse asserts in her edition of the Letters that she tended to hang back, as did the management, being in agreement that she lacked the experience for major and complex roles. Strindberg, a power in the theatre, nevertheless often prevailed. The role of Eleonora in Easter (1901), which intimidated Bosse by its sensitivity and delicacy, but which she finally undertook to play, {{turned out to be}} Bosse's most successful and beloved role, and a turning-point in Bosse's and Strindberg's relationship. They became engaged in March 1901, during the rehearsals of Easter, in what in Bosse's narrative may be the best-known incident of the Strindberg legend. Bosse relates how she went to see Strindberg to ask him to give the part to a more experienced actress, but he assured her she would be perfect for it. [...] "Then he placed his hands <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> looked at me long and ardently, and asked: 'Would you like to have a little child with me, Miss Bosse?' I made a curtsey and answered, as though hypnotized: 'Yes, thank you!'—and we were engaged." ...|$|E

During the crossing, the river became swollen and the child seemed as heavy as lead, so much that Christopher could scarcely carry him and found himself in great difficulty. When he finally reached the other side, {{he said to the}} child: [...] "You have put me in the greatest danger. I do not think the whole world could have been as heavy <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> as you were." [...] The child replied: [...] "You had on your shoulders not only the whole world but Him who made it. I am Christ your king, whom you are serving by this work." [...] The child then vanished.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2010, Horton {{was signed}} by Zimbabwean side Matabeleland Tuskers. He {{described}} {{his role in the}} squad as [...] "...to get runs in all forms of the game and also bring an approach and a dedication to the game that rubs off {{on the rest of the}} squad. To have that added responsibility <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> can only make me a better person and a better cricketer in the forthcoming season for Lancashire." [...] In a match against the Mountaineers in November, Horton scored his first T20 half-century, beating his previous best of 44. He set another personal best two months later in a match against Southern Rocks; Horton scored his maiden first-class double-century. The innings of 209 beat his previous highest score of 173.|$|E
2500|$|After his death, Kharlamov's {{teammates}} with CSKA {{decided that}} no one at any level of the organization would wear Kharlamov's #17 sweater, until his son Alexander {{was old enough to}} wear it. Alexander wore #17 until he was a teenager, but later switched to #22, feeling that the expectations that went along with his father's sweater number were too great. When he found himself playing for Tikhonov with the Central Red Army club in 1992, the decision was taken away from him, and he was issued the #17 sweater. After initially being reluctant, Alexander said [...] "Now I am used to it. I felt an additional burden <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders.</b> But now I don't feel anything like that." [...] The #17 is not worn by any member of the Russian national team at senior international competitions. Ilya Kovalchuk who usually wears #17 in honour of Kharlamov, his father's favorite player, dons the reverse #71 for international play.|$|E
2500|$|Adams' {{retirement}} in May 2002 meant Vieira became club captain. He described the feeling as [...] "daunting", {{but it was}} something he looked forward to: [...] "Taking the responsibility <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> is something I relish. It will make me a better, more mature footballer and a more mature person as well." [...] Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in September 2002, Vieira was sent off for a late tackle on Gianfranco Zola; Arsenal's persistence nevertheless earnt them a point. In an interview with L'Équipe soon after, Vieira spoke of his desire to rest, as he felt [...] "burned out": [...] "I can hardly stand. My back aches, my legs hurt, it hurts all over. I'm going to see Arsène. He must give me time off to relax." [...] He featured in 66 games the previous campaign for Arsenal, but Wenger rejected the player's need for special treatment: [...] "I looked at the statistics for Tuesday's game and, physically, Patrick was outstanding. He pushed himself very hard and that explains why he was so tired." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the making}} of King of Kings, The Honeymoon Machine, and How The West Was Won, as Bazlen was still only 17 years of age at the time, she had to attend {{educational}} classes between takes in order {{to comply with the}} Los Angeles Board of Education's requirement that she carry out three hours of study per day Monday to Friday. Moreover, when answering a question during this time about whether young people were misunderstood by the older generation, she said [...] "Yes, but I'm sure that's been the case down the ages. It's too much to expect people of the older generation completely to understand people of my age. Some {{of the ways in which}} we behave were unheard of in my mother's young days, but each generation finds different symbols to express its discontent." [...] Also, when asked at the same time about how she felt about her rapid rise to stardom at such a young age, Bazlen said [...] "I realise what a lucky person I am and I'm anxious to repay the trust a lot of important people have placed in me. Reaching so high so young has put a lot of responsibility <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> but I feel that responsibility is part of the pattern of living and it is not to be taken lightly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Red Sox {{pitching}} coach John Farrell stated that Buchholz {{would most likely}} be in line for 180–190 innings in the 2008 season. On May 15, Buchholz {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list {{as the result of a}} torn fingernail. He was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket following the injury, and remained there for several weeks to work on his fastball. On July 11, he was recalled to Boston and was part of their regular pitching rotation, though he did not record a single win after his return. On August 20, as the Red Sox were trying to sweep the Orioles, the team that Buchholz had no-hit the preceding year, he gave up a 4–0 lead by allowing three runs in the second inning and two more in the third. He was removed after only pitching [...] innings. In his previous start, he had only lasted three innings. In 2008, the Red Sox were 3–12 in Buchholz' fifteen starts. After the game, Buchholz was demoted to Double-A Portland. Buchholz stated [...] "I've never had a streak like this", and [...] "I've never been one to say the pressure was too much for me, but I've felt like I've had a lot of weight <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> just trying to be perfect and trying to do everything as well as I could to help this team win". Following the 2008 season, Buchholz pitched in the Arizona Fall League.|$|E
