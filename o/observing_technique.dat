40|$|Recent {{concern over}} {{possible}} long term stratospheric changes {{caused by the}} introduction of man-made compounds has increased the need for instrumentation that can accurately measure stratospheric minor constituents. The technique of radio spectroscopy at millimeter wavelengths was first used to observe rotational transitions of stratospheric ozone nearly two decades ago, but has not been highly developed until recently. A ground-based <b>observing</b> <b>technique</b> is reported which employs a millimeter-wave superheterodyne receiver and multichannel filter spectrometer for measurements of stratospheric constituents that have peak volume mixing ratios that are less than 10 to the - 9 th, more than 3 orders of magnitude less than that for ozone. The technique is used for an extensive program of observations of stratospheric chlorine monoxide and also for observations of other stratospheric trace gases such as (O- 16) 3, vibrationally excited (O- 16) 3, (O- 18) 2 (O- 16), N 2 O, HO 2, and HCN.

40|$|Integral Field Spectroscopy is a {{powerful}} <b>observing</b> <b>technique</b> for As-tronomy that is becoming available at most ground-based observatories {{as well as in}} space. The complex data obtained with this technique require new approaches for visualization. Typical requirements and the p 3 d tool, as an example, are discussed. 1 Integral Field Spectroscopy Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS), which is – somewhat confusingly – also called “ 3 D ” or “tri-dimensional ” spectroscopy”, “two-dimensional ” or “area” spectroscopy and so forth, and which is known in other areas beyond astron-omy under terms like e. g. “hyperspectral imaging”, is {{a powerful}} <b>observing</b> <b>technique</b> that has been introduced and refined over the past two decades. It is now at the verge of becoming a standard tool, which is available at most modern telescopes Roth (2010). For practical reasons, some users have, furthermore, adopted the intuitively descriptive terminology “ 3 D ” as a ref-erence to the datacube, which is thought to be the product of an observation (cf. Fig. 1). IFS is an astronomical observing method that in a single exposure cre-ates spectra of (typically many) spatial elements (“spaxels”) simultaneously over a two-dimensional field-of-view (FoV) on the sky. Owing to this sam-pling method, each spaxel can be associated with its individual spectrum. Once all of the spectra have been extracted from the detector frame, in the a...|$|E

The total flux of Cas A measured at 850 m does present a fairly large excess over the flux expected from synchrotron emission alone (as extrapolated from lower frequency data), but it remains unclear whether this excess is real and reflects the presence of large amounts of cold dust, or if it is an artifact of the <b>observing</b> <b>technique...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{results of}} the CCD {{photometry}} of the 1995 FG Virginis multi-site campaign, organized by the Delta Scuti Network, are presented. Between March 16 and April 20, 1995 over 120 hours of CCD measurements were obtained. The ten frequencies of FG Vir, known from the previous campaign (1993), range from 9. 20 to 34. 12 cycles/day (106. 5 and 394. 9 µHz). Three new frequencies at 16. 07, 19. 23 and 24. 19 c/d (186. 0, 222. 5 and 279. 9 µHz) were detected. The precision of the FG Vir measurements was better than 3. 5 mmag per single 1 -min integration.

30|$|For the {{determination}} of current space weather conditions {{and their impact on}} the ionosphere, real-time specification is usually preferable to modelling. The problem with specification, however, is that it relies on the assimilation of real-time observations which are often very sparse, meaning that underlying theoretical constraints are needed, for example to regularise the observation grid. Certain types of observation themselves need to be supplemented by modelling. For example, {{one of the most widely}} available <b>observing</b> <b>techniques</b> is ground-based vertical-incidence HF sounding; but this technique cannot provide any information on the shape of the topside ionospheric profile, and models based on the ionospheric-scale height are used to provide this information (e.g. Reinisch et al. 2001 a; Belehaki and Kersley 2006). In addition, during very disturbed conditions, the signal is absorbed in the ionosphere. <b>Observing</b> <b>techniques</b> including incoherent scatter radars (Farley 1996) like EISCAT_ 3 D, sounding data from satellites (Reinisch et al. 2001 b), ionospheric tomography (Leitinger 1996), or radio occultation measurements (Jakowski 2005) can be used to obtain the missing information.|$|R
