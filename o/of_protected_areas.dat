40|$|AbstractIn {{a context}} of {{unprecedented}} environmental crisis, <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> are expected to play a central role. Although considerable {{work has been done}} to understand the effectiveness of different types <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area,</b> there has been limited investigation of how a combination of different types <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> within a system affects its overall environmental outcomes. Defining and using the concept of environmental complementarity, the paper explores whether or not the presence of private, state and community <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in a landscape has a positive effect on biodiversity conservation outcomes. Based on a Kenyan case study, it emphasizes the important and currently undervalued role <b>of</b> state <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> and shows that other types <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> can be analyzed as being a support. It suggests there is a complex array of complementarities between community, state and private <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> Differences in management capacity, staff skills, social acceptability, access to financial resources, tourism products, ecological resources, etc. between types <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> were found to drive additionality and synergistic complementarities that undeniably contribute to strengthening the overall <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> system and increasing its resilience, as well as its capacity to generate environmental outcomes...|$|R

5000|$|A Regional Reserve {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> used in South Australia {{that allows}} the use of natural {{resources}} {{in conjunction with the}} <b>protected</b> <b>area’s</b> conservation function. This class <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> was first used in 1988 for the Innamincka Regional Reserve and as of 2015, there are seven regional reserves that cover an area of 93400 km2 or 9.5% of South Australia’s land area.|$|R
5|$|The Territory officially {{became the}} Australian Capital Territory in 1938. Canberra {{was built to}} {{accommodate}} the government, while the surrounding area was developed to support the city, including the construction of dams, the establishment of plantation forests and the creation <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> An advisory council was established in 1930, with some elected representation.|$|E
5|$|Various {{conservation}} {{techniques are}} employed {{to prevent these}} extinctions, including laws and regulations to control hunting pressure, the establishment <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> to prevent further habitat loss, the establishment of captive populations for reintroduction back into the wild (ex situ conservation), and the translocation of individuals to suitable habitats to create additional populations.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} {{issue is how}} to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts through the use <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred. It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain {{a high level of}} genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E

40|$|The {{changing}} paradigm <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> {{management has}} evolved quite {{significantly from the}} pleasuring-ground of Yellowstone through {{a strong emphasis on}} wildlife protection to a more recent acknowledgement that <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> alone cannot guarantee the conservation of biodiversity. With strong endorsement from IUCN there have been many complementary developments that address this gap in capacity for any <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> system. While there may be concerns about the prospect <b>of</b> undervaluing traditional <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> (mostly unfounded), the new directions are widely embraced as value adding the system. They come with a price. Adopting a more inclusive framework for biodiversity conservation creates many challenges for managers <b>of</b> traditional <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> This paper explores the experiences <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> managers in adapting to the new framework and identifies the ways in which new management has to change...|$|R

5|$|During the {{considerations}} {{prior to}} the establishment of the national park, there was a conflict with the mining industry. Svalbard Minerals had found baryte within the national park borders, and Arktikugol holds two mining claim areas just south of the national park. The national park was established on 9 September 2005. It completed a several-year-long plan to increase the amount <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> of Svalbard from 55% to 65%, which had two years earlier resulted in Nordenskiöld Land National Park, Sassen – Bünsow Land National Park and Nordre Isfjorden National Park.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the International Union for Conservation of Nature set up {{a status}} survey and {{conservation}} action plan for dragonflies.

5|$|It may {{always have}} been thinly spread, {{but there has been}} {{widespread}} deforestation within its range resulting in loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat. The rail has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972, and the large Lore Lindu and Bogani Nani Wartabone National Parks are within its range, but logging and rattan cutting occurs even in these protected areas, and human encroachment is also a problem at Lore Lindu. The rail has been trapped for food in the past, and is sometimes killed by dogs, cats and other introduced predators. A 2007 survey <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> of Sulawesi failed to find the rail, suggesting that it is genuinely rare even in reserves.|$|E
5|$|N. menagensis {{is listed}} in CITES Appendix I, which {{prevents}} international commercial trade; it is also protected by Indonesian law. The species is often confused with other slow lorises in animal rescue centers, as it is not well-covered in field guides. The species occurs in a number <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> throughout its range, including some fragmented forests. Threats to the species include the illegal local exotic pet trade and habitat loss due to burning and conversion to palm oil plantations. Additionally, uncontrolled release of pets in some areas is also {{a threat to the}} species.|$|E

5|$|It {{is listed}} in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which means it is not {{considered}} threatened with extinction, but hunting and trading must be closely monitored. The animal is regulated in all three of its range countries, and is found in a number <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> of the United States, its principal territory. Estimates from the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the US in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II. Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy. The IUCN lists it as a species of least concern, noting it is relatively widespread and abundant, but information from southern Mexico is poor.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} (Crocuta crocuta), {{also known as}} the {{laughing}} hyena, is a species of hyena, currently classed as the sole member of the genus Crocuta, native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN on account of its widespread range and large numbers estimated between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals. The species is, however, experiencing declines outside <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> due to habitat loss and poaching. The species may have originated in Asia, and once ranged throughout Europe for at least one million years {{until the end of the}} Late Pleistocene. The spotted hyena is the largest known member of the Hyaenidae, and is further physically distinguished from other species by its vaguely bear-like build, its rounded ears, its less prominent mane, its spotted pelt, its more dual purposed dentition, its fewer nipples and the presence of a pseudo-penis in the female. It is the only mammalian species to lack an external vaginal opening.|$|E
