Based on analysis of raw materials (fluid ash), various ingredients and additives were added to the mixtures in order to modify the composition or rheological properties of the fresh mixtures.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1926, Meyer {{had written to}} Irène Joliot-Curie {{suggesting}} that Rona work with her to learn how his laboratory could make their own polonium samples. Once Hans Pettersson was able to secure funds to pay Rona's expenses, Joliot-Curie allowed her to come and study polonium separation at the Curie Institute in Paris. Rona developed an enhanced method <b>of</b> <b>preparing</b> polonium sources and producing alpha-emissions.(α-emission). Gaining recognition as {{an expert in the}} field, she took those skills back to the Radium Institute along with a small disc of polonium. This disc allowed Rona to create lab specimens of polonium, which were used in much of the Institute's subsequent research.|$|E

5|$|In 1835, Elizabeth Lummis {{published}} {{her first}} book, entitled Poems, Translated and Original, which included her tragedy, Teresa Contarini, {{based on the}} history of Venice, that was successfully performed in New York and other cities. Around this time she married William Henry Ellet (1806–1859), a chemist from New York City. He graduated from Columbia College in New York and earned a gold medal for a dissertation on the compounds of cyanogen. The couple moved to Columbia, South Carolina, when he was made professor of chemistry, mineralogy and geology at South Carolina College in 1836. He also discovered a new and inexpensive method <b>of</b> <b>preparing</b> guncotton, for which the state of South Carolina presented him a service of silver plate.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond <b>of</b> <b>preparing</b> hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack {{and see how they}} would act to defend the ship. Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played with wooden sticks with wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist. Many of the crew became very expert.|$|E

40|$|Effects of ZnO {{nanoparticles}} combined {{radio frequency}} (RF) heating on the sterilization and product quality attributes (hardness, color, carotenoids and microstructure) <b>of</b> <b>prepared</b> carrots were investigated comparing to ZnO nanoparticles or RF heating treatment alone. The {{results showed that}} the combined sterilization effect of ZnO nanoparticles with radio frequency treatments was superior to ZnO nanoparticles or RF heating treatment alone and extended the shelf life <b>of</b> <b>prepared</b> carrots up to 60 days. ZnO nanoparticles combining RF heating 20 mm/ 20 min (plate spacing/RF heating time) reduced the loss of hardness, color difference value (AE), and carotenoids <b>of</b> <b>prepared</b> carrots. The Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) showed that the cell microstructure <b>of</b> <b>prepared</b> carrots that treated by RF treatments within 20 min was most closely integrated with each other. Therefore, the experimental results of ZnO nanoparticles combined with radio frequency heating could be helpful for food processing industries to produce high quality sterilized prepared carrots...|$|R
40|$|The Master thesis {{deals with}} {{utilization}} possibilities of fly ash after selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) process for Portland cement preparation as a correction component to {{the raw material}} with regard to contaminated fly ash by ammonium sulphate or ammonium hydrogensulfate {{that is one of}} the products from SNCR process. Presented thesis was focused on behaviour of raw meal with ammonia hydrogensulfate contaminated fly ash after SNCR during burning of Portland clinker in simulated kiln conditions. The thesis deals with Portland clinker preparation from this kind of raw mix and it studies mainly clinker quality, clinker phases and structure. Quantitative phase composition <b>of</b> <b>prepared</b> samples <b>of</b> clinker was performed by optical microscopy measurements using point counting method and XRD analysis (Rietveld method). Hydration heat flow <b>of</b> <b>prepared</b> clinker was measured by Isothermal Calorimetry. TG-DTA analysis <b>of</b> <b>prepared</b> raw meal was studied due to better comparison <b>of</b> <b>prepared</b> samples and better understanding of processes during burning process...|$|R

5|$|Laid up at Chatham {{during the}} years of peace, Bellerophon was not {{commissioned}} until July 1790, when the crisis known as the Spanish Armament broke out. As war with Spain threatened, warships lying in ordinary began to be commissioned and fitted for sea. Bellerophons first commander, Captain Thomas Pasley, arrived on 19 July and began the process <b>of</b> <b>preparing</b> her for service. After a month spent fitting out the ship with guns, masts, stores and rigging, and recruiting a crew, Pasley gave the orders for his crew to slip the moorings on 16 August, and Bellerophon made her way down the Medway to the fleet anchorage at the Nore.|$|E

His father assisted him in the task <b>of</b> <b>preparing</b> the necessary references, but died on 2 April at Glenlair before either knew the result of Maxwell's candidacy.

5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea is the morel that is {{cultivated}} commercially per US patents 4594809 and 4757640. This {{process was}} developed in 1982 by Ronald Ower with {{what he thought was}} Morchella esculenta; M.rufobrunnea had not yet been described. The cultivation protocol consists <b>of</b> <b>preparing</b> a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This mixture is laid on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotia—hardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these sclerotia grow into morels.|$|E
5|$|Recovering uranium and {{plutonium}} from spent {{nuclear fuel}} for reuse {{is one of the}} major processes of the nuclear fuel cycle.

Many separation methods have been used to separate out the neptunium, operating on small and large scales.
