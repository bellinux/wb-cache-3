40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the biology and ecology of the world’s largest (heaviest) bony fish, the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> Mola mola, despite its {{worldwide}} occurrence in temperate and tropical seas. Studies are now emerging that require many common perceptions about sunfish behaviour and ecology to be re-examined. Indeed, the long-held view that <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> are an inactive, passively drifting species seems to be entirely misplaced. Technological advances in marine telemetry are revealing distinct behavioural patterns and protracted seasonal movements. Extensive forays by <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> into the deep ocean have been documented and broad-scale surveys, together with molecular and laboratory based techniques, are addressing the connectivity and trophic role of these animals. These emerging molecular and movement studies suggest that local distinct populations may be prone to depletion through bycatch in commercial fisheries. Rising interest in <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish,</b> highlighted by the increase in recent publications, warrants a thorough review of the biology and ecology of this species. Here we review the taxonomy, morphology, geography, diet, locomotion, vision, movements, foraging ecology, reproduction and species interactions of M. mola. We present a summary of current conservation issues and suggest methods for addressing fundamental gaps in our knowledge...|$|R

40|$|Determining {{the habitat}} use of mobile marine species is {{important}} for understanding responses to climate change and aids the implementation of management and conservation measures. Inference of preferred habitat use has been greatly improved by combining satellite-based oceanographic data with animal tracking techniques. Although {{there have been several}} satellite-tracking studies on <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> Mola mola, limited information is available about either horizontal or vertical environmental preferences. In this study, both geographical movements and diving behaviour of <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> were explored together with the environmental factors influencing this species’ space use in the north-east Atlantic...|$|R

50|$|Tetradontiform: dorsal and anal fins are flapped as a unit, {{either in}} phase or exactly {{opposing}} one another. The <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> {{is an extreme}} example of this form of locomotion.|$|R
50|$|Robert Collett, who {{examined}} {{some of the}} first known specimens of sharptail mola, speculated they might represent abnormal <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes</b> that had retained larval characteristics. However, the caudal projection is now known to be a secondary development that follows the loss of the primary tail. The swimming mode of the sharptail {{is similar to that of}} other <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes,</b> using sculling motions of its long dorsal and anal fins to propel itself through the water. The anal fin moves more extensively than the dorsal fin. The small pectoral fins move constantly to control pitch, while the clavus is employed as a rudder.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> is the {{heaviest}} bony {{fish in the}} world, while the longest is the king of herrings, a type of oarfish. Specimens of <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> have been observed up to 3.3 m in length and weighing up to 2303 kg. Other very large bony fish include the Atlantic blue marlin, some specimens {{of which have been}} recorded as in excess of 820 kg, the black marlin, some sturgeon species, and the giant and goliath grouper, which both can exceed 300 kg in weight. In contrast, the dwarf pygmy goby measures a minute 15 mm.|$|R
50|$|While {{the first}} <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> {{to be held}} in an {{aquarium}} in the United States is claimed to have arrived at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in August 1986, other specimens have previously been held at other locations. Marineland of the Pacific, closed since 1998 and located on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County, California, held an <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> in its warm-water tank as early as 1957, and in 1964 held a 650 lb specimen, claimed as the largest ever captured at that time. However, another 1000 lb specimen was brought alive to Marineland Studios Aquarium, near St. Augustine, Florida, in 1941.|$|R
50|$|Arapaima gigas is {{the largest}} species of {{freshwater}} bony fish. The largest bony fish ever was Leedsichthys, which dwarfed the beluga sturgeon, <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish,</b> giant grouper, {{and all the other}} giant bony fishes alive today.|$|R
50|$|Accacoelium contortum is a {{parasitic}} flatworm of {{the class}} Trematoda. It lives in the gills and oral cavity of the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish,</b> Mola mola, and was first described by Swedish-born naturalist Karl Rudolphi in 1819.|$|R
50|$|A {{member of}} the order Tetraodontiformes, which also {{includes}} pufferfish, porcupinefish, and filefish, the sunfish shares many traits common to members of this order. The <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish,</b> Mola mola, is the type species of the genus.|$|R
50|$|More than 40 {{species of}} parasites may reside {{on the skin}} and internally, {{motivating}} the fish to seek relief {{in a number of}} ways. One of the most frequent <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> parasites is the flatworm, Accacoelium contortum.|$|R
50|$|Between April {{and the end}} of July each year, <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> {{are kept}} in a net cage 10 m by 10 m and 5 m deep. When the water {{temperature}} rises, they release the fish into the wild.|$|R
50|$|Two {{ships of}} the United States Navy have borne the name USS Sunfish, {{named in honor}} of the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish,</b> Mola mola, a plectognath marine fish, having a deep body {{truncated}} behind, and high dorsal and anal fins.|$|R
50|$|In tetraodontiform locomotion, the dorsal and anal fins are flapped as a unit, {{either in}} phase or exactly {{opposing}} one another, {{as seen in}} the Tetraodontiformes (boxfishes and pufferfishes). The <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> displays an extreme example of this mode.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> {{are native}} to the {{temperate}} and tropical waters of every ocean in the world. Mola genotypes appear to vary widely between the Atlantic and Pacific, but genetic differences between individuals in the Northern and Southern hemispheres are minimal.|$|R
50|$|USS Sunfish (SS-281), a Gato-class submarine, was {{the first}} ship of the United States Navy to be named for the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish,</b> Mola Mola, a plectognath marine fish, having a deep body {{truncated}} behind, and high dorsal and anal fins.|$|R
50|$|USS Sunfish (SSN-649), a Sturgeon-class attack submarine, was {{the second}} ship of the United States Navy to be named for the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> (Mola mola), a marine species having a deep body {{truncated}} behind, and high dorsal and anal fins.|$|R
50|$|Austromola angerhoferi is an {{extinct species}} of the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfishes</b> (Molidae). It is known from the Lower Miocene Ebelsberg Formation near Pucking, Austria. This species was a {{resident}} of the Paratethys Sea and is estimated to have reached a length around 320 cm.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> {{can become}} so infested with skin parasites, they will often invite small fish or even birds to feast on them. Sunfish will even breach the surface up to 10 ft in the air, {{in an attempt}} to shake the parasites.|$|R
50|$|Fringing and patch {{coral reefs}} are {{extensive}} and best developed on the north-east coast of Komodo. The park {{is rich in}} marine life, including whale sharks, <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish,</b> manta rays, eagle rays, pygmy seahorse, false pipefish, clown frogfish, nudibranchs, blue-ringed octopus, sponges, tunicates, and coral.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] A lion's mane jellyfish, {{so long as}} {{it remains}} in cold oceanic waters out of the range of the {{leatherback}} turtle and the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> is an invulnerable predator that ensnares and stings to death a wide range of prey despite, like other cnidarians, having no brain.|$|R
50|$|Triacanthidae, {{commonly}} known as triplespines or tripodfishes, is a family of Indo-Pacific fishes. It is classified in the order Tetraodontiformes, along with the pufferfishes and the <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish.</b> The family consists of seven species in four genera, in addition to one extinct genus that only is known from fossils.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aquarium}} contains 60 tanks, {{with a total}} {{tank volume}} of [...] The largest tank contains 20,000 individuals of about 80 species. The shark tank contains two species of sharks, and includes a tunnel which lets visitors walk under the fish. The [...] sunfish tank contains 8 individual <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish.</b>|$|R
50|$|Predators of the lion's mane {{jellyfish}} include seabirds, larger fish such as <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish,</b> other jellyfish species, and {{sea turtle}}s. The {{leatherback sea turtle}} feeds almost exclusively on them in large quantities during the summer season around Eastern Canada. The jellyfish themselves feed mostly on zooplankton, small fish, ctenophores, and moon jellies.|$|R
50|$|In addition, animals which favour warm {{waters and}} which {{have never been}} seen {{as far north as}} Alaska, have been spotted, {{examples}} being the warm water thresher sharks (Alopias spp) and <b>ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> (Mola mola). In the spring of 2016, acres of Velella velella were reported in the waters south of the Copper River Delta.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>sunfish</b> {{may live}} up to ten years in captivity, but their {{lifespan}} in a natural habitat {{has not yet been}} determined. Their growth rate is also undetermined. However, a young specimen at the Monterey Bay Aquarium increased in weight from 26 to 399 kg and reached a height of nearly 1.8 m in 15 months.|$|R
