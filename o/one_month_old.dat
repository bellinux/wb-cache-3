500|$|Born in Bristol, England {{and educated}} in London after {{his family moved}} to colonial South Carolina, Zephaniah Kingsley (1765–1843) {{established}} his career as a slave trader and shipping magnate, which allowed him to travel widely. He settled on Fort George Island in 1814 after leasing it from McIntosh. He purchased the land and buildings for $7,000 in 1817 ($ in 2009). Kingsley owned several plantations around the lower St. Johns River in what is today Jacksonville, and Drayton Island in central Florida; two of them may have been managed part-time by his wife, a former slave named Anna Madgigine Jai (1793–1870). Kingsley married Anna in 1806 when she was 13 years old, recently arrived in Cuba from West Africa. He freed her in 1811 and charged her with running his Laurel Grove plantation at Doctors Lake in modern-day Orange Park. His legal emancipation submitted to the Spanish colonial government read Let it be known that I ... possessed as a slave a black woman called Anna, around eighteen years of age, bought as a bozal [...] in the port of Havana from a slave cargo, who with the permission of the government was introduced here; the said black woman has given birth to three mulatto children: George, about 3 years 9 months, Martha, 20 months old, an Mary, <b>one</b> <b>month</b> <b>old.</b> And regarding the good qualities shown by the said black woman, the nicety and fidelity which she has shown me, and for other reasons, I have resolved to set her free ... and the same to her three children.|$|E

Maurer and Barrera [1981] showed the images depicted in Figure one in front of 1 - to 2 -month old kids. For those using text browsers: one image has features arranged as a proper face, and on the others, the features are either random or symmetric but not a face. They found that the two <b>month</b> <b>olds</b> fixate more on the face than the others but the <b>one</b> <b>month</b> <b>olds</b> don’t, implying that face recognition comes in somewhere during that time.

40|$|Schwartz-Jampel {{syndrome}} (SJS) is {{a heterogeneous}} autosomal recessive syndrome of myotonia and bone dysplasia. Two types have been recognised: the classical type with late infantile or childhood manifestation and a rarer form with neonatal manifestation. We report five families {{with a total}} of 11 children affected with severe neonatal SJS. All presented after birth with skeletal abnormalities and feeding difficulties. Five had the typical pursed appearance of the mouth. Nine died from respiratory complications (five in the neonatal period and four before 2 years of age). <b>One</b> (4 <b>months</b> <b>old)</b> remains hospitalised since birth requiring continuous oxygen supplementation and <b>one</b> (5 <b>months</b> <b>old)</b> requires nasogastric tube feeding and has repeated attacks of aspiration. Only seven of the 17 previously reported neonatal SJS cases had a similar course to the patients in this report. We suggest that within neonatal SJS there is a subgroup which manifests severe respiratory and feeding problems and has a poor prognosis. This report brings the total number of children with neonatal SJS reported from the UAE to 14. This represents the largest review of this syndrome to date from one centre and indicates that this syndrome is fairly common in the population of the UAE...|$|R
