40|$|Civil {{aviation}} is {{a highly}} protected industry where {{the impact of the}} economic globalisation is invisible. National control over foreign ownership and control over cabotage restricted this industry to become a fully globalised industry. Based of the theory of economic liberalisation, in 2007 The European Commission, had coined in the idea of a establishing a transatlantic <b>open</b> <b>aviation</b> <b>area</b> (OAA) where there will be no- control over foreign ownership and control and over cabotage. The EC argues that the transatlantic OAA would liberalise the 60 % of global civil aviation. Both sides of Atlantic strikes the first phase of two phased agreement. This book analysed the historical phases of civil aviation and gradual changes that happened over the times in the EU and the US civil aviation industry. In the context of first phase agreement main objective of this book is to examine the agreement and its potential possibility to become a successful model for a globalised civil aviation industry.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the liberalization process of the air market between the United States and the member states of the European Union, which resulted in the signing of an Open Skies agreement among these countries, in its first phase, in 2007. This agreement represents a milestone in the scenario of liberalization of the international air traffic with important results for the countries involved. The analysis of the negotiations development and obtained progress towards a further civil aviation flexibility among the involved countries evidences the need for greater cooperation to resolve the established conflicts, promoting means for a future implementation of an <b>open</b> <b>aviation</b> <b>area</b> between the United States and European Union on a stable and sustained manner. It is also emphasized the relevance of this analysis for countries that are applying easing policies in their air sector, such as Brazil, which may use the issues, conflicts and challenges that were presented in the case of United States and European Union...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impacts of the EU-US Open Skies {{agreement}} on the environment on emissions from the aviation sector. We use the Hamburg Tourism Model of domestic and international tourist numbers and flows, to estimate these impacts. The <b>Open</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Area</b> will result in increased competition between carriers and falls {{in the cost of}} transatlantic flights. This will not only have implications for the size and structure of the industry but also for climate policy. The paper assesses what effects the expected increases in passenger numbers will have on CO 2 emissions and tests whether this increase in travel will result in a corresponding rise in emissions. Simulations show that passenger numbers arriving from the US to the EU will increase by between 1 % and 14 % depending on the magnitude of the price reductions because of substitution between destinations, the percentage increase in global emissions is much smaller (max. 1 %) than the increase in cross-Atlantic traffic...|$|E
40|$|We use a {{model of}} {{domestic}} and international tourist numbers and flows to estimate {{the impact of the}} EU-US Open Skies agreement that is to take effect in March 2008. The <b>Open</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Area</b> will result in increased competition between transatlantic carriers and consequently falls in the cost of flights, therefore we look at the change in visitor numbers from the US into the EU and corresponding CO 2 emissions. We find that passenger numbers arriving from the US into the EU will increase by approximately 1 % and 14 % depending on the magnitude of the price reductions. This increase in passenger numbers does not, however, result in a corresponding rise in emissions as arrivals into other countries from the US fall by a comparable amount. The number of tourist arrivals from the US to countries outside of the EU will fall and overall emissions would then increase by a maximum of 0. 7 %. If we assume that domestic holidays and foreign holidays are close substitutes, these effects are strengthened and US passengers switch from domestic trips to foreign destinations as airfares converge...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{evaluate}} {{the effects of the}} eU-U. S. open skies agreement on the italy U. S. air transportation market. the eU-U. S. open skies agreement, which came into force in march 2008, is an important example of the liberalization of the air transport industry the goal of which is to improve consumer welfare. enabling any european carrier and any U. S. airline to fly between eU and U. S. destinations without restrictions on frequencies and fares {{is the first step in}} creating an eU-U. S. <b>open</b> <b>aviation</b> <b>area.</b> this agreement harmonizes the fragmented and diversified regulation on transatlantic market access in eU countries. the study focuses on passenger traffic in terms of both direct flights and one-stop flights from italy to the U. S. to analyze the changes in competition and service quality induced by the eU-U. S. open skies agreement. a pre- and post deregulation comparison of the transatlantic market highlights that the number of flights and destinations decreased, while the service coverage in italy improved. moreover, although the number of carriers offering transatlantic services decreased, fewer routes are monopolized by only one carrier...|$|E

40|$|After fi nishing {{the process}} of {{liberalisation}} of air transport, the Eu-ropean Union has realised what benefi ts its air transport sector, carriers and economy could have if it would only spread its common aviation rules outside {{the borders of the}} EU. In the fi rst decade of the 21 st century the EU has undergone a sys-tematic revision of bilateral agreements which Member States have concluded with third countries in the air transport sector, but it has also made an interesting twist in its policy towards neighbouring countries. The idea of a common European sky, encompassing much more than the EU itself was incorporated in the 2006 European Common <b>Aviation</b> <b>Area</b> Agreement. The European Union (with its 27 Member States) and another eleven European non-EU countries have signed the agreement, obliging themselves to create a common <b>aviation</b> <b>area</b> based on mutual market access to the air transport markets of all contracting parties and on respect to the same rules in the areas of safety, security, air traffi c management, social harmo-nisation and environment.
