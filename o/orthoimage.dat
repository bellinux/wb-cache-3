Each orthorectified satellite image covers an area of approximately 3 600 km², or 60×60 km of the Earth’s surface.

40|$|Change {{detection}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important topics in the application field of aerial images and satellite images. In this paper, a novel framework for accuracy improvement on change detection is proposed. The proposed framework consists of three parts. Firstly, the location difference between the two <b>orthoimages</b> for change detection is rectified globally. Secondly, the illumination change of the <b>orthoimages</b> from two different times is adjusted to produce the <b>orthoimages</b> with more unified illumination condition. Thirdly, the location difference between the two <b>orthoimages</b> is adjusted in more precise level of local regions. Experimental results show that the detection accuracy of change detection is greatly improved through the pre-processing of the proposed framework...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{geometric}} accuracy of DSMs and <b>orthoimages,</b> which are obtained from high resolution satellite stereo pairs of in-track, cross-track and mixed satellite images. Four IKONOS and two QuickBird panchromatic images {{are used to}} constitute 15 stereo pairs, and are processed to generate DSMs and <b>orthoimages.</b> A geometric stereo model, which represents the stereo acquisition geometry of a satellite stereo pair is applied to investigate {{the relationship between the}} geometric accuracy of DSMs and <b>orthoimages</b> and the parameters of the geometric stereo model. The results showed that the geometric accuracy is mainly influenced by two parameters, i. e. base-height ratio (B/H) and bisector elevation (BIE). And, if the stereo acquisition geometry is ideal, high accuracy DSMs and <b>orthoimages</b> can also be obtained by cross-track stereo and mixed satellite stereo pairs. * Corresponding author...|$|R
40|$|Orthophotos (or <b>orthoimages</b> if {{in digital}} form) {{have long been}} {{recognised}} as a supplement or alternative to standard maps. The increasing applications of <b>orthoimages</b> require efforts to ensure the accuracy of produced <b>orthoimages.</b> As digital photogrammetry technology has reached a stage of relative maturity and stability, the availability of high quality ground control points (GCPs) and digital elevation models (DEMs) becomes the central issue for successfully implementing an image orthorectification project. Concerns with the impacts {{of the quality of}} GCPs and DEMs on the quality of <b>orthoimages</b> inspire researchers to look for more reliable approaches to acquire high quality GCPs and DEMs for orthorectification. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), an emerging technology, offers capability of capturing high density three dimensional points and generating high accuracy DEMs in a fast and cost-effective way. Nowadays, highly developed computer technologies enable rapid processing of huge volumes of LiDAR data. This leads to a great potential to use LiDAR data to get high quality GCPs and DEMs to improve the accuracy of <b>orthoimages.</b> This paper presents methods for utilizing LiDAR intensity images to collect high accuracy ground coordinates of GCPs and for utilizing LiDAR data to generate a high quality DEM for digital photogrammetry and orthorectification processes. A comparative analysis is also presented to assess the performance of proposed methods. The results demonstrated the feasibility of using LiDAR intensity image-based GCPs and the LiDAR-derived DEM to produce high quality <b>orthoimages...</b>|$|R
50|$|An orthophoto, {{orthophotograph}} or <b>orthoimage</b> is {{an aerial}} photograph or image geometrically corrected ("orthorectified") {{such that the}} scale is uniform: the photo has the same lack of distortion as a map. Unlike an uncorrected aerial photograph, an orthophotograph {{can be used to}} measure true distances, because it is an accurate representation of the Earth's surface, having been adjusted for topographic relief, lens distortion, and camera tilt.|$|E
50|$|High {{resolution}} orthoimagery (HRO) is {{the process}} of combining of creating an image that combines the geometric qualities with the characteristics of photographs. The result of this process is an <b>orthoimage,</b> a scale image which includes corrections made for feature displacement such as building tilt. These corrections are made {{through the use of a}} mathematical equation, information on sensor calibration and the application of digital elevation models. More information on HRO and high resolution orthoimages can be found at orthophoto.|$|E
50|$|A 3-D {{visualization}} can {{be created}} by georeferencing the aerial photos and LiDAR data in the same reference frame, orthorectifying the aerial photos, and then draping the orthorectified images {{on top of the}} LiDAR grid. It is also possible to create digital terrain models and thus 3-D visualisations using pairs (or multiples) of aerial photographs or satellite (e.g. SPOT satellite imagery). Techniques such as adaptive least squares stereo matching are then used to produce a dense array of correspondences which are transformed through a camera model to produce a dense array of x, y, z data which can be used to produce digital terrain model and <b>orthoimage</b> products. Systems which use these techniques, e.g. the ITG system, were developed in the 1980s and 1990s but have since been supplanted by LiDAR and radar-based approaches, although these techniques may still be useful in deriving elevation models from old aerial photographs or satellite images.|$|E
40|$|A {{problem of}} {{detecting}} {{changes in a}} region viewed by multiple overlapping cameras is addressed. We are exploring a background change detection method of multilayered <b>orthoimages</b> using spatiotemporal texture blocks. Each camera view is projected to create a spatially aligned multilayered background <b>orthoimages.</b> The multilayered <b>orthoimages</b> are subdivided into non-overlapping blocks, and each block is represented by a 3 D texture map. Texture maps are dimensionally reduced with principal component analysis. Motion detection is performed on each block and nonmoving texture sections of the block are clustered into N-dimensional hyperspheres to discover changing patterns. The method evaluation is performed on publicly available surveillance video datasets. ...|$|R

The accuracy of the <b>orthoimages</b> has been determined by comparing with orthophotos DOF 5. The results are unexpectedly good and show the potential of SPOT imagery.

That comprises a Geo image and a file with the rational transformation coefficients (RPC´s). Rio de Janeiro was chosen due to its rough relief, which makes the evaluation become more reliable. For the generation of DEM, 1 : 2, 000 and 1 : 10, 000 -scale digital maps are used. Finally, the <b>orthoimages</b> are evaluated by using ground control points, collected by differential GPS.

5000|$|Orthophotographs are {{commonly}} used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a [...] "map accurate" [...] background image. An orthorectified image differs from [...] "rubber sheeted" [...] rectifications as the latter may accurately locate a number of points on each image but [...] "stretch" [...] the area between so scale may not be uniform across the image. A digital elevation model (DEM) is required to create an accurate orthophoto as distortions in the image due to the varying distance between the camera/sensor and different points on the ground need to be corrected. An <b>orthoimage</b> and a [...] "rubber sheeted" [...] image can both {{be said to have}} been [...] "georeferenced" [...] however the overall accuracy of the rectification varies. Software can display the orthophoto and allow an operator to digitize or place linework, text annotations or geographic symbols (such as hospitals, schools, and fire stations). Some software can process the orthophoto and produce the linework automatically.|$|E
40|$|The {{large-scale}} urba n <b>orthoimage</b> {{generation is}} being deployed in all level {{government agencies and}} private sectors. However, the early procedures and algorithms for digital <b>orthoimage</b> generation in the National Digital Orthophoto Program (NDOP) were based on earlier USGS mapping operations, which have not considered the urban case so that the Standard for Digital Orthophoto formulated by USGS has not considered the requirements of large-scale city orthophoto generation. To provide advanced technical basis (algorithms and procedures) and experience needed for national large-scale digital orthophoto generation and the revision of the Standards for National Large-scale City Digital Orthophoto in National Digital Orthophoto Program (NDOP), this paper presents a comprehensive study on theories, algorithms, and methods of large-scale urban <b>orthoimage</b> generation. These techniques include DTM-based <b>orthoimage</b> generation, DBM-based <b>orthoimage</b> generation, and their mergence for true <b>orthoimage</b> generation, the problems of <b>orthoimage</b> generated using traditional method, building occlusions and compensation, the data structure to model urban buildings for accurately generating urban <b>orthoimage,</b> shadow detection and removal, the optimization of seamline for automatic mosaic, and radiometric balance of neighbor images, street visibility analysis...|$|E

40|$|Pixel {{discontinuity}} in <b>orthoimages</b> occurs frequently due to altitude {{variations in}} the pitch and heading of an airplane, and low performance of real-time analyzing software. This study proposes a scheme to resolve pixel discontinuity. The proposed scheme includes the following steps: 1) capture images by a self-made hyperspectral imager; 2) determine the pixel locations of <b>orthoimages</b> using a top-down approach; 3) repair discontinuities by the Nearest Neighbor (NN) or Bilinear Interpolation (BL) approaches; and, 4) perform a dynamic range adjustment on the <b>orthoimages,</b> according to the maximum pixel value of the raw images and <b>orthoimages.</b> After applying the proposed scheme, this study found that pixel discontinuity was eliminated by both approaches, and that the software dependability and image quality were improved substantially. In addition, the computational efficiency of the NN approach was roughly two minutes faster {{than that of the}} BL due to its simpler computation. However, BL produces smoother image edges for landscapes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The high resolution, IKONOS-images {{taken from}} space are used {{more and more}} for {{practical}} applications. An obstacle is the high price for <b>orthoimages</b> produces by SpaceImaging. But {{it is not a}} problem to create <b>orthoimages</b> based on the less expensive rectifications, the CARTERRA-Geo-product. This can be made also without the rational functions which can be bought for additional expenses. The method of creating <b>orthoimages</b> based on Geo-images will be described in detail. Based on just 3 to 4 control points together with a digital elevation model (DEM) <b>orthoimages</b> can be created with an accuracy of 1 – 3 m. The DEM also can be achieved by automatic matching with IKONOS-stereo models. Without control points the direct sensor orientation of IKONOS allows an absolute accuracy in the range of 10 – 20 m. The information contents of panchromatic IKONOS-images allows the creation of maps 1 : 10 000. 1 Einführung Die hochauflösenden IKONOS-Satellitenaufnahmen finden zunehmend Anwendung in de...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} it is {{performed}} {{a comparison of}} two methods for obtaining digital elevation models (DEMs) and <b>orthoimages</b> of medium-sized archaeological sites (500 - 5000 m 2). The photogrammetric methods analyzed consist {{in the use of}} a light aerial platform applying the normal case of photogrammetry (vertical photographs and regular blocks), and the second one is based on a network of oblique photographs, taken from a telescopic mast, using a DEM obtained from a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) survey. The main goal is to analyze the more efficient method for these studies taking into account variables such the working time, the accuracy obtained in the final products, the visual analysis of final <b>orthoimages,</b> etc. This study has been applied to the same archaeological site in two different epochs. The image acquisition was performed before and after a conservation intervention at the archaeological site. The results have shown similar characteristics for both products (DEMs and <b>orthoimages)</b> and accuracies but the density of DEMs and the visual analysis of <b>orthoimages</b> have shown differences that allows us to select the more adequate method taking into account the characteristics of each case. Thus the DEMs obtained using the TLS survey has shown more density of points while the visual analysis of <b>orthoimages</b> has shown a better behaviour (radiometrically and visually) in the case of vertical photographs...|$|R
40|$|Land cover {{identification}} and area quantification are {{key aspects of}} implementing the European Common Agriculture Policy. Legitimacy of support provided to farmers is monitored using the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), with land cover identification performed by visual image interpretation. While the geometric <b>orthoimage</b> quality required for correct interpretation is well understood, {{little is known about}} the photometric quality needed for LPIS applications. This paper analyzes the <b>orthoimage</b> quality characteristics chosen by authors as being most suitable for visual identification of agricultural fields. We designed a survey to assess users' preferred brightness and contrast ranges for orthoimages used for LPIS purposes. Survey questions also tested the influence of a background color on the preferred <b>orthoimage</b> brightness and contrast, the preferred <b>orthoimage</b> format and color composite, assessments of orthoimages with shadowed areas, appreciation of image enhancements and, finally, consistency of individuals' preferred brightness and contrast settings across multiple sample images. We find that image appreciation is stable at the individual level, but preferences vary across respondents. We therefore recommend that LPIS operators be enabled to personalize photometric settings, such as brightness and contrast values, and to choose the displayed band combination from at least four spectral bands. </p...|$|E

40|$|Digital <b>orthoimage</b> (or orthophoto) {{is a type}} of information-rich digital {{products}} and has found applications in many fields. However, digital <b>orthoimage</b> itself is a 2 -dimensional product and therefore it is insufficient for many applications. On the other hand, the traditional stereo model of photogrammetry formed from a pair of overlapping aerial photographs offer the possibility of both 3 D measurement of terrain surface and terrain objects. However, it cannot be used a plan like the case of digital <b>orthoimage</b> and the model size is usually limited to the stereo pair. To take the advantage of both, the concept of stereomate was introduced by Collins in 1968. It is a new image with additional relief displacement. The total amount of relief displacement at each point of the stereomate is exactly the same as the sum of two relief displacements at the same position on both images of the stereo pair. That is, if this stereomate is used together with the <b>orthoimage,</b> one is still able to reconstruct a 3 D surface of the area precisely. The main limitation with the current practice is that if more than one stereo pairs are used to generate the stereo orthophoto pair, the solution is not rigorous and thus leads to low accuracy of 3 D measurement in highly mountainous areas although reasonable accuracy of 3 D measurement can be achieved in areas with low relief. This paper introduces the concept of “measurable seamless stereo model”, which is formed by a mosaic <b>orthoimage</b> and a mosaic stereomate (i. e. mosaics of a whole block of aerial photographs), with the lineage (image coordinates on original photograph and the orientation parameters of the original photograph) of each pixel on both mosaic <b>orthoimage</b> and a mosaic stereomate recorded. Such a measurable seamless stereo model not only provides seamless 3 D landscape environment but also offers the rigorous and thus accurate 3 D measurement of any object and feature visible in the measurable seamless stereo model withou...|$|E

However, when producing digital aerial <b>orthoimages,</b> radiometric equalization over large areas is often a most time-consuming and costly process and has become a bottleneck. This letter presents a network-based radiometric equalization approach to eliminate the radiometric differences between images. The network is constructed using the area Voronoi diagrams with overlap and is based on the topological relationship of the constructed network; transferring paths between images are determined, and a global-to-local strategy is used to improve the algorithm, both in its global and local performance.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{two different}} methods for extraction of {{two types of}} urban objects from lidar digital surface model (DSM) and digital aerial images. Within the preprocessing digital terrain model (DTM) and <b>orthoimages</b> for three test areas were generated from aerial images using automatic photogrammetric methods. Automatic building extraction was done using DSM and multispectral <b>orthoimages.</b> First, initial building mask was created from the normalized digital surface model (nDSM), then vegetation was eliminated from the building mask using multispectral <b>orthoimages.</b> The final building mask was produced employing several morphological operations and buildings were vectorised using Hough transform. Automatic extraction of other green urban features (trees and natural ground) started from <b>orthoimages</b> using iterative object-based classification. This method required careful selection of segmentation parameters; in addition to basic spectral bands also information from nDSM was included. After the segmentation of images the segments were classified based on their attributes (spatial, spectral, geometrical, texture) using rule set classificator. First iteration focused on visible (i. e. unshaded) urban features, and second iteration on objects in deep shade. Results from both iterations were merged into appropriate classes.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to find answer for two questions: why stereo <b>orthoimage</b> (orthophoto) was forgotten, and furthermore, what {{conditions}} have to be fulfilled for this particular technique to be reanimated? Stereo orthophoto concept was first introduced by Collins, during late seventies of last century (Colins, 1968). It has ignited huge interest, and many researchers were looking forward for its development (Blachut 1976, Kraus et al. 1976). However, after around twenty years, interest in stereo-orthophoto has shrunk, and during eighties of XX century it was almost extinct. Despite of fact that digital photogrammetry provides better conditions for it now than ever, it has never got chance for reactivation. There was but few papers about stereo <b>orthoimage,</b> and they are proposing continuous stereo ortho-mosaic generation while preserving its metric value (Li et al 2002, Wang 2004). Reasons of downfall of this interest were examined, and it has been concluded that the main cause was usage of this technique in conjunction with analog photogrammetry. The radiometric value of orthophotomaps and stereo components developed on photosensitive paper were very low during that time. Equipment for observation and measurement were simply very big and therefore impractical. Authors have concluded, that nowadays sum of gains outweighs its flaws and it is reason enough to go back to it. But in a time of digital vector 3 D models there is a need for proper strategy for popularization stereo orthophoto. Main point of this strategy would be encapsulating stereo <b>orthoimage</b> method into GIS tools, optimally open source. GIS have large numbers of consumers whom regard for orthophotomap (or <b>orthoimage)</b> is very high. If they were to be proposed with possibility of using stereo <b>orthoimage</b> inside a GIS tool, as a complementary to the orthophotomap, probably they would recon how much stereoscopy helps with interpretation of an image. Authors have planned to develop software for utilization of stereo <b>orthoimage</b> available from the Quantum GIS interface, and test version is to be based on anaglyph stereoscopy. Value of creating continuous stereo-mosaic composed from many 3 D models was assessed. Consensus was, however, that this solution surprises us with frequent perspective changes which leads to discomfort. As an outcome it was decided to focus on single stereo <b>orthoimage</b> pairs. When area constrains are specified for single model, one can load them as requested by an user. In case of increased lateral and longitudinal coverage, which is more common in modern aerial photogrammetric flights, every localization will be accessible for visualization using several models, and there will be less concealed areas. Few algorithms for generation of parallax are tested. After completion of sets from a dozen or so example models of interesting areas are gathered, there will be release. Authors are confident that stereo <b>orthoimage</b> may prove more useful for GIS users than true orthophotomap...|$|E

This possibility is estimated via the technical specifications of the Hellenic Cadastre. For the achievement of this aim, two orthoimages were produced with two different methods. The first method led to an <b>orthoimage</b> production by using control points that were received from map digitization in scale 1 : 5000, while the second method led to an <b>orthoimage</b> production using control points that were received from measurements, which were realized with the Global Positioning System (GPS).

Moreover, the two orthoimages ’ accuracy was estimated based on the technical specifications of the Hellenic Cadastre for suburban regions.

In this research, stereo pairs acquired by very high-resolution optical satellites GeoEye- 1 (GE 1) and WorldView- 2 (WV 2) have been utilized {{to carry out the}} land cover classification of an agricultural area through an object-based image analysis approach, paying special attention to greenhouses extraction. The main novelty of this work lies in the joint use of single-source stereo-photogrammetrically derived heights and multispectral information from both panchromatic and pan-sharpened <b>orthoimages.</b> The main features tested in this research can be grouped into different categories, such as basic spectral information, elevation data (normalized digital surface model; nDSM), band indexes and ratios, texture and shape geometry. Furthermore, spectral information was based on both single <b>orthoimages</b> and multiangle <b>orthoimages.</b> The overall accuracy attained by applying nearest neighbor and support vector machine classifiers to the four multispectral bands of GE 1 were very similar to those computed from WV 2, for either four or eight multispectral bands.

Each of these scenes {{is the result of}} orthorectifying an image (which is often in a conic projection) captured by means of an airborne sensor, at a specific date of acquisition. Such source images partially overlap each other, providing, for example, stereoscopic capabilities in the overlapping areas between two contiguous scenes. Therefore, the <b>orthoimage</b> coverage constitutes a mosaic composed of selected areas from the orthorectified scenes used for producing it.|$|E
40|$|II Geometric {{correction}} of remote sensing imagery is indispensable {{for the purpose}} of data integration and applications. Conventional ortho-rectification only considers the {{correction of}} tilt displacements and terrain relief displacements. Since high-resolution imagery captures more detailed information, the abrupt changes of object elevation result in the relief displacements and occlusions in image space. In urban areas, high-rise buildings and multi-layer road systems of <b>orthoimages</b> cause serious image deformation. True-orthorectification procedures take account of ground objects for the correction of relief displacements and compensation of the hidden areas. Accordingly, the true <b>orthoimages</b> provide the exact position of land objects. This research focuses on the man-made constructions, including buildings and roads. Thus, the generation of true <b>orthoimages</b> is done by integration of building, road, and terrain models. The test data comprise three dimensional building models, road models and digital terrain models, and multi-view aerial images are employed for the compensation of hidden areas. The proposed scheme includes：(1) visibility analysis, (2) hidden detection, (3) hidden compensation, and (4) shadow enhancement. Three test sites includie...|$|R

40|$|Historical {{photographs}} {{become widely}} used in geographical and environmental applications. Their enhancement involves converting them into georeferenced data, such as <b>orthoimages</b> or digital models. However no ground control points are available unlike in current image processing, and many problems such as image noise, landscape modifications, perspective distortion and unknown sensor calibration prevent automatic tie-point retrieval with current <b>orthoimages.</b> That is why photograph georeferencing remains a manual and time-consuming task. A novel method is {{presented in this paper}} to register photographs with current topographic database using line feature matching. Indeed, geometrical considerations only let avoid high radiometric difference issues when dealing with current <b>orthoimages.</b> Besides topographic database use lets selecting stable through time features, such as road network and historical buildings. A multi-scale approach allows very coarse georeferencing initialization, which can be set manually by a minimum number of ground control points per image set. At each scale an iterative processing improves the line matching and the registration model estimation at the same time. Finally, building integration makes registration more reliable for off-ground objects. Results are promising as georeferencing is much improved and its estimation converges in all test cases. 1...|$|R
