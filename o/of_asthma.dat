40|$|T helper 17 (Th 17) cells play an {{important}} role in the pathogenesis <b>of</b> allergic <b>asthma.</b> Th 17 cell differentiation requires Notch signaling. γ-Secretase inhibitor (GSI) blocks Notch signaling; thus, it may be considered as a potential treatment for allergic <b>asthma.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study was to evaluate the effect of GSI on Th 17 cell differentiation in a mouse model <b>of</b> allergic <b>asthma.</b> OVA was used to induce mouse asthma model in the presence and absence of GSI. GSI ameliorated the development <b>of</b> OVA-induced <b>asthma,</b> including suppressing airway inflammation responses and reducing the severity of clinical signs. GSI also significantly suppressed Th 17 -cell responses in spleen and reduced IL- 17 levels in serum. These findings suggest that GSI directly regulates Th 17 responses through a Notch signaling-dependent pathway in mouse model <b>of</b> allergic <b>asthma,</b> supporting the notion that GSI is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment <b>of</b> allergic <b>asthma...</b>|$|R
40|$|Whether mouse models <b>of</b> chronic <b>asthma</b> {{can be used}} to {{investigate}} the relationship between airway inflammation/remodeling and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) is a vexed question. It raises issues {{about the extent to which}} such models replicate key features of the human disease. Here, we review some of the characteristic pathological features <b>of</b> human <b>asthma</b> and their relationship to AHR and examine some limitations of mouse models that are commonly used {{to investigate}} these relationships. We compare these conventional models with our mouse model <b>of</b> chronic <b>asthma</b> involving long-term low-level inhalational challenge and review studies of the relationship between inflammation/remodeling and AHR in this model and its derivatives, including models of an acute exacerbation <b>of</b> chronic <b>asthma</b> and <b>of</b> the induction phase <b>of</b> childhood <b>asthma.</b> We conclude that while extrapolating from studies in mouse models to AHR in humans requires cautious interpretation, such experimental work can provide significant insights into the pathogenesis of airway responsiveness and its molecular and cellular regulation...|$|R

5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause <b>of</b> <b>asthma</b> is not yet known.|$|E

The literature search for primary prevention <b>of</b> occupational <b>asthma</b> yielded 29 studies. Assessment of the available information led to the following conclusions and recommendations concerning primary prevention <b>of</b> occupational <b>asthma.</b> Exposure elimination is the strongest and preferred primary preventive approach to reduce the burden <b>of</b> occupational <b>asthma.</b> If elimination is not possible, exposure reduction is the second best option for primary prevention <b>of</b> occupational <b>asthma.</b> The evidence for the effectiveness of respirators in preventing occupational asthma is limited, and other options higher in the list of controls for occupational exposures, notably eliminating or minimising exposures at the source or in the environment, should be used preferentially. There is strong evidence to recommend not using powdered allergen-rich natural rubber latex gloves.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionMany {{workers in}} Alexandria {{are exposed to}} a variety of {{occupational}} and environmental allergens and/or irritants that predispose them to the development <b>of</b> bronchial <b>asthma.</b> The present study was conducted to determine the role of occupational exposure as a determinant of occurrence <b>of</b> bronchial <b>asthma</b> and to assess the possible role of total serum IgE; eosinophil count and GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 null polymorphism as risk factors for the development <b>of</b> bronchial <b>asthma.</b> MethodsA case control study was conducted in which 100 workers with bronchial asthma were compared to 100 non asthmatic controls regarding their occupational characteristics, bronchodilator responsiveness, blood analysis for eosinophil count, total serum IgE, GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 genotypes. ResultsExposure to irritants and allergens were significantly higher among workers with bronchial asthma compared to controls (86 % vs. 64 %, respectively, P= 0. 00). Moreover, workers exposed to irritants were found to be 4 times at a higher risk <b>of</b> developing bronchial <b>asthma,</b> and those exposed to high molecular weight (HMW), and/or low molecular weight (LMW) were about three times at a higher risk <b>of</b> developing bronchial <b>asthma.</b> There was no significant difference detected between the cases <b>of</b> bronchial <b>asthma</b> and the controls regarding the frequency of the Null-genotype for either GSTT 1 or GSTM 1. However, the frequency of combined Null-genotype for both GSTT 1 and GSTM 1 was significantly higher in asthmatic workers than in controls. A significant positive correlation was found between total serum IgE level and pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC% (r= 0. 29, and P= 0. 03). ConclusionOccupational exposure to irritants and/or allergens is a significant risk factor for the occurrence <b>of</b> bronchial <b>asthma</b> among workers. On the other hand, eosinophil count and total serum IgE neither predicts the occurrence <b>of</b> bronchial <b>asthma</b> nor affects the severity and pattern of the disease among workers with bronchial asthma. Moreover, the present study concluded that GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 Null-genotypes are not likely to act as risk factors for the development <b>of</b> bronchial <b>asthma.</b> However, combined GSTT 1 and GSTM 1 Null-genotypes were considered as a potential risk factor for the development <b>of</b> bronchial <b>asthma...</b>|$|R
