5|$|The 1980s saw a {{rebirth of}} Wall Street, and Manhattan {{reclaimed}} its {{role at the}} center of the worldwide financial industry. The 1980s also saw Manhattan at the heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> crisis, with Greenwich Village at its epicenter. The organizations Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) and AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) were founded to advocate on behalf of those stricken with the disease.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the first}} {{physicians}} to notice among his gay male patients the immune deficiency that would later be named AIDS, during the 1980s and 1990s he treated many hundreds of HIV-positive people. During the height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> crisis, Sonnabend helped create several AIDS organisations, including the AIDS Medical Foundation (now amfAR), the nonprofit Community Research Initiative (now ACRIA), which pioneered community-based research, and the PWA Health Group, the first and largest formally recognised buyers' club.|$|E
5|$|The Blade started {{publishing}} weekly in January 1983 and coverage {{shifted to the}} AIDS crisis and news about this newly emerging disease. The ever-breaking news caused the paper to remain in a heightened state of coverage and nearly exhausted the papers resources {{with members of the}} community having to step in to support the work of the Blade. The reporting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> crisis from this timeframe allowed the newspaper to come of age to the mature and professionally driven publication seen today. In June 1988, the editors of the paper used a computer to layout the paper for the first time. The 1990s saw increases in readership and circulation of the Washington Blade. In April 1993, during the 1993 Gay March on Washington, the paper published its largest edition to date consisting of 216 pages. The paper expanded into new markets and mediums with the 1995 launch of the online version of the Blade, followed two years later with the launching of a sister publication in New York, called the New York Blade. In the later part of the century, coverage was expanded to include local and national news, as well as international news of interest to the LGBT community.|$|E
40|$|Use of inter-loop aiding for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. However, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previously proposed <b>aiding</b> schemes rely {{on the assumption that}} <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> carrierâ€™s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both aiding and aided loops. This paper proposes an aiding scheme that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies. Also, an algorithm is proposed that continuously updates <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop bandwidth to keep its jitter at a minimum. A relationship between <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> signal and its effects on <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop is analysed. An adaptive Kalman filter-based implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> architecture is proposed to improve <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>aiding</b> estimates. This implementation offers an improved margin against received interference. Simulation and real data results are presented that show improvements of 7 and 5 dB-Hz in this margin by employing <b>the</b> proposed <b>aiding</b> scheme with and without an adaptive Kalman filter...|$|R

40|$|This paper gives a broad {{overview}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> Belgian <b>aid</b> policies throughout <b>the</b> 1990 s. It documents changes in stated motives and objectives, aid volumes, poverty orientation <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> <b>the</b> structure and main components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> programme, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> new types <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> instruments, <b>the</b> geographic concentration <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> and <b>the</b> institutional set-up. Official rhetoric on aid motives and objectives {{as it is}} captured in subsequent official policy notes is confronted with effective aid practice. It is argued that aid practice was strongly influenced by factors which are external to deliberate aid policy making. Crisis in the countries in Central Africa, which were traditionally major beneficiaries of Belgian aid, for instance, did heavily impinge upon the structure and main components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> programme, <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> volume and <b>the</b> geographic concentration <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> whereas internal political discussions in Belgium, in particular linguistic tensions, largely dominated the various institutional reforms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> department. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that two heads {{are better than}} one, but {{reliance}} on decision aids is often inappropriate. Decisions to rely on an aid {{are thought to be}} based on a comparison between <b>the</b> perceived reliability <b>of</b> own performance and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision <b>aid.</b> Unfortunately, perceived reliabilities are unlikely to be perfectly calibrated. This may result in inappropriate decisions to rely on advice. In a laboratory experiment with 40 participants, we studied whether calibration improves after practice, whether calibration of own reliability differs from calibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aidâ€™s</b> reliability and whether unreliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> is attributed differently. Under-trust in own reliability disappears after practice but under-trust in <b>the</b> <b>aidâ€™s</b> reliability persists. Unreliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> is less likely to be attributed to temporary, external and uncontrollable factors. This asymmetry in attribution and calibration may explain under-reliance on decision aids...|$|R
50|$|Most {{economic}} development projects were funded with external assistance on concessional terms. In the mid- to late 1980s, recorded aid disbursements averaged more than US$200 million annually--about 7 percent of GDP. More than 70 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> was in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> grants; <b>the</b> remainder was in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> concessional loans.

25|$|Since {{the start}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> epidemic, PCP has been closely {{associated}} with AIDS. Because it only occurs in an immunocompromised host, {{it may be the}} first clue to a new AIDS diagnosis if the patient has no other reason to be immunocompromised (e.g. taking immunosuppressive drugs for organ transplant). An unusual {{rise in the number of}} PCP cases in North America, noticed when physicians began requesting large quantities of the rarely used antibiotic pentamidine, was the first clue to the existence of AIDS in the early 1980s.|$|E

25|$|The Preston {{curve is}} a {{relationship}} found in cross-country data - that is, it holds for a sample of countries taken at a particular point in time. Some research however suggests that a similar relationship does not hold in time series and longitudinal data within individual countries. In particular, per capita incomes between countries have generally diverged over time, while life expectancies, and other health indicators such as the infant mortality rates, have converged (this trend was interrupted in the 1990s with the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa). This suggests that over time changes in income may have no impact on health or even be negatively related.|$|E
