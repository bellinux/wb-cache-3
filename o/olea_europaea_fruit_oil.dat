40|$|The {{present study}} we {{investigated}} the hepatoprotective effects of <b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> <b>fruit</b> pulp extract against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic damage in experimental mice. Further we explored the antioxidant {{potential of the}} extract to substantiate the hepatoprotective properties. Biochemical parameters were analyzed in the serum of experimental mice using respective diagnostic kits. Antioxidant activities were measured following alkyl and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays. Compared with control groups, administration of the extract to carbon tetrachloride- treated mice significantly reduced the elevated serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. The carbon tetrachloride-treated morphological changes in hepatocyte architecture were also reversed by extract pretreatment. Further, the carbon tetrachloride-treated increased serum cholesterol levels such as triglyceride and low density/very low-density lipoprotein in the liver were reversed in acute and chronic carbon tetrachloride-treated mice. The extract was also found to significantly increase the serum level of high-density lipoproteins in carbon tetrachloride-treated mice. Furthermore, the extract showed significant in vitro antioxidant actions by scavenging the alkyl and hydroxyl free radicals, substantiating its use in hepatoprotection. The concentration of the extract necessary for 50 % inhibition of alkyl and hydroxyl radicals was 72. 41 and 52. 24 µg/ml, respectively. In conclusion, data from our study suggest that <b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> <b>fruit</b> pulp extract could prevent carbon tetrachloride-treated acute and chronic liver degeneration and attenuated the lipid levels elevated by carbon tetrachloride. The hepatoprotective activity exhibited by <b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> extract might possibly be through its antioxidant defense mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Phenolic {{composition}} and biological activities of fruit extracts from Italian and Algerian <b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> L. cultivars were studied. Total phenolic and tannin contents were quantified in the extracts. Moreover 14 different phenolic compounds were identified, and their profiles showed remarkable quantitative differences among analysed extracts. Moreover antioxidant and enzymatic inhibition activities were studied. Three complementary assays {{were used to}} measure their antioxidant activities and consequently Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI) {{was used to compare}} and easily describe obtained results. Results showed that Chemlal, between Algerian cultivars, and Coratina, among Italian ones, had the highest RACI values. On the other hand all extracts and the most abundant phenolics were tested for their efficiency to inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes. Leccino, among all analysed cultivars, and luteolin, among identified phenolic compounds, were found to be the best inhibitors of α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes.

40|$|<b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> L. {{commonly}} known as olive has been traditionally used for the prevention and treatment of many diseases since ancient times. Olive {{has been reported to}} possess a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties. In the present study, we investigated the activity of aqueous extract of <b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> L. <b>fruit</b> at various concentrations on A 2780, A 172, and HFFF 2 cell lines proliferation by MTT assay. Aqueous extract of olive significantly increased cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner in the cell lines. It has been previously reported that olive has chemoproventive and anti-tumor effects. These disagreements can be explained by differences in cell line properties, type of olive and different solvents in the extracts. However, further investigation is needed to clarify the exact role of olive in cell proliferation and cancer. In this study <b>fruit</b> extract of <b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> L. showed more activatory effects on A 2780 cell line in comparison with A 172 and HFFF 2.

40|$|Endocarp {{developmental}} timing in drupe-type fruits, involving tissue {{expansion and}} sclerification processes, is increasingly used as marker for biological studies and crop management. In {{spite of its}} wide application, however, little is known regarding how these morphogenetic processes unfold or the factors that modify it. This study evaluates endocarp expansion and sclerification of olive (<b>Olea</b> <b>europaea)</b> <b>fruits,</b> used {{as an example of}} drupe-type fruits, from trees growing under different water regimes: full irrigated, deficit irrigated (moderate reduction of water availability) and rainfed (severe reduction of water availability). Fruits were sampled weekly until pit hardening, and fruit and endocarp areas were evaluated in histological preparations. An image analysis process was tested and adjusted to quantify sclerified area and distribution within the endocarp. Individual stone cells differentiated independently but distribution and timing indicated the overall coordination of endocarp tissue sclerification. Increase in sclerified area was initially gradual, accelerated abruptly the week prior to the end of endocarp expansion and then continued at an intermediate rate. These results suggest {{that the end of the}} expansion period is driven by sclerification and the morphogenetic signals involved act first on sclerification rather than endocarp size. Intensification of sclerification and the end of expansive growth occurred first with lowest water supply. Moderate and severe reductions in water availability proportionately decreased endocarp expansion and prolonged the sclerification, delaying the date of physically perceived hardening but not affecting the final degree of endocarp sclerification. © 2013 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the antioxidant and anti-neuroinflammatory potentials of <b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> Linn. <b>fruit</b> pulp (OFP-EA) extract in LPS-stimulated BV- 2 microglial cells. Methods: Cell viabilities were measured using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 - diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Antioxidant properties were evaluated using 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) {{was used to}} stimulate BV- 2 microglia. Nitric oxide (NO) production was measured using Griess assay. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis. Results: OFP-EA extract significantly (p< 0. 001 at 20 - 200 µg/ml, respectively) scavenged the free radicals in a dose-dependent fashion. The increased levels of No stimulated by LPS (34 ± 2. 41) were also inhibited by OFP-EA extract significantly and concentration dependently (27 ± 2. 32, 21 ± 2. 54, 17 ± 1. 92 and 11 ± 1. 94 at 10, 20, 40 and 80 µg/ml, respectively).

PAL, CHS, F 3 H, and UFGT were expressed at the early stages of fruit development when DFR and ANS transcripts were not detected. DFR was induced in the epicarp at the onset of ripening and color change, while ANS transcripts were extremely abundant at a more advanced stage. A coordinated up-regulation of the genes involved in the last steps of anthocyanin biosynthesis was observed in ripe olives. These results suggest that DFR and ANS, together with UFGT, might represent key elements in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in olives, and that the expression pattern of these two genes could be used to monitor, at the molecular level, the evolution of ripening in fruits of this species...|$|R
40|$|Samples of charred wood, {{collected}} during the excavation of the West House in Akrotiri, Santorini, were analysed and identified. Olive (<b>Olea</b> <b>europaea)</b> dominated the samples, especially inside the West House, suggesting regular pruning of olive trees {{and use of the}} branches as firewood. The findings included sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), almond (Prunus dulcis), alder (Alnus sp.), pear (Pyrus amygdaliformis), terebinth or mastic tree (Pistacia sp.), juniper (Juniperus sp.), pine (Pinus sp.) and tamarisk (Tamarix sp.). Castanea and Alnus were not known before from Bronze Age Santorini. The find of Castanea is the earliest registered find of wood of Castanea in Greece. Also it is shown that domesticated almond trees grew on the island itself and already were cultivated as early as the Middle Cycladic period.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of different metabolites in olive (<b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> (L.)) <b>fruit</b> at harvest {{can be affected}} by water availability, with significant consequences on the composition {{and the quality of}} the resulting oil. The aim of the present study was to profile the metabolic composition of ripe olives (cv. Cipressino) grown under water-stress and irrigated conditions applied during the last part of the fruit developmental cycle (from pit hardening to commercial harvest). The imposed conditions resulted in a moderate water stress (− 3. 5 MPa) at the end of the experimental period. Samples (pulp + skin) of fruit collected at the stage of complete epicarp pigmentation were analyzed by means of GC–MS. In total, 176 metabolites were detected, of which 57 were identified. Principal component analysis (PCA) of stress and non-stress treatments resulted in clearly separated profiles with the first principal component (PC 1) mostly correlated with the organic acid content. Of the 57 compounds identified, 19 metabolites (organic acids, fatty acids, soluble sugars, and terpens) accumulated differently in the two sets of samples. A reduction in soluble sugars and unsaturated fatty acids was detected in water stressed samples, suggesting an acceleration of the ripening process.

40|$|Olive (<b>Olea</b> <b>europaea,</b> cv Leccino) <b>fruits</b> grown under {{different}} water regimes {{were analyzed by}} metabolomics and specific transcript accumulation analyses. The fruit from non-irrigated (rain-fed) and irrigated trees cultivated under field conditions, with a seasonal water amount equivalent to the calculated crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was compared in the last developmental phase and, in particular, at commercial harvest. Metabolomics (GC-MS) analysis identified several hundred metabolites in ripe mesocarp, 46 of which showed significantly different contents in the rain-fed and irrigated samples. Some compounds involved in primary metabolism (carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids) and secondary metabolism (squalene, simple phenols) appeared to be more abundant when irrigation was performed. Higher levels of total polyphenol were observed in the rain-fed fruit, which at ripening showed an increase in anthocyanin concentration. These data indicate that ripening in olives is affected by irrigation. In addition, expression analyses of three key polyphenol biosynthetic genes (phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), chalcone synthase (CHS), dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR)) and two genes involved in triterpenoid metabolism (??-amyrin synthase and cycloartenol synthase) were also performed. The analyzed genes showed different expression patterns throughout ripening, and the resulting PAL, DFR and ??-amyrin synthase transcript accumulation {{was found to be}} affected by the different water regimes at specific stages of fruit development. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract Background Olive (<b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> L.) <b>fruits</b> contain {{numerous}} secondary metabolites, primarily phenolics, terpenes and sterols, some {{of which}} are particularly interesting for their nutraceutical properties. This study will attempt to provide further insight into the profile of olive phenolic compounds during fruit development and to identify the major genetic determinants of phenolic metabolism. Results The concentration of the major phenolic compounds, such as oleuropein, demethyloleuropein, 3 – 4 DHPEA-EDA, ligstroside, tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, verbascoside and lignans, were measured in the developing fruits of 12 olive cultivars. The content of these compounds varied significantly among the cultivars and decreased during fruit development and maturation, with some compounds showing specificity for certain cultivars. Thirty-five olive transcripts homologous to genes involved in the pathways of the main secondary metabolites were identified from the massive sequencing data of the olive fruit transcriptome or from cDNA-AFLP analysis. Their mRNA levels were determined using RT-qPCR analysis on fruits of high- and low-phenolic varieties (Coratina and Dolce d’Andria, respectively) during three different fruit developmental stages. A strong correlation was observed between phenolic compound concentrations and transcripts putatively involved in their biosynthesis, suggesting a transcriptional regulation of the corresponding pathways. OeDXS, OeGES, OeGE 10 H and OeADH, encoding putative 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose- 5 -P synthase, geraniol synthase, geraniol 10 -hydroxylase and arogenate dehydrogenase, respectively, were almost exclusively present at 45 days after flowering (DAF), suggesting that these compounds might {{play a key role in}} regulating secoiridoid accumulation during fruit development. Conclusions Metabolic and transcriptional profiling led to the identification of some major players putatively involved in biosynthesis of secondary compounds in the olive tree. Our data represent the first step towards the functional characterisation of important genes for the determination of olive fruit quality. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{structures}} of two oligomers of acidic xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) {{of the same}} molecular weight (634 Da), Xyl 2 MeGlcAHex and Xyl 2 GlcA 2 were differentiated by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). These oligomers were present {{in a mixture of}} XOS obtained by acid hydrolysis of heteroxylans extracted from Eucalyptus globulus wood (Xyl 2 MeGlcAHex) and <b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> olive <b>fruit</b> (Xyl 2 GlcA 2). In the ESI-MS spectra of the XOS, ions at m/z 657 and 652 were observed and assigned to [M + Na]+ and [M + NH 4]+, respectively. The ESI-MS/MS spectrum of [M + Na]+ ion of Xyl 2 MeGlcAHex showed the loss of Hex residue from the reducing end followed by the loss of MeGlcA moiety. Simultaneously, the loss of a Xyl residue from either the reducing or the non-reducing ends was detected. On the other hand, the fragmentation of Xyl 2 GlcA 2 occurs mainly by the loss of one and two GlcA residues or by the loss of the GlcAXyl moiety, due to the glycosidic bond cleavage between the two Xyl residues. Loss of one and two CO 2 molecules was only observed for this oligomer, where the GlcA are in vicinal Xyl residues. The ESI-MS/MS spectra of [M + NH 4]+ of both oligomers showed the loss of NH 3, resulting in the protonated molecule, where the presence of ions assigned as protonated molecules of aldobiuronic acid residues, [MeGlcA − Xyl + H]+ and [GlcA − Xyl + H]+, are diagnostic ions of the presence of MeGlcA and GlcA moieties in XOS. Since these structures occur in small amounts in complex acidic XOS mixtures and are very difficult, if possible, to isolate, tandem mass spectrometry revealed to be a powerful tool for the characterization of these types of substitution patterns present in heteroxylans...|$|R

Fruit load was manipulated in mature olives grown in weighing-drainage lysimeters. Fruit was thinned or entirely removed from trees at three separate stages of growth: early, mid and late in the season. Tree-scale transpiration, calculated from lysimeter water balance, {{was found to be}} a function of fruit load, canopy size and weather conditions. Fruit removal caused an immediate decline in water consumption, measured as whole-plant transpiration normalized to tree size, which persisted {{until the end of the}} season. The later the execution of fruit removal, the greater was the response. The amount of water transpired by a fruit-loaded tree was found to be roughly 30 % greater than that of an equivalent low- or nonyielding tree. The tree-scale response to fruit was reflected in stem water potential but was not mirrored in leaf-scale physiological measurements of stomatal conductance or photosynthesis. Trees with low or no fruit load had higher vegetative growth rates. However, no significant difference was observed in the overall aboveground dry biomass among groups, when fruit was included. This case, where carbon sources and sinks were both not limiting, suggests that the role of fruit on water consumption involves signaling and alterations in hydraulic properties of vascular tissues and tree organs. </p...|$|R
