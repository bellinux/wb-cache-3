5|$|Enumerative {{problems}} in mathematics often concern {{a class of}} geometric objects called algebraic varieties which are defined by the vanishing of polynomials. For example, the Clebsch cubic (see the illustration) is defined using a certain polynomial of degree three in four variables. A celebrated result <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> mathematicians Arthur Cayley and George Salmon states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on such a surface.|$|E
5|$|She {{is placed}} {{firmly in the}} imperialist {{literature}} <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> England, and inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of South Africa and British colonialism. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary conceptions of the late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the fin de siècle. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.|$|E

5|$|Walton {{worked for}} many years on his only {{full-length}} opera, Troilus and Cressida, both before its premiere and afterwards. It has never been regarded as a success. The libretto is generally considered weak, and Walton's music, despite many passages that have won critical praise, is not dramatic enough to sustain interest. Grove calls the work a partially successful attempt to revivify the traditions <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> Italian opera in a post-war era wary of heroic Romanticism.|$|E
5|$|Sarmiento {{grew up in}} a poor but {{politically}} active family that paved the way for much of his future accomplishments. Between 1843 and 1850 he was frequently in exile, and wrote in both Chile and in Argentina. His greatest literary achievement was Facundo, a critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas, that Sarmiento wrote while working for the newspaper El Progreso during his exile in Chile. The book brought him far more than just literary recognition; he expended his efforts and energy on the war against dictatorships, specifically that of Rosas, and contrasted enlightened Europea world where, in his eyes, democracy, social services, and intelligent thought were valuedwith the barbarism of the gaucho and especially the caudillo, the ruthless strongmen <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> Argentina.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} set on the fictional world of Prester, where its {{inhabitants}} use aerial vehicles known as vanships {{as a means of}} transportation. On this world which is divided in eternal conflict between the nations of Anatoray and Disith, sky couriers Claus Valca and Lavie Head must deliver a girl who holds the key to uniting the two factions. Although Prester itself is not a representation of Earth, it features technology reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> Europe {{at the dawn of the}} Industrial Revolution. Many of its designs were also inspired by Germany's technological advances during the interwar period.|$|E

5|$|Rose Hill {{is largely}} made up <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> architecture, with some {{contemporary}} buildings. The campus {{is home to}} several structures on the National Register of Historic Places, such as the University Church built in 1845 as a seminary chapel and parish church for the surrounding community. It contains the altar from Old St. Patrick's Cathedral, as well as stained glass windows given to the university by King Louis Philippe I of France. The windows are particularly notable for their connection to a workshop in Sevres, France, locus of the earliest stages of the Gothic Revival. Adjacent to the church is a 138-plot cemetery where the university's nineteenth-century Jesuits, diocesan seminarians, students, and workers are interred, relocated in 1890 from its original location at today's New York Botanical Garden.|$|E
5|$|The first printed {{account of}} Pickingill that {{described}} him as a cunning man appeared fifty years after his death. This {{was provided by the}} folkorist Eric Maple, who was making a systematic study <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> traditions regarding witchcraft and magic in south-eastern Essex, and who examined the case of Canewdon in the winter of 1959–60. He had begun his enquiries by meeting with a number of elderly local residents at the home of the schoolmistress, from whom he gained a variety of tales pertaining to magical practices in the village. His initial findings were published in 1960 in the scholarly journal Folklore, produced by The Folklore Society. Maple followed this article with a shorter piece written for 'Essex Countryside Magazine' (Vol.18 No.58 - November 1961). He subsequently produced a sensationalist popular history of witchcraft, The Dark World of Witches (1962), in which he repeated many of the claims regarding Pickingill. In this work, he erroneously described south-eastern Essex as the last bastion of English witchcraft beliefs, and ignored scholarly conventions in relating his information, resulting in a critical reception from folklorists; the book nevertheless was popular and sold well.|$|E
