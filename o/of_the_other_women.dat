50|$|This is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more {{interesting}} Works of Xiang Jing. It shows {{two women in}} modern clothing, {{one of which is}} cowering in fear while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> is smiling. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> that is smiling has her hand shaped as a gun and it pointing it directly towards <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>woman.</b> <b>The</b> woman that is in fear does not seem to realize the feeling on her head is just <b>the</b> finger <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>woman.</b> She truly believes she is about to die. After looking closely, her eyes are shut and it feels like she is letting out a terrified scream. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>woman</b> seems to be taking joy in this action. This {{is a good example of}} how Xiang Jing shows a sense of violence through her work. The woman is taking pleasure in the fear and fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>woman.</b> <b>The</b> woman who is in fear is vulnerable because of her fear <b>of</b> death. <b>The</b> women are in modern clothes, Xiang Jing is trying to show that some women live in this sort <b>of</b> fear in <b>the</b> modern day. She is showing that there are two different types <b>of</b> women; <b>the</b> ones who fear and those who are feared. She could also be playing on <b>the</b> violence <b>of</b> society causing people to live in fear or society causing the violence. This is another sculpture painted in porcelain. It is very realistic. Unlike Your Body, the women are in shape but they seem real still. Xiang Jing creates lifelike sculpture to portray a stronger message to the audience.|$|R

Best known works: Speculum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Woman</b> (1974) and This Sex is Not One (1977).She {{was inspired by}} <b>the</b> psychoanalytic theories <b>of</b> Jaques Lacan and <b>the</b> deconstruction <b>of</b> Jaques Derrida. Her work aims to reveal a perceived masculine philosophy underlying language and gestures toward a “new” feminine language that would allow women to express themselves {{if it could be}} spoken.|$|R

500|$|Piccard was {{the first}} of the eleven women ordained because she was the oldest and she was {{fulfilling}} a lifelong dream. Carter Heywardanother of the group who were known as [...] "irregulars" [...] and sometimes called the [...] "Philadelphia Eleven"became the 1974 Ms. magazine Woman of the Year. Suzanne Hiatt later said [...] "In retrospect, to have been ordained 'irregularly' is the only way for women to have done it." [...] Alison Cheek, Heyward, and Piccard joined in the consecration, and Piccard gave the absolution, in a celebration of the Eucharist at Riverside Church in Manhattan in November 1974. Philip McNairy of the Diocese of Minnesota, who wanted women in the priesthood, was concerned that the eleven were hurting the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> deacons, who numbered over one hundred at the time.|$|E
500|$|Falle's pimp {{regularly}} {{beat her}} {{and she began to}} suffer from battered person syndrome. The worst beating she received was in a brothel where she and four other teenagers engaged in prostitution. Over the years that she was married to her pimp, she hoped he would change. She later said that she [...] "wanted to love him, believe he'd never do it again." [...] She tried to make him enough money through prostitution to convince him not to find another girl. He threatened her family, and conditioned her not to call the police. Fear of being labelled a [...] "snitch" [...] or [...] "rat" [...] prevented her from going to the police. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> she knew in the sex industry were in healthy relationships. At her peak, Falle owned a Ford Mustang, bought her pimp a Mercedes-Benz, and lived in a four-bedroom penthouse apartment, but she continued to experience violence. She used her material possessions to elevate herself above the women around her who were dependent on cocaine; she dismissed them as [...] "crackheads" [...] and [...] "crackhoes".|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to being}} cast on Knots Landing, Mills was {{predominantly}} known for playing [...] "damsel in distress" [...] roles, {{which is why}} the producers didn't initially consider her. Abby's storylines focused on business dealings, affairs and family troubles. Introduced as the sister of Sid Fairgate, she was initially portrayed as a friendly, warm-hearted woman with great love for her children. In due time, she evolved into the series' main antagonist, constantly causing mayhem in others' lives. According to series creator David Jacobs, the producers always intended Abby to be a J.R. Ewing-esque character. Jacobs said, [...] "When we were casting the role of Abby, we were looking for a homey type, someone whom the other women characters would trust. It was our intention to have this nice person gain the trust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> and then cause trouble for them. We didn't want the other characters and the audience to know that there was a scheming person under this nice facade. We wanted her to come on as a good person and then evolve into a vixen." ...|$|E

500|$|Abby {{was always}} {{intended}} to be the show's promiscuous seductress. In an interview with Carolyn McGuire of The Chicago Tribune, Jacobs said: [...] "When we were casting the role of Abby, {{we were looking for}} a homey type, someone whom the other women characters would trust.

We didn't want the other characters and the audience to know that there was a scheming person under this nice facade. We wanted her to come on as a good person and then evolve into a vixen." [...] Author June L. May of Monsters and Critics said, [...] "In season two of Knots Landing, a catalyst moves into the neighborhood in the form of Sid’s sister, the drop dead gorgeous Abby Cunningham. [...] Whether Abby is directly involved, or simply in the neighborhood, she has a detrimental affect on the harmony of couples." [...] Almost immediately, Abby sank her claws into Richard Avery (John Pleshette), one of the neighborhood husbands. Though the affair was brief, it set the stage for what was to come.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{investigations}} soon eliminated {{all but one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>women.</b> The other, {{a former}} coworker of Rasmussen's who had had some disputes with her, was eliminated by a covertly collected DNA sample. With only Lazarus left, they kept their investigation a closely guarded secret. Not only did her husband work in the nearby Commercial Crimes Division as a detective, she may have had other friends who could have tipped her off. If she were the killer, she could have improved her defense; if she were not, then they could have unintentionally smeared a fellow officer who had had an unblemished service record {{over the course of}} her career, with no disciplinary investigations or civilian complaints. They only referred to her as [...] "No. 5", worked on the case after hours or behind closed doors, and developed cover stories to explain why they wanted to look at personnel records for one particular officer from 20 years ago.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reasons for}} this big jump in the 1970s has been {{attributed}} by some scholars to widespread access to the birth control pill. While [...] "the pill" [...] was medically available in the 1960s, numerous laws restricted access to it. See, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (overturning a Connecticut statute barring access to contraceptives) and Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (establishing the right of unmarried people to access contraception). By the 1970s, the age of majority had been lowered from 21 to 18 in the United States, largely {{as a consequence of}} the Vietnam War; this also affected women's right to effect their own medical decisions. Since it had now become socially acceptable to postpone pregnancy even while married, women had the luxury of thinking about other things, like education and work. Also, due to electrification women's work around the house became easier leaving them with more time to be able to dedicate to school or work. Due to the multiplier effect, even if some women were not blessed with access to the pill or electrification, many followed by the example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> entering the work force for those reasons. The Quiet Revolution is called such because it was not a [...] "big bang" [...] revolution; rather, it happened and is continuing to happen gradually.|$|E
