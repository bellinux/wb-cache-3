The authors find that these generalizations in the assumptions are able to effect profound alterations in the conclusions. For example, if a firm is constrained to a fair return on invested capital, we find that the profit-maximizing firm would have an incentive to <b>overcapitalize</b> (the Averch-Johnson result), while the sales or output maximizing firm would have an incentive to undercapitalize. If any of several other methods of constraint are used, the authors find that there is no incentive to alter the relative amounts of labor and capital employed in the production process. ...|$|R

Averch and Johnson (1962) argue that certain regulation of electric utilities provides utilities the incentive to purchase an inefficiently large amount of capital. Another possible and related unintended consequence of electric utility regulation is that regulatory cost disallowances on capital may also increase utilities' incentives to <b>overcapitalize.</b> The authors provide theoretical evidence that capital expenditure disallowances will increase the Averch and Johnson effect in some instances and thus {{may have contributed to}} the overcapitalization problem that regulation was designed to discourage. Our model shows that disallowances can reduce the rate of return on investment and thereby increase the Averch and Johnson distortion. Electric utilities; Energy industries...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The Pacific halibut has {{supported}} a major commercial fishery on the West {{coast of the}} United States for over 100 years. In the past, the halibut fishery was managed by a policy of open access which led to an <b>overcapitalized</b> fishery and raised concerns about overfishing, fishing safety, and deteriorating product quality. In order to address these problems, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council implemented an individual transferable quota program for the halibut fishery in the Spring of 1995. The new quota regulations will provide some benefit to the severely <b>overcapitalized</b> halibut fishery. However, the ITQ program may threaten resource sustainability by providing fishermen with an incentive to exceed their quota and high grade their catch. In addition, the quota consolidation, job loss, and costs that will result from the new system will raise several ethical concerns regarding the ideas of social equity, efficiency, and stewardship. Based on traditional conservation ethics {{as well as more}} modern ideas, the envirocentric ethical approach to quota management can be used to address some of these environmental and ethical problems. Fishing quotas have had an interesting political history which has been evolving for the past 20 years. The quota issue spurred intense debate in Congress during the reauthorization of the Magnuson Act in 1996 and divided the fishing industry while pitting environmental groups against each other. With the Magnuson Act being amended, environmental groups were able to lobby Congress to include in the rewrite a 4 -year moratorium on new quota programs. The NPFMC did a commendable job with an overwhelming task by creating an ITQ plan which {{could be used as a}} prototype for future quota management. Although the halibut system adequately addresses several difficult issues, it will also produce its own problems, the full extent of which may not be realized for years to come. This research suggests that not only do ITQs provide some benefits, but also that much caution should be exhibited when allocating fishery resources in this manner...|$|E

Limited access and a stock rebuilding program were introduced in 1994, but an asymmetric distribution of potential gains in favor of relatively few, multi-permit companies has preoccupied public debate on the transferability and consolidation of fishing rights.

Based on data compiled from the field and photo-interpretation a conservative estimate is that about 5 - 7 % of the desert (‚âà 103, 000 acres) has been directly impacted by nitrate mining, nearly 174 million cubic yards of waste material generated, and over 100 processing plants abandoned.

A negative functional relationship was found between the catchability coefficient and the number of traps, which indicated that the fewer traps operating under the trap reduction scheme were more efficient. Also, the financial analyses indicated that the higher catch efficiency resulting from fewer traps generated significantly higher revenues, despite lower stock abundances.

40|$|We review fleet {{dynamics}} and fishermen behavior {{from an economic}} and sociological basis in developing fisheries, in mature fisheries near full exploitation, and in senescent fisheries that are overexploited and <b>overcapitalized.</b> In all cases, fishing fleets behave rationally within the imposed regulatory structures. Successful, generalist fishermen who take risks often pioneer developing fisheries. At this stage, regulations and subsidies tend to encourage excessive entry and investments, creating the potential for serial depletion. In mature fisheries, regulations often restrict season length, vessel and gear types, fishing areas, and fleet size, causing or exacerbating the race for fish and excessive investment, and are typically unsuccessful except when combined with dedicated access privileges (e. g., territorial rights, individual quotas). In senescent fisheries, vessel buyback programs must account for the fishing power of individuals and their vessels. Subsidies should be avoided as they prolong the transition towards alternative employment. Fisheries managers need to create individual incentives that align fleet {{dynamics and}} fishermen behavior with the intended societal goals. These incentives can be created both through management systems like dedicated access privileges and through market forces...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{seeks to}} determine the impact of lagged regulation on a profit-maximizing firm subject to a rate-of-return constraint. We are {{particularly interested in the}} effect of lag on the accomplishment of two regulatory goals: minimum-cost production, and an output greater than that of an unconstrained monopoly. The extend to which these goals are reached depends on whether the fair rate of return is equal to the cost of capital or somewhat higher. If the two are equal, lagged regulation accomplishes both goals; this contrasts sharply with continuous regulation, where the firm is indifferent among all methods of production or levels of output that let it break even in its operations. If the rate of return is above the cost of capital, it will not always pay for the firm to alter its resource allocation from the <b>overcapitalized</b> level indicated by Averch and Johnson. There will, however, be some length of the lag interval above which the firm will overcapitalize by successively smaller amounts, with attendant increases in output from the Averch-Johnson level. ...|$|E
