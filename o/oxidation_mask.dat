40|$|Silicides are the {{materials}} {{of choice for}} contacts and short interconnects in microelectronic devices. For {{a new generation of}} devices the realization of nanostructures is required. The optical lithography techniques encompass their limits. In this thesis it is shown that silicide layers can be patterned by local oxidation (LOCOSI). This technique uses standard optical lithography in combination with the well known masking technique employed for local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) and exploits the oxidation stability of silicide layers. During oxidation of the silicide silicon dioxide grows on top of the silicide. The silicide layer remains its morphology but moves into the silicon substrate. Local oxidation shifts the silicide layer deeper into the substrate only in the oxidized regions generating weak points at the transition regions between the unmasked and masked regions. At a critical silicon dioxide thickness depending on the mechanical stress field of the <b>oxidation</b> <b>mask</b> and the thickness of the silicide, the silicide layer breaks up at these transition points into two separated regions. In this thesis the patterning process of epitaxial CoSi_ 2 /Si(111) and CoSi_ 2 /Si(100) heterostructures is investigated. The influence of the crystal symmetry, the silicide thickness, the design of the <b>oxidation</b> <b>mask</b> and the oxidation conditions is discussed.

30|$|The {{experimental}} {{procedure for}} the formation of Ge nanocrystallite cluster within SiO 2 is described schematically in Figure  1. The SiO 2 capping layer prevents the evaporation of Ge during the final, high-temperature oxidation process for the generation of Ge QDs from the SiGe layer. The bottom Si 3 N 4 layer (in contact with the Si substrate) also acts as an <b>oxidation</b> <b>mask</b> to protect the Si substrate from oxidation during the thermal oxidation of the SiGe nanopillars. Thermal oxidation preferentially converts the Si from the poly-Si 0.85 Ge 0.15 into SiO 2, while squeezing the Ge released from solid solution within each poly-SiGe grain into irregularly shaped Ge nanocrystallite clusters that ostensibly assume the crystal orientation and the morphology of the original poly-SiGe grains. Thus, within this newly formed SiO 2, a self-assembled cluster of Ge nanocrystallites appears in the core of the oxidized nanopillars (Figure  1) and the Ge nanocrystallites are 5.8 [*]±[*] 1.2 nm in size with an interspacing of approximately 4.8 nm [7].|$|E

40|$|This {{communication}} {{reports the}} use of dry pressure-oxidation (P-OX) for obtaining oxide-isolated evice structures in both bulk silicon and epitaxial siIicon on sapphire (SOS). Dry P-OX is a new low tempera-ture oxidation technique which, compared with con-ventional dry thermal oxidation, reduces required oxi-dation temperatures a much as 400 ~ for equivalent oxide film growth. It has been shown, for example, that oxidation of silicon by 140 arm dry oxygen at 80 ~ 0 ~ is comparable to 1 atm dry oxidation at 1200 ~ (1). Localized oxide isolation of silicon devices in inte-grated circuits utilizes silicon nitride as an <b>oxidation</b> <b>mask</b> (2). In the present work two structures were examined, {{one in which the}} Si 3 N 4 was deposited di-rectly on the silicon surface and one in which a 500 - 1000 A conventional thermal oxide was grown prior to the nitride deposition. The nitride was grown by the SiH~-NH ~ process and was defined by supplemental CVD masking and etching in phosphoric acid. When the intermediate oxide layer was used, silicon areas were exposed by HF etching. The local oxidation proc-ess with dry P-OX was explored under a variety of experimental conditions, i. e., 700 ~ 176 140 - 500 atm oxygen pressure, and oxidation times o~f 3 - 24 hr. Optimum pressure-temperature-t ime conditions have not yet been determined, but at 850 ~ and 25, 0 arm, the average oxidation rate was about 17 A /min for silicon.

An efficiency of 18. 6 % (annealed) and 18. 4 % (stable, independently confirmed) is achieved for a PERC device fabricated from boron-doped Czochralski-silicon by means of the SiNTO process. The average efficiency of a batch of 34 SiNTO cells is 18. 2 %, measured after fabrication (not stabilised). Parallel processed Al-BSF references reach average efficiencies of 17. 7 %.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel method for the {{industrial}} fabrication of a silicon solar cell that features an oxidepassivated rear surface. The SiNTO process (Silicon Nitride Thermal Oxidation) utilizes a SiNX layer for masking the front {{side of the}} solar cell during the thermal <b>oxidation</b> process. This <b>masking</b> layer prevents the oxidation of the textured and phosphorus-doped emitter surface and limits {{the growth of the}} thermal oxide to the uncoated rear surface. After oxidation the SiNX layer remains at the front side of the cell and serves as an anti-reflection coating (ARC). In this work we investigate the impact of the thermal oxidation process on the SiNX film and the underlying emitter and analyze the passivation quality of the thermal oxide. The oxidation process results in a sufficiently passivated rear surface with a surface recombination velocity of 40 cm/s, measured after Al-metallization and post-metallization anneal. Measurements of the emitter sheet resistance and Seco ndary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) profiling reveal that the SiNX-coated emitter reorganizes slightly during the oxidation process whereas an uncoated reference is strongly affected.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the mechanistic basis of our recent observation that exposing young mice to an industrial surfactant potentiates the inhibition of fatty-acid β-oxidation that occurs with subsequent virus infection (Murphy et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1315, 208 – 216, 1996). In our mouse model for acute hepatic encephalopathy (AHE), neonatal mice were painted on their abdomens from birth to postnatal day 12 with nontoxic amounts of the industrial surfactant, Toximul MP 8 (Tox), and then infected with a sublethal dose (LD 30) of mouse-adapted human Influenza B (Lee) virus (FluB). Mortality in mice treated with Tox+FluB {{was significantly higher than}} that in mice treated with FluB alone. In vitro assays of hepatic β-oxidation of [1 - 14 C]palmitic and [1 - 14 C]octanoic acids in {{the presence or absence of}} exogenous coenzyme A (CoA) indicated that Tox-mediated inhibition of <b>oxidation</b> was <b>masked</b> when CoA was added to the assays. FluB also inhibited β-oxidation by 20 – 30 %, however this effect was independent of exogenous CoA which suggested that it involved a different mechanism. Tox-mediated potentiation of the inhibitory effect was most obvious (> 80 % inhibition) when assays were done without added CoA. Analysis of hepatic CoA and its esters indicated that levels of both free CoA and acetyl-CoA were significantly lower in mice that were painted with Tox for 12 days. Tox-dependent reductions of acetyl-CoA were transient and returned to normal values after cessation of painting, whereas those of CoA persisted. FluB infection alone significantly reduced hepatic acetyl-CoA and the magnitude of this reduction (> 30 %) was not affected by pre-exposing the mice to Tox. Relative to control mice, levels of acid insoluble acyl-CoA esters were elevated significantly in FluB and Tox+FluB treated mice. Activation of both [1 - 14 C]palmitic and [1 - 14 C]octanoic acids was reduced in Tox-exposed mice at experimental day 12, but only when exogenous CoA was not included in the assay media; this effect appeared to persist after cessation of painting. Collectively, these data support the concept that Tox and FluB have independent effects on hepatic CoA metabolism that are associated with abnormalities in fatty-acid β-oxidation. However, these do not fully explain the synergistic effect of the virus and chemical on β-oxidation inhibition, which is a candidate co-mechanism for potentiation of mortality in this mouse model of AHE...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a systematic {{investigation of the}} DHA-encapsulated particles. Special research attention {{was drawn to the}} particle drying behavior and surface phenomenon during and after the particle formation. As a heat and chemical sensitive substance, DHA is often errapsulated to decrease <b>oxidation</b> or to <b>mask</b> unpleasant taste and odour. Selection of the rest coating materials and micro-encapsulation process technology is crucial. In this study, different shell materials (protein-based and starch-based, respectively) were examined to indicate their feasibility for DHAoil encapsulation and to understand their drying behavior. Spray drying is a primary method to manufacture food and pharmaceutical powders. Before subjecting a new formulation (ingredient or wall material) to this process, informations about drying kinetics and shrinkage parameters, which are crucial to 100 del the spray drying process, can be obtained via single-droplet drying experiments. In this study, a glass filament method was adopted to measure the changes in droplet size, weight, and temperature during the drying of emulsion droplets containing DHA at specific solid-liquid ratios under hot air convection. The Reaction Engineering Approach (REA) could then be adopted to describe the drying behavior of the emulsion droplets, and correlate the shrinkage coefficients against the solids content. The heat transfer and mass transfer models of s~cific types of emulsion were also established. The REA model in this thesis has provided an accurate description of drying behaviour of the tested emulsion systems. Significant differerres could be found when comparing the present master curves with previous reJX>rted master curves. The early shell formation process was assumed to be the reason and was confirmed by the further studies. In addition, when an emulsion droplet was dried, the pro~rties of different dissolved solids could lead to different behaviors, for example, different shell formation process. Such phenomena could make droplet drying a very complex process to understand and also would affect the functionality of tre final dried particles. Thus, the surface phenomena of DHA-containing emulsion during convective droplet drying, with the associated functionality changes, were analyzed by the extended glass-filament single droplet drying approach to understand the mechanisms behind these changes. The in situ analysis of particle surface formation allowed changes in the dissolution behavior of tre semi-dried/dried particle to be monitored while droplet drying was in progress. By comparing the changes in dissolution behavior with different shell materials during drying, the possible material migration behavior during the DHA-containing emulsion droplet drying was examined and generated. Discussion based on visual observations of the emulsion morphologies, droplet drying behaviors and dissolution process was presented. The quick crust formation processes of tre DHA-containing emulsion droplets during drying were verified. The surface characterization for DHA containing particle before and after surface oil extraction were also carried out to detect tre influence of different wall materials on the surfa:e formation and surface com}X) sition.
