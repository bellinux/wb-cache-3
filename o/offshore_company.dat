At {{the same time the}} <b>offshore</b> <b>company,</b> which had failed to make payments for the charters in time, was forgiven 153,000 euros of penalty interests. As a result, Vesterinen and two other officials were found guilty for corruption and as a result lost their positions, were given suspended sentences of four to ten months and had to pay back the unlawfully obtained benefits. The incident ended the co-operation between DSND and the Finnish Maritime Administration and left many people suspicious about the profitability of the multipurpose icebreakers.|$|E

40|$|With an aim {{to ensure}} {{comprehensive}} worldwide {{protection of the}} social and labour rights of seafarers, the Maritime Labour Convention 2006, provides a model for tackling the most pressing globalisation challenges of our time by setting solid and uniform rules for the workers involved in commerce at sea, the seafarers. This study identifies implications of implementing the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 for Norwegian <b>offshore</b> <b>companies.</b> In order to answer the aim and objectives in this study, a range of Norwegian <b>offshore</b> <b>companies</b> were approached through interviews. Observations are also used to get an in depth understanding of the implementation process. The study revealed that the Convention created some implementation challenges for the <b>offshore</b> <b>companies,</b> and discusses if these problems occur as a result of neglecting the <b>offshore</b> <b>companies</b> when making the Convention. It emerges that the <b>offshore</b> <b>companies</b> have not been considered as a separate activity in the Convention. This made the new definition of a seafarer specially challenging for the <b>offshore</b> <b>companies,</b> {{due to the nature of}} the sector. Offshore activities related to shipping, as we know it in Norway, are not as central in other countries, with a few exceptions. In Norway, exemptions for some offshore positions were granted, which solved the problems regarding the definition for vessels registered in Norway. Other flag states has granted a statement of interpretation for each vessel, which excludes some positions from the Convention. The definition of a seafarer is the same as it was before the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 came. Further, it emerged that flag state inefficiency have been problematic for the <b>offshore</b> <b>companies,</b> which has lead to pressed time to finish the DMLC, which again has lead to pressed time to certify the vessels. The study concludes that the implications of implementing the Maritime Labour Convention for the Norwegian <b>offshore</b> <b>companies</b> occurs as a result of neglecting the offshore sector when the Convention was made...|$|R
