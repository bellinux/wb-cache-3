40|$|This {{study is}} {{primarily}} about the <b>Open</b> Organisations <b>Profile,</b> a questionnaire {{developed in the}} United States by Professor Oscar Mink (1991) to assess openness {{in the workplace and}} thus assist in decisions on organisational change and development. The <b>Open</b> Organisations <b>Profile</b> was developed as an assessment tool of the Open Organisations theoretical model. The Open Organisations Model offers researchers a lens to assess an organisational system and the system’s ability to adapt to internal and external changes in its environment, while maintaining a sense of unity. While the <b>Open</b> Organisations <b>Profile</b> has been used extensively in Australia and the United States of America, limited research has examined its psychometric properties. This current set of studies aimed to examine the psychometric qualities of the instrument. The first study examined the reliabilities and factor structure of the <b>Open</b> Organisations <b>Profile.</b> Results indicated that the <b>Open</b> Organisations <b>Profile</b> displayed high internal consistency ranging from r =. 80 to r =. 95. Furthermore confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the theoretical three factor model of unity, internal responsiveness and external responsiveness. The second study assessed cultural differences and similarities between Australia and American using the profile. The findings suggested that significant differences existed between the countries and also between male and female values across the nine dimensions measured. The final study examined the relationships between the three higher order factors of openness and customer satisfaction and sales performance. The study found that the three factors of openness had a mediating effect on customer satisfaction and sales performance. The three studies showed the <b>Open</b> Organisation <b>Profile</b> offers researchers a reasonably reliable and valid instrument for assessing the openness of an organisation and its ability to adapt to internal and external changes in the organisation’s environment.

As it is known, the low {{torsional}} stiffness and the eventual non-coincidence of the shear centre and centroid of the cross-section, make compressed thin-walled <b>open</b> <b>profiles</b> vulnerable to torsional and flexural-torsional buckling. Moreover, in real-world applications, critical loads are affected by initial imperfections, which generally have a significant influence.

40|$|Abstract. Carcass {{production}} of flexible offshore {{oil and gas}} pipes implies winding and interlocking of a roll formed stainless steel profile around a mandrel in a spiral shape. The location of the dividing point between {{the left and right}} half of the s-shaped profile in the finished carcass is very important as it directly influences carcass flexibility. The target location of the dividing point can be difficult to achieve since undesired degrees of freedom in the winding stage allows the profile to change geometry. The present work investigates this issue by performing production tests of a single carcass profile size on three mandrel sizes showing a size effect to be evident; smaller mandrel size increases a shift of the dividing point during initial mandrel contact in the winding stage. The cause is high strains in the <b>open</b> <b>profile,</b> which are minimized by the material moving closer to profile neutral plane. Other parameters such as profile entry angle on the mandrel and spiral pitch are likely to have significant importance. Proper dividing point position is shown to be obtainable by adjusting the profile in the roll forming stage. The profile rolling is successfully modeled by Finite Element Analysis (FEA), whereas a simplified FE-model of the subsequent winding operation shows that full interlock modeling is required for proper prediction of profile deformation...|$|E

The new blind-bolt is {{a modified version of}} the standard Lindapter Hollo-bolt, and its application relates to the construction of bolted, moment-resisting connections between <b>open</b> <b>profile</b> beams and concrete-filled tubular columns. The fatigue behaviour of the system is studied on the basis of constant amplitude loading tests, with a total of 56 experiments being reported. The specimens were subjected to tensile loading for various stress ranges, with the repeated load being selected relative to the design yield stress of the blind-bolt's internal shank. The influence of testing frequency and strength of concrete infill is also examined. An analysis of the results indicates that an increase in the concrete strength can increase the fatigue life of the EHB system. Within the tested range, the failure mode of the EHB under repeated loading was found to be due to internal bolt shank fracture, a mode which is consistent with its monotonic behaviour and also comparable with standard bolt–nut–washer system behaviour. The experimental results (S–N data) were further compared with the Eurocode 3 Part 1 - 9 guidelines. The fatigue design strength of the anchored EHB blind-bolt is found to be adequately represented by the current specification detail Category 50 that is provided for standard bolting systems...|$|E
