5|$|This section {{covers the}} actual management, or handling, <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> {{pertaining}} {{to a federal}} program, specifically on how federal assistance is distributed to recipients and how recipients manage the funds until disbursement. The actual transfer <b>of</b> <b>funds,</b> {{commonly referred to as}} “drawdowns”, is usually done electronically by requesting the funds to the federal agency via website or a network. The funds are automatically transferred from the US Department of Treasury to the recipient’s bank account. Federal assistance for program operations is provided to recipients usually by one of two methods, also called “funding techniques”: by either advances <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> or by reimbursement <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|E

5|$|Advances <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> – Advances are {{federal funds}} {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E
30|$|We proxy funding by {{the volume}} <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> {{and the number}} <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> deals. The latter might signal {{additional}} information about the potential value of the start-ups because a large volume <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> does not necessarily imply {{a large number of}} investors. Therefore, we introduce the number <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> deals as another industry measurement.|$|R

5|$|The state {{experienced}} budget shortages {{because of}} low tax revenues, which forced Jennings to pursue other means of financing the projects. The main sources <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> came from issuing government bonds to the state bank and sales of public lands. The state's spending and borrowing led to short-term budget problems, but despite early setbacks (poor access to capital eventually halted improvement programs and caused the Indiana Canal Company to fold because of lack <b>of</b> <b>funds),</b> the infrastructure improvements initiated by Jennings attracted new settlers to the state. By 1810 the Indiana Territory's population {{within the boundaries of}} the new state was 24, 520. In the decades following his governorship, Indiana's population grew from sixty-five thousand in 1816 to 147,178 in 1820 and surpassed one million by 1850.|$|E

Further, we identify the main structural characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>funding</b> systems, by looking at features like sectoral divisions, level of delegation {{and the role of}} different institutional levels in the management <b>of</b> <b>funding.</b> Against a widespread conception of research policies in central and eastern European countries converging towards a western-style model, our study displays profound differences between the considered countries, related to history but also to contextual factors in the reform phas...|$|R

5|$|A {{proposed}} {{variant of}} the B-52H was the EB-52H, which would have consisted of 16 modified and augmented B-52H airframes with additional electronic jamming capabilities. This variant would have restored USAF airborne jamming capability that it lost on retiring the EF-111 Raven. The program was canceled in 2005 following the removal <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> for the stand-off jammer. The program was revived in 2007, and cut again in early 2009.|$|E
5|$|A similar source <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> {{was to be}} the tax {{on exports}} of cotton.

Initial optimistic estimates of revenue to be collected through this tax ran as high as 20 million dollars, but in the end only $30 thousand was collected.|$|E

When hedge fund firms start <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>funds,</b> we find evidence of value creation, driven by better management of economies of scale and cross learning.
