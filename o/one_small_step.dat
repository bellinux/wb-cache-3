25|$|The Co-op {{refinery}} was {{a product}} of the Co-operative movement, which began in Britain in the mid-19th century. Frequently expanded and modernized, the Co-op plant (first constructed in 1935) was a small but modern refinery when talk about a refinery/upgrader complex began in the early 1980s. Both the federal and Saskatchewan governments had forbidden their Crown corporations to participate in the project, yet both took part themselves. The province had a particular interest, since an upgrader would increase the market for heavy oil from Saskatchewan's fields. This would give the provincial oil industry an important boost. The federal government saw the project as an opportunity to move the nation <b>one</b> <b>small</b> <b>step</b> towards the stated goal of crude oil self-sufficiency. For its part, the Co-op wanted an assured supply of crude oil for its refinery.|$|E

Computer scientists also study other models of computation including parallel computers (more than one deterministic step at a time), and quantum computers (which are based on non-deterministic quantum mechanical models).

40|$|Principia Mathematica revolutionised our {{understanding}} of mathematics by demonstrating {{for the first time}} that it was possible to put all mathematical arguments on an objective footing. It accomplished this by showing that any mathematical argument could be expressed in a formal ‘proof’, consisting of a series of assertions, each following from previous assertions via precisely specified rules of formal deduction. By expressing an argument in such a format, a mathematician could break the complex question of whether the argument was valid into many tiny questions, each asking whether a single step in the argument was valid. Then if the <b>steps</b> were <b>small</b> enough, it would be demonstrated beyond doubt that the original argument was correct. This perspective underlies all of modern mathematics.

40|$|Schuman’s Europe: His {{frame of}} {{reference}} provides an insight into the way European unification was envisioned by its founding father Robert Schuman. The thesis makes clear why Schuman can be considered the main architect of European unification because of his thoughts, his personality, his religious background as a practicing catholic and his origins from the region of Alsace-Lorraine. A comparison with several contemporary thinkers shows the uniqueness of Schuman’s thoughts regarding European unification. It explains that Schuman considered the European spiritual and cultural heritage to be the raison d’être of European unification and that this implies effective solidarity beyond frontiers. Schuman’s aim for European unification was peace and security, which should be achieved by political unification through economic integration {{at the service of}} the citizen and be consistent with the moral order based in Christianity. Schuman’s method of integration was <b>one</b> of <b>small</b> <b>steps,</b> taking into account the human psyche.

60|$|Again, as I {{hear from}} Mr. Rivers, the double-flowering Chinese peaches {{resemble}} almonds in their manner {{of growth and}} in their flowers; the fruit is much elongated and flattened, with the flesh both bitter and sweet, but not uneatable, and {{it is said to}} be of better quality in China. From this stage <b>one</b> <b>small</b> <b>step</b> leads us to such inferior peaches as are occasionally raised from seed. For instance, Mr. Rivers sowed a number of peach-stones imported from the United States, where they are collected for raising stocks, and some of the trees raised by him produced peaches which were very like almonds in appearance, being small and hard, with the pulp not softening till very late in the autumn. Van Mons (10/28. Quoted in 'Journal de La Soc. Imp. d'Horticulture' 1855 page 238.) also states that he once raised from a peach-stone a peach having the aspect of a wild tree, with fruit like that of the almond. From inferior peaches, such as these just described, we may pass by small transitions, through clingstones of poor quality, to our best and most melting kinds. From this gradation, from the cases of sudden variation above recorded, and {{from the fact that the}} peach has not been found wild, it seems to me by far the most probable view, that the peach is the descendant of the almond, improved and modified in a marvellous manner.|$|E
60|$|In {{considering}} {{the probability of}} natural selection having come into action in rendering species mutually sterile, {{one of the greatest}} difficulties will be found to lie in the existence of many graduated steps from slightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility. It may be admitted, on the principle above explained, that it would profit an incipient species if it were rendered in some slight degree sterile when crossed with its parent-form or with some other variety; for thus fewer bastardised and deteriorated offspring would be produced to commingle their blood with the new species in process of formation. But he who will take the trouble to reflect on the steps by which this first degree of sterility could be increased through natural selection to that higher degree which is common to so many species, and which is universal with species which have been differentiated to a generic or family rank, will find the subject extraordinarily complex. After mature reflection {{it seems to me that}} this could not have been effected through natural selection. Take the case of any two species which, when crossed, produce few and sterile offspring; now, what is there which could favour the survival of those individuals which happened to be endowed in a slightly higher degree with mutual infertility, and which thus approached by <b>one</b> <b>small</b> <b>step</b> towards absolute sterility? Yet an advance of this kind, if the theory of natural selection be brought to bear, must have incessantly occurred with many species, for a multitude are mutually quite barren. With sterile neuter insects we have reason to believe that modifications in their structure and fertility have been slowly accumulated by natural selection, from an advantage having been thus indirectly given to the community to which they belonged over other communities of the same species; but an individual animal not belonging to a social community, if rendered slightly sterile when crossed with some other variety, would not thus itself gain any advantage or indirectly give any advantage to the other individuals of the same variety, thus leading to their preservation.|$|E
