5|$|From {{the start}} of Elizabeth's reign, it was {{expected}} that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships, or that she knew herself to be infertile. She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the mid-1800s, most {{legal systems}} viewed wife beating as <b>a</b> valid {{exercise}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband's</b> authority over his wife.

5|$|Miss Honora Sneyd {{would not}} admit the {{unqualified}} control <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> over all her actions; {{she did not}} feel, that seclusion from society was indispensably necessary to preserve female virtue, or to secure domestic happiness. Upon terms of reasonable equality, she supposed, that mutual confidence might best subsist; she said, that, as Mr Day had decidedly declared his determination to live in perfect seclusion from what is usually called the world, it was fit she should decidedly declare, {{that she would not}} change her present mode of life, with which she had no reason to be dissatisfied, for any dark and untried system, that could be proposed to her.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} second acts deal with the {{attempts}} of the central character, Harry Luckless, to woo his landlady's daughter, and his efforts to make money by writing plays. In the second act, he finishes a puppet theatre play titled The Pleasures of the Town, about the Goddess Nonsense's choice <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> from allegorical representatives of theatre and other literary genres. After its rejection by one theatre, Luckless's play is staged at another. The third act becomes a play within a play, in which {{the characters in the}} puppet play are portrayed by humans. The Author's Farce ends with a merging of the play's and the puppet show's realities.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Guillaume {{revolves}} around the common theme of the , a young man who, because of a wager (in the case of Guillaume, because of jealousy) needs to find a young woman's favor. He fails in his enterprise but pretends publicly to have succeeded, causing the ruin <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> (if the gageure had claimed to have succeeded with another man's wife) or, in this case, the despair of a brother. Usually the young man's story is believed at first because he reveals an intimate detail about a young woman, who then has to prove her innocence.|$|E

25|$|In law, treason is {{the crime}} that covers {{some of the more}} extreme acts against one's nation or sovereign.

25|$|All Apache peoples {{lived in}} {{extended}} family units (or family clusters); they usually lived close together, with each nuclear family in separate dwellings. An extended family generally consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> and wife, their unmarried children, their married daughters, their married daughters' husbands, and their married daughters' children. Thus, {{the extended family}} is connected through a lineage of women who live together (that is, matrilocal residence), into which men may enter upon marriage (leaving behind his parents' family).|$|E

25|$|During the Austro-Prussian War, Victoria and Frederick {{received}} a hard blow. Sigismund, their fourth child, died of meningitis at 21 months on 18 June 1866, {{just a few}} days before the Battle of Königgrätz. This tragedy weakened the Crown Princess, who found no comfort from her mother or her in-laws. Queen Augusta demanded that her daughter-in-law quickly resume her official duties instead of feeling sorry for herself. Queen Victoria, who was still mourning the loss of Prince Albert, didn't understand the feelings of her daughter and considered that the loss of a child was much less severe than that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the past}} most agunah cases {{were due to}} a husband dying without leaving clear {{evidence}} of his demise, or becoming mentally ill (insane).

Nevertheless, the Prenuptial Agreement for the Prevention of Get-Refusal is one remedy which is in use in Modern Orthodox Jewish communities worldwide and is accepted by moderate halakhic authorities.|$|E
25|$|In Pride's first book, The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, Back to Reality, she chronicled {{her journey}} {{away from what}} she argued were feminist and anti-natal ideas of happiness, within which she had lived as an activist before her {{conversion}} to conservative evangelical Christianity in 1977. She described her discovery of happiness surrounding what she felt was the Biblically mandated role of wives and mothers as bearers of children and workers in the home under the authority <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband.</b> Pride argued that such a lifestyle was Biblically required of married Christian women but that most had been unknowingly duped by feminism.

25|$|In Jogajog (Relationships), {{the heroine}} Kumudini—bound by {{the ideals of}} Śiva-Sati, {{exemplified}} by Dākshāyani—is torn between her pity for the sinking fortunes of her progressive and compassionate elder brother and his foil: her roue <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband.</b> Tagore flaunts his feminist leanings; pathos depicts the plight and ultimate demise of women trapped by pregnancy, duty, and family honour; he simultaneously trucks with Bengal's putrescent landed gentry. The story revolves around the underlying rivalry between two families—the Chatterjees, aristocrats now on the decline (Biprodas) and the Ghosals (Madhusudan), representing new money and new arrogance. Kumudini, Biprodas' sister, is caught between the two as she is married off to Madhusudan. She had risen in an observant and sheltered traditional home, as had all her female relations.|$|E
25|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have stated that}} the superiority <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>husband</b> over his wife is relative, and the obedience of the wife is also restrictive. The Quran advises men {{that if they are}} certain of a rebellious attitude by the woman, they should first admonish her, then refuse to share beds, and finally beat ("darab") her, according to Qur'an 4:34. (Today most Islamic scholars agree that it be without leaving a mark and not on the face). This refers to serious breaches of behaviour such as being promiscuous according to renowned 20th-century scholar Muhammad Hamidullah which is not expected from a dutiful wife, and not for simple disobedience to the husband. In explaining this, Ibn Abbas gives an example of striking with a toothstick.|$|E
