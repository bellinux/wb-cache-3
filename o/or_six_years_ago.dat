2500|$|Like Fey, who {{was head}} writer of Saturday Night Live (SNL) from 1999 to 2006, the {{character}} is head writer for a sketch comedy show. For this reason, Liz Lemon is widely seen by critics as a fictionalized version of Fey herself, which Fey herself has confirmed as being her intention. In a video interview conducted with Fey before the airing of the pilot, she stated that Liz is herself [...] "five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> when I first started at my job and {{had to figure out}} how to deal with big, strong personalities and get through the day, being sort-of scared of everyone... but acting like you're not scared of everyone." ...|$|E

60|$|It is, happily, no {{new thing}} that Englishmen should employ their wealth in {{building}} and endowing institutions for educational purposes. But, five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> deeds of foundation expressed or implied conditions as nearly as possible contrary to those {{which have been}} thought expedient by Sir Josiah Mason. That is to say, physical science was practically ignored, while a certain literary training was enjoined {{as a means to}} the acquirement of knowledge which was essentially theological.|$|R

"Mr. Bindloose," [...] said she, [...] "I am no {{sure that}} you may mind, about <b>six</b> <b>or</b> seven <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> that there were twa daft English callants, lodgers of mine, that had some trouble from auld St. Ronan's about {{shooting}} on the Springwell-head muirs." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{has been}} grumbling all the time," [...] said Lily, [...] "and swears he never {{will have the}} laurels so robbed again. Five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> he used to declare that death would {{certainly}} save him from the pain of such another desecration before the next Christmas; but he has given up that foolish notion now, and talks as though he meant to protect the Allington shrubs at any rate {{to the end of}} this century." ...|$|E
60|$|Whilst we were digging, the two staff-officers rode to the date-groves of Wady Tiryam, {{and made}} a plan of the ancient defences--the results of the first Khedivial Expedition had either not been {{deposited}} at, or had been lost in, the Staff bureau, Cairo. They found that the late torrents had filled up the sand pits acting as wells; and the people assured them that the Fiumara had ceased to show perennial water only about five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Chillip {{had left}} Blunderstone <b>six</b> <b>or</b> seven <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and I {{had never seen}} him since.

6000|$|Other {{types of}} early {{literature}} are the riming chronicles or verse histories (such as Layamon's Brut, a famous poem, {{in which the}} Arthurian legends appear as part of English history), stories of travel, translations, religious poems, books of devotion, miracle plays, fables, satires, ballads, hymns, lullabies, lyrics of love and nature,--an astonishing collection for so ancient a time, indicative at once of our changing standards of poetry and of our unchanging human nature. For the feelings which inspired or gave welcome to these poems, some five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> are precisely the same feelings which warm {{the heart of a}} poet and his readers to-day. There is nothing ancient but the spelling in this exquisite Lullaby, for instance, which was sung on Christmas eve: ...|$|R

"Five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> it did {{not seem}} likely that you, my [...] dear ones, should, after such a loss, find a Friend in your [...] Brother,—that I should survive our dear Father.

50|$|Anagumang was a (probably legendary) Yapese {{navigator}} who led {{an expedition}} in rafts and canoes five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> On this expedition {{he discovered the}} islands of Palau, {{where he and his}} men first saw limestone. Limestone did not exist on Yap. The Palauan natives let the Yapese quarry this limestone in return for coconut meat, beads and copra; as well as performing services. Anagumang and his men first quarried the rock to make fish-shapes, but then changed to making the huge rings which are now known as Rai stones, which were easier to transport. These were then used as currency on Yap, despite being very hard to carry around. After this expedition, the Yapese frequently quarried more of these stones as more money was needed.|$|R

Now, I'm an English Minister, and I've got nobody but a maid-servant to open my hall door, and I'm obliged to look after my own wine. I wonder whether it's improper?
