5|$|The third {{match of}} the show was between Raven and Chris K. This match <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> Raven refused to quit the company, which was {{something}} NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko had requested in the storyline.

5|$|Influences of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} can {{be discerned}} in the geographically distant schools of {{architecture of the}} Hoysala Empire in southern Karnataka, and the Kakatiya dynasty in present-day Andhra Pradesh. Sometimes called the Gadag style of architecture, Western Chalukya architecture is considered a precursor to the Hoysala architecture of southern Karnataka. This influence <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> the early builders employed by the Hoysalas came from pronounced centres of medieval Chalukya art. Further monuments in this style were built {{not only by the}} Western Chalukya kings but, also by their feudal vassals.|$|E

Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. Later, they {{discover}} the broken shells of dinosaur eggs. Grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding, which <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> of their frog DNA—West African bullfrogs can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.|$|E
5|$|The 2016 season saw {{a return}} to the playoffs for the Crusaders, who posted a record of 11 wins and 4 losses, Despite the Crusaders having a good record they still {{finished}} 6th in the last spot of the Australasian Group. This <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> the Hurricanes, Highlanders and Chiefs all posted a record of 11 wins and 4 losses. However, the other teams earned more points than the Crusaders (50) so finished higher Hurricanes (53), Highlanders (52) and Chiefs (51). The Crusaders had to travel to Johannesburg to face the Lions. The Crusaders were well beaten by the (Runners-up) Lions 42-25 in the qualifier round.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match of}} the event pitted Raven against P.J. Polaco. This match <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> Raven refused to quit the company, which was {{something}} NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko had requested in the storyline. Since Raven refused to quit, Zbyszko forced him to wrestle Polaco. Cassidy Riley interfered in the match by attempting to aid Raven. The duration of the bout was 5 minutes and 45 seconds. Raven won the contest by forcing Polaco's head into the mat with his signature Even Flow DDT maneuver.|$|E

5|$|According to Armando Maya Castro, many {{students}} {{who are members of}} the church have been discriminated against for refusing to partake in celebrations and customs concerning the Day of the Dead in their schools, and some have been punished for it. In one case reported by a Mexican newspaper, La Gaceta, a female member of the church was pushed by a fellow bus passenger, who then crossed herself because the member was wearing a long skirt. In July 25, 2008, a public official sealed the entrance to a La Luz del Mundo temple in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, trapping the congregation inside until other officials removed the seals. This incident <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> of complaints from individuals who did not like the presence of the church in the area. Reporter Rodolfo Chávez Calderón stated that the church was in compliance with local laws.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) number of A and B alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B alleles, chances are that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the {{boundaries}} of the Clause were further defined when Senator William S. Kenyon was allowed to accept an appointment by President Warren G. Harding as circuit judge for the Eighth Circuit. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty concluded that no disqualifying event had <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> the increase in emoluments to that office had occurred in a term prior to the one Kenyon was serving {{at the time of the}} nomination. (Daugherty's opinion would later be reaffirmed by the Clinton administration when Representative Bill Richardson was nominated as U.N. Ambassador.) No rollback was attempted when Senator Hugo Black was appointed to the Supreme Court, and in Ex parte Levitt, the court rejected, for lack of legal standing, an attempt to prevent Black from taking his seat based on Ineligibility Clause objections. The movant in the Black case, Albert Levitt, only had an interest in the case as a United States Citizen and a member of the Supreme Court bar, which the Court found to be insufficient.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Pablo Jayat {{and colleagues}} {{reviewed}} {{the members of}} the Akodon boliviensis species group, including A.spegazzinii, in Argentina. They could not find clear differentiation in either morphological or molecular characters between animals belonging to A.alterus, A.leucolimnaeus, A.spegazzinii, and A.tucumanensis, and consequently concluded that they all represent a single species. Although genetic variation is relatively high within A.spegazzinii, there is no clear geographic structure among haplotypes from different regions. The next year, Ulyses Pardiñas and colleagues concluded that A.oenos, which had formerly, and incorrectly, been placed in the A.varius species group, was in fact another synonym of A.spegazzinii. The proliferation of scientific names for this one species <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> of the terseness of the original description of A.spegazzinii, and a lack of large samples and of appreciation of the substantial variation occurring within A.spegazzinii.|$|E
5|$|Marco Pesenti Gritti, the {{initiator}} of Galeon, {{originally developed}} Epiphany in 2002 as a fork of Galeon. The fork <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> of the divergent aims of Gritti {{and the rest}} of Galeon development team about new features. While Gritti regarded Galeon's monolithic design and the number of user-configurable features as factors limiting Galeon's maintainability and user base expansion, the rest of the Galeon developers wanted to see more features added. At the same time the GNOME project created the GNOME human interface guidelines, which promoted simplification of user interfaces. As Galeon was oriented towards power users, most developers saw the implementation of those guidelines as unacceptable. As a result, Gritti created a new browser based on Galeon's codebase, with most of the non-mission-critical features removed. He intended Epiphany to comply fully with the GNOME human interface guidelines, with a very simple user-interface. As such, Epiphany does not have its own theme settings and uses GNOME's settings, which are specified in the GNOME Control Center.|$|E
5|$|Molly {{lost her}} {{championship}} to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud {{led to a}} Hair versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in her having her head shaved. Greenwald maintains {{that it was her}} idea to have her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> she wanted to do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using loose-fitting wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E

5|$|Protohistoric {{refers to}} the period when American Indians were exposed to European trade items and large {{population}} shifts <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> of introduced European diseases and warfare, but {{there is very little}} direct written documentation. Explorers such as Marquette and Joliet occasionally documented American Indians along the Mississippi in Iowa, {{but it was not until}} the early 19th century that regular written accounts of American Indians in Iowa became common. American Indians in the early Protohistoric period continued many aspects of Oneota culture, but soon almost all indigenous technology disappeared, including ceramics and stone tool production. It was during this period that the Meskwaki (Fox) and Sauk appeared in eastern Iowa, displaced from their homelands in the east. Important protohistoric sites include Milford; Blood Run; Gillett Grove; and Iowaville.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{intolerance}} was {{one particular}} {{factor in the}} decline of the Pax Mongolica. In Rus', the Mongols (known as the Golden Horde), gradually lost power and territory due to intolerance specifically geared towards different religions. The Rus' Mongols converted to Islam and joined the Egyptian Mamluks for political reasons. At one point in the war the Golden Horde even fought the Persian Mongols. The eastern part of the Golden Horde, White Horde, had friendly relations with the Ilkhanate and the Great Khan. The decentralisation <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> communication was so difficult due to the collapsing trade system and the rivalry between Mongol princes. Eventually, the Persian Mongol leader Ghazan converted to Islam in 1295. This contributed to the growing power of Nawruz; a Muslim Oirat general.|$|E
5|$|Results {{showed that}} Golkar, the former ruling {{party of the}} New Order era led by People's Representative Council Speaker Akbar Tanjung, had won {{the largest number of}} seats, {{defeating}} President Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle (PDI–P). Golkar received more votes than other parties in twenty-six out of thirty-two provinces. However, these results <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> of declining PDI–P popularity rather than an increase in Golkar's popularity. Golkar's support in its traditional stronghold of Sulawesi declined due to the performance of medium and small parties in the region. Despite winning the largest share of vote once again in Bali, PDI–P performance there suffered the greatest after the 2002 bombings by terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah devastated the island province's economy.|$|E

5|$|Sable briefly {{became a}} face again when she {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Playboy magazine (March 2004 issue) {{for the third time in}} her career. On the cover, she appeared with fellow diva Torrie Wilson, making them the first WWE Divas to pose in Playboy together. Surrounding the release of the cover, the duo feuded with Raw divas Stacy Keibler and Miss Jackie, even though all four women were faces at the time. The two teams squared off at WrestleMania XX in an Interpromotional Tag Team Evening Gown match, but the divas started the match in their underwear, making it more of a lingerie match. Sable and Wilson were victorious. The change was rumored to have <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> Sable had suffered damage to her Breast Implants while Weightlifting.|$|E
5|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} advanced {{to explain the}} swiftness and ease of the initial Lombard advance in northern Italy. It {{has been suggested that}} the towns' doors may have been opened by the betrayal of the Gothic auxiliaries in the Byzantine army, but historians generally hold that Lombard success <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> Italy was not considered by Byzantium as {{a vital part of the}} empire, especially at a time when the empire was imperilled by the attacks of Avars and Slavs in the Balkans and Sassanids in the east. The Byzantine decision not to contest the Lombard invasion reflects the desire of Justinian's successors to reorient the core of the Empire's polices eastward.|$|E
5|$|The problem <b>occurred</b> <b>because</b> {{of the way}} the {{vehicles}} were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side.

A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
