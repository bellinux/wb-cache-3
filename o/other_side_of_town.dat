He is given a belt containing $10,000 and told that he must reach the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> where he would then win the money and his life. Pursuing him is the hunt organizer Emil Fouchon (Lance Henriksen), his lieutenant Pik Van Cleef (Arnold Vosloo), a businessman named Mr. Lopaki who has paid $500,000 for the opportunity to hunt a human, and mercenaries including Stephan (Sven-Ole Thorsen) and Peterson (Jules Sylvester). Binder fails to reach his destination and is shot by three crossbow bolts. Van Cleef retrieves the money belt.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first house}} burned, {{and the family}} lost its possessions. They {{moved to a new}} house on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> on Rose Street, which Williams' mother soon turned into a {{boarding}} house. The house had a small garden, on which they grew diverse crops that Williams and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana. At a chance meeting in Georgiana, Hank Williams met U.S. Representative J. Lister Hill while he was campaigning across Alabama. Williams told Hill that his mother was interested to talk with him about his problems and her need to collect Elonzo Williams' disability pension. With Hill's help, the family began collecting the money. Despite his medical condition, the family managed fairly well financially throughout the Great Depression.|$|E

500|$|Dianetics {{appeared}} {{to be on the}} edge of total collapse. However, it was saved by Don Purcell, a millionaire businessman and Dianeticist who agreed to support a new Foundation in Wichita, Kansas. Their collaboration ended after less than a year when they fell out over the future direction of Dianetics. The Wichita Foundation became financially nonviable after a court ruled that it was liable for the unpaid debts of its defunct predecessor in Elizabeth, N.J. The ruling prompted Purcell and the other directors of the Wichita Foundation to file for voluntary bankruptcy in February 1952. Hubbard resigned immediately and accused Purcell of having been bribed by the American Medical Association to destroy Dianetics. Hubbard established a [...] "Hubbard College" [...] on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> where he continued to promote Dianetics while fighting Purcell in the courts over the Foundation's intellectual property.|$|E

2500|$|In 1954, Phelps, his {{pregnant}} wife, and their newborn son moved to Topeka, Kansas, {{where he was}} hired by the East Side Baptist Church as an associate pastor. The following year, the church's leadership opened Westboro Baptist Church on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> and Phelps became its pastor. [...] Although the new church was ostensibly nondenominational, Phelps preached a doctrine very {{similar to that of the}} Primitive Baptists, who believe that Christian biblical scripture is literally true, and that a predetermined number of people, who were selected for redemption before the world was created, will be saved on Judgment Day. [...] (The Baptist World Alliance and the Southern Baptist Convention have both denounced Phelps and his teachings over the years, as have many Primitive Baptist congregations.) [...] His vitriolic preaching alienated church leaders and most of the original congregation, leaving him with a small following consisting almost entirely of his own relatives and close friends. [...] Phelps was forced to support himself selling vacuum cleaners, baby strollers, and insurance; later, some of his 13 children were reportedly compelled to sell candy door-to-door for several hours each day. [...] In 1972, two companies sued Westboro Baptist for failing to pay for the candy being resold by the children.|$|E
