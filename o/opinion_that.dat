30|$|More formally, given {{a product}} catalog C, our {{ultimate}} goal is to generate an Enriched Catalog C+ as follows. For each product p_i = 〈 t, A〉 in C, there is an enriched representation p^+_i = 〈 t, A, S〉, where S = A∪{General,Other}. Each element in S is called an aspect class. For each aspect class S ∈S, we have a set of opinions O_p_i,S as follows. When S = A ∈A, O_p_i,S is the set of opinions referring to attribute A in pj, <b>that</b> is, <b>opinions</b> <b>that</b> fall in to case 1 above. When S=General, O_p_i,S is a set of <b>opinions</b> <b>that</b> refer to the product as a whole, <b>that</b> is, <b>opinions</b> <b>that</b> fall in case 2 above.
