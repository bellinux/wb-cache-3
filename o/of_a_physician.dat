5|$|Among the {{earliest}} cases of rumination was that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physician</b> {{in the nineteenth}} century, Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, who acquired the condition {{as the result of}} experiments upon himself. As a way of evaluating and testing the acid response of the stomach to various foods, the doctor would swallow sponges tied to a string, then intentionally regurgitate them to analyze the contents. As a result of these experiments, the doctor eventually regurgitated his meals habitually by reflex.|$|E

25|$|At maximal doses, and {{sometimes}} at much lower doses, {{side effects of}} iodide used for medical reasons, in doses of 1000 times the normal nutritional need, may include: acne, loss of appetite, or upset stomach (especially during the first several days, as the body adjusts to the medication). More severe side effects which require notification <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physician</b> are: fever, weakness, unusual tiredness, swelling in the neck or throat, mouth sores, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, irregular heartbeat, numbness or tingling of the hands or feet, or a metallic taste in the mouth.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{registered}} nurses (RNs) in the pre-hospital setting {{is common in}} many countries. In some {{regions of the world}} nurses are the primary healthcare worker that provides emergency medical services. In European countries such as France or Italy, also use nurses as a means of providing ALS services. These nurses may work under the direct supervision <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physician,</b> or, in rarer cases, independently. In some places in Europe, notably Norway, paramedics do exist, but the role of the 'ambulance nurse' continues to be developed, as it is felt that nurses may bring unique skills to some situations encountered by ambulance crews.|$|E

25|$|An {{attempt to}} {{describe}} the model of care used quickly becomes complex. At the ALS end of the spectrum, the model closely resembles the German version of the Franco-German model, with paramedics working with and under the direction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physician.</b> This represents, however, only the 5 percent of EMS personnel {{in the entire country}} who are paramedics, and only a single ambulance, out of 77 units in service. For the balance, the model much more closely resembles the Anglo-American model, with EMTs making their own treatment decisions based upon local guidelines, albeit at a basic life support level, or at best, with the limited skill set of an EMT-I.|$|E
25|$|William Albert Bruce Cooper {{was born}} on 22 November 1914 in Castle Eden, County Durham, England. The son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physician,</b> he {{received}} his education at Henry Smith Grammar School in Hartlepool, County Durham. In 1930, the teenager obtained work on a tramp steamer by prevaricating about his age. Cooper graduated with a medical degree from Durham University in 1938. Before the Second World War, he was a general practitioner in County Durham. There, he not infrequently had to treat the victims of coalmining accidents. In one such case, he had to maneuver half a mile in a tunnel, eventually rescuing a man pinned under a rockfall by amputating his lower extremity.|$|E
25|$|Women and men {{inhabited}} {{very different}} roles in natal care {{up to the}} 18th century. The role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>physician</b> was exclusively held by men who went to university, an overly male institution, who would theorize anatomy {{and the process of}} reproduction based on theological teaching and philosophy. Many beliefs about the female body and menstruation in the 17th and 18th centuries were inaccurate; clearly resulting from the lack of literature about the practice. Many of the theories of what caused menstruation prevailed from Hippocratic philosophy. Midwives of this time were those assisted in the birth and care of both born and unborn children, and as the name suggests this position held mainly by women.|$|E
