40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronization</b> with PGF 2 a and CIDR on the ovarian antral follicle population and plasma IGF- 1 concentration in goats. Daily transrectal ultrasonographic examination was conducted in 24 regularly cycling goats that were divided equally into 3 groups and oestrus synchronized with PGF 2 a (group A), CIDR (group B) and unsynchronized group (C). The mean number of follicles and IGF- 1 concentration was significantly higher in the synchronized and subsequent natural oestrous cycles of group A and B when compared to group C. The total number of 3 mm diameter follicles were significantly higher in groups A and B compared with the control group C while the follicles that were 6 mm and larger were not significantly different (p> 0. 05). There was a significant low positive correlation (r = 0. 14, N = 234) between IGF- 1 concentration and the number of 3 mm follicles and between plasma IGF-I concentration and number of follicles (r = 0. 13, N = 234).

40|$|A {{total of}} 137 cycling Zebu cows, each {{receiving}} a single dose of prostaglandin PGF 2 a {{were used in}} an <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronization</b> programme on three different farms. Of the cows on the three farms, 60. 6 and 90. 5 percent showed over oestrus and luteolysis, respectively. Pregnancy rate to fixed time inseminations following single injection of PGF 2 a was 61. 4 percent for farm 1, {{significantly higher than the}} values of 45. 7 and 46. 9 percent for farms 2 and 3, respectively. The pregnancy rates to second service of rebred cows were 53. 3, 50. 0 and 50. 0 percent for the three farms, respectively, with no significant differences between each. Fertility classification of the cows based on progesterone (P 4) concentration showed that 6. 6 percent of cows on the three farms were incorrectly diagnosed as having corpora lutea; 2. 9 percent of them had incomplete luteolysis and 5. 1 percent may have lost their embryos between days 21 and 45 post-insemination. The pregnancy rate was 10 percent higher in the rainy season than in the dry season. Cows with body condition scores of 3 and 4 had a higher overall pregnancy rates than those with a body condition score of 2.

Experiments were conducted to compare Oocyte Recovery (OR) between Laparoscopic Ovum Pick-Up (LOPU) and ovarian slicing and to evaluate the effects of OR cycle, hormone stimulation, <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronization,</b> breeds, liveweight and age of goats on {{the quantity and quality}} of oocytes obtained. In Experiment 1, oocytes were recovered from abattoir-derived ovaries by the slicing method. The ovaries were transported to the laboratory for immediate harvesting. The slicing method yielded significantly (p< 0. 05) larger number of oocytes per ovary than LOPU (22. 53 ± 2. 78 vs. 6. 10 ± 0. 46). However, the proportion of Grade A oocytes was highest from the LOPU technique (30. 51 ± 4. 14) compared to the slicing method (19. 07 ± 3. 57). LOPU resulted in good quality Cumulus Oocytes Complexes (COC) with more than 5 layers of cumulus cells. Experiment 2 consisted of three OR cycles (OR- 1, OR- 2 or OR- 3); four durations of <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronization</b> using CIDR (Day- 10, - 14, - 17 or - 21); three goat breeds (Boer Crossbred, Mixed breed or Katjang); 4 age groups (Young, Mature, Old or Very Old) and 4 levels of body weight (20, 21 - 29, 30 - 37 or 38 kg). Goats were synchronized using Control Internal Drug Release (CIDR) combined with 125 jig Estrumate and hyperstimulated with 70 mg FSH and 400 IU hCG after the removal of CIDR 24 h later. There was no significant effect of OR cycle, CIDR removal goat breed, age or body weight on the total number of oocytes recovered per ovary. Katjang goats yielded a higher proportion of Grade A oocytes compared to Boer Crossbreds and mixed breeds which had a higher proportion of Grade C oocytes (p< 0. 05). Age and weight of animals had no significant effect on the quality of oocytes recovered. Grade A and B oocytes were obtained in OR- 1, whilst the repetition of LOPU resulted in an increment of Grade C oocytes in OR- 2 and OR- 3, respectively. Day- 10 and - 21 gave the highest cumulative percentage of 58 and 64 % for Grade A and B oocytes, respectively.

The present work was conducted to compare the efficiency of an <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronization</b> protocol “ovsynch” in Nili Ravi buffalo during peak (n= 8) and low breeding seasons (n= 11) by determining luteinizing hormone (LH) peak and progesterone (P 4) rise in blood plasma using ELISA. Buffaloes were administered gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue (50 µg lecirelin; day 0) followed by prostaglandinF 2 α (PGF 2 α) analogue (150 µg cloprostenol; day 7) and again GnRH analogue at 36 hours after PGF 2 α. Blood sampling for LH was started 12 h after PGF 2 α injection and done at 3 h interval up to 108 h. An animal was considered to have responded to ovsynch protocol if it showed LH peak within 48 h after PGF 2 α injection (and within 3 - 6 h after second GnRH injection) and showed a P 4 concentration of > 2. 0 ng/ml on day 18 after the 1 st GnRH injection. 87. 5 % animals showed positive response to ovsynch protocol in term of oestrus and ovulation synchronization during the peak season as assessed by LH peak and P 4 level while only 36. 36 % animals responded to synchronization treatment during low breeding season (P< 0. 05). The LH peak in responsive animals was 11. 48 ± 1. 98 and 10. 38 ± 1. 77 ng/ml in peak and low breeding season respectively.

These techniques, collectively termed biotechnology, create the opportunity for modifying domestic animals in ways that markedly increase the efficiency of production. Among the procedures being developed for animal production systems are marker-assisted selection of specific alleles of a gene that are associated with high production, production of transgenic animals, super ovulation and embryo transfer, in vitro fertilization, embryo sexing and cloning, production of large amounts of previously-rare proteins through use of genetically -engineered bacteria or other cells, and identification of new biologically-active molecules as potential regulators of animal function. To date, most uses of biotechnology have concentrated on problems of general relevance to animal agriculture rather than specific problems related to livestock production in hot climates. However, it is likely that biotechnology will be used for this latter purpose also. Strategies to increase disease resistance using marker-assisted selection, production of transgenic animals expressing viral proteins, and recombinant cytokines to enhance immune function should prove useful to reducing the incidence and seventy of various tropical diseases. Additionally, there are methods to reduce effects of heat stress on oestrus detection and establishment of pregnancy. These include remote sensing of <b>oestrus,</b> ovulation <b>synchronization</b> systems and embryo transfer.

40|$|The buffalo is an {{important}} livestock resource in several countries of South Asia and the Mediterranean regions. However, reproductive efficiency is compromised due to known problems of biological and management origins, such as lack of animal selection and poor nutrition. Under optimal conditions puberty is attained at 15 to 18 months in river buffalo, 21 to 24 months in swamp buffalo and is influenced by genotype, nutrition, management and climate. However, under field conditions these values deteriorate up to a significant extant. To improve reproductive efficiency, several protocols of <b>oestrus</b> and ovulation <b>synchronization</b> have been adopted from their use in commercial cattle production. These protocols yield encouraging pregnancy rates of (30 % to 50 %), which are comparable to those achieved in buffaloes bred at natural oestrus.

Assisted reproductive technologies have been transferred and adapted to buffalo but the efficiency of these technologies are low. However, these latest technologies offer the opportunity to accelerate the genetic gain in the buffalo industry after improving the technology and reducing its cost.

In Experiment 1, cyclic Black Angus heifers (n = 20) received an Ovsynch protocol and {{were randomly assigned to}} receive (CIDR-Ovsynch) or not (Ovsynch) a progesterone device between Days 0 and 7. Treatment with a controlled internal drug release (CIDR) device significantly increased the size of the dominant follicle prior to ovulation (12. 8 ± 0. 4 CIDR-Ovsynch vs 11. 4 ± 0. 4 Ovsynch) (p < 0. 02). Plasma progesterone concentrations throughout the experiment were affected by the interaction between group and day effects (p < 0. 004). In Experiment 2, cyclic Polled Hereford heifers (n = 382) were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the six treatment groups (3 × 2 factorial design) to receive a CIDR, a used bovine intravaginal device (DIB), or a medroxiprogesterone acetate (MAP) sponge and GnRH analogues (lecirelin or buserelin). All heifers received oestradiol benzoate plus one of the devices on Day 0 and PGF on Day 7 pm (device withdrawal). Heifers were detected in oestrus 36 h after PGF and inseminated 8 – 12 h later, while the remainder received GnRH 48 h after PGF and were inseminated on Day 10 (60 h).

40|$|Twice weekly blood {{progesterone}} {{analysis was}} used to monitor resumption of ovarian cyclicity in 239 postpartum periods of 144 Holstein cows in one herd between D 7 and D 70 postpartum (PP). Calving season, low milk production and low BCS were risk factors for delayed cyclicity (DC: 16. 3 %). Retained placenta and metritis, early ovulation after calving and postpartum negative energy balance were identified as risk factors for prolonged luteal phase (PLP: 18. 4 %). At the same time, in 110 postpartum periods, ovaries were examined twice a week by ultrasonography. In normal cows (N: 56. 5 %), the first large follicle (>= 10 mm) appeared 14. 6 +/- 3. 9 days after calving, ovulation occurred 28. 9 +/- 9. 5 days PP and the maximum diameter of the first corpus luteum (CL) was 24. 9 +/- 4. 9 mm. In DC cows, the interval between calving to the first large follicle tended to be longer than in normal cows (23. 0 +/- 15. 6 d; P= 0. 06). In PLP cows, the first large follicle was delayed (17. 6 +/- 5. 2 d, P< 0. 05), first ovulation occurred earlier (23. 2 +/- 6. 9 d PP, P< 0. 05), the maximum size of the first CL was not different from N cows (26. 2 +/- 6. 2 mm) despite its lifespan (33. 6 +/- 13. 8 days). Before first AI, cows not seen in oestrus or with a diagnosed abnormal progesterone profile were submitted to <b>oestrus</b> induction and <b>synchronization</b> treatment. The proportions of treated cows were 32. 8, 62. 9 and 60. 5 % in the N, DC and PLP groups of cows (significant difference between N and abnormal cows). In N cows, the interval from calving to conception was 117. 3 +/- 60. 6 days. Conception rate at first service (CR) was 31. 3 %, the incidences of early embryonic (EEM) and late embryonic-foetal mortality (LEM) were 47. 9 and 33. 3 %. In DC cows, calving to conception interval was higher (144. 0 +/- 67. 3 d, P< 0. 05) than N cows. CR (28. 6 %) and EEM (60 %) incidence were not different from N cows.

Still in the Farm 1 were compared variables such as CR and number of births, when it was clear demonstrated that CR in pluriparous beef cows with more than four parturitions where quite higher when confronted with cows with 2 - 3 parturitions and primiparous (40. 5 ≥ 4 births, 28. 5 % 2 - 3 births and 0 % for primiparous), (P = 0. 4130); when compared with CR and parturition interval and the use of FTAI protocol “Heat-pregna - E'' the CR is higher in cows between 60 and 200 days postpartum, than cows with the interval of more than 200 days, which showed a very low CR (9. 0 %) (P = 0. 0241); regarding to ECC no significant statistical difference important were observed among females with BSC= 3 submitted to FTAI when confronted to animals with higher BCS showing a very poor (P= 0. 1632). With reference to the degree of difficulty for AI, animals with 0 degree of difficulty for AI, presenting the highest conception rates compared to the animals of 1 degree (44. 4 and 31. 2 %), respectively. The use of the protocol “Pregna Heat - E” for FTAI, can be recommended for both in cattle and buffaloes with satisfactory results, however the CR in the case of crossbred Bos taurus or crossed animals with more blood of this sub-species probably due the fact that are raised in hot and humid regions {{as in the case of}} Farm 1, it has been observed a decrease in CR, which can be attributed to environmental factors interfering negatively on this variable. Likewise it is important to note that female buffaloes must be synchronized at the favorable season, not in outbreeding season, since throughout this time there was a decrease in CR in buffaloes submitted to FTAI, 20. 8 vs 34. 6 % and 42. 8 %, respectively. In the case of the use of synchronization protocols such as “Pregna Heat – E” for FTAI use in buffalo heifers in the present study showed to be inadequate, with zero of CR, probably due anatomical and physiological concerned to the reproductive tract (very small cervix), thus buffalo heifers should not be included in FTAI programs with conventional techniques. The protocol ''Pregna Heat - E” can be used as a viable tool for <b>oestrus</b> cycle <b>synchronization</b> and FTAI in both cattle and buffaloes, and in the present study with the bovine CR being higher than in buffaloes (40. 1 vs 31, 9 %) (Fisher = 0. 9624, P = 0. 0212, P < 0. 05). That being so the use of “Pregna Heat - E” protocol as was used in the present study needs to be further studied in buffalo to obtain higher conception rates. CAPES - Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível SuperiorCNPq - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnológicoA utilização de dispositivos intravaginais com progestágeno como o protocolo de sincronização do ciclo estral para inseminação artificial em tempo fixo (IATF) “Pregna Heat-E,” foi utilizado em 219 fêmeas bovinas e 169 fêmeas bubalinas, pertencentes a 6 fazendas comerciais localizadas nos estados Táchira, Carabobo, e Portuguesa, na República Bolivariana da Venezuela com o objetivo de avaliar a taxa de concepção (TC) em vacas bovinas mestiças leiteiras, de corte e vacas bubalinas mestiças leiteiras, assim como em novilhas bovinas mestiças de leite e corte e novilhas bubalinas mestiças leiteiras, e de analisar algumas variáveis que podem interferir na TC, tais como o escore de condição corporal, (ECC), número de partos, intervalo parto tratamento, grau de dificuldade para a IA na Fazenda 1, e nas outras fazendas(2, 3, 4, 5 e 6), avaliou-se somente a taxa de concepção. O manejo das fazendas era de tipo semi-intensivo, com a alimentação baseada principalmente em espécies forrageiras introduzidas em sistema de piquetes rotacionados a campo e suplementação dependendo das necessidades de cada sistema de produção. Na Fazenda 1, localizada no Sul do Lago de Maracaibo, estado Táchira, foram sincronizadas e submetidas a IATF, 22 novilhas bovinas mestiças leiteiras onde foram obtidas TC de 27, 2 %, igualmente foram submetidas a IATF 20 vacas bovinas mestiças leiteiras no período pós parto (PPP) com uma TC de 30 %, enquanto que da mesma forma, 18 novilhas bubalinas mestiças leiteiras foram inseminadas resultando em nenhuma gestação; em 24 vacas bubalinas no (PPP) sincronizadas na época desfavorável (fevereiro, de 2011), foi obtida uma TC de 20, 8 %. Para na Fazenda 2, localizada na zona Sul do Estado Tachira foi praticada a IATF na época favorável (novembro de 2010) em 78 búfalas mestiças leiterias no PPP obtendo-se uma TC de 34, 6 %. No caso da Fazenda 3, localizada em Urama, no Estado Carabobo, foram submetidas a IATF 49 vacas bubalinas mestiças no PPP, obtendo-se uma TC de 42, 8 %; Na Fazenda 4, localizada em Santa Ana, estado Tachira, foi utilizada a IATF, 85 vacas bovinas mestiças leiteiras obtendo-se uma TC de 40 %; Na Fazenda 5, localizada no Estado Portuguesa, foram submetidas a IATF 23 vacas bovinas mestiças de dupla aptidão no PPP, observando-se 47, 8 % de TC; a Fazenda 6 localizada no estado Portuguesa foram submetidas à IATF 20 novilhas mestiças de corte e 49 vacas bovinas mestiças de corte, resultando em uma TC de 55 e 48, 8 % respectivamente. Ademais na Fazenda 1, foram avaliadas variáveis como TC e número de partos, quando ficou demonstrado melhores TC em vacas bovinas pluriparas quando comparadas com primíparas (40, 5 ≥ 4 partos, 28, 5 % de 2 a 3 partos e 0 % para as primiparas), (P= 0. 4130); com relação a TC e o intervalo parto tratamento pode ser observado que as maiores TC são em vacas entre 60 e 200 dias pós–parto, sendo que vacas com intervalo entre o parto e tratamento superior a 200 dias, a TC foi muito baixa (9, 0 %), (P= 0. 0241); com relação a ECC não houve diferença significativa importante pois todos os animais foram sincronizados com ECC maior ou igual a três e a variação entre os animais foi muito reduzida (P= 0. 1632); no tocante a o grau de dificuldade para IA, animais com 0 grau de dificuldade para a IA, apresentaram os maiores índices de concepção (44, 4 e 31, 2 %), respectivamente. A utilização do protocolo para IATF, como o “Pregna Heat-E”, pode ser recomendado tanto em bovinos como em bubalinos com resultados satisfatórios, sendo que as TC no caso de bovinos mestiços com maior sangue Bos taurus, em regiões úmidas quentes como o caso da Fazenda 1, observou-se uma queda na TC, o que se pode atribuir a fatores do meio ambiente interferindo de forma negativa nas TC. Da mesma maneira, é importante salientar que as fêmeas bubalinas devem de ser sincronizadas na época favorável, posto que na época desfavorável ocorreu uma queda nas TC nas fêmeas sincronizadas neste período, (20, 8 % vs 34, 6 e 42, 8 %) respectivamente. No caso da utilização dos protocolos de sincronização pela IATF em novilhas bubalinas, mostrou-se inadequado, com taxas nulas de concepção, provavelmente, por razões anátomo-fisiológicas neste grupo de animais, neste sentido não devem ser incluídas novilhas bubalinas em programas de IATF, com técnicas convencionais. No tocante para o caso das novilhas bovinas o protocolo “Pregna Heat–E” apresenta se como uma alternativa viável, sendo mais eficientes as taxas de concepção em novilhas mestiças de corte quando comparadas com mestiças leiteiras, por ser mais rústicas e melhor adaptadas as condições tropicais do meio ambiente. Os custos do protocolo “Pregna Heat–E” são relativamente similares com outros protocolos com progestagenos, sendo os resultado aceitáveis, podendo este protocolo ser usado junto com outros protocolos de menor custo. O protocolo “Pregna Heat-E” pode ser usado como uma ferramenta viável na sincronização e IATF tanto em bovinos como em bubalinos, sendo que no caso dos bovinos as TC são maiores do que em bubalinos, (40, 1 vs 31, 9 %), (Fisher = 0, 9624; P= 0, 0212, P< 0, 05). Portanto, a utilização do protocolo “Pregna Heat-E”, necessita ser melhor estudado em bubalinos para a obtenção de maiores taxas de concepção. Sendo a taxa de concepção geral tanto em bovinos como em bubalinos de 36, 5 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronization</b> by {{applying}} progestagen-impregnated intravaginal sponges for either 7 or 12 days to lactating goats during the breeding season and at {{the determination of the}} effects of post-mating GnRH injection on fertility. The study was conducted in 80 hair goats aged between 2 - 5 years. The goats were allocated to two equal groups, one of which was applied short-term intravaginal sponge treatment and the other long-term treatment. The duration of intravaginal sponge treatment was 7 days in the short-term group (ST, n = 40) and 12 days in the long-term group (LT, n = 40). Furthermore, on the day of intravaginal sponge removal, the goats received intramuscular injections of 400 IU of PMSG and 0. 075 mg of cloprostenol. In both groups, 12 h after the removal of the vaginal sponges, 10 fertile bucks were introduced into the flock for oestrus detection twice a day and goats which were determined to be in oestrus were hand-mated to the assigned bucks. Immediately after mating, the goats included in each of the ST and LT groups were randomly assigned to two subgroups, referred to as ST 1 (n = 18), ST 2 (n = 18), LT 1 (n = 18) and LT 2 (n = 18). The subgroups ST 1 and LT 1 were maintained as controls whilst the subgroups ST 2 and LT 2 were administered with 5 mcg of bucerelin acetate immediately after mating. In the present study, the times of oestrus onset and oestrus rates in the ST and LT groups were determined as 33. 3 ± 1. 4 and 35. 0 ± 1. 4 h and 94. 7 and 97. 2 %, respectively. The differences observed between the two groups for the time of oestrus onset and oestrus rate were statistically insignificant (p> 0. 05). In the subgroups ST 1, ST 2, LT 1 and LT 2, pregnancy rates were determined as 55. 5, 50, 50 and 55. 5 %, respectively whilst the parturition rate of all four subgroups was 100 %. Furthermore, litter sizes were detected as 150, 200, 188 and 170 % in the subgroups ST 1, ST 2, LT 1 and LT 2, respectively. The differences observed between the subgroups for pregnancy rate, parturition rate and litter size were statistically insignificant (p> 0. 05). In conclusion, it was demonstrated in the present study that GnRH administrations immediately after mating to lactating goats in which <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronization</b> was performed by means of short and long-term intravaginal sponge treatment during the breeding season did not improve pregnancy rate, parturition rate and litter size...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is to describe the use of artificial insemination (AI) in sheep and discuss the possibilities for AI in Sweden. Male and female fertility, heat detection, semen handling and insemination techniques in sheep are described. Advantages and disadvantages of AI are discussed. In order to achieve genetic progress it is important with well planned and implemented breeding programs. The Swedish Sheep Recording Scheme and computer software from Elitlamm are the basis for sheep breeding in Sweden. Natural mating of ewes are most common {{and the use of}} AI is limited. However, there is an increasing interest for use of AI for importation of genetic material and for storage of semen from endangered breeds. In Norway the use of AI has increased in recent years. Two different methods, cervical and vaginal insemination, are used. When using AI it is advantageous if all ewes in the herd are in heat at the same time. <b>Oestrus</b> <b>synchronization</b> can be implemented by means of synthetic hormones or with use of so-called teaser rams. The technique that works best and is recommended in Norway is vaginal insemination. This technique, together with ram synchronized heat is good practice also in Swedish sheep breeding...|$|E

A total of 1439 Menz and 1347 Horro ewes were single sire mated following <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronization</b> to lamb in the wet and dry season. Three ewe treatment groups were constituted as mated/lactating/undrenched: mated/lactating/drenched; unmated/undrenched for three wet and three dry lambing seasons. All ewes grazed naturally contaminated pasture. Levels of faecal egg output were monitored at mating, 3 months after mating, 2 weeks befor elambing, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-parturition in ewes lambing just {{before the beginning of}} the dry season (October/November). There was no significant increase in FEC when lambing occurred before the onset of the long rainy season (May/June). The PPR in this study was associated with both lactation and seasonal availability of third-stage infective larvae on pasture. There was no consistent breed difference in FEC during the six sampling periods form mating to weaning. Faecal cultures and worm counts from both breeds confirmed the presence of Longistrongylus (Pseudomarshallagia) elongata, Trichostrongylus spp. and Haemonchus contortus.

40|$|Background and Aim: Suboestrus {{constitutes}} the largest factor responsible for poor reproductive efficiency in buffaloes. Therefore, <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronization</b> (OS) and fixed-time artificial insemination (AI) {{is considered an}} alternative approach to enhance reproductive efficiency in buffaloes. Thus, {{the present study was}} carried out to study the efficacy of modified Ovsynch protocol with fixed time insemination in post-partum anoestrus buffaloes. Materials and Methods: Total 50 post-partum anoestrus dairy buffaloes were selected and randomly divided into 5 Groups, each comprising ten animals (n= 10). Animals of Group I received buserelin acetate 10 μg(GnRH) at day 0 and 9, and prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α) at day 7; in Group II similar to Group I except double dose of Gn RH (20 μg) at day 0; in Group III, similar to Group I plus additional administration of insulin on day 0, 1 and 2; in Group IV, similar to Group II plus additional administration of insulin on day 0, 1 and 2; in Group V similar to Group I except replacement of first Gn RH with insulin on day 0, 1 and 2. Animal of all groups were inseminated at fixed time using frozen semen at 60 h and 72 h after PGF 2 α administration and confirmed for pregnancy at day 60 post-insemination.

All the heifers were inseminated 80 h after injection. All 22 heifers in group I were examined rectally 35 days after insemination. Open heifers were given a second PGF 2 alpha injection if a CL was present and inseminated 80 h later. Open heifers without CLs were injected and inseminated 11 days later. This was repeated every 38 - 39 days {{until the end of}} the experiment (July to December). Heifers in group II were observed for signs of oestrus for 15 minutes twice daily (am and pm) and mated 12 h after the first observed signs. There were no significant differences between the groups for mean days from first service to conception (42. 27 and 54. 22), mean services/conception (1. 68 and 2. 22), or pregnancy rate (86. 2 % and 81. 8 %).

40|$|Thirty adult goats were {{classified}} at parturition into two {{body condition score}} (BCS) groups: BCI (n= 16) with a score of 2. 7 and BCII (n= 14) with a score of 2. 0. On the fiftieth day postpartum, oestrus was synchronized by CIDR for 5 days. Upon CIDR removal (Day 0), they received 1 mL of PGF 2 α IM and mated for 72 hours. Kids were kept with does and weaned at 40 days of age. Blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 4, 8 and 21 days after CIDR removal for progesterone assay. The BCI group showed a greater weight loss compared to the BCII group, and BCS before synchronization was 1. 9 ± 0. 08 and 1. 6 ± 0. 07 for the BCI and BCII groups, respectively (P vs 36 %; P vs 1. 25; P vs 0. 25; P< 0. 05). Progesterone concentration was higher in pregnant does in BCI. A positive relationship was found between progesterone level at CIDR removal and BCS at parturition (0. 57; P< 0. 01), also between progesterone level at 21 days after CIDR removal and BCS at parturition (0. 47; P< 0. 05), or BCS before synchronization (0. 51; P< 0. 05).

The animals (n= 93) at 160. 8 ± 114. 3 days of lactation were divided in two homogeneous groups and a progesterone releasing intravaginal device (PRID) was inserted for 10 days in all subjects. Buffaloes in Group A (n= 47) received an i. m. injection of 1000 IU of PMSG and 0. 15 mg of cloprostenol on day 7 (Day 0 = day of PRID insertion), whereas animals in Group B (n= 46) received the same injections of PMSG and PGF on day 10 (day of PRID removal). The AI was carried out at 72 and 96 hours after PRID removal using frozen/thawed semen of progeny test bulls. The pregnancy diagnosis was performed on day 26 after the first AI by an ultrasound sector scanner with a 7. 5 Mhz rectal linear probe and confirmed by a gynaecologic visit on day 45. The data were analysed by chi square test. No significant differences were observed in terms of pregnancy rate on day 26 between the groups (48. 9 % and 32. 6 % respectively in group A and B). On the contrary, a significant (P< 0. 01) difference was recorded on day 45 (44. 7 and 21. 3 respectively in group A and B).

40|$|Synthetic {{progestagens}} like {{melengestrol acetate}} (MGA) {{are widely used}} for <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronization</b> and for growth promotion in cattle production. The metabolic effects exceed its primary potency as a progestagen. It is speculated that MGA stimulates follicle development and thereby endogenous oestrogen production, but inhibits ovulation. To investigate the dose-dependent effects on mRNAexpression levels, six heifers were fed for 8 weeks with different levels of MGA(0. 5, 1. 5, 5 mg) daily and two heifers served as controls. The expression of steroid receptor mRNA[androgen receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR), oestrogen receptor (ER) ERa and ERb], insulinlike growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) and its receptor were quantified in liver, neck (m. splenius) and shoulder muscularity (m. deltoideus). Plasma concentrations of IGF- 1 were quantified by radioimmunoassay. In treated animals the MGAplasma levels were elevated over the complete treatment period, corresponding to the MGAtreatment concentrations. IGF- 1 concentrations of control animals were at constant levels. Plasma levels for oestradiol (E 2) and IGF- 1 were increased in the low MGA treatment group. Overdosed MGAdecreased progesterone (P 4) and E 2 levels. To quantify the IGF- 1 and all receptor mRNA transcripts, sensitive and reliable real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) quantification methods were developed and validated in the LightCycler.

The overall level of oestrus synchrony was low (27 percent), but was higher for animals previously isolated (38 vs. 17 percent). The mean interval from ram introduction to oestrus was 12. 2 (SD= 7. 3) days, but this was significantly shorter for isolated ewes (9. 4 + 1. 2 vs. 14. 8 + 1. 7 days, P 0. 05). Oestrus after ram introduction included two peaks (at 6 and 13 days) which were influenced by the behaviour of previously isolated animals. Conception rates to first and second service of 86 percent and 14 percent, respectively, were confirmed by plasma progesterone determinations. Subsequent lambing rate was only 72 percent, suggesting high prenatal reproductive wastage. Lambing was compacted, except for ewes conceiving at their second oestrus. There was as many twins born to isolated ewes as to exposed ewes but substantially more to ewes that were heavier at mating.

A total of 1840 Menz and Horro ewes were mated to 60 rams of their respective breeds following <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronization</b> to lamb in wet and dry season. A group of 240 ewes was left unmated to serve as controls. Ewes were grazed out on naturally-contaminated pasture. Levels of faecal egg output were monitored at mating, 3 months after mating, 2 weeks before lambing, 2 - 4 weeks after lambing, 8 and 12 weeks post-lambing. Consistently higher egg counts were observed in pregnant/lactating ewes in both Menz and Horro sheep than their unmated counterparts. A significant (P< 0. 05) periparturient rise (PPR) occurred 2 weeks before lambing and peaked 2 - 4 weeks post-parturition for ewes lambing {{at the end of}} the wet season (October/November).

Animals included in the experiment were selected from one farm, comprising a total of 22 Friesian dairy cows. Animals used for the experiment were multiparous, were not observed in heat, had no sign of being cyclic after two ultrasonographic examinations, and had no palpable evidence of uterine or ovarian abnormalities. The cows were randomly allocated to receive a treatment following the GPG + P 4 program or to receive a treatment following the same protocol but than without P 4. Ultrasonography was performed from day 0 to 8 once a day, and twice daily on days 9, 10 and 11, to record the presence and diameter of the dominant follicle (DF), and further follicular dynamics. Blood sampling took place on a daily basis in the coccygeal vein to measure P 4 and E 2 concentrations, and on a hourly basis at day 9 of the program, to follow LH-level dynamics. Fixed time AI was performed on the 10 th day, 16 hours after the second GnRH injection.

40|$|This {{review is}} aimed at {{providing}} information on current status of <b>oestrus</b> <b>synchronization</b> as a management tool in goats in Nigeria. Oestrus synchronisation is a reproductive tool that enables goat farmers breed their animals within a short pre-determined period. The principle of oestrus synchronisation is chiefly {{the control of the}} luteal phase of the oestrous cycle and two basic mechanisms are employed. These include the use of prostaglandins or its analogues to shorten luteal life/induce premature luteolysis or the use of exogenous progesterone to prolong luteal life, thereby simulating the activity of natural progesterone produced by the corpus luteum. The latter is advantageous where the reproductive status of the flock is unknown. However, the former is easy to apply and only effective in cycling animals. Pharmaceutical products that have been employed in ES protocols in Nigeria include Lutalyse®, Estrumate®, EstroPLAN®, Fluorogestone acetate®, Sil-Oestrus®, Medroxyl-progesterone acetate®, Synchromate-B®, PMSG®, and more recently, the Controlled Internal Drug Release® (CIDR) devices. Over the last three decades, many attempts have been made at assessing the response of goats to various oestrus synchronisation agents and protocols in Nigeria. However, the low availability of these pharmaceutical agents and cost preclude the widespread use of oestrus synchronisation technique in goat production. The inclusion of gonadotrophins in oestrus synchronisation protocols have been reported to improve oestrus responses in goats, while season has been reported to influence the efficiency of oestrus synchronisation programmes. Increasing the dose levels of exogenous hormones in oestrus synchronisation protocols has caused variable and sometimes inconsistent effects. The effects of combining the male stimulus with exogenous hormones, seasonal variation, extra-label use of products and short-term nutritional manipulation on oestrus responses in goats require further evaluation. It is concluded adoption of oestrus synchronisation practice portends enhanced goat production in Nigeria...|$|E
