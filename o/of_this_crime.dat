5|$|According to John of Salisbury, {{who first}} {{reported}} {{this story in}} 1172 {{after the death of}} Thomas Becket, as a young clerk Roger was involved in a scandal involving a homosexual relationship with a boy named Walter. After Walter made the relationship public, Roger reacted by embroiling Walter in judicial case that ended with Walter's eyes being gouged out. When Walter then accused Roger <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>crime,</b> Roger persuaded a judge to condemn Walter to death by hanging. Becket supposedly was involved in the cover-up afterwards, by arranging with Hilary of Chichester and John of Coutances for Roger to swear an oath that he was innocent. According to John of Salisbury, Roger then went to Rome in 1152 and was cleared of involvement by Pope Eugene III. John of Salisbury further alleges that it was only after bribery that the pope cleared Roger. Frank Barlow, a medieval historian and Becket's biographer, points out in his biography of Becket that while Roger was accused of these crimes, and may even have been guilty of some sort of criminal homosexuality, John of Salisbury's motives for bringing up this story in 1172 were almost certainly to defame Roger. Such a story would naturally have put Roger in the worst possible light.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Caliph {{was brought}} to Raqqa for greater safety, while Husayn ibn Sa'id tried to secure control over {{northern}} Syria and pre-empt Egypt's ruler Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid {{taking control of the}} region. The attempt failed, as al-Ikhshid himself advanced into Syria, took Aleppo and marched to Raqqa, where he met the Caliph. Al-Ikhshid tried to persuade al-Muttaqi to come to Egypt under his protection, but the Caliph refused, and al-Ikhsid returned to Egypt. Instead, al-Muttaqi, persuaded by Tuzun's assurances of loyalty and safety, returned to Baghdad, where Tuzun deposed and blinded him, replacing him with al-Mustakfi (r. 944–946). At the news <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>crime,</b> Nasir al-Dawla again refused payment of tribute, but Tuzun marched against him and forced his compliance. Henceforth, Nasir al-Dawla would be tributary to Baghdad, but he would find it difficult to resign himself to his loss of power over the city he once ruled, and the subsequent years would feature several attempts to regain it.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, George P. Lee, a Navajo {{member of}} the First Quorum of the Seventy {{who had participated in}} the Indian Placement Program in his youth, was excommunicated.

In October 1994, Lee confessed to, and was convicted of, sexually molesting a 13-year-old girl in 1989.

25|$|Teti, Son of Minhotep, was an Egyptian {{official}} in Coptos {{during the reign}} of the Seventeenth Dynasty Pharaoh, Nubkheperre Intef. His only clear attestation is in the Coptos Decree, which deprives him of his office and its stipend for some act of sacrilege. The exact nature <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>crime</b> is debated, largely due to the idiomatic or euphemistic language used in the text. Some have identified him as the same Teti who opposed Kamose several kings later, which would indicate the kings between Nubkheperre Intef and Kamose had very short reigns, but this identification remains problematic.|$|E

His assassination, in circumstances which remain unclear, provoked violent riots in Kabylie. Berber Algerians still accuse the Algerian government of killing Matoub Lounès, but some of the Algerian government's figures accused the Islamist terrorists <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Japanese raiding force {{encountered}} only {{a single}} Allied ship during its operation. On the morning of 9 March Tone shelled and sank the British steamer Behar in the central Indian Ocean. This ship was bound from Fremantle to Colombo, {{as part of a}} voyage to the United Kingdom. Behars crew broadcast a distress signal after being attacked to warn other Allied ships, causing the commander of the raiding force to abandon the operation. The heavy cruisers were escorted through the Sunda Strait by Kinu, Ōi and five destroyers, and arrived back at the Netherlands East Indies on 16 March. Shortly afterwards, 89 of the 104 Behar survivors who had been rescued by Tones crew were murdered on board the cruiser. The commanders of the raiding force and Tone were convicted <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>crime</b> after the war and imprisoned. The Allies were unaware of the attack on Behar until a ship which had picked up the steamer's distress signal arrived in Fremantle on 17 March. The orders diverting Allied shipping from the central Indian Ocean were cancelled on 18 March.|$|E

500|$|But, Bollman {{held that}} venue for the Neutrality Act charges was {{improper}} in the District of Columbia.

[...] "hat no part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>crime</b> was committed in the district of Columbia is apparent. It is therefore the unanimous opinion of the court that they cannot be tried in this district." [...] Second, the Court rejected statutory venue under section 8 the Crimes Act of 1790 (as permitted by Article Three for crimes not committed within a state). The Court held that the Territory of Orleans was not a place that triggered the alternative venue provisions of the Crimes Act. The Court held that the statutory term [...] "any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular state" [...] applied only to [...] "any river, haven, bason or bay, not within the jurisdiction of any particular state," [...] and only in [...] "those cases there is no court which has particular cognizance of the crime." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the most}} egregious offence an {{individual}} could commit, viewed as seriously as though the accused had personally attacked the monarch, high treason demanded the ultimate punishment. [...] But whereas men guilty <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>crime</b> were hanged, drawn and quartered, women were drawn and burned. [...] In his Commentaries on the Laws of England the 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone noted that the sentence, [...] "to be drawn to the gallows, and there to be burned alive", was [...] "full as terrible to the sensation as the other". [...] Blackstone wrote that women were burned rather than quartered as [...] "the decency due to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies". [...] However, an observation by historian Jules Michelet, that [...] "the first flame to rise consumed the clothes, revealing poor trembling nakedness", may, {{in the opinion of}} historian Vic Gatrell, suggest that this solution is [...] "misconceived". [...] In The Hanging Tree, Gatrell concludes that the occasional live burial of women in Europe gave tacit acknowledgement to the possibility that a struggling, kicking female hanging from a noose could [...] "elicit obscene fantasies" [...] from watching males.|$|E

500|$|The motives {{behind the}} murder case are officially unknown but Mexican {{authorities}} believe {{that given the}} circumstances and the players involved, the suspected source of fire was organized crime and that the motives possibly stemmed from [...] "unpaid old debts, and old retributions". The authorities are working with two separate lines of investigation: (1) the first line alleges that Francisco Rafael was killed {{by members of the}} Beltrán Leyva Cartel, a drug trafficking organization that fights for the control of the smuggling routes in the Baja California peninsula against the Sinaloa Cartel; (2) the second line alleges that Francisco Rafael was killed by members of the Sinaloa Cartel, specifically on orders of [...] "El Chapo" [...] Guzmán, the cartel's leader. [...] "El Chapo" [...] was nearly captured by the Mexican federal police in Los Cabos in March 2012, after an anonymous call informed the DEA that the drug lord was possibility hiding in three properties. Investigators allege that Francisco Rafael, although he was no longer involved in organized crime, might have tipped the authorities to his whereabouts and incurred [...] "El Chapo's" [...] wrath. They also believe that the attack might have been carried out by a local drug-dealing group in Los Cabos; the main suspect of this allegation is a man named Javier López Rivera or Javier Acosta López (alias [...] "El Javier" [...] and/or [...] "El Javi"), the supposed leader <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>crime</b> cell. In this line of investigation, the authorities believe that the drug dealer sent two of his men to pick up the assassin who had arrived from Sinaloa at the Los Cabos International Airport. Two of the three men involved in the murder case, they allege, go by the aliases [...] "Caín" [...] and [...] "El Chapito".|$|E
