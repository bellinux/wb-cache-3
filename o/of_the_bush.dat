Renold invented the bush roller chain shortly after and began producing it. It {{is the type of}} chain most commonly used for transmission of mechanical power on bicycles, motorbikes, to industrial and agricultural machinery to uses as varied as rollercoasters and escalators.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} <b>the</b> {{analysis}} <b>of</b> hydraulically balanced external gear pumps, in particular on the lubricating gap between <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> and <b>the</b> gears. This topic is of key importance for <b>the</b> optimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine efficiency because it both influences the mechanical-viscous friction and the volumetric losses. In this paper {{the intent is}} to investigate <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> surfaces, to compare the analysis done with rigid and elastic surfaces and finally to correlate the results with <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> balancing surfaces. A numerical procedure for <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pressure distribution inside the gap bounded by gears sides and <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> internal surfaces is presented and applied. With respect to past works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authors, the procedure has been integrated taking into account <b>the</b> elastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> and <b>the</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynamic viscosity <b>of</b> fluid, two well recognized phenomena that can {{play a key role}} on <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> behaviour and lubricating gap pressure distribution. It is shown that, when <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> rear surfaces determines a strong balancing thrust, <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> themselves need to tilt strongly with respect to the gears to generate an opportune widening thrust to avoiding contact with the gears. Useful suggestions for <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> balancing surface design may be drawn from <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> balancing maps reported in the paper, which illustrate the widening thrust magnitude and position in both the pure hydrodynamic and elasto-hydrodynamic cases, for different tilted positions and operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Power {{transformer}} {{is the key}} {{equipment in}} power system. In view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current <b>bushing</b> monitoring method, a new detection method of bushing insulation defects is proposed in this paper. According to <b>the</b> internal structure <b>of</b> <b>bushing,</b> <b>the</b> internal insulation defects are divided into three categories, including partial moisture, pollution, local insulation defects, <b>the</b> outer insulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> is equivalent to a resistance chain model. <b>The</b> entire <b>bushing</b> insulation is considered as a parallel between inner insulation and external insulation (inner Insulation is the main). This detection makes uses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transient voltage measured from transformer <b>bushing</b> and <b>the</b> transient current measured from the end shield down-lead as the signal source. The reference data dynamically generated is used to diagnosis and distinguish Insulation defects of Transformer <b>bushing,</b> according to <b>the</b> monitoring data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> and <b>the</b> maximum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference data, <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> insulation defect and the severity can be sentenced. A large number of simulation results initially confirmed the effectiveness and feasibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} testing of new components for medium-voltage metalclad switchgears filled with SF 6 gas. <b>The</b> <b>bushing</b> is <b>the</b> mein part <b>of</b> these components and {{is used as a}} connection between two switchgear compartments, to control the electric potential distribution and as a voltage detector. It has been designed by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> a two- and three-dimensional electrostatic model based on <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> finite elements. This analysis is helpful in defining <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing,</b> <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conductive parts that are connected to <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> and <b>the</b> distances between the conductive and grounded parts. <b>The</b> numerical calculations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electric field were confirmed by practical tests on a prototype <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>bushing...</b>|$|R

Ringo Brown decides to help Donna make friends. Donna helps to clear an area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> and when a fire breaks out, she is suspected of starting it because of her strange behaviour. Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), a school counsellor, talks with Donna, who then decides to transfer to Erinsborough High. There she eventually becomes friends with Rachel and Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon), and starts dating Ringo. Donna's father, Matt, bans her from seeing Ringo and she steals his car. Donna accidentally hits Nicola West (Imogen Bailey) and her dog, Bronte. However, Donna is initially unaware that she hit Nicola and she and Ringo ask Lucas Fitzgerald to fix the car. When she realises that she also hit Nicola, Donna tells Matt what happened. He tries to frame Lucas to save her, but he is caught and then goes on the run. Elle Robinson takes Donna in and becomes her legal guardian.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, the NRA {{captured}} Kampala with a {{force of}} 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government. After Museveni was inaugurated as president, he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army. The experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, {{with the goal of}} allowing the refugees to return home. In addition to fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack. With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala. At its 1987 convention, it renamed itself to the Rwandan Patriotic Front, and it too committed to returning the refugees to Rwanda by any means possible. In 1988, a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing Peter Bayingana as RPF president. Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, with Kagame assuming the vice-presidency. Bayingana remained as the other vice-president, but resented the loss of the leadership.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|The 1981 Entumbane uprising, {{also known}} as the Battle of Bulawayo or Entumbane II, {{occurred}} between 8 and 12 February 1981 in and around Bulawayo, Zimbabwe amid political tensions in the newly independent state. Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) guerrillas, mainly in the city's western suburb of Entumbane, rebelled, creating a situation that threatened to develop into a fresh civil war, barely a year after the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> War. The Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR) and other white-commanded elements of the former Rhodesian Security Forces, fighting for the Zimbabwean government as part of the new Zimbabwe National Army, put down the uprising. Groups of Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) fighters attacked both ZIPRA and the government forces during the revolt, which followed a smaller outbreak of fighting between guerrillas in November 1980.|$|E

50|$|Bushings {{are perhaps}} the easiest things to change on a truck in order to change <b>the</b> feel <b>of</b> how it turns. Bushings are usually made of a {{polyurethane}} material, and come in varying shapes and durometers (hardness). Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most standard <b>bushing</b> shapes include barrels and cones. Barrels, having a larger shape, are often thought to have more stability and rebound whereas cones, having a more narrow shape, allow for more turn and less rebound. <b>The</b> durometer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> also greatly influences its characteristics. a harder bushing (such as a bushing with a rating around 97A) will be much harder to turn on than a softer bushing (something around 78A). <b>The</b> type <b>of</b> washers used with <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> can also greatly affect the bushing's characteristics. While it depends on <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> washer, generally a cupped washer {{will be the most}} restrictive on a bushing, a flat washer will be neutral, and a flipped cup washer will be the least restrictive.Another aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longboard that has an influence on <b>bushing</b> performance is <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> seat on <b>the</b> truck. <b>The</b> <b>bushing</b> seat is <b>the</b> area on the hangar where <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> makes contact. This area often has a rim to cup <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing,</b> adding a small amount <b>of</b> restriction as <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> deforms through a turn. Some trucks have very loose or even non-existent bushing seats, whereas others have very restrictive bushing seats, greatly reducing bushing deformation. More restrictive bushing seats generally found on trucks designed with faster riding in mind as they offer more stability and lean.|$|R

The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries together because they all were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the Scud missile. In the pre-9/11 days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> presidency, the administration had focused heavily on developing a national missile defense system to counter such threats.
