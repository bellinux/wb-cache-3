50|$|Maine's first {{psychiatric}} hospital was the Maine Insane Hospital, established in Augusta in 1835. That facility was repeatedly enlarged, until 1889, {{when it was}} determined to no longer be feasible to expand it further. The state appointed a committee to identify a location for a second facility, resulting {{in the selection of}} this location. The centerpiece of the campus is a sprawling, connected multi-building complex, at whose center is the hospital's first building, designed by the noted Portland architect John Calvin Stevens and completed in 1897. The wings, which were designed by Bangor architect George Coombs, were added in 1899-1901, when the facility formally <b>opened</b> its <b>doors.</b> The <b>hospital</b> continued to grow {{over the course of the}} 20th century, generally according to the principles of the Kirkbride Plan for the design and organization of mental hospitals. The main building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987; it is one of the state's largest public buildings.|$|R
40|$|In hospitals, domain {{specific}} {{challenges for}} HCI research emerge: {{the hospital is}} a closed environment, physicians have little time, and the research is considered too abstract from the physician’s perspective, as they are unfamiliar with our methods. Also, physicians often have plenty of experience with failed IT projects within the hospital, so our research easily becomes yet another set of empty promises. We argue that tangibles for caregivers might break down barriers and <b>open</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>doors,</b> as these artifacts {{have the ability to}} materialize and embody our research questions. We present the Speaker’s Staff, a work-in- progress where we use tangibles for physicians in a research-through-design approach, to explore opportunities for technology to support peripheral interaction during multidisciplinary team meetings. While this approach seems to be promising, we do question whether the fun of creating tangible interfaces is worth the effort. Maybe, imaginary tangibles can save efforts?status: publishe...|$|R
