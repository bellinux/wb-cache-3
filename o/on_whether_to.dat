5|$|Temperance {{became a}} part of the evangelical Protestant {{initiative}} during Indiana's pioneer era and early statehood. Many Hoosiers freely indulged in drinking locally distilled whiskey on a daily basis, with binges on election days and holidays, and during community celebrations Reformers announced that the devil was at work and must be repudiated. A state temperance society formed in 1829 and local temperance societies soon organized in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and Logansport. By the 1830s pietistic (evangelical) Protestants and community leaders had joined forces to curb consumption of alcohol. In 1847 the Indiana General Assembly passed a local option bill that allowed a vote <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> prohibit alcohol sales in a township.|$|E

A park and ride lot in Northgate was secured in August 1969, settling the demands of the federal government.
