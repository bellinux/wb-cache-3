5|$|After the rosters were announced, {{a second}} round of fan voting, the Monster All-Star Final Vote, was {{commenced}} to determine the <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> the final roster spot for each team. This round lasted until July 5. Chris Young and Hideki Okajima were elected to represent the National League and American League, respectively, in the All-Star Game as first time All-Stars.

5|$|In Arizona v.

5|$|The {{authority}} of the Byzantine emperor as the legitimate Roman emperor was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Imperator Augustus by Pope Leo III in the year 800. Needing Charlemagne's support in his struggle against his enemies in Rome, Leo used {{the lack of a}} male <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> the throne of the Roman Empire at the time to claim that it was vacant and that he could therefore crown a new Emperor himself.|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the fatality risk for <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> rear passenger seats in extended cab and crew cab pickup trucks to the fatality risk for front seat <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> the same vehicles using the (US) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) for 1982 – 1997. A 10 -digit truncated {{vehicle identification number}} was used to classify the pickup trucks. The data were analyzed with an estimating equation for data having few observations per stratum. We identified 549 extended cab pickup trucks {{with one or more}} <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> rear passenger seats and one or more <b>occupant</b> deaths. <b>Occupants</b> <b>of</b> rear passenger seats had a fatality risk 43 % lower than front seat occupants (95 % confidence interval 32 % to 52 %), controlling for age, sex, and restraint use. <b>Occupants</b> <b>of</b> rear seats of extended cabs in compact pickup trucks did not experience any higher fatality risk (relative to front-seat <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> the same vehicles) than rear seat <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> extended cabs in full-size pickup trucks and large 4 -door crew cabs...|$|R

5|$|The {{disaster}} {{caused the}} deaths of 33 people: 32 tourists (17 of them were Swedes) and the <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> the apartment above the book store. Eighteen charred bodies were recovered from the debris. Thirteen people, who had jumped from windows, either died or were severely injured. Among the dead was the celebrated German concert musician and composer Walter Kraft, longtime organist of St. Mary's Church, Lübeck. Of the 57 people who were injured, 21 had severe injuries. Two guests from the United States escaped without injury.|$|E
5|$|After {{consulting}} with Deep Throat, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) travels to Townsend and takes {{photos of the}} crash site, only to be captured. After being interrogated by Henderson, Mulder is detained alongside an eccentric NICAP member named Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), who was also captured in the woods. The next morning, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives to retrieve Mulder, telling him that FBI Section Chief Joseph McGrath is threatening {{to shut down the}} X-Files because of his behavior. She also claims that the wreckage has been identified as a downed Libyan fighter jet; Mulder dismisses this explanation. Meanwhile, the invisible <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> the UFO passes through an electronic fence set up around the crash site, escaping into the outside world.|$|E
5|$|At Sutton Hoo (near Woodbridge, in Suffolk) is {{the site}} of two 6th-7th century Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, where it is {{believed}} that members of the Eorpwald's dynasty were entombed under large earth mounds. Several East Anglian kings, including Eorpwald, have been suggested as possible candidates for the <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> the burial site under Mound 1, discovered in 1939. Martin Carver has speculated that historians could use regal lists and other sources of information to identify the occupants, whilst acknowledging that no material evidence exists to support the theory that Eorpwald or other members of his family are buried there. He has used Eorpwald's relationship as the son of Rædwald to place him in either Mound 1 or 2.|$|E

5|$|Each {{tomb of the}} Fitomiandalana {{contained}} the bodies of early Kings of Imerina and their relatives, and was assigned a name after the principal <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> the underlying grave. These were, in order: Andrianavalonibemihisatra (son of Andriamasinavalona and King of Antananarivo, five bodies), Andriamponimerina (son of Andriamasinavalona and King of Antananarivo {{at the time of}} future king Andrianampoinimerina's birth, three bodies), Andrianjakanavalomandimby (oldest son of Andriamasinavalona and King of Antananarivo, two bodies), Andriamasinavalona (great-grandson of Andrianjaka and King of Imerina, three bodies), Andriantsimitoviaminandriandehibe (grandson of Andrianjaka and King of Imerina, two bodies), Andrianjaka (founder of Antananarivo and King of Imerina, 12 bodies) and Andriantsitakatrandriana (son of Andrianjaka and King of Imerina, two bodies). The final tomb without a tomb house was for Andriantomponimerina (son of Andriamasinavalona and King of Antananarivo) and housed eight bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} {{allegation}} against Pleydell in the Star Chamber concerned the forced expulsion of an <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> the manor house at East Grafton, Somerset in late 1553. He {{was accused of}} assisting John Berwick in the original infringement and composing an amenable jury in Marlborough to avoid conviction. Both were found innocent of breaching the peace and claimed to have acted at the reasonable request of their employer, Anne Seymour; undue interference with judicial proceedings was ruled out. Around the same time, Pleydell was sued for forcible entry and illegal seizure of property at Little Bedwyn (with similar offences at Collingbourne Ducis) but claimed to be acting on {{the failure of the}} plaintiff to punctually pay rent.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige {{had been}} a royal clerk prior to his {{appointment}} to York in 1051, although the monks of Peterborough Abbey maintained that he {{had been a}} monk in their house. It is possible he was both a monk and a royal clerk. He delayed his visit to Rome to receive his pallium until 1055, when he was given it by Pope Victor II. During his time as archbishop he was claimed to have consecrated both John and Magsuen as Bishops of Glasgow, although the two bishops probably never lived in their diocese. John may have ended up as the Bishop of Mecklenburg in Germany. Cynesige dedicated the church of the Abbey of Waltham Holy Cross in the presence of King Edward the Confessor around 3 May 1060. This was at the invitation of Earl Harold Godwinson of Wessex. The chronicle of Waltham Abbey states that Cynesige did the consecration because the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant. However, there was an <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> Canterbury, Stigand, but his election to Canterbury was not considered canonical by the papacy, and Harold may have excluded him because of concerns about Stigand's canonical status.|$|E

5|$|From around 616, Rædwald was {{the most}} {{powerful}} of the English kings south of the River Humber. According to Bede he was the fourth ruler to hold imperium over other southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: he was referred to in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, written centuries after his death, as a bretwalda (an Old English term meaning 'Britain-ruler' or 'wide-ruler'). He was the first king of the East Angles to become a Christian, converting at Æthelberht's court some time before 605, whilst at the same time maintaining a pagan temple. In receiving the faith he helped to ensure the survival of Christianity in East Anglia during the apostasy of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Essex and Kent. He is generally considered by historians to be the most favoured candidate for the <b>occupant</b> <b>of</b> the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, although other theories have been advanced.|$|E
