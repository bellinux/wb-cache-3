We find that the model has perturbatively stable and unstable solutions, with both types of solutions occupying significant regions of the parameter space. All solutions are unstable with respect to collapse by quantum tunneling to zero size. We discuss the possibility that the state resulting from the collapse is non-singular, so it may tunnel back to the oscillating regime.

The aim of this study was to assess the work-related population attributable fraction (PAF) of lumbar disc surgery (LDS) for disc-related sciatica in occupational categories at high risk in the general population. Methods: Patients living in a French region in 2003 and discharged from a large University Hospital following LDS were compared with demographic and socioeconomic data from the population census. Medical and occupational histories from 75 women and 71 men were gathered using a mailed questionnaire. The ageadjusted relative risks and PAF of CTS were calculated according to occupational categories. Results: The PAFs of lumbar disc surgery was 37 % [19 - 54] for the male blue-collar workers suggesting that about 37 % of the cases occurring in this category of workers could be avoided if the excess risk of LDS could be eliminated. The PAF value for male and female lower-grade white collar workers and female intermediate <b>occupations</b> were <b>18</b> %, 33 % and 13 %, respectively. Conclusion: The study suggested that 13 – 37 % of LDS for disc-related sciatica might be avoided in the whole population if totally effective intervention programs were implemented in specific occupational categories or industries.

40|$|Kuumbi Cave {{is one of}} a {{group of}} caves that {{underlie}} a flight of marine terraces in Pleistocene limestone in eastern Zanzibar (Indian Ocean). Drawing on the findings of geoarchaeological field survey and archaeological excavation, we discuss the formation and evolution of Kuumbi Cave and its wider littoral landscape. In the later part of the Quaternary (last ca. 250, 000 years?), speleogenesis and terrace formation were driven by the interplay between glacioeustatic sea level change and crustal uplift at rates of ca. 0. 10 - 0. 20 mm/yr. Two units of backreef/reef limestone were deposited during ‘optimal’ (highest) highstands, tentatively correlated with MIS 7 and 5; (mainly) erosive marine terraces formed in these limestones in ‘suboptimal’ highstands. Kuumbi and other sub-terrace caves developed as flank margin caves, in the seaward portion of freshwater lenses during such ‘suboptimal’ highstands. Glacioeustacy-induced fluctuations of the groundwater table may have resulted in shifts from vadose (with deposition of well-developed speleothems) to phreatic/epiphreatic conditions in these caves. At Kuumbi, Late Pleistocene (pre- 20, 000 cal. BP) ceiling collapse initiated colluvial deposition near-entrance and opened the cave to large plants and animals, including humans. A phase of terminal Pleistocene human <b>occupation</b> ca. <b>18,</b> 500 - 17, 000 cal.

40|$|The major {{immediate}} early enhancer of {{the human}} cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is composed of unique and repeated sequence motifs, which interact with different nuclear proteins, thus forming a large nucleoprotein complex. Using DNAase I protection analysis, we determined at the nucleotide level the interactions of B cell and HeLa cell nuclear proteins with transcription factor binding sites in the enhancer/promoter. In agreement with in vivo activity, protein binding to the 18 bp repeats (kappa B element) was found predominantly with B cell extract. Competition for proteins with individual transcription factor binding sites allowed us to define boundaries of closely spaced and overlapping binding sites, and to group binding proteins into several classes. Using gel mobility shift assays, we could show that proteins, which bind to the 17 bp repeat, also bind to a classical NF 1 site. In addition, several novel binding sites were identified. The presence of overlapping binding sites, together with differences in the <b>occupation</b> of the <b>18</b> bp repeats in the two cell types, suggest that the HCMV major IE enhancer has several possibilities of forming nucleoprotein complexes...|$|R

More than 80 % of South American mammals weighing  44 kg succumbed. Analysis of the megafaunal extinction chronology in relation to human arrival and major climate changes have revealed slightly different extinction patterns in different eco-regions of the continent, highlighting the importance of detailed regional analysis {{in order to understand}} how the possible drivers of extinction operated. Here we present an analysis of the megafaunal extinction in the Última Esperanza (UE) area of southwestern Patagonia, Chile. We have compiled a comprehensive chronology of megafaunal extinctions and earliest human <b>occupation</b> between <b>18</b> – 7 cal ka BP, based on radiocarbon dates from published literature. We calculated confidence intervals using the GRIWM method to estimate the times of human arrival and megafaunal local extinctions, and then compared these events to the timing of major climate and vegetation changes, fire frequency increase, and the Reclús volcanic eruption. Our results suggest that a combination of human impacts and climate–vegetation change drove megafaunal extinctions in the UE area, with the balance of factors being taxon specific; the volcanic eruption {{does not seem to have}} exacerbated extinctions. Competition between humans and mega-carnivores seems to be the most plausible cause for the extinction of the mega-carnivores. Coexistence of humans with extinct horses, extinct camels, and mylodonts for several thousand years rules out a scenario of blitzkrieg overkill of megafauna by humans. The transition of vegetation from cold grasslands to Nothofagus forests corresponds with the disappearance of Hippidion saldiasi and Lama cf. owenii. The later full establishment of Nothofagus forests and an increasing fire frequency coincided with the disappearance of mylodonts.

Design: Cross-sectional study {{based on data from}} five years (2008 - 2012) of the nationally representative Health Survey for England. Setting: England. Participants: 20, 103 adults aged 17 - 65 indicating they were economically active at the time of survey classified into four occupational groups: nurses (n= 422), other healthcare professionals (n= 412), unregistered care workers (n= 736) and individuals employed in non-health related <b>occupations</b> (n= <b>18,</b> 533). Outcome measure: Prevalence of obesity defined as Body Mass Index  30. 0 with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) and weighted to reflect the population. Results: Obesity prevalence was high across all occupational groups including: among nurses (25. 1 % 95 % CI 20. 9, 29. 4); other healthcare professionals (14. 4 % CI 11. 0, 17. 8); non-health related occupations (23. 5 % CI 22. 9, 24. 1); and unregistered care workers, who had the highest prevalence of obesity (31. 9 %, CI 28. 4, 35. 3). A logistic regression model adjusted for socio-demographic composition and survey year indicated that, compared to nurses, the odds of being obese were significantly lower for other health care professionals (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 0. 52, CI 0. 37, 0. 75) and higher for unregistered care workers (aOR 1. 46 CI 1. 11, 1. 93).
