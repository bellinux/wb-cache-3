40|$|Pacific oysters were {{introduced}} into the Eastern Scheldt in 1964 for breeding purposes. The first spatfall of wild Pacific oysters was recorded in 1976, and a second larval outburst in 1982 definitely settled wild Pacific oysters in the Eastern Scheldt waters. <b>Oyster</b> <b>beds</b> on intertidal and subtidal areas have been growing since. The objective {{of this study is}} to research the potential of aerial photography for estimating surface areas of intertidal Pacific <b>oyster</b> <b>beds.</b> Black & white and false-color aerial photographs were used to locate Pacific <b>oyster</b> <b>beds.</b> For verification purposes, <b>oyster</b> <b>bed</b> contours were measured in the field. The accuracy of the method used was comparable with accuracies found in other studies, with a chance of underestimating the surface areas in the field. With aerial photographs of 1980 and 1990 the surface areas of Pacific oysters in both years were reconstructed, showing an increase in surface area of Pacific <b>oyster</b> <b>beds.</b> The study shows aerial photography has the potential to be an aid in surveying intertidal Pacific <b>oyster</b> <b>bed...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is {{a marine}} exotic species that has {{successfully}} been {{introduced into the}} Oosterschelde estuary in the Netherlands in the 1960 's. It is still spreading, and can now be considered {{a part of the}} local ecosystem. Along with C. gigas other exotic species have been introduced. C. gigas influences its environment through the formation of <b>oyster</b> <b>beds.</b> An <b>oyster</b> <b>bed</b> alters the local environment by influencing current flow, filtering food particles from the water column, by providing structural complexity and by locally enriching the sediment through faeces and pseudofaeces deposition. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how the presence of a Pacific <b>oyster</b> <b>bed</b> affects local macrofaunal diversity. Along a transect from the center of the <b>oyster</b> <b>bed</b> to the adjacent mudflat, sediment and oysters were sampled to determine the occurrence of species and their abundances. Two <b>oyster</b> <b>beds</b> were sampled. In total, 38 species were found. Polychaeta dominated, and together with Bivalvia and Malacostraca comprised 76 % of all specimens identified to species level. Considerably higher biodiversity and abundances per unit area were found on the <b>oyster</b> <b>beds</b> than on the mudflats. This may be due to the structural complexity of the <b>oyster</b> <b>beds,</b> providing many microhabitats, and by organic enrichment of the sediment. The total number of specimens found increased from the center of the <b>oyster</b> <b>bed</b> to the transition zone, where the <b>oyster</b> <b>bed</b> and mudflat overlap. Both depositlsuspension feeders and carnivore/omnivores showed this pattern. This may be explained by the heterogeinity in habitat types of the transition zone. The transition zone may provide an optimal compromise between nutrient availability, shelter and living space for deposit/suspension feeders. Carnivore/omnivores may feed on these, and thus show a similar pattern. Total diversity also increased from the center to the transition zone on one <b>oyster</b> <b>bed,</b> but this was not shown conclusively for the other <b>oyster</b> <b>bed.</b> The implications of the spreading of the Pacific oyster in Dutch waters may be profound. Locally the spreading of Pacific oyster considerably increased biodiversity and abundances. However, the extent of the implications of this to the ecosystem as a whole remain to be investigated. ...|$|R
40|$|Inner part of Isahaya Bay {{was closed}} for the {{reclamation}} on April 14, 1997,and the water level in the regulating pond was kept at - 1 m of sea level standardized at Tokyo Bay. Therefore, a broad salty mud flat dried up and a wide area of an <b>oyster</b> <b>bed</b> emerged at the area beyond Oe.
