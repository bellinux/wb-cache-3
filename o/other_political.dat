5|$|The Electronic Frontier Foundation {{acknowledged}} that the companies were within their legal rights to terminate their contracts with The Daily Stormer, but that the move set a dangerous precedent in which <b>other</b> <b>political</b> views including left-wing ones could be denied legal protection.

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of the Vietnamese support the CPP, and those who carry Cambodian citizenship would vote for the party. Vietnamese support for the CPP has mostly driven by strong anti-Vietnamese sentiments from <b>other</b> <b>political</b> parties. Although many members within the rank and file of the CPP share anti-Vietnamese sentiments with <b>other</b> <b>political</b> parties, the CPP maintained an openly neutral stance towards the Vietnamese community. According to Ehrentraut, the CPP's neutral stance was a balance between not providing open support for the Vietnamese community, which would have the potential effect of losing electoral votes to <b>other</b> <b>political</b> parties, {{while at the same time}} maintaining close ties with the Vietnamese government which the CPP had historical ties dating back to 1979. Vietnamese who hold Cambodian citizenship have also expressed fear over physical insecurity during election periods, which is most apparent during the 1993 and 2013 elections when Vietnamese civilians faced physical intimidation from the Khmer Rouge and CNRP supporters respectively and have abstained from participating in elections.|$|E

50|$|According to neo{{functional}}ists, {{there are}} two kinds of spillover: functional and political. Functional spillover is the interconnection of various economic sectors or issue-areas, and the integration in one policy-area spilling over into <b>others.</b> <b>Political</b> spillover is the creation of supranational governance models, as far-reaching as the European Union, or as voluntary as the United Nations.|$|R
5|$|Improving {{opportunities}} for growing families of same-sex couples has shaped {{the political landscape}} within the past ten years. A push for same-sex marriage or civil unions in western countries has replaced <b>other</b> <b>political</b> objectives. , ten countries and six U.S. states offer same-sex marriage; civil unions are offered as an option in some European countries, U.S. states and individual municipalities. The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as a foster parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians, as is improving access to artificial insemination.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Evans {{acknowledged}} that membership levels had declined but predicted a dramatic turnaround would soon occur. His prediction was inaccurate.

McVeigh argues that the Klan's inability to form alliances with <b>other</b> <b>political</b> groups led to the sharp loss of political power and solidarity within the group.|$|E

On September 23, 1980, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana convicted Dozier of extortion and racketeering when he pushed companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf.
