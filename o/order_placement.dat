5000|$|Strategic {{plans are}} drawn up with {{suppliers}} {{to support the}} manufacturing flow management process {{and the development of}} new products. In firms whose operations extend globally, sourcing may be managed on a global basis. The desired outcome is a relationship where both parties benefit and a reduction in the time required for the product's design and development. The purchasing function may also develop rapid communication systems, such as electronic data interchange (EDI) and Internet linkage, to convey possible requirements more rapidly. Activities related to obtaining products and materials from outside suppliers involve resource planning, supply sourcing, negotiation, <b>order</b> <b>placement,</b> inbound transportation, storage, handling, and quality assurance, many of which include the responsibility to coordinate with suppliers on matters of scheduling, supply continuity (inventory), hedging, and research into new sources or programs. Procurement has recently been recognized as a core source of value, driven largely by the increasing trends to outsource products and services, and the changes in the global ecosystem requiring stronger relationships between buyers and sellers.|$|E
50|$|September 18, 2013 CFTC Orders FXDirectDealer, LLC to Pay $2.74 Million for Supervision Failures Relating to Trading Platform.According to the CFTC Order, FXDD used {{asymmetrical}} slippage parameters on {{its principal}} trading platform, {{meaning that the}} system favored FXDD over its customers in slippage situations. Based on these parameters, FXDD rejected a customer’s order when the price slipped more than 2 pips in the customer’s favor (and instead re-quoted the customer the new, less favorable price), but filled a customer’s order at the original price if the price slipped in FXDD’s favor by more than 2 pips. As a result, FXDD benefited from slippage of more than 2 pips in its favor between <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> and order execution, but did not allow its customers to benefit from similar price changes in their favor. The CFTC Order further finds that had FXDD employed an adequate supervisory system and diligently supervised its personnel, FXDD would have discovered these problems with the integrity of trades on the platform and {{would have had the}} opportunity to correct them before more than 24,900 customer accounts were deprived of $1,828,261.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} increasing pre-trade transparency on the intraday <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> strategies of individual and institutional investors. The effect of pre-trade transparency on market performance is also studied. We find that transparency affects <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> strategies. First, greater pre-trade transparency intensifies com-petition and thus aggressiveness in <b>order</b> <b>placement,</b> especially for institutional investors. Transparency also reduces and reduces extreme <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> by individual investors as they are better informed about how to place orders. Second, increasing transparency also changes trader order sizes. Institutional investors make smaller orders with increas-ing transparency, while individual investors make larger orders. Generally, greater transparency increases volatility, but not liquidity and efficiency. Finally, this study shows {{that the impact of}} transparency on market performance and the changes in <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> strategies are simultaneously determined. The analytical results are robust to different trading periods...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{documented}} that limit order revision and cancellation activities {{play an important}} role in creating dynamic <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> strategies. By utilising a new approach, this thesis provides further evidence on <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> strategies, their determinants and their effects on the stock market quality. Firstly, this thesis constructs the full life for each limit order as a series of successive order events. Survival analyses with both single-spell and multiple-spell duration models are employed to examine the determinants of dynamic limit <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> strategies in the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). This thesis is, perhaps, the first study which employs such a new approach in this area of research. Limit <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> strategies are found to be determined by limit order characteristics, by conditions of the stock market where the limit order is placed, as well as by the previous duration of the limit order. Secondly, this thesis creates a measure for dynamic limit <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> activities and examines how these activities affect the stock market quality. Using a system of simultaneous equations, the thesis finds that <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> activities are increased in response to market turbulence such as heightened volatility and reduced liquidity. The results suggest that the stock market quality is significantly improved as traders intensify their activities, including revising or cancelling their limit orders. However, this positive effect is only found in the early period before the structural changes of the ASX. Following ASX’s migrations to lower-latency exchanges, the intensity of <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> activities tends to reduce the stock market quality. Thirdly, this thesis investigates dynamic limit <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> strategies and their aggressiveness in a low-latency market environment. The study employs a new approach with a multiple-spell duration model to examine the factors that contribute to the decision of traders to cancel or revise limit orders, as well as the decision to opt for an aggressive or a defensive strategy. The results provide evidence in support for both the ‘chasing hypothesis’ and the ‘cost of immediacy hypothesis’ of limit orders. The findings of this thesis are significant for researchers, market regulators as well as other stock market participants...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increase}} in personal wealth and organization sizes, {{there is also an}} increase in their assets. So, there is a great demand of professionals to manage these assets and coordinate investment activities {{in order to maintain the}} growth. Wealth Management Services are now widely offered by banks, trusts companies, and brokerages. As the financial market becomes well-developed worldwide, the variety of financial products also increases: equities, mutual funds, bonds, securities, foreign currencies, and derivatives (like options, futures, forwards, and swaps). As a Wealth Management System (WMS) plays the role of an <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> hub, it becomes more and more complicated during each enhancement to support <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> of additional kinds of financial products. This is because a WMS requires different channels to communicate with different Instrument Markets. For an international investment company, the problem comes more complicated because the <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> processes are heterogeneous in different countries and locations. In fact, trading systems for different instrument markets of different countries and even different cities are different. Workflows are also hard to coincide with different sites. Therefore, we propose the use of Web services to implement the workflow of <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> process. © 2006 IEEE...|$|E

This includes limit orders being placed outside of the spread, inside the spread and (effective) market orders.

While for some stocks <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> on or next to the quotes is dominating, deeper price levels are more important for other stocks.

40|$|Document de travail, Universitat Pompeu Fabra et CEPR Discussion Papers n° 1817 This paper {{provides}} a game theoretic model of price formation and <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> decisions in a dynamic limit order market. Investors {{can choose to}} post limit orders or to submit market orders. Limit orders result in better execution prices but face a risk of non-execution and a winner's curse problem. The execution probability of a limit order trader is endogenous and depends on the <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> decisions of the other traders. Solving for the equilibrium of this dynamic game, closed form solutions for the <b>order</b> <b>placement</b> strategies are obtained. Thus, testable implications for the cross-sectional behaviour of the mix between market and limit orders and trading costs in limit order markets are derived. It is also shown that the winner's curse problem has {{a negative impact on}} the allocative efficiency of these markets...|$|E
