40|$|The Thurne {{catchment}} in north-east Norfolk, UK, is {{an extremely}} {{important part of the}} Broads National Park, an internationally important wetland environment. Extensive engineered land drainage of the marshes of this low-lying coastal catchment over the past two centuries has led to land subsidence and the need for drainage pumps to control water levels sufficiently below sea-level to maintain agricultural productivity. Consequently, seawater from the North Sea has intruded into the underlying Pleistocene Crag (sand) aquifer and brackish groundwater enters into land drainage channels, thereby raising their salinity. Powerful pumps discharge these brackish drainage waters into a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and RAMSAR site, leading to adverse ecological impacts on salt-sensitive species. Chloride concentrations within drainage channels throughout the network have been found to significantly vary, with several influential factors affecting channel salinity such as proximity to the sea and connectivity to the underlying aquifer. A thorough understanding of the surface-water/groundwater system and a subsequent quantification of the various processes has been necessary for the development for the drain/aquifer interactions and a numerical groundwater model. These models are used to estimate the long-term distribution of the salinity within the drainage system under current conditions. The model credibility is justified by comparable aquifer-drain water balance, a comparable coast water inflow/ total groundwater ratio and the particle tracking from the coastal reaches trace to previously-measured saline-vulnerable locations. The numerical groundwater model has demonstrated that the average daily inflow of saline groundwater into the Crag aquifer of the Thurne catchment is 3, 081 m 3 /day, of which the HempsteadMarshes main drain {{is one of the main}} conduits for saline inflow into the Brograve system, which discharges directly into the SAC. Various changes to the engineering design or operation of the drainage system have been proposed to minimise the saline inflow to the SAC, but the implementation of any proposals must be considered in conjunction with the current dynamics of the system. Three separate management or engineering remedial measures have been modelled: (i) raising the water levels in the drains of the Hempstead Marshes in the north east of the catchment (ii) lining the main drain of the HempsteadMarshes with low permeability material, and (iii) The construction of a new coastal <b>open</b> <b>ditch</b> <b>drain</b> which is intended to ‘intercept’ the saline intrusion and prevent ingress into inland drains of the Brograve system. The results suggest that raising the water levels in the Hempstead Marshes will reduce the saline inflow into the Brograve sub-catchment substantially, and decrease the overall saline inflow into the Thurne catchment from 3081 m 3 /day to 2822 m 3 /day). The lining of the main drain in Hempstead produces a less than 10 % decrease in saline inflow into the catchment from 3, 081 m 3 /day to 2, 958 m 3 /day. The simulated coastal interceptor drain could in theory through maintaining a low groundwater head near the coast, prevent the inflow of saline groundwater into the Brograve system. However, such a drain would increase the saline inflow across the coastal boundary by around six times (from 3, 081 m 3 /day to 19, 750 m 3 /day), remove large quantities of fresh groundwater from the Pleistocene Crag aquifer and lead to high energy and pumping costs. The research has shown that there are partial solutions to reducing the saline inflow into the drainage systems in this lowland coastal catchment. However, any intended alterations must first consider other potential impacts, such as changes to flood risk, land management restrictions or hydrodynamic effects on the receiving watercourse through changed discharge volumes.

40|$|The Environmental Ministry of Schleswig-Holstein has {{implemented}} a novel peatland management strategy {{in order to}} utilize the high nutrient retention potential of degenerated peatlands, and to improve the habitat at the same time. The effect of raised water levels and passive land use management on hydraulic properties of heavily vegetated and groundwater-fed <b>open</b> <b>ditches</b> was investigated at the ‘Eider River Valley’. The flow properties of selected representative <b>open</b> <b>ditches</b> were regularly assessed at different discharge levels during different vegetation cover periods. The hydraulic residence time is predominantly {{a function of the}} <b>open</b> <b>ditch</b> geometry and the overall obstruction cover including the presence of macrophytes. Typical mean discharges measured ranged between 0. 2 and 2. 5 l/s. Within-ditch vegetation and other hydraulic obstructions, like accumulated silt and organic debris, slow down the hydraulic residence time. The experimental results were evaluated to acquire more realistic values for total bed-roughness under different hydraulic flow regimes. Further findings show that the lower parts of the <b>open</b> <b>ditches</b> were flooded by the Eider River due to the absence of a mowing scheme. Typical water level increases were 0. 5 m. This led to a reduction of the velocity and an increase of the dispersion within the ditch...|$|R

40|$|An {{infrastructure}} crisis {{exists in}} America with a prevalence of systems in disrepair. While this {{problem has been}} documented, limited research has asked whether the infrastructure crisis overburdens certain population groups. Through {{a series of three}} conceptually linked papers, this dissertation investigates the inventory, condition, and distribution of stormwater and roadway infrastructure systems using the frameworks of equity, environmental justice, and social vulnerability to assess racial and economic disparities in infrastructure provision across neighborhoods. This dissertation includes a literature review and two empirical papers to link these bodies of research?equity, environmental justice, and social vulnerability to disaster?to planning inequalities in infrastructure management. These papers make some of the first empirical assessments of infrastructure disparities based on race, ethnicity, and class. In ?Unequal Protection Revisited,? I develop the theoretical framework to integrate environmental justice and social vulnerability to disaster theory within a critical examination of infrastructure. In paper two, ?Waterproof,? I use <b>open</b> <b>ditch</b> stormwater systems data from Houston, Texas consisting of an inventory of 2, 400 miles of roadside <b>open</b> <b>ditches</b> to understand variation in location and amount of <b>open</b> <b>ditches</b> across Census block groups. <b>Open</b> <b>ditches</b> are particularly limited in discharging stormwater to protect people and mitigate the inundation of property, especially in urbanized areas. Findings indicate that communities of color {{are more likely to have}} <b>open</b> <b>ditches</b> and have a greater proportion of their roadsides equipped with <b>open</b> <b>ditch</b> systems. Race was the strongest predictor of the proportion of roadside <b>open</b> <b>ditches</b> controlling for median household income, population density, neighborhood age, housing improvement values, and vacant homes. Lastly, in paper three, ?Pavement and Prosperity, I use roadway condition data from the City of Houston to compare conditions across Census block groups. The findings are contrary to transportation equity and environmental justice theory such that communities of color were found to have marginally better road condition ratings relative to the other neighborhoods, nevertheless most neighborhoods had low ratings in terms of acceptable pavement condition. These findings reveal opportunities for the rehabilitation of transportation systems and the retrofitting and replacement of stormwater infrastructure systems to green infrastructure or low-impact development standards as a method to increase environmental justice and reduce inequities in infrastructure provision and resulting environmental impacts. This research indicates that outdated, insufficient, and declining infrastructure systems might be more prevalent for minority communities across the U. S. Collectively, this research shows the need for a continued environmental justice research agenda that addresses the planning, management, provision and distribution of infrastructure systems to improve neighborhood wellbeing and urban utility for communities across the country, especially communities of color...|$|R
