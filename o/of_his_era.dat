5|$|Ford had 20 career fumble {{recoveries}} at {{the time}} of his retirement. Ford was successful in part because of his combination of quickness and size.

5|$|Although Du Bois {{attended}} a New England Congregational {{church as a}} child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois described himself as agnostic or a freethinker, {{but at least one}} biographer concluded that Du Bois was virtually an atheist.Lewis, p. 550 (agnostic, atheist).Johnson, passim (agnostic). However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded that he had a religious voice, albeit radically different from other African-American religious voices <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era,</b> and inaugurated a 20th-century spirituality to which Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and James Baldwin also belong.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the gekiken kogyo performances, in his later years Sakakibara regretted their development. In his view, the rules and strictures of gekiken were perverting kenjutsu into new forms that were no longer {{relevant}} to battlefield combat. He disdained the point-scoring swordsmanship of other kendoka <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era,</b> ignoring light touches by his opponents in order to deliver his own powerful strikes. Nonetheless, the gekiken kogyo practices which he began created an interest in fencing which led ultimately to the development of modern kendo.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the best}} {{defensive}} forwards <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era,</b> Phillips was also known for his all-around skill, particularly his strong shot and endurance, and was considered, alongside Frank McGee, {{one of the two}} best players in all of hockey. His younger brother, Russell, also played for the Thistles and {{was a member of the}} team when they won the Stanley Cup. When the Hockey Hall of Fame was founded in 1945, Phillips was one of the original nine inductees.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{of hockey}} Stuart {{worked as a}} bricklayer, and later in his life he also worked with his father in construction. He {{was said to have}} been a quiet person, and unlike other athletes <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era</b> was not one to talk about his exploits, except with close friends. Loughlin, his wife, came from Quebec; around 1903 they were married and had two {{children}} together.|$|E

5|$|Riley's chief legacy was his {{influence}} in fostering {{the creation of}} a midwestern cultural identity and his contributions to the Golden Age of Indiana Literature. Along with other writers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era,</b> he helped create a caricature of midwesterners and formed a literary community that produced works rivaling the established eastern literati. There are many memorials dedicated to Riley, including the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children.|$|E
5|$|Robert Neil Harvey MBE (born 8 October 1928) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who {{represented}} the Australian cricket team between 1948 and 1963, playing in 79 Test matches. He was the vice-captain of the team from 1957 until his retirement. An attacking left-handed batsman, sharp fielder and occasional off-spin bowler, Harvey was the senior batsman in the Australian team {{for much of the}} 1950s and was regarded by Wisden as the finest fielder <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era.</b> Upon his retirement, Harvey was the second-most prolific Test run-scorer and century-maker for Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{war years}} divided Macartney's career in two. Prior to the war, he was {{primarily}} {{known as a}} bowling all-rounder. In 21 Tests, he had taken 34 wickets at 26 and scored 879 runs at 27, with one century. After the war, Macartney transformed himself {{into one of the}} greatest batsmen <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era.</b> In his 14 post-war Tests, he scored 1,252 runs at nearly 70, with six centuries. His bowling became more sporadic, taking just 11 more wickets, averaging 32.|$|E

50|$|Isidore was {{the first}} Christian writer to try to compile a summa of {{universal}} knowledge, in his most important work, the Etymologiae (taking its title from the method he uncritically used in the transcription <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era's</b> knowledge). It is also known by classicists as the Origines (the standard abbreviation being Orig). This encyclopedia — the first such Christian epitome—formed a huge compilation of 448 chapters in 20 volumes.|$|R
5|$|After {{returning}} from World War II, Hassett operated a sports store in Melbourne; {{one of his}} staff members was Victorian Test teammate Neil Harvey. After retiring from cricket, Hassett joined the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a radio commentator in 1956, remaining in that position until 1981. During {{his time in the}} commentary booth, he was known for his self-deprecating humour and frequently made fun of his conservative approach to batting during the latter half of his career. Hassett was known for his disapproval of some of the aspects of the modern evolution of cricket, particularly the more aggressive player conduct that contrasted with the more sedate and gentlemanly style <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his career, Speedie was one of {{the most}} {{prolific}} receivers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era.</b> He averaged more than 800 receiving yards a season during his seven years in the AAFC and NFL, a mark that was not surpassed for 20 years after he left the game. His career receiving yards average of 49.9 per game stood for 25 years. He was named to the National Football League 1940s All-Decade Team and was selected by news outlets as a first-team All-Pro six times. The authors of the official NFL encyclopedia named him one of the league's 300 greatest-ever players.|$|E
5|$|Baker is {{considered}} one of the greatest ice hockey players <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era,</b> and the first great American hockey player. He was one of the first nine players inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame upon its founding in 1945, the first American so honored, and was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame as one of its charter members in 1973. Baker was posthumously awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy by the National Hockey League and USA Hockey in 1987 for his contributions to hockey in the United States. In 1975, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and is the only person in both the College Football and Hockey Halls of Fame. Baker was also inducted into the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940– December 4, 1993) was an American musician, composer, {{activist and}} filmmaker. His work was {{characterized}} by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrète works, and produced {{almost all of the}} 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He {{is considered one of the}} most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Browns' biggest {{trade of}} the offseason, Brown sent end John Harrington to the Chicago Rockets for Bill Boedeker, a halfback. Perhaps the most {{significant}} signing, however, was punter Horace Gillom, who had played for Brown at Massillon Washington High School and who Brown had recruited to Ohio State before World War II. Gillom could kick the ball further than most punters <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era.</b> He changed the way teams approached punting by lining up 15 yards behind the center instead of the customary 10 yards to give himself more space and time to make his kicks. Gillom was also the third black player to sign with the Browns {{at a time when}} many teams did not employ African-Americans. Cleveland chose fullback Dick Hoerner in the AAFC draft, but he signed instead with the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League.|$|E
5|$|In the marginalia that El Greco {{inscribed in}} his copy of Daniele Barbaro's {{translation}} of Vitruvius' , he refuted Vitruvius' attachment to archaeological remains, canonical proportions, perspective and mathematics. He also saw Vitruvius' manner of distorting proportions {{in order to}} compensate for distance from the eye as responsible for creating monstrous forms. El Greco was averse to {{the very idea of}} rules in architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty, variety, and complexity. These ideas were, however, far too extreme for the architectural circles <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era</b> and had no immediate resonance.|$|E

5|$|On December 11, 1905, {{before the}} start of the 1905–06 season, Stuart was {{suspended}} from the league after the western teams complained that he had won too many championships and was too rough for the league. He was reinstated by the league on December 30, and joined the Pittsburgh Professionals. After Pittsburgh finished their season, Stuart joined Calumet for one game so they could try to win the league championship, which they lost to the Portage Lakes Hockey Club. Once again he was named best cover-point in the IPHL as he scored eleven goals. A big man with a fluid skating stride, he was considered the finest defenceman <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era</b> for his outstanding play on both offence and defence.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian also {{recognized}} talent in quarterback John Huarte {{and wide receiver}} Jack Snow, who had been used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. Snow was large for a receiver <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era,</b> but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6–4 record if they were lucky. Sports Illustrated predicted a 5–5 record at best, and the team did not rank among the top 20 programs {{in the country in}} the pre-season AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|Though {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the leading}} goalkeepers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era,</b> he never played for his native country. Trautmann met with the German national coach, Sepp Herberger, in 1953, who explained that travel and political implications prevented him from selecting a player who was not readily available, and that he could only consider including Trautmann if he were playing in a German league. Consequently, Trautmann's international isolation prevented him from playing in the 1954 World Cup, in which his countrymen were victorious. Trautmann's only experience of international football came in 1960, when the Football League decided to include non-English players in the Football League representative team for the first time. Trautmann captained the League against the Irish League, and also played against the Italian League.|$|E

50|$|In 1976 Rubin {{published}} A Season on the Earth: Selected Poems of Nirala. While initially {{considered one}} of the original Chhayavad poets, a romantic era in Indian poetry lasting from 1922 to 1938, Nirala’s penchant for social reform along with a late-blooming love of mystical symbols made him one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>era’s</b> most original bards: the name Nirala means “strange one.” As much as possible, Rubin’s translations held true to the wordplays found in the original. In 1980, Rubin published a collection by the Nepali poet Laxmi Prasad Devkota, Nepali Visions, Nepali Dreams.|$|R
50|$|The National Steeplechase Association has maintained, since 1956, a list {{of annual}} leading jockeys by races won. Aitcheson has won more titles than any other jockey, 7.
