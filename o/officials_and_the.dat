5|$|Carney's {{appointment}} to diplomatic postings {{in countries that}} had often difficult relations with the United States earned him both praise and criticism from observers for his hands-on diplomatic style. His strong views on Iraq's reconstruction efforts after the war in 2003 were in part responsible for a wholesale change in the Bush administration's strategy to stabilize the war-torn nation. He also advocated engagement with Sudan {{at a time when}} White House <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> C.I.A. wanted the U.S. Embassy closed in Khartoum.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, a {{jury found}} for Heffernan and awarded him damages {{from the police}} <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city. Despite the verdict, Heffernan sought a retrial because Judge Peter G. Sheridan had not allowed him to pursue {{the freedom of speech}} claim; the defense did so as well because Judge Sheridan had allowed the freedom of {{association}} claim. While considering these motions, Judge Sheridan became aware of a conflict of interest through a former law firm and set aside the verdict, setting a new date for trial before Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh.|$|E
5|$|In the Eastern empire, {{laws and}} {{official}} documents were regularly translated into Greek from Latin. Both languages were in active use by government <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Church during the 5th century. From the 6th century, Greek culture was {{studied in the}} West almost exclusively through Latin translation. Latin loanwords appear liberally in Greek texts on technical topics from late antiquity and the Byzantine period.|$|E
5|$|Residential school {{deaths were}} common {{and have been}} linked to the {{persistence}} of poorly constructed and maintained facilities. The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting by school <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> destruction of medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies for government records. Research by the TRC revealed that at least 6,000 students had died, mostly from disease.|$|E

5|$|After Johnson's {{death in}} 1774, Brant and her {{children}} left Johnson Hall in Johnstown, New York {{and returned to her}} native village of Canajoharie, further west on the Mohawk River. A Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War, she migrated to British Canada, where she served as an intermediary between British <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Iroquois. After the war, she settled in what is now Kingston, Ontario. In recognition of her service to the Crown, the British government gave Brant a pension and compensated her for her wartime losses, including a grant of land. When the British ceded their former colonial territory to the United States, most of the Iroquois nations were forced out of New York. A Six Nations Reserve was established in what is now Ontario.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Hurricane Katrina and the {{subsequent}} 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and Beth Israel garnered national attention after {{attempts were made to}} save its Torah scrolls. Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within a mile of Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls. The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments.|$|E
5|$|As the Great War progressed, war {{exhaustion}} in Germany grew. The first {{strikes in}} the country {{since the start of}} the war broke out in 1915, steadily increasing in frequency and magnitude. The unions' role as troubleshooter between the employers and the workers soon led to conflict between the membership and union <b>officials,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Free Trade Unions steadily lost members. Correspondingly, the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable to comment on the October Revolution as the Rundschreiben had been banned by the time it broke out.|$|E
5|$|Between 1880 and 1895 {{the city}} {{experienced}} a huge rise in corruption, as crime bosses, such as Soapy Smith, worked {{side by side}} with elected <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> police to control elections, gambling, and bunco gangs. The city also experienced a depression in 1893 after the crash of silver prices. In 1887, the precursor to the international charity United Way was formed in Denver by local religious leaders who raised funds and coordinated various charities to help Denver's poor. By 1890, Denver had grown to be the second-largest city west of Omaha, Nebraska. In 1900, whites represented 96.8% of Denver's population.|$|E

Although some ground was lost to the Yugoslavs, especially around the town of Drniš, northeast of Šibenik, the ZNG captured several JNA and Yugoslav Navy facilities in the city, including dozens of navy vessels and several coastal artillery batteries. The captured batteries were used to support defence of the city. The JNA Šibenik garrison was evacuated {{following a}}n agreement between the Croatian <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> JNA, except for several comparably small JNA posts in the city which were captured by the ZNG.|$|E
5|$|Governor Harrison had wide-ranging {{powers in}} the new territory, {{including}} authority to appoint territorial <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> legislature, as well as authority to divide the territory into smaller political districts and counties. One of his primary responsibilities was to obtain title to Indian lands that would allow future settlement and increase the territory's population, a requirement for statehood. Harrison was eager to expand the territory for personal reasons as well; his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's eventual statehood. On February 8, 1803, when President Jefferson reappointed Harrison as the Indiana territorial governor, he also granted Harrison the authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians.|$|E
5|$|Henry quickly took {{revenge on}} his enemies after the Battle of Evesham. He {{immediately}} ordered the sequestration {{of all the}} rebel lands, triggering a wave of chaotic looting across the country. Henry initially rejected any calls for moderation, but in October 1266 he was persuaded by the Papal Legate, Ottobuono de' Fieschi, to issue a less draconian policy, called the Dictum of Kenilworth, which allowed {{for the return of}} the rebels' lands, in exchange for the payment of harsh fines. The Statute of Marlborough followed in November 1267, which effectively reissued much of the Provisions of Westminster, placing limitations on the powers of local royal <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> major barons, but without restricting central royal authority. Most of the exiled Poitevins began to return to England after the war. In September 1267 Henry made the Treaty of Montgomery with Llywelyn, recognising him as the Prince of Wales and giving substantial land concessions.|$|E

5|$|In 2005 the Defense Department {{announced}} that it would be shifting 18,000 jobs to Fort Belvoir in Virginia and at least 5,000 jobs to Fort Meade in Maryland by 2012, as part of that year's Base Realignment and Closure plan. In anticipation of such a move, local <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> military proposed extending the Blue and Green Lines to service each base. The proposed extension of the Green Line could cost $100 million per mile ($60 million per kilometer), and a light rail extension to Fort Belvoir was estimated to cost up to $800 million. Neither proposal has established timelines for planning or construction.|$|E
5|$|The Bribery Act 2010 (c.23) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} the {{criminal}} law relating to bribery. Introduced to Parliament in the Queen's Speech in 2009 after several decades of reports and draft bills, the Act received the Royal Assent on 8 April 2010 following cross-party support. Initially scheduled to enter into force in April 2010, this was changed to 1 July 2011. The Act repeals all previous statutory and common law provisions in relation to bribery, instead replacing them with the crimes of bribery, being bribed, the bribery of foreign public <b>officials,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> failure of a commercial organisation to prevent bribery on its behalf.|$|E
5|$|The {{homecoming}} celebration {{went on for}} days. <b>Officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{general population}} of the island crowded the shoreline to cheer their returning monarch.

Along his route to Iolani Palace, the procession passed beneath numerous festooned arches erected for his homecoming. A daytime parade was held in his honor. The palace was opened {{for the public to}} personally greet the King. The Honolulu Fire Department and the Poola Association began an evening torchlight parade at a bell tower brightly lit with Chinese lanterns, and proceeded through the streets of downtown Honolulu to the palace.|$|E
