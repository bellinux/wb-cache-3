5|$|Screensavers were {{designed}} {{to ensure that there}} would be no phosphor burn-in <b>of</b> <b>images</b> left on a CRT-based screen. Delrina added sound and basic interactivity with its series of screensaver products, arguably qualifying it as an early form of multimedia.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking the}} Family Portrait series <b>of</b> <b>images,</b> which {{included}} Pale Blue Dot, NASA mission managers commanded Voyager 1 to power its cameras down, as the spacecraft {{was not going}} to fly near anything else of significance for the rest of its mission, while other instruments that were still collecting data needed power for the long journey to interstellar space.|$|E
40|$|Term {{segmentation}} {{is about}} splitting the whole image into segments. In case <b>of</b> <b>image</b> analysis, <b>image</b> processing one <b>of</b> the crucial steps is segmentation <b>of</b> <b>image.</b> Segmentation <b>of</b> <b>image</b> concern about dividing entire image in sub parts {{that may be}} similar or dissimilar with respect to features. Output <b>of</b> <b>image</b> segmentation has consequence on analysis <b>of</b> <b>image,</b> further processing <b>of</b> <b>image.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> <b>image</b> comprises depiction <b>of</b> object and object representation, measurement of feature. Therefore characterization, area of interest’s visualization in the image, description have crucial job in segmentation <b>of</b> <b>image.</b> This survey explains some methods <b>of</b> <b>image</b> segmentation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:Ensemble of {{classifier}} {{provides a}} great versatility of classifier for pattern recognition and classification. The pattern recognition and classification {{is a new}} age direction for content based image retrieval. The content based image retrieval depends on lower content feature <b>of</b> <b>image.</b> The lower content of feature extraction <b>of</b> <b>image</b> is colour texture and geometrical dimension <b>of</b> <b>image.</b> The geometrical dimension <b>of</b> <b>image</b> gives the shape structure <b>of</b> <b>image.</b> The partial feature ensemble is process of merging a classifier value according to matched feature <b>of</b> query <b>image</b> and stored image in database. The �ensembling feature� of classifier depends on extraction process <b>of</b> feature <b>of</b> <b>image.</b> The partial feature extraction is basically based on outside boundary value <b>of</b> <b>image.</b> The movement <b>of</b> <b>image</b> varies according to its rotation or length and breadth. The value <b>of</b> rotation <b>of</b> <b>image</b> feature extraction plays a role of ensemble point <b>of</b> classifier for <b>image</b> retrieval. For the classification of feature support vector machine classifier has been used...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} noise <b>of</b> <b>image,</b> {{in this paper}} median filter is used. Also to eliminate small and fake points <b>of</b> <b>image</b> and filling holes and empty region <b>of</b> <b>image,</b> series <b>of</b> morphological operations is applied on the <b>image.</b> For elimination <b>of</b> fake points <b>of</b> <b>image,</b> morphological opening filter is used and for filling holes, morphological closing filter is applied on the image. Then, for unification of separate points <b>of</b> <b>image,</b> connected component analysis is used [47].|$|R
5|$|Algorithmic {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>images</b> of artworks, {{for example}} using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help {{to tell a}} copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.|$|E
5|$|All {{images from}} Hubble are {{monochromatic}} grayscale, in which its cameras incorporate {{a variety of}} filters each passing specific wavelengths of light. Color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters. This process can also create false-color versions <b>of</b> <b>images</b> including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal <b>of</b> <b>images</b> was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E

5|$|As {{bishop of}} Turin, Claudius {{found that men}} were often {{directed}} to go on pilgrimage to Rome for penance and that worshippers were accustomed to venerate Christ and the saints by bowing before images and relics. Claudius, coming from an educated background, was not greatly exposed to such provincial modes of worship. He made attacks on the use <b>of</b> <b>images,</b> relics, and crosses, he opposed pilgrimages to obtain absolution, and he had little regard for {{the authority of the}} pope due to his belief that all bishops were equal.|$|E

30|$|It is {{precisely}} because of the importance <b>of</b> <b>image</b> processing technology that many researchers have begun research on image processing technology and achieved fruitful results. However, with the deepening <b>of</b> <b>image</b> processing technology research, today’s research has a tendency to develop in depth, and this depth is an in-depth aspect <b>of</b> <b>image</b> processing technology. However, the application <b>of</b> <b>image</b> processing technology is a system engineering. In addition to the deep requirements, there are also systematic requirements. Therefore, if the unified model research on multiple aspects <b>of</b> <b>image</b> application will undoubtedly promote the application <b>of</b> <b>image</b> processing technology. Wavelet transform has been successfully applied in many fields <b>of</b> <b>image</b> processing technology. Therefore, this paper uses wavelet transform as a method to establish a unified model based on wavelet transform. Simulation research is carried out by filtering, watermark hiding, encryption and decryption, and <b>image</b> compression <b>of</b> <b>image</b> processing technology. The results show that the model has achieved good results.|$|R
5|$|In 1980, the Solar Maximum Mission was {{launched}} by NASA. This spacecraft {{was designed to}} observe gamma rays, X-rays and UV radiation from solar flares {{during a time of}} high solar activity and solar luminosity. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984 Space Shuttle Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands <b>of</b> <b>images</b> of the solar corona before re-entering Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.|$|E

The council decided on the orderly removal <b>of</b> <b>images</b> within Zurich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote.

5|$|Other black {{newspapers}} {{also carried}} significant {{coverage of the}} lynching, as did liberal papers such as The New Republic and The Nation.

Although there were other lynchings as brutal as Washington's, the availability <b>of</b> <b>images</b> and the setting of his death made it a cause célèbre.
