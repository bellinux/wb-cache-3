The aim of this publication is to report the safety of pneumococcal and <b>other</b> <b>vaccinations</b> in CAPS patients. All CAPS patients followed in the β-CONFIDENT (Clinical Outcomes and Safety Registry study of Ilaris patients) registry were analysed if they had received a vaccination. The β-CONFIDENT registry is a global, long-term, prospective, observational registry, capturing and monitoring patients treated with canakinumab. Sixty-eight CAPS patients had received a total of 159 vaccine injections, 107 injections against influenza, 19 pneumococcal vaccinations, 12 against tetanus/diphtheria antigens and 21 <b>other</b> <b>vaccinations.</b> Fourteen per cent of injections had elicited at least one vaccine reaction. All five vaccine-related serious adverse events were associated with pneumococcal vaccination. Vaccine reactions were observed in 70 % of pneumococcal vaccinations, compared with 7 % in influenza and 17 % in tetanus/diphtheria vaccinations. The odds ratios {{to react to the}} pneumococcal vaccines compared with influenza and tetanus/diphtheria vaccines were 31. 0 (95 % CI: 8, 119) and 10. 8 (95 % CI: 2, 74).

40|$|To {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness {{of a potential}} Helicobacter pylori (HP) vaccine for the Dutch situation, we developed a Markov model. Several HP prevalence scenarios were assessed. Additionally, we assessed {{the impact of the}} discount rate for health on the outcomes, as this influence can be profound for vaccines. When applying the current discount rate of 1. 5 % for health, the expected cost-effectiveness of HP vaccination is estimated below the informal Dutch threshold of (sic) 20, 000 /LYG when the HP prevalence is assumed >= 20 % in the Dutch population. In conclusion, we showed that HP vaccination could possibly be a cost-effective intervention. However, this depends to a large extend on the prevalence of HP in the population. Furthermore, we showed the large impact of the discount rate for health on the cost-effectiveness of a HP vaccination program, illustrative for <b>other</b> <b>vaccination</b> programs.

RESULTS: Overall, BCG vaccination did not affect stunting in SSA children (OR 1. 00 [0. 98 - 1. 03]). Timing of BCG vaccination was of importance (betatime= 0. 067 [0. 061 - 0. 073]) : compared to unvaccinated children, BCG was associated with lower odds on stunting for children vaccinated early in life (OR 0. 92 [0. 89 - 0. 94]) and higher odds for children vaccinated later in infancy (OR 1. 64 [1. 53 - 1. 76]).

40|$|Innnunization is an {{important}} weapon in the med-ical arsenal against infectious disease, yet interest in immunization is predominately limited to protecting children. Despite its potential benefits, adult inmiu-nization in the US has not been given the attention it deserves, and adult immunization programs remain few and far between. As a result, immunization of adults falls well below target levels, whereas US vaccine coverage estimates for children approach or exceed national goals. ’-’ The consequences are simple: inadequate vaccina-tion results in deaths and serious illness from preventable diseases. Each year in the US alone, between 50, 000 and 70, 000 adults die of diseases that can be prevented by vaccination, predominately pneumococcal infection (which causes meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia), influenza, and hepatitis B. 44 The total cost of treating adults for these three diseases alone exceeds $ 1 0 billion annually, excluding the value of lost lives. ’ The poteii-tial for improvement is vast. Some vaccinations are particularly appropriate to cer-tain high-risk populations that comprise a relatively small proportion of the population. In these groups, the risk of disease is associated with factors such as occupa-tion, lifestyle, living conditions, and overall health and well-being 8 Thus, prisoners, healthcare workers, and people with multiple sexual partners are at greatly increased risk of hepatitis B infection, whereas alcoholics, organ trans-plant patients, and residents of nursing homes {{are at greater risk}} of influenza and pneumococcal infection. <b>Other</b> <b>vaccinations,</b> such as tetanus, are appropriate to the general adult population.

40|$|Diabetes {{has emerged}} as a disease of major public health {{importance}} in India affecting {{the rich and the poor}} alike. Conventionally, comprehensive diabetes management is aimed at preventing micro and macro vascular complications. However, morbidity and mortality due to infections are also signifi cant. In developing countries like India, the concept of adult immunization is far from reality. Recently the H 1 N 1 pandemic has triggered the necessity for considering immunization in all age groups for the prevention of vaccinepreventable fatal infectious diseases. Considering the economics of immunization in a developing country, providing free vaccines to all adults may not be a practical solution, although the free universal immunization program for children is in existence for several decades. There is no consensus on the use of vaccines in diabetes subjects in India. However, there are some clinics offering routine pneumococcal, infl uenza and <b>other</b> <b>vaccinations.</b> Patients with diabetes have a deranged immune system making them more prone for infections. Hospitalization and death due to pneumococcal disease and infl uenza are higher in diabetes patients. They, like other healthy individuals, have a normal humoral response to vaccination with clinically signifi cant benefi ts. The American Diabetes Association, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, United Kingdom Guidelines and a number of other scientifi c organizations have well defi ned guidelines for vaccination in diabetes.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{immunotherapy}} with monoclonal antibodies targeting immunological check points {{has become a}} breakthrough therapeutic modality for solid cancers. However, only up to 50 % of patients benefit from this powerful approach. For <b>others</b> <b>vaccination</b> might provide a plausible addition or alternative. For induction of effective anticancer immunity CD 4 + T cell help is required, which {{is often difficult to}} induce to self cancer targets because of tolerogenic mechanisms. Our approach for cancer vaccines has been to incorporate into the vaccine design sequences able to activate foreign T cell help, through genetically linking cancer targets to microbial sequences (King et al. in Nat Med 4 (11) : 1281 – 1286, 1998; Savelyeva et al. in Nat Biotechnol 19 (8) : 760 – 764, 2001). This harnesses the non-tolerized CD 4 T cell repertoire available in patients to help induction of effective immunity against fused cancer antigens. Multiple immune effector mechanisms including antibody, CD 8 + T cells as well as CD 4 effector T cells can be activated using this strategy. Delivery via DNA vaccines has already indicated clinical efficacy. The same principle of linked T cell help has now been transferred to other novel vaccine modalities to further potentiate immunity against cancer targets...|$|R

Large populations of supporters travelled to various locations in Poland and Ukraine, depending on the schedule of Euro 2012 and the outcome of the games, possibly carrying the disease from one location to another.
