5|$|When Henson {{began work}} on Sam and Friends, he asked fellow University of Maryland sophomore Jane Nebel to assist him. The show was a {{financial}} success, but after graduating from college, Henson began to have doubts about going into a career performing with puppets.

Upon Henson's return to the United States, he and Jane began dating. They were married in 1959 and had five children, Lisa (b. 1960), Cheryl (b. 1961), Brian (b. 1963), John (b. 1965, d. 2014), and Heather (b. 1970).|$|E

After {{the release of the}} game in December through shareware publisher Apogee Software, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss, Softdisk owner Al Vekovius, confronted them on both their plans and their use of company resources to develop the game—the team had created it <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends—the team made no secret of their intentions.

Ideas from the Deep, now founded as id Software, used some of these games to prototype ideas for their own releases, such as Catacomb 3-D. In late spring of 1991 they worked on a new Keen game in order to develop new systems for their next major release in the Commander Keen series. They did not initially want to do a Keen game for Softdisk, but eventually decided that doing so would let them fulfill their obligations while also helping improve the next full set of games for Apogee.|$|E
