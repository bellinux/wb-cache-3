40|$|The spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias (SEDs) and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasias (SEMDs) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of skeletal dysplasias (dwarfing disorders) characterized by abnormal epiphyses, {{with and without}} varying degrees of metaphyseal irregularities, flattened vertebral bodies, and myopia. To better define the underlying cause of these disorders, we have analyzed the collagens from costal cartilage from several of these patients, using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of intact chains and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptides and amino acid analysis. In {{almost all of the}} patients in this study group, the type II collagen exhibited a slower electrophoretic mobility when compared with that in normal controls. The mobility of many, but not all, of the CNBr peptides was also retarded. Peptides near the amino terminus were almost always altered, while the mobility of peptides close to the carboxyl terminus were normal in all but the severely affected cases. Analysis of the CNBr peptides on an HPLC sieving column confirmed that the electrophoretically abnormal peptides were of a higher molecular weight than were control peptides. Amino acid analysis indicated that the abnormal collagens have a higher ratio of hydroxylysine to lysine than does control collagen, suggesting that <b>overmodification</b> may be involved in the altered mobility. Our results are consistent with a defect in the collagen helix that results in <b>overmodification</b> of the molecule from that point toward the amino terminus. We propose that some forms of SED and SEMD are associated with abnormalities in type II collagen that results in delayed helix formation and consequent <b>overmodification</b> of the collagen. Cases of SED fit onto a continuous spectrum of clinical severity that correlates positively with both the extent of alteration and the proximity of the defect to the carboxyl terminus...|$|E
40|$|Autosomal {{recessive}} lethal {{and severe}} osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) {{is caused by}} the deficiency of cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and prolyl- 3 -hydroxylase 1 (P 3 H 1) because of CRTAP and LEPRE 1 mutations. We analyzed five families in which 10 individuals had a clinical diagnosis of lethal and severe OI with an <b>overmodification</b> of collagen type I on biochemical testing and without a mutation in the collagen type I genes. CRTAP mutations not described earlier were identified in the affected individuals. Although it seems that one important feature of autosomal recessive OI due to CRTAP mutations is the higher consistency of radiological features with OI type II-B/III, differentiation between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive OI on the basis of clinical, radiological and biochemical investigations proves difficult in the affected individuals reported here. These observations confirm that once a clinical diagnosis of OI has been made in an affected individual, biochemical testing for <b>overmodification</b> of collagen type I should always be combined with molecular genetic analysis of the collagen type I genes. If no mutations in the collagen type I genes are found, additional molecular genetic analysis of the CRTAP and LEPRE 1 genes should follow. This approach will allow proper identification of the genetic cause of lethal or severe OI, which is important in providing prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis and estimating recurrence ris...|$|E
40|$|We have characterised a point {{mutation}} causing {{the substitution of}} serine for glycine at position 661 of the alpha 1 (I) chain of type I collagen in {{a child with a}} severe form of osteogenesis imperfecta. An identical glycine substitution in the alpha 2 (I) chain was previously detected in a woman with post-menopausal osteoporosis, Two of her sons were heterozygous for the mutation and the third son was homozygous as a result of uniparental isodisomy. Biochemical profiles of the type I collagen heterotrimers were studied in each of the patients and compared with a control, Medium and cell-layer collagens were overmodified in all patients. <b>Overmodification</b> was obvious in the patient with the alpha 1 (I) mutation but mild in the patients with the alpha 2 (I) mutation, being slightly less evident in the heterozygote than in the homozygote. Investigation of the melting curves of the mutant collagen trimers in all three patients showed the same slight decrease in thermal stability and, hence, a lack of correlation with phenotypic severity, In contrast, the degree of <b>overmodification</b> of the collagen alpha chains was correlated with the phenotypic severity. The clinical observations in these patients illustrate the possibly predominant role of mutations in the collagen alpha 1 (I) chains over the same mutations in the alpha 2 (I) chains in determining the clinical outcome...|$|E
40|$|Skin {{fibroblasts}} from a proband with {{a lethal}} variant of osteogenesis imperfecta synthesized both apparently normal type I procollagen and a type I procollagen that had slow electrophoretic mobility because of posttranslational <b>overmodifications.</b> The thermal unfolding of the collagen molecules as assayed by protease digestion was about 2 degrees C lower than normal. It is surprising, however, that collagenase A and B fragments showed an essentially normal melting profile. Assay of cDNA heteroduplexes {{with a new}} technique involving carbodiimide modification indicated a mutation at about the codon for amino acid 550 of the alpha 1 (I) chain. Subsequent amplification of the cDNA by the PCR and nucleotide sequencing revealed a single-base mutation that substituted an aspartate codon for glycine at position alpha 1 - 541 in the COL 1 A 1 gene. The results here confirm previous indications {{that the effects of}} glycine substitutions in type I procollagen are highly position specific. They also demonstrate that a recently described technique for detecting single-base differences by carbodiimide modification of DNA heteroduplexes can be effectively employed to locate mutations in large genes...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} mutations {{were found}} in two unrelated probands with lethal chondrodysplasias, one with achondrogenesis type II {{and the other with}} the less severe phenotype of hypochondrogenesis. The mutations in the COL 2 A 1 gene were identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of genomic DNA followed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing and restriction site analysis. The proband with achondrogenesis type II had a heterozygous single-base mutation that substituted aspartate for glycine at position 310 of the alpha 1 (II) chain of type II procollagen. The proband with hypochondrogenesis had a heterozygous single-base mutation that substituted serine for glycine at position 805. Type II collagen extracted from cartilage from the probands demonstrated the presence of type I collagen and a delayed electrophoretic mobility, indicating post-translational <b>overmodifications.</b> Analysis of CNBr peptides showed that, in proband 1, the entire peptides were overmodified. Examination of chondrocytes cultured in agarose or alginate indicated that there was a delayed secretion of type II procollagen. In addition, type II collagen synthesized by cartilage fragments from the probands demonstrated a decreased thermal stability. The melting temperature of the type II collagen containing the aspartate-for-glycine substitution was reduced by 4 degrees C, and that of the collagen containing the serine-for-glycine substitution was reduced by 2 degrees C. Electron microscopy of the extracellular matrix from the chondrocyte cultures showed a decreased density of matrix and the presence of unusually short and thin fibrils. Our results indicate that glycine substitutions in the N-terminal region of the type II collagen molecule can produce more severe phenotypes than mutations in the C-terminal region. The aspartate-for-glycine substitution at position 310, which was associated with defective secretion and a probable increased degradation of collagen, is the most destabilizing mutation yet reported in type II procollagen...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{have built}} {{molecular}} models of collagen type I {{from a patient}} with lethal osteogenesis imperfecta incorporating one or two mutant α 1 (I) -chains which contain a cysteine substituting a glycine near the C-terminal end. In either case, the cysteines can only be accommodated with considerable distortion of the native collagen structure, which disrupts inter-chain contacts. The disturbance of the triple helix {{is limited to a}} small local region. This suggests that the most important consequence of the mutation is delayed helix formation leading to <b>overmodification</b> and decreased collagen production, rather than the structural abnormality of the folded molecules, which are only marginally unstable...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 Collagen type II is a prototypic fibrillar collagen. It is {{the main}} {{structural}} protein of articular cartilage and the cartilaginous enlage of endochondral bone development. One way to study the normal structure and function of type II collagen is to study the structure of abnormal type II collagen in inherited diseases of the skeleton. Within the skeletal dysplasias a small subset of chondrodysplasias are emerging that are produced by mutations in the gene for type II collagen, COL 2 A 1. This dissertation presents thru protein biochemistry the identification and characterization of structurally defective type II collagen in cases of hypochondrogenesis, spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD), and Kniest dysplasia. In a perinatal lethal form of hypochondrogenesis a glutamate for glycine(853) substitution was identified. In the SEMD case a serine for glycine(841) was identified. And in two unrelated probands with Kniest dysplasia a deletion of a seven amino acids(102 [...] 108) was identified. The type II collagen from the cartilage of these affected probands and from additional cases of hypochondrogenesis and premature osteoarthritis were post-translationally overmodified. Amino acid sequencing of specific lysines revealed that the <b>overmodification</b> occurred primarily amino terminal to the mutation site {{and the degree of}} <b>overmodification</b> was proportional to the severity of the disease phenotype. The exception was the two Kniest dysplasia probands. The seven amino acid deletion was unique for it disrupted the Gly-x-y repeat of the triple helix. Type II collagen from these probands was overmodified amino and carboxy terminal to the mutation site...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} and metabolism of type I and III collagens were studied in fibroblast cultures and dermis from 25 unrelated patients including 23 with typical Marfan syndrome and two infants {{with a very}} severe clinical form of this syndrome. Electrophoretic analysis of collagen α-chains, as well as one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis of collagen cyanogen bromide peptides, failed to show any evidence of primary structure defects or <b>overmodification</b> of lysine residues in thesed collagens. The proportion of hydroxylated prolyl residues in isolated α 1 (I) chains was also normal. There was a minimal increase {{in the proportion of}} type III collagen produced by nine cultures. The findings in this study indicate that the underlying molecular defects in the patients studied are unlikely to involve the structure of the main fibrillar type I and III collagens. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} an 18 bp deletion in exon 49 {{of the type}} II procollagen gene (COL 2 A 1) in a patient with Kniest dysplasia. The deletion {{is located at the}} very C-terminus of the helical domain and removes two of three Gly-Pro-Pro triplets at positions 1007 - 1012, which are thought to be involved in helix formation and stability. Morphological investigation of an iliac crest biopsy showed large inclusions in the endoplasmic reticulum of chondrocytes, reflecting impaired secretion of type II collagen. Electrophoretic analysis of collagens extracted from cartilage or synthesised by cultured chondrocytes showed that type II and also type XI procollagen molecules containing mutant alpha 1 (II) chains showed post-translational <b>overmodification.</b> These observations provide further evidence for the general association of Kniest dysplasia with small deletions in the helical domain of type II collagen...|$|E
40|$|Cultured skin {{fibroblasts}} {{were examined}} from two probands with type II (lethal) osteogenesis imperfecta. One proband {{had a single}} base mutation which converted the glycine codon at position alpha 1 - 244 in the alpha 1 (I) chain of procollagen I into a cysteine codon whereas the other had a similar mutation that converted the glycine codon at position alpha 2 - 787 of the alpha 2 (I) chain into a cysteine codon. Both mutations produced post-translational <b>overmodification</b> of procollagen I. The Cys alpha 1 - 244 mutation, however, had a minimal effect on the thermal stability or secretion of the protein whereas the Cys alpha 2 - 787 mutation markedly decreased the thermal stability and, apparently as a result, essentially none of the mutated protein was secreted. The results provide clear exceptions to two previous generalizations about the position-specificity of glycine substitutions in procollagen I...|$|E
40|$|SummaryProlyl {{hydroxylation}} is {{a critical}} posttranslational modification that affects structure, function, and turnover of target proteins. Prolyl 3 -hydroxylation occurs at only one position in the triple-helical domain of fibrillar collagen chains, and its biological significance is unknown. CRTAP shares homology with a family of putative prolyl 3 -hydroxylases (P 3 Hs), {{but it does not}} contain their common dioxygenase domain. Loss of Crtap in mice causes an osteochondrodysplasia characterized by severe osteoporosis and decreased osteoid production. CRTAP can form a complex with P 3 H 1 and cyclophilin B (CYPB), and Crtap−/− bone and cartilage collagens show decreased prolyl 3 -hydroxylation. Moreover, mutant collagen shows evidence of <b>overmodification,</b> and collagen fibrils in mutant skin have increased diameter consistent with altered fibrillogenesis. In humans, CRTAP mutations are associated with the clinical spectrum of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta, including the type II and VII forms. Hence, dysregulation of prolyl 3 -hydroxylation is a mechanism for connective tissue disease...|$|E
40|$|The type II colIagenopathies form a {{continuous}} spectrum of clinical severity, ranging from lethal achondrogenesis type II and hypochondrogenesis, through spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia and Kniest dysplasia to the Stickier syndrome and familial precocious osteoarthropathy at the mildest {{end of the}} spectrum. We have carried out a radiographic, morphologic, biochemical and molecular study {{in a case of}} achondrogenesis type II. Electron micrographs showed inclusion bodies of dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum in the chondrocytes and the presence of sparse collagen fibers in the cartilage matrix. Protein analysis of collagen from cartilage indicated posttranslational <b>overmodification</b> of the major cyanogen bromide peptides, and suggested a mutation near the carboxyl terminus of the type II collagen molecule. Analysis at the DNA level demonstrated that the phenotype was produced by a single base change (G [...] >C) that resulted in the substitution of glycine(691) by arginine in the type II collagen triple helical domain. We confirm previous observations in three cases of hypochondrogenesis that glycine substitutions in the alpha 1 (II) chain can result in a phenotype at the most severe end of the type II collagenopathy spectrum...|$|E
40|$|We have {{extended}} {{the study of}} a mild case of type II achondrogenesis-hypochondrogenesis to include biochemical analyses of cartilage, bone, and the collagens produced by dermal fibroblasts. Type I collagen extracted from bone and types I and III collagen produced by dermal fibroblasts were normal, as was the hexosamine ratio of cartilage proteoglycans. Hyaline cartilage, however, contained approximately equal amounts of types I and II collagen and decreased amounts of type XI collagen. Unlike the normal SDS-PAGE mobility. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE revealed extensive <b>overmodification</b> of all type II cyanogen bromide peptides in a pattern consistent with heterozygosity for an abnormal pro alpha 1 (II) chain which impaired the assembly and/or folding of type II collagen. This interpretation implies that dominant mutations of the COL 2 A 1 gene may cause type II achondrogenesis-hypochondrogenesis. More generally, emerging data implicating defects of type II collagen in the type II achondrogenesis-hypochondrogenesis-spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita spectrum and in the Kniest-Stickler syndrome spectrum suggest that diverse mutations of this gene {{may be associated with}} widely differing phenotypic outcome...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{tissue and}} cells from a stationary and {{a rapidly growing}} hyperplastic callus from a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type IV and compared the results with those of compact bone and skin fibroblasts of an age-matched control. Collagen and protein contents per cell were low in the callus tissues and collagen I and III were overmodified as evidenced by an elevated level of hydroxylysine. The degree of lysyl hydroxylation was highest in those regions that appeared most immature by histological examination. Lysyl hydroxylation approached normal levels in collagen from the stationary callus and {{from the center of}} the growing callus. <b>Overmodification</b> of collagen was not seen in compact bone or cell cultures (neither skin fibroblasts nor callus cells) from the patient. Elevation of hydroxylysine in collagen from OI patients is generally attributed to mutations that delay triple helix formation. Our observations suggest that the varying degree of collagen modifications may occur in consequence of regulatory mechanisms during bone development and tissue repair. These mechanisms may be defective in some patients with 01 as seen in this case with hyperplastic callus formation...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} on low magnesium A 413. 0 type alloys. The results show that strontium (Sr) is mainly concentrated in the silicon particles. <b>Overmodification</b> occurs when Sr precipitates {{in the form of}} Al 2 SrSi 2, which takes place over a wide range of temperatures. The first peak occurs following the precipitation of α-Al, the second peak is merged with the precipitation of eutectic silicon (Si), and the third peak is a posteutectic reaction. Introduction of phosphorus (P) to Sr-modified alloys leads to the formation of (Al,P,Sr) 2 O 5 compound, which reduces the modification effectiveness of Sr. Therefore, in the presence of P, the amount of added Sr should exceed 200 [*]ppm. For the same levels of P, the tensile parameters of well modified alloys (233 [*]ppm Sr) are relatively higher than those partially modified with Sr (about 60 [*]ppm Sr) containing the same amount of P. During solution heat treatment, coarsening of the eutectic Si particles occurs by the growth of some particles {{at the expense of the}} dissolution of the smaller ones, as well as by the collision of nearby particles...|$|E
40|$|Type I {{collagen}} is {{the predominant}} protein of connective tissues such as skin and bone. Mutations {{in the type}} I collagen genes (COL 1 A 1 and COL 1 A 2) mainly cause osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). We describe a patient with clinical signs of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), including fragile skin, easy bruising, recurrent luxations, and fractures resembling mild OI. Biochemical collagen analysis of the patients' dermal fibroblasts showed faint <b>overmodification</b> of the type I collagen bands, a finding specific for structural defects in type I collagen. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing detected an in-frame deletion in exon 44 of COL 1 A 1 (c. 3150 _ 3158 del), resulting in the deletion of three amino acids (p. Ala 1053 _Gly 1055 del) in the collagen triple helix. This COL 1 A 1 mutation was hitherto identified in four probands with lethal OI, and never in EDS patients. As the peaks on the electropherogram corresponding to the mutant allele were decreased in intensity, weperformed next generation sequencing of COL 1 A 1 to study mosaicism in skin and blood. While approximately 9 % of the reads originating from fibroblast gDNA harbored the COL 1 A 1 deletion, the deletion was not detected in gDNA from blood. Most likely, the mild clinical symptoms observed in our patient {{can be explained by}} the mosaic state of the mutation...|$|E
40|$|In {{a family}} who {{expressed}} severe dominantly inherited osteoarthritis, the underlying mutation was traced by genomic sequencing to a single base change which predicts an amino acid substitution of cysteine for arginine at residue 519 of the triple-helical domain of the type II collagen molecule (Ala-Kokko, L., C. T. Baldwin, R. W. Moskowitz, and D. J. Prockop. 1990. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 87 : 6565 - 6568). In the present study we examined whether this predicted protein phenotype was evident in articular cartilage obtained from an affected family member who underwent hip surgery. The cartilage collagen was solubilized by CNBr digestion. Cysteine residues were labeled by reduction and alkylation with 14 C-iodoacetate. Collagen CNBr-peptides were fractionated by ion exchange and reverse phase column chromatography. One peptide from the alpha 1 (II) chain, alpha 1 (II) CB 8, {{was found to be}} radiolabeled. Tryptic peptides were prepared from it and identified by microsequence analysis. The results show that approximately one-quarter of the alpha 1 (II) chains present in the polymeric extracellular collagen of the patient's cartilage contained the Arg 519 -to-Cys substitution. The protein exhibited other abnormal properties including disulfide-bonded alpha 1 (II) -dimers and signs of posttranslational <b>overmodification.</b> The premature cartilage failure and osteoarthritis are presumably a result of the abnormal type II collagen being expressed in the cartilage matrix...|$|E
40|$|Mutations {{in the two}} {{genes for}} type I {{collagen}} (COL 1 A 1 or COL 1 A 2) cause osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a heritable disease characterized by moderate to extreme brittleness of bone early in life. Here we show that a 52 -year-old postmenopausal woman with severe osteopenia and a compression fracture of a thoracic vertebra had a mutation in the gene for the alpha 2 (I) chain of type I collagen (COL 1 A 2) similar to mutations that cause OI. cDNA was prepared from the woman's skin fibroblast RNA and assayed {{for the presence of}} a mutation by treating DNA heteroduplexes with carbodiimide. The results indicated a sequence variation in the region encoding amino acid residues 660 - 667 of the alpha 2 (I) chain. Further analysis demonstrated a single-base mutation that caused a serine-for-glycine substitution at position 661 of the alpha 2 (I) triple-helical domain. The substitution produced posttranslational <b>overmodification</b> of the collagen triple helix, as is seen with most glycine substitutions that cause OI. The patient had a history of five previous fractures, slightly blue sclerae, and slight hearing loss. Therefore, the results suggest that there may be phenotypic and genotypic overlap between mild osteogenesis imperfecta and postmenopausal osteoporosis, and that a subset of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis may have mutations in the genes for type I procollagen...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Chemical mapping {{experiments}} offer powerful {{information about}} RNA structure but currently involve ad hoc assumptions in data processing. We show that simple dilutions, referencing standards (GAGUA hairpins), and HiTRACE/MAPseeker analysis allow rigorous <b>overmodification</b> correction, background sub-traction, and normalization for electrophoretic data and a ligation bias correction needed for accurate deep sequencing data. Comparisons across six noncoding RNAs stringently test the proposed standardization of dimethyl sulfate (DMS), 2 ′-OH acylation (SHAPE), and carbodiimide measurements. Identification of new signa-tures for extrahelical bulges and DMS “hot spot ” pockets (including tRNA A 58, methylated in vivo) illustrates the utility and necessity of standardization for quantitative RNA mapping. Structure mapping, {{also known as}} footprinting, provides arapid means for probing nucleic acid conformation at single-nucleotide resolution. New modification chemistries, higher-throughput readouts, multidimensional expansions, error analysis, and resources for sharing data are advancing the approach. 1 Despite powerful insights from separate data sets, ad hoc choices in data processing have precluded robust comparison of chemical reactivities across RNAs and read-outs. 2 − 7 For example, “hot spots ” that might signal specific noncanonical features 6, 7 in one RNA cannot be confidently established in other RNAs without universal reactivity scales, analogous to problems in nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift analysis prior {{to the adoption of}} referencing samples. 8 In principle, establishing reactivities should be unambiguous.

40|$|The {{association}} of dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) {{with a distinct}} form of chondrodysplasia in a boy was reported by Goldblatt et al. [1991; Am J Med Genet 39 : 170 - 172] and has been given the name of Goldblatt syndrome or odontochondrodysplasia (ODCD; OMIM# 184260). Since the original description, only four further individuals have been reported (one sib pair and two unrelated cases). We report on an additional six individuals, including a second sib pair (brother and sister), with clinical and radiographic features that cluster and thus confirm the nosologic status of this entity. The main radiographic features are congenital platyspondyly with coronal clefts, severe metaphyseal changes particularly of the hands, wrists, and knees, mesomelic limb shortening, and coxa valga. The main physical signs are short stature, joint laxity, narrow chest, scoliosis, and DI. This combination of clinical and radiographic findings allows clear recognition of this syndrome in early childhood. Of note, the signs that {{are present in the}} newborn period are not entirely specific and the differential diagnosis includes spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (SMD) Sedaghatian type or platyspondylic lethal dysplasia (PSLD) Torrance type. The occurrence of two sib pairs in a group of only 11 patients suggests an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. <b>Overmodification</b> of cartilage-extracted collagen 2 has been reported in two sibs, but mutation analysis of COL 2 A 1 as well as of COMP, FGFR 3, RMRP, and SBDS in one or more patients have given negative results, and the molecular etiology is as yet unknow...|$|E
40|$|A {{chemical}} cleavage {{method for}} detecting mismatched bases in heteroduplexes formed between patient mRNA and control cDNA probes {{was employed to}} identify a single base mutation in a heterozygous case of osteogenesis imperfecta type IV. The parents' fibroblast mRNA did not contain the mutation. The region of the mRNA mismatch was amplified by using the polymerase chain reaction, cloned and sequenced. A point mutation of G to U at base-pair 2162 of the collagen alpha 2 (I) mRNA resulted in the substitution of glycine by valine at amino acid position 586 of the helix. This substitution disrupted the critical Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeating unit of the collagen triple helix and resulted in helix destabilization, as evidenced by a decreased thermal stability. This local disturbance to helix propagation from the C-terminus to the N-terminus led to the <b>overmodification</b> of the collagen helix downstream towards the N-terminus. However, collagen secretion in vitro was normal, and the clinical phenotype probably resulted from the secretion into the extracellular matrix of the mutant collagen combined with a decrease in collagen production to 65 % of control values. The rapid detection of the osteogenesis imperfecta mutation by using the chemical cleavage method afforded the opportunity to apply the technique to prenatal diagnosis in the next pregnancy of {{the mother of the}} osteogenesis imperfecta patient. The absence of a mismatched base in chorionic villus mRNA and control cDNA heteroduplexes indicated that the foetus did not carry the mutation, which was confirmed by the subsequent delivery of a normal baby...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA new {{dominant}} mutation in the COL 2 A 1 gene {{was found in}} a 38 -week-old fetus with hypochondrogenesis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to analyze all 44 exons coding for the triple-helical domain of COL 2 A 1 gene and the corresponding exon-intron boundaries. The technique detected a new sequence variation in exon 35. Sequencing of exon 35 demonstrated a single base mutation that converted the codon for glycine at position 604 to a codon for alanine. Electrophoresis of pepsin-digested collagen extracted from the diseased cartilage showed a doublet band of the alpha 1 (II) chain of type II collagen and the presence of alpha 1 (I) and alpha 2 (I) chains of type I collagen. Two-dimensional analysis of cyanogen bromide peptides from the type II collagen revealed post-translational <b>overmodification</b> of peptides CB 12, CB 11, CB 8, and CB 10. 5, whereas peptide CB 9. 7 migrated normally. Microscopic examination of cartilage showed that the mutation altered the organization of the growth plate. Also, articular chondrocytes contained large cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The density of the extracellular matrix was reduced, and the intensity of the staining with an antibody to type II collagen was diminished. In contrast, a significant staining with an antibody to type I collagen was observed. In situ hybridization with cRNA probes revealed a significant level of alpha 1 (I) mRNA in the cytoplasm of the patient's chondrocytes. The signal for alpha 1 (II) mRNA was about the same in control samples. The results indicated, therefore, that the genes for both type I and type II procollagens were simultaneously expressed in chondrocytes from the patient...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{biochemical}} {{test for}} osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) detects structural abnormalities in the helical region of type I collagen as delayed electrophoretic migration of alpha chains on SDS-urea-PAGE. Sensitivity of {{this test is}} based on <b>overmodification</b> of alpha chains in helices with a glycine substitution or other structural defect. The limits of detectability have not been reported. METHODS: We compared the collagen electrophoretic migration of 30 probands (types III or IV OI) with known mutations in the amino half of the alpha 1 (I) and alpha 2 (I) chains. Differences in sensitivity were examined by 5 % and 6 % SDS-urea-PAGE, and with respect to alpha chain, location along the chain, and substituting amino acid. RESULTS: Sensitivity was enhanced on 5 % gels, and by examination of intracellular and secreted collagen. In alpha 1 (I), substitutions in the first 100 residues were not detectable; 7 % of cases in the current Mutation Consortium database are in this region. alpha 1 (I) substitutions between residues 100 and 230 were variably detectable, while those after residue 232 were all detected. In alpha 2 (I), variability of electrophoretic detection extended through residue 436. About a third of cases in the Consortium database {{are located in the}} combined variable detection region. Biochemical sensitivity did not correlate with substituting residue. CONCLUSIONS: Complete testing of probands with normal type I collagen biochemical results requires supplementation by molecular analysis of cDNA or gDNA in the amino third of alpha 1 (I) and amino half of alpha 2 (I). Mutation detection in OI is important for counselling, reproductive decisions, exclusion of child abuse, and genotype-phenotype correlations...|$|E
40|$|Null {{mutations}} in cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and prolyl 3 -hydroxylase 1 (P 3 H 1 /LEPRE 1) cause types VII and VIII OI, respectively, two novel recessive forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) with severe to lethal bone dysplasia and <b>overmodification</b> {{of the type}} I collagen helical region. CRTAP and P 3 H 1 form a complex with cyclophilin B (CyPB) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which 3 -hydroxylates the Pro 986 residue of α 1 (I) and α 1 (II) collagen chains. We investigated the interaction of complex components in fibroblasts from types VII and VIII OI patients. Both CRTAP and P 3 H 1 are absent or reduced on western blots and by immunofluorescence microscopy in cells containing null {{mutations in}} either gene. Levels of LEPRE 1 or CRTAP transcripts, however, are normal in CRTAP- or LEPRE 1 -null cells, respectively. Stable transfection of a CRTAP or LEPRE 1 expression construct into cells with null mutations for the transfected cDNA restored both CRTAP and P 3 H 1 protein levels. Normalization of collagen helical modification in transfected CRTAP-null cells demonstrated that the restored proteins functioned effectively as a complex. These data indicate that CRTAP and P 3 H 1 are mutually stabilized in the collagen prolyl 3 -hydroxylation complex. CyPB levels were unaffected by mutations in either CRTAP or LEPRE 1. Proteasomal inhibitors partially rescue P 3 H 1 protein in CRTAP-null cells. In LEPRE 1 -null cells, secretion of CRTAP is increased compared with control cells and accounts for 15 – 20 % of the decreased CRTAP detected in cells. Thus, mutual stabilization of P 3 H 1 and CRTAP in the ER collagen modification complex is an underlying mechanism for the overlapping phenotype of types VII and VIII OI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background: Recessive {{forms of}} osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) {{may be caused}} by {{mutations}} in LEPRE 1, encoding prolyl 3 -hydroxylase- 1 (P 3 H 1) or in CRTAP, encoding cartilage associated protein. These proteins constitute together with cyclophilin B (CyPB) the prolyl 3 -hydroxylation complex that hydroxylates the Pro 986 residue in both the type I and type II collagen alpha 1 -chains. Methods: We screened LEPRE 1, CRTAP and PPIB (encoding CyPB) in a European/Middle Eastern cohort of 20 lethal/severe OI patients without a type I collagen mutation. Results: Four novel homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations were identified in LEPRE 1 in four probands. Two probands survived the neonatal period, including one patient who is the eldest reported patient (17 (7 / 12) years) so far with P 3 H 1 deficiency. At birth, clinical and radiologic features were hardly distinguishable from those in patients with autosomal dominant (AD) severe/lethal OI. Follow-up data reveal that the longer lived patients develop a severe osteochondrodysplasia that overlaps with, but has some distinctive features from, AD OI. A new splice site mutation was identified in two of the four probands, affecting only one of three LEPRE 1 mRNA splice forms, detected in this study. The affected splice form encodes a 736 amino acid (AA) protein with a "KDEL'' endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. While western blotting and immunocytochemical analysis of fibroblast cultures revealed absence of this P 3 H 1 protein, mass spectrometry and SDS-urea-PAGE data showed severe reduction of alpha 1 (I) Pro 986 3 -hydroxylation and <b>overmodification</b> of type I (pro) collagen chains in skin fibroblasts of the patients. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the 3 -hydroxylation function of P 3 H 1 is restricted to the 736 AA splice form...|$|E
40|$|The {{collagens}} are {{the most}} abundant proteins in the human body. Their function is predominantly structural. The mature collagen protein is composed of three polypeptides which form triple helical structures. The genes coding for the collagens are large, complex and semi-dispersed throughout me human genome. They are expressed in a tissue specific, developmentally regulated manner. Analysis of the fibrillar collagen protein and gene sequences has revealed {{a high degree of}} conservation. A possible variant in the cDNA sequence coding for 1 (III) was investigated. The variant sequence was phenotypically silent and coded for an amino acid in the carboxyl end of the helical domain. The variant base was shown to be an artefact introduced during cDNA synthesis. Many mutations causing the disease osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) have been described in the literature. Most are point mutations causing single amino acid substitutions. The mutation causing a Sillence type III OI phenotype was determined. It was found to be an inframe 3 bp deletion which resulted in the loss of the last amino acid coded for by exon 19 of COL 1 A 2, a valine. The mutation, like many of those in the type I collagen genes which cause OI, coincided in its position with the start of <b>overmodification</b> of the patients type I collagen molecules. 15 collagen types have been at least partially characterized to date. In an attempt to characterize new collagen cDNA sequences a library was produced which was intended to be enriched with collagen coding sequences. The production of such a library relied on the ability of a polymerase chain reaction primer to selectively amplify cDNA sequences coding for the helical domains of collagens. The library contained collagen sequences, but not enough to make screening the library for new collagen sequences by random sequencing of clones a viable proposition. This work continues...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} abnormalities of collagen {{were observed in}} tissues and fibroblast cultures from 17 consecutive cases of lethal perinatal osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The content of type I collagen was reduced in OI dermis and bone {{and the content of}} type II collagen was also reduced in the dermis. Normal bone contained 99. 3 % type I and 0. 7 % type V collagen whereas OI bone contained a lower proportion of type I, a greater proportion of type V and a significant amount of type III collagen. The type III and V collagens appeared to be structurally normal. In contrast, abnormal type I collagen chains, which migrated slowly on electrophoresis, were observed in all babies with OI. Cultured fibroblasts from five babies produced a mixture of normal and abnormal type I collagens; the abnormal collagen was not secreted in two cases and was slowly secreted in the others. Fibroblasts from 12 babies produced only abnormal type I collagens and they were also secreted slowly. The slower electrophoretic migration of the abnormal chains was due to enzymic <b>overmodification</b> of the lysine residues. The distribution of the cyanogen bromide peptides containing the overmodified residues was used to localize the underlying structural abnormalities to three regions of the type I procollagen chains. These regions included the carboxy-propeptide of the proα 1 (I) -chain, the helical α 1 (I) CB 7 peptide and the helical α 1 (I) CB 8 and CB 3 peptides. In one baby a basic charge mutation was observed in the α 1 (I) CB 7 peptide and in another baby a basic charge mutation was observed in the α 1 (I) CB 8 peptide. The primary defects in lethal perinatal OI appear to reside in the type I collagen chains. Type III and V collagens did not appear to compensate for the deficiency of type I collagen in the tissues. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Apparently {{because the}} biosynthetic {{pathways}} involve eight or more highly specific post-translational enzymes, {{it has been}} difficult to obtain expression of genes for fibrillar collagens in recombinant systems. Here two constructs of the human gene for procollagen II (COL 2 A 1) were prepared, one with about 0. 5 kb of a promoter for a procollagen I gene (COL 1 A 1) and the other with about 4 kb of the promoter for the procollagen II gene. The constructs, together with a neomycin-resistant gene, were transfected into a human tumour cell line (HT 1080) that synthesizes the collagen IV found in basement membranes, but does not synthesize any fibrillar collagen. About two per 100 clones resistant to the neomycin analogue G 418 synthesized and secreted human procollagen II. Milligram quantities of the recombinant procollagen II were readily isolated from the cultured medium. The recombinant procollagen II had the expected amino acid sequence as defined by nucleotide sequencing of mRNA-derived cDNA and the expected amino acid composition as defined by analysis of procollagen II that was converted into collagen II by digestion with procollagen N- and C-proteinases. Also, analysis of the carbohydrate content indicated that there was glycosylation of some of the hydroxylysine residues but no evidence of post-translational <b>overmodification</b> of the residues. In addition, the protein was shown to have a native conformation as assayed by a series of protease digestions. No essential differences were found between clones transfected with the COL 2 A 1 gene construct containing the COL 1 A 1 promoter and the similar construct containing the COL 2 A 1 promoter in terms of number of clones synthesizing recombinant procollagen II and the levels of expression. With both constructs, the expression of the COL 2 A 1 gene was closely related to copy number. The results demonstrated therefore that it is not essential to use a promoter for a gene normally expressed in a host cell in order to obtain gene copy-number-dependent expression of an exogenous collagen gene in stably transfected cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} {{mutations}} in type I collagen causing types II-IV osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) result in substitution for glycine in a Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplet by another amino acid. We delineated a Y-position substitution {{in a small}} pedigree with a combined OI/Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) phenotype, characterized by moderately decreased DEXA z-score (- 1. 3 to - 2. 6), long bone fractures, and large-joint hyperextensibility. Affected individuals have an alpha 1 (I) R 888 C (p. R 1066 C) substitution in one COL 1 A 1 allele. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of [(3) H]-proline labeled steady-state collagen reveals slight <b>overmodification</b> of the alpha 1 (I) monomer band, much less than expected for a substitution of a neighboring glycine residue, and a faint alpha 1 (I) dimer. Dimers form in about 10 % of proband type I collagen. Dimer formation is inefficient compared to a possible 25 %, probably because the SH-side chains have less proximity in this Y-position than when substituting for a glycine. Theoretical stability calculations, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms, and thermal denaturation curves showed only weak local destabilization from the Y-position substitution {{in one or two}} chains of a collagen helix, but greater destabilization is seen in collagen containing dimers. Y-position collagen dimers cause kinking of the helix, resulting in a register shift that is propagated the full length of the helix and causes resistance to procollagen processing by N-proteinase. Collagen containing the Y-position substitution is incorporated into matrix deposited in culture, including immaturely and maturely cross-linked fractions. In vivo, proband dermal fibrils have decreased density and increased diameter compared to controls, with occasional aggregate formation. This report on Y-position substitutions in type I collagen extends the range of phenotypes caused by nonglycine substitutions and shows that, similar to X- and Y-position substitutions in types II and III collagen, the phenotypes resulting from nonglycine substitutions in type I collagen are distinct from those caused by glycine substitutions...|$|E
40|$|TAPT 1 encodes the {{evolutionary}} highly conserved Transmembrane Anterior Posterior Transformation- 1 protein. ENU mutagenesis of TAPT 1 results in embryonic lethality of murine homozygotes, with posterior to anterior transformations of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. The {{mechanism by which}} this ubiquitously expressed protein causes a specific patterning defect and lethality is unknown. We describe a Moroccan family with three lethal fetuses affected with fractures of ribs and long bones, undermineralized skull and axial skeleton, hydramnios with ascites and dilated ventricles. Because of the occurrence of multiple fractures and undermineralized skeleton, a clinical diagnosis of lethal autosomal recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta was suggested. Although type I collagen folding was slightly delayed, causing mild <b>overmodification</b> of type I collagen, thorough molecular analysis of all known OI genes did not detect a causal mutation. We combined homozygosity mapping with exome sequencing, which identified a homozygous c. 1108 - 1 G>C mutation in TAPT 1, causing in-frame skipping of exon 10. A second homozygous TAPT 1 missense mutation in exon 9 (c. 1058 A>T, p. (Asp 353 Val)) was identified by direct sequencing in a complex Syrian pedigree with three lethal fetuses with fractures and multiple congenital anomalies of brain, face, heart and lungs. Immunocytochemical staining of dermal fibroblasts revealed co-localization of TAPT 1 with the centrosomal protein γ-tubulin, while co-staining with acetylated tubulin detected that TAPT 1 forms a pocket in which the primary cilium is inserted. Increased TAPT 1 expression was observed during cilium formation. Moreover, we showed in patients’ dermal fibroblasts that primary cilium formation is severely disturbed. A zebrafish tapt 1 b- morpholino-approach revealed severe cartilage malformation and a delay in bone formation. Our results show that defects in TAPT 1 underlie a novel autosomal recessive disorder, which is characterized by multiple fractures in utero, generalized undermineralization of the skeleton, microbrachycephaly, ascites and pleural effusion. We also prove that TAPT 1 is a centrosomal protein that is of crucial importance for proper cilium formation, thereby suggesting that this disorder is a novel ciliopathy...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of collagen mutations causing osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are glycine substitutions that disrupt {{formation of the}} triple helix. A rare type of collagen mutation consists of a duplication or deletion {{of one or two}} Gly-X-Y triplets. These mutations shift the register of collagen chains with respect {{to each other in the}} helix but do not interrupt the triplet sequence, yet they have severe clinical consequences. We investigated the effect of shifting the register of the collagen helix by a single Gly-X-Y triplet on collagen assembly, stability, and incorporation into fibrils and matrix. These studies utilized a triplet duplication in COL 1 A 1 exon 44 that occurred in the cDNA and gDNA of two siblings with lethal OI. The normal allele encodes three identical Gly-Ala-Hyp triplets at aa 868 - 876, whereas the mutant allele encodes four. The register shift delays helix formation, causing <b>overmodification.</b> Differential scanning calorimetry yielded a decrease in T(m) of 2 degrees C for helices with one mutant chain and a 6 degrees C decrease in helices with two mutant chains. An in vitro binary co-processing assay of N-proteinase cleavage demonstrated that procollagen with the triplet duplication has slower N-propeptide cleavage than in normal controls or procollagen with proalpha 1 (I) G 832 S, G 898 S, or G 997 S substitutions, showing that the register shift persists through the entire helix. The register shift disrupts incorporation of mutant collagen into fibrils and matrix. Proband fibrils formed inefficiently in vitro and contained only normal helices and helices with a single mutant chain. Helices with two mutant chains and a significant portion of helices with one mutant chain did not form fibrils. In matrix deposited by proband fibroblasts, mutant chains were abundant in the immaturely cross-linked fraction but constituted a minor fraction of maturely cross-linked chains. The profound effects of shifting the collagen triplet register on chain interactions in the helix and on fibril formation correlate with the severe clinical consequences. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 Ehlers-Danlos {{syndrome}} type IV (EDS IV) is {{an inherited}} disease caused by mutation of COL 3 A 1, {{the gene that}} encodes type III procollagen. Different mutations produce the disease: point mutations, exon skipping mutations and genomic insertations and deletions. The effect of these different lesions on type III procollagen, the cells that produce it, and the ultrastructural aggregates {{of which it is}} a component are not known. To better understand the consequences of COL 3 A 1 mutation, protein secretion, protein folding, cell architecture, and dermal collagen fibril formation were examined following the characterization of novel EDS IV-causing mutations. I defined 15 mutations: skipping of exons 9, 14, 18, 22, 24, 34, and 38 and point mutations G 373 R, G 769 R, G 829 E, G 904 V, G 1012 R, G 1015 E, G 1018 V, G 1021 E all of which are in the triple helical portion of the protein. I determined the genomic origin of the exon 22 skip to be a 57 base pair deletion which removed 13 bases of intron 21 and 44 bases of exon 22. The remaining six exon skipping mutations were defined at the genomic level by another member of the lab. The proteins from affected individuals displayed a gradient of overmodification; proteins with mutations closest to amino terminal end of the triple helix displayed the least amount with the degree of <b>overmodification</b> increasing as the mutation moved toward the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein concomitant with increased intracellular retention. The mutations nearest the carboxyl-terminal end of the triple helix, G 1012 R, G 1015 E, G 1018 V, G 1018 D, G 1021 E, G 1021 R, interfere with disulfide bond formation and perturb triple helix formation at 37 ∘C suggesting that the domain for nucleating folding of the triple helix is within the last 20 - 25 amino acids of this region. Electron microscopic examination of patient cells indicates that the ER is the site of retention and is increasingly dilated as mutation moves from N- to C-terminus. The fibrils from mutations in the first third of the triple helix display greater variability than normal and are also larger while those in the last third of the helix are much smaller than normal...|$|E
