40|$|This project {{proposes to}} develop and test schemes for the direct {{utilization}} of western U. S. coals in advanced power systems. One of the major issues facing such utilization of coal is the arrival of vapor-phase ash constituents that can cause fouling and hot corrosion of gas path components. The utilization schemes being developed and tested rely {{on the fact that}} western U. S. coals can be ''partially'' gasified at relatively low temperatures, and that the concomitant char produced is reactive. These characteristics afford western U. S. coals a significant advantage over bituminous coals and solid waste fuels such as petroleum coke. As part of this project, over the past four years, WRI has constructed and tested a fuel-flexible gasifier.

The Transport Gasifier is an advanced circulating fluidized-bed gasifier designed to operate as either a combustor or a gasifier in air- or <b>oxygen-blown</b> mode of operation using a particulate control device (PCD). The Transport Gasifier was operated as a pressurized gasifier during TC 10 in air- (mainly for transitions and problematic operations) and <b>oxygen-blown</b> mode. Test Run TC 10 was started on November 16, 2002, and completed on December 18, 2002. During <b>oxygen-blown</b> operations, gasifier temperatures varied between 1, 675 and 1, 825 F at pressures from 150 to 180 psig. After initial adjustments were made to reduce the feed rate, operations with the new fluidized coal feeder were stable with {{about half of the}} total coalfeed rate through the new feeder. However, the new fluidized-bed coal feeder proved to be difficult to control at low feed rates. Later the coal mills and original coal feeder experienced difficulties due to a high moisture content in the coal from heavy rains. Additional operational difficulties were experienced when several of the pressure sensing taps in the gasifier plugged. As the run progressed, modifications to the mills (to address processing the wet coal) resulted in a much larger feed size. This eventually resulted in the accumulation of large particles in the circulating solids causing operational instabilities in the standpipe and loop seal. Despite problems with the coal mills, coal feeder, pressure tap nozzles and the standpipe, the gasifier did experience short periods of stability during oxygenblown operations. During these periods, the syngas quality was high. During TC 10, the gasifier gasified over 609 tons of Powder River Basin subbituminous coal and accumulated a total of 416 hours of coal feed, over 293 hours of which were in <b>oxygen-blown</b> operation.

40|$|This project {{emphasizes}} CO 2 -capture technologies {{combined with}} integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) power systems, CO 2 transportation, and {{options for the}} long-term sequestration Of CO 2. The intent is to quantify the CO 2 budget, or an ``equivalent CO 2 `` budget, associated {{with each of the}} individual energy-cycle steps, in addition to process design capital and operating costs. The base case is a 458 -MW (gross generation) IGCC system that uses an <b>oxygen-blown</b> Kellogg-Rust-Westinghouse (KRW) agglomerating fluidized-bed gasifier, bituminous coal feed, and low-pressure glycol sulfur removal, followed by Claus/SCOT treatment, to produce a saleable product. Mining, feed preparation, and conversion result in a net electric power production for the entire energy cycle of 411 MW, with a CO 2 release rate of 0. 801 kg/kV-Whe. For comparison, in two cases, the gasifier output was taken through water-gas shift and then to low-pressure glycol H 2 S recovery, followed by either low-pressure glycol or membrane CO 2 recovery and then by a combustion turbine being fed a high-hydrogen-content fuel. Two additional cases employed chilled methanol for H 2 S recovery and a fuel cell as the topping cycle, with no shift stages. From the IGCC plant, a 500 -km pipeline takes the CO 2 to geological sequestering. For the optimal CO 2 recovery case, the net electric power production was reduced by 37. 6 MW from the base case, with a CO 2 release rate of 0. 277 kg/kWhe (when makeup power was considered).

40|$|This study evaluates {{integration}} of an <b>oxygen-blown</b> biofuel gasifier {{to a natural}} gas combined cycle {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) plant. The CHP plant and gasifier are assumed to be designed for future co-production of CO 2 neutral heat, electricity and transportation fuels (energy combine plant). The paper investigates the consequences of substituting natural gas with gasified biofuel for conventional CHP plant operation. Results are for a gasifier integrated to a large size CHP plant producing electricity and district heat. The power plant simulation program GateCycle is used for plant performance evaluation. The study investigates the technical and economic performance of the CHP plant and the consequences for global fossil CO 2 emissions.

40|$|The {{transport}} reactor development unit (TRDU) {{was modified}} to accommodate <b>oxygen-blown</b> operation {{in support of}} a Vision 21 -type energy plex that could produce power, chemicals, and fuel. These modifications consisted of changing the loop seal design from a J-leg to an L-valve configuration, thereby increasing the mixing zone length and residence time. In addition, the standpipe, dipleg, and L-valve diameters were increased to reduce slugging caused by bubble formation in the lightly fluidized sections of the solid return legs. A seal pot was added {{to the bottom of the}} dipleg so that the level of solids in the standpipe could be operated independently of the dipleg return leg. A separate coal feed nozzle was added that could inject the coal upward into the outlet of the mixing zone, thereby precluding any chance of the fresh coal feed back-mixing into the oxidizing zone of the mixing zone; however, difficulties with this coal feed configuration led to a switch back to the original downward configuration. Instrumentation to measure and control the flow of oxygen and steam to the burner and mix zone ports was added to allow the TRDU to be operated under full <b>oxygen-blown</b> conditions. In total, ten test campaigns have been conducted under enriched-air or full <b>oxygen-blown</b> conditions. During these tests, 1515 hours of coal feed with 660 hours of air-blown gasification and 720 hours of enriched-air or <b>oxygen-blown</b> coal gasification were completed under this particular contract. During these tests, approximately 366 hours of operation with Wyodak, 123 hours with Navajo sub-bituminous coal, 143 hours with Illinois No. 6, 106 hours with SUFCo, 110 hours with Prater Creek, 48 hours with Calumet, and 134 hours with a Pittsburgh No. 8 bituminous coal were completed. In addition, 331 hours of operation on low-rank coals such as North Dakota lignite, Australian brown coal, and a 90 : 10 wt% mixture of lignite and wood waste were completed. Also included in these test campaigns was 50 hours of gasification on a petroleum coke from the Hunt Oil Refinery and an additional 73 hours of operation on a high-ash coal from India. Data from these tests indicate that while acceptable fuel gas heating value was achieved with these fuels, the transport gasifier performs better on the lower-rank feedstocks because of their higher char reactivity. Comparable carbon conversions have been achieved at similar oxygen/coal ratios for both air-blown and <b>oxygen-blown</b> operation for each fuel; however, carbon conversion was lower for the less reactive feedstocks. While separation of fines from the feed coals is not needed with this technology, some testing has suggested that feedstocks with higher levels of fines have resulted in reduced carbon conversion, presumably due to the inability of the finer carbon particles to be captured by the cyclones. These data show that these low-rank feedstocks provided similar fuel gas heating values; however, even among the high-reactivity low-rank coals, the carbon conversion did appear to be lower for the fuels (brown coal in particular) that contained a significant amount of fines. The fuel gas under <b>oxygen-blown</b> operation has been higher in hydrogen and carbon dioxide concentration since the higher steam injection rate promotes the water-gas shift reaction to produce more CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 } at the expense of the CO and water vapor. However, the high water and CO{sub 2 } partial pressures have also significantly reduced the reaction of (Abstract truncated...|$|E

For the integrated biorefineries analyzed here, the ratio of useful energy outputs (steam, electricity and fuels) to total energy inputs (black liquor, wood residuals and fuel oil) ranges from 66 to 74 %; these values compare with about 57 % for conventional systems based on Tomlinson boilers and 65 % for gasification combined cycles that produce only electricity. Because of the integration of the biorefinery with the pulp and paper mill, the adjusted liquid fuel yield per unit of biomass – a measure of the effectiveness of biomass conversion to liquids – is far higher than for “standalone” gasification-based biorefineries or for ethanol production via biochemical conversion (based on enzymatic hydrolysis). Besides better energy performance, the integration between the biorefinery and the pulp mill effectively limits the specific capital investment associated with liquid fuels production to a surprisingly modest $ 60, 000 – 150, 000 per barrel of diesel equivalent per day—specific capital costs comparable to those for much larger coal-to-liquids facilities. Gasification-based pulp mill biorefinery technologies, once fully commercialized, offer the potential for attractive investment returns and, if implemented widely, significant energy and environmental benefits to the United States...|$|E
