P. E., which Mr. Egremont regarded with great annoyance, though they only consisted of such phrases as 'Back on Wednesday. Find an excuse,' or in French, 'Envoyez moi la petite boite!'

60|$|Upon {{the voyage}} down the Meuse, in {{company with the}} Dutch commissioners, {{he had a very}} narrow escape.

The earl had with him an old servant named Gill, who, with great presence of mind, slipped into his master's hand an <b>old</b> <b>passport</b> made out in the name of General Churchill. The French, intent only upon plunder, and not recognizing under the name of Churchill their great opponent Marlborough, seized all the plate and valuables in the boat, made prisoners of the small detachment of soldiers on board, but suffered the rest of the passengers, including the earl and the Dutch commissioners, to pass unmolested.|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{proposed}} system modeled after New Zealand, passport holders {{would no longer}} need to return their <b>old</b> <b>passports</b> to CIC for cancellation, but can instead apply for a new passport online while keeping the old documents before they receive the new ones.

6000|$|This was all I {{could get}} out of the chaplain; indeed, there was no more to be got. I went to bed, but not to sleep. Next day, and many other days, I spent wrestling in {{argument}} with the Duchess. I brought her my certificate of baptism, my testamurs in Smalls and Greats, an <b>old</b> <b>passport,</b> a bill of Poole's, anything I could think of to prove my identity. She was obdurate, and only said--"If you are not Percy, how do you know my secret?" [...] I had in the meantime to alter the intended course of my novel--"The Baronet's Wife." [...] The Baronet was made to become a reformed character. But in all those days at the lonely Towers, and in the intervals of arguing with the poor Duchess, I could not but meet Gwyneth Birkenhead. We met, not as cousins, for Miss Birkenhead had only too clearly appreciated the situation from the moment she first met me. The old seneschal, too, was in the secret; I don't know {{what the rest of the}} menials thought. They were accustomed to the Duchess. But if Gwyneth and I did not meet as cousins, we met as light-hearted young people, in a queer situation, and in a strange, dismal old house.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{countries}} issue {{only one}} passport to each national (an {{exception is the}} Family Passport, see below under [...] "Types"). When passport holders apply for a new passport (commonly, due to expiration of an <b>old</b> <b>passport</b> or lack of blank pages), they {{may be required to}} surrender the <b>old</b> <b>passport</b> for invalidation.

50|$|Visitors {{applying}} for most types of UK visas (including a visitor's visa and an EEA Family Permit) {{are required to}} submit biometric identifiers (all fingerprints and a digital facial image) {{as part of the}} visa application process. However, diplomats, foreign government ministers and officials and members of Commonwealth Forces are exempt from the requirement to submit biometric identifiers. Applicants who have obtained a new passport and are merely requesting a transfer of their visa vignette from their <b>old</b> <b>passport</b> to their new passport are not required to re-submit biometric identifiers. In addition, applicants who are travelling directly to the Channel Islands or Gibraltar without passing through the UK or the Isle of Man are exempt from providing biometric information. Children must be accompanied by an adult when their biometric identifiers are taken. Biometric identifiers may be shared with foreign governments. Biometric identifiers are destroyed 10 years after the last date a person's fingerprints and digital facial image were captured.|$|E
5000|$|The Singaporean {{passport}} {{is valid}} {{for a period}} of five years for passports issued since April 1, 2005 and ten years for passports issued before 1 April 2005. Before biometric passports were issued in August 2006, passports for male citizens between 11 and 18 were only valid for two years, and had to be renewed or replaced every two years. Biometric passports cannot be modified due to the [...] "write once" [...] policy by ICAO. A new passport is valid for a total period of five years. For the renewal of a passport that has a validity of nine months or less, the new one will have a validity of five years plus the remaining validity in the <b>old</b> <b>passport.</b> However, if a passport is being renewed with a validity of more than nine months, it will be valid for five years and nine months. To travel overseas, a passport must be valid for at least six months.|$|E
50|$|Most westerners {{took refuge}} in the French embassy from which they were taken by truck to Thailand two weeks later. But Cambodian {{citizens}} sheltering there, including government ministers seeking asylum, were ordered out. No exceptions were allowed, although some Cambodian women married to westerners could remain if they had documentation. Some did not survive the forced exodus to the countryside where {{they were expected to}} work in the fields. Rockoff tried to forge a passport for Dith Pran using an <b>old</b> <b>passport</b> belonging to Jon Swain. He is incensed at the way the 'Killing Fields' movie portrayed this, particularly scenes which appear to show him fixing up an improvised dark room and chemical solution while a photo of Pran fades away, until he finally gets it. In reality, Pran had an old photograph which Rockoff successfully attached to a passport. Eventually, Pran left the embassy of his own volition. As a result of this discrepancy, Rockoff and another journalist named Denis Cameron have publicly disassociated themselves from the movie.|$|E
