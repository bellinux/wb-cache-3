2500|$|Pope Francis stated during Romero's beatification that [...] "His {{ministry}} was {{distinguished by}} his {{particular attention to}} the most poor and marginalized." [...] Hailed as a hero by supporters of liberation theology inspired by his work, Romero, according to his biographer, [...] "was not interested in liberation theology" [...] but faithfully adhered to Catholic teachings on liberation and a preferential <b>option</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> desiring a social revolution based on interior reform. Up {{to the end of his}} life, his spiritual life drew much from the spirituality of Opus Dei. While seen as a social conservative at his appointment as Archbishop in 1977, he was deeply affected by the murder of his friend and fellow priest Rutilio Grande a few weeks after his own appointment and subsequently developed into an outspoken social activist.|$|E

Francis concludes that the church should be [...] "poor and for the poor" [...] (EG 198), with [...] "creative concern and effective cooperation in helping the poor to live with dignity and reaching out to everyone". Without this all the religious practices and talk of social issues will be just a camouflage (EG 207). He expects some to be offended by his words but would help [...] "those who are in thrall to an individualistic, indifferent, and self-centred mentality, to ... bring dignity to their presence on this earth" [...] (EG 208).|$|E
25|$|Many {{local and}} {{national}} governments have, for political interests, subverted efforts to remove, reduce or upgrade slums into better housing <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> Throughout <b>the</b> second half of <b>the</b> 19th century, <b>for</b> example, French political parties relied on votes from slum population and had vested interests in maintaining that voting block. Removal and replacement of slum created a conflict of interest, and politics prevented efforts to remove, relocate or upgrade the slums into housing projects that are better than the slums. Similar dynamics are cited in favelas of Brazil, slums of India, and shanty towns of Kenya.|$|R

2500|$|Francis {{observes that}} {{developed}} countries exploit the non-renewable resources of poor countries and are lax in assisting them to sustainable development, though these poor areas are {{least able to}} adopt new models that reduce environmental impact (LS 52). Here we are reminded of the <b>option</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> (above), One must discern {{the impact on the}} poor and on integral human development before launching any project (LS 185). Francis stresses the common destination of the earth's goods, preserving these for the good of all (LS 158). For this Christians must move away from consumerism to a more Christian concept of quality of life, where we can be [...] "grateful for the opportunities which life affords us ... and appreciate the small things" [...] with a certain detachment based on our Christian philosophy of life (LS 222). The need for solidarity with the poor runs through much of Evangelii Gaudium, with solidarity mentioned 14 times.

40|$|Abstract <b>The</b> {{potential}} <b>for</b> agricultural {{systems to}} adapt to climate change is at once both promising and poorly understood. This chapter reviews possible pro-ducer and consumer responses to a changing climate, the ability of these responses to offset otherwise negative impacts on food security, {{and the role of}} public and private institutions in investing in adaptation where individual responses are insuf-ficient. Accumulated evidence suggests that wealthier societies and households will be better able {{to adapt to}} a changing climate because of their greater availability of alternatives and their ability to take advantage of them. Accordingly, investments that improve <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> such as improved agricultural production tech-nologies, financial instruments, and off-farm income opportunities, will likely be critical for adapting food security to a changing climate. Climate change will not confront a static world.

40|$|Most {{developing}} countries have based their housing strategies on ownership. Approaches they have adopted, such as sites and services or upgrading schemes, rely basically on ownership through self-help. Yet, {{most of these}} efforts have proved inadequate to cope with <b>the</b> increasing demand <b>for</b> urban housing. In this context, informal settlements seem to provide the cheapest and more 'affordable' ownership <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> Nevertheless, home ownership, even in its squatter form, demands time, investment, and long term commitment; a luxury that some households simply cannot afford. Based on qualitative research conducted in three low income barrios of informal origin, this study looks at the kind of non-ownership-oriented solutions available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> in Resistencia a provincial capital in Northeast Argentina. On the demand side, findings suggest that for some households rental or shared housing is <b>the</b> only choice. <b>For</b> others, on <b>the</b> contrary, {{it seems to be}} a matter of preference, a way to avoid the chores of ownership. On the supply side, the study unveils a fairly wide spectrum of choices, with options ranging from a bed in a house to rooming houses of up to 15 rooms. While some of the landlords are relatively wealthy, others are just as poor, or poorer than their tenants. Rental and shared alternatives are far from being 'ideal' housing solutions. Under certain conditions, however, they result in reasonable short-term options that, apart from generating extra income for small landlords, contribute to diversify the supply of cheap accommodation for poor households...|$|R

En las distintas etapas de su vida desarrolló una antropología a partir del Cuerpo Místico: el hombre está llamado a ser hijo de Dios, basta ser hombre para poder pertenecer al Cuerpo Místico, Cristo está presente en los pobres y la unidad de todos los hombres en Cristo. Este estudio muestra la influencia de Columba Marmión en nuestro autor. Esta antropología teológica es el fundamento de su moral social: la dignidad de la persona humana está fundamentada en la encarnación del Verbo.

40|$|Are the {{determinants}} of chronic and transient poverty different? Do policies that reduce transient poverty also reduce chronic poverty? The authors decompose measures of household poverty into chronic and transient components and use censored conditional quantile estimators to investigate the household and geographic {{determinants of}} both chronic and transient poverty, taking panel data for post-reform rural China. They find that a household's average wealth holding is an important determinant for both transient and chronic poverty. Although household demographics, levels of education, and the health status {{of members of the}} households are important for chronic poverty, they are not significant determinants of transient poverty. Both chronic and transient poverty are reduced by greater command over physical capital, and life-cycle effects <b>for</b> <b>the</b> two types of poverty are similar. But there the similarities end. Smaller and better-educated households have less chronic poverty, but household size and level of education matters little for transient poverty. Living in an area where health and education are better reduces chronic poverty but appears to be irrelevant to transient poverty. Nor are higher foodgrain yields a significant determinant of transient poverty, although they are highly significant in reducing chronic poverty. These findings suggest that China's poor-area development program may be appropriate for reducing chronic poverty but is likely to help reduce variations in consumption that households typically face in <b>poor</b> areas [...] <b>the</b> exposure to uninsured income risk that underlies transient poverty will probably persist.
