5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II {{until about}} 1971, the Bretton Woods system of semi-fixed {{exchange}} rates meant that competitive devaluation was not an option, {{which was one of}} the design <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systems' architects. Additionally, global growth was generally very high in this period, so there was little incentive for currency war even if it had been possible.|$|E
5|$|Richard Bonnie, a {{professor}} of law and medicine at the University of Virginia School of Law, mentioned the deformed nature of the Soviet psychiatric profession as one of the explanations for why it was so easily bent toward the repressive <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, and pointed out the importance of a civil society and, in particular, independent professional organizations separate and apart from the state {{as one of the most}} substantial lessons from the period.|$|E

The High Authority could issue three types of legal instruments: Decisions, which were entirely binding laws; Recommendations, which had binding aims but the methods were left to member states; and Opinions, which had no legal force.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{exchange}} {{project of the}} late 1980s, activity to export the Finnhorse has been minimal. However, a 2008 study stated that increased international interest and demand for the Finnhorse was advisable to ensure {{the survival of the}} breed. To this end, the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national breeding program, as of 2008, include increasing international recognition of the Finnhorse and generating demand for the breed for recreational and educational uses such as in Pony Club; to make it the standard breed used in Finland for equestrian tourism; and to improve the opportunities for Finnhorse trotters to participate in Swedish and Norwegian heats.|$|E
5|$|Between 9 and 10 pm on {{the night}} of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the British troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's {{intelligence}} suggested that the most likely <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regulars' movements later that night would be the capture of Adams and Hancock. They did not worry about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but they did think their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war Australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of Germany's Pacific colonies. The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN), a 2000-man volunteer force—separate from the AIF—and consisting of an infantry battalion plus 500 naval reservists and ex-sailors, was rapidly formed {{under the command of}} Colonel William Holmes. The <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force were the wireless stations on Nauru, and those at Yap in the Caroline Islands, and at Rabaul in German New Guinea. The force reached Rabaul on 11 September 1914 and occupied it the next day, encountering only brief resistance from the German and native defenders during fighting at Bita Paka and Toma. German New Guinea surrendered on 17 September 1914. Australian losses were light, including six killed during the fighting.|$|E
5|$|IUPAC and UNESCO {{were the}} lead {{organizations}} coordinating events for the International Year of Chemistry, {{which took place}} in 2011. The International Year of Chemistry was originally proposed by IUPAC at the general assembly in Turin, Italy. This motion was adopted by UNESCO at a meeting in 2008. The main <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Year of Chemistry were to increase public appreciation of chemistry and gain more interest in the world of chemistry. This event is also being held to encourage young people to get involved and contribute to chemistry. A further reason for this event being held is to honour how chemistry has made improvements to everyone's way of life.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the {{cultivated}} plant taxonomist is concerned with the naming of plants as prescribed by two plant nomenclatural Codes. The provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Botanical Code) serve primarily scientific ends and the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scientific community, while those of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (Cultivated Plant Code) are designed to serve both scientific and utilitarian ends by making provision for the names of plants used in commerce — the cultigens that have arisen in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. These names, sometimes called variety names, are not in Latin but are added onto the scientific Latin names, and they assist communication among the community of foresters, farmers and horticulturists.|$|E

5|$|The first phase, {{known as}} the ‘orange phase’, was {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} because it provided South Vietnamese units in I Corps with a platform to stop enemy attacks, and even attack them if necessary. To accomplish the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘orange phase’, General Trưởng placed several elite combat units such as the Ranger groups and armoured forces on constant combat alert. The second phase, {{known as the}} ‘green phase’, was designed to delay enemy forces and buy more time for the South Vietnamese to regroup in order to stage a counter-attack, in the scenario that enemy forces managed to overcome the ‘orange phase’. In the final phase, or the ‘blue phases’, require South Vietnamese units to secure their areas of defence, then destroy and push enemy forces out of I Corps.|$|E
5|$|The four <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{operation}} (which {{evolved over}} time) were {{to boost the}} sagging morale of the Saigon regime in the Republic of Vietnam, to persuade North Vietnam to cease its support for the communist insurgency in South Vietnam without actually taking any ground forces into communist North Vietnam, to destroy North Vietnam's transportation system, industrial base, and air defenses, and to halt the flow of men and material into South Vietnam. Attainment of these objectives was made difficult by both the restraints imposed upon the U.S. and its allies by Cold War exigencies and by the military aid and assistance received by North Vietnam from its communist allies, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and North Korea.|$|E
