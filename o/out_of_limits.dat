However, other implementations may not increment the counter while it is overflowed, allowing it to correctly determine whether following events conform or not.|$|E

The ESs can be installed at noncritical loads for grid support.

In the upper level, the tap positions of load tap changer and capacitor banks switching are optimized to prevent the voltages along the feeder from being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>limits.</b> The model predictive control technique is applied to handle the uncertainties in renewable energy and demand. In the lower level, the responsibility of maintaining the voltages of the critical buses is shared among the ES in a distributed way via consensus control which is suitable for systems with limited communication and calculation capabilities. The proposed management scheme is verified on a modified IEEE 15 -bus distribution network. The results show that different voltage regulation devices can work together to maintain the voltage of critical buses by sharing the responsibility in the proposed scheme...|$|E

40|$|Artículos en revistasDistribution {{networks}} are operated in a radial configuration, but their topology, especially in urban areas, is normally meshed {{in order to}} improve reliability of supply. This makes it possible to configure the network after a power outage to restore the service to affected customers by alternative ways of supply. Distribution operation and planning decisions usually involve network reconfiguration studies. Network reconfiguration entails changing the state of network switches to redistribute loads among feeders in order to restore service or minimize losses or alleviate overloads or voltages <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>limits.</b> The switching operation is the basic control action in network reconfiguration. A switching operation consists of closing the switch in an opened branch and opening the switch in a closed one, keeping the network configuration radial. As a consequence, the computation of sensitivities of the state variables with respect to switching operations is a useful resource for predicting the changes in a network during a reconfiguration process. This paper presents a method for computing the sensitivities of the state variables with respect to switching operations and obtaining estimations of voltages and power flows in the network. The proposed method not only provides accurate estimations, but also implies low computation load. To illustrate the performance of the developed method, a 16 bus test system and a real scenario of the 15 kV Madrid distribution system were analyzed. For both cases, the bus voltages and the feeder power flows were estimated and compared with the power flow solution. In addition, an analysis of the computation load is presented. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|Shewhart {{control charts}} have been {{established}} as an expedient method for analyzing dynamic, trending data {{in order to identify}} anomalous subsystem performance as soon as such performance would exceed a statistically established baseline. Additionally, this leading indicator tool integrates a selection methodology that reduces false positive indications, optimizes true leading indicator events, minimizes computer processor unit duty cycles, and addresses human factor concerns (i. e., the potential for flight-controller data overload). This innovation leverages statistical process control, and provides a relatively simple way to allow flight controllers to focus their attention on subtle system changes that could lead to dramatic off-nominal system performance. Finally, this capability improves response time to potential hardware damage and/or crew injury, thereby improving space flight safety. Shewhart control charts require normalized data. However, the telemetry from the ISS Early External Thermal Control System (EETCS) was not normally distributed. A method for normalizing the data was implemented, as was a means of selecting data windows, the number of standard deviations (Sigma Level), the number of consecutive points <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>limits</b> (Sequence), and direction (increasing or decreasing trend data). By varying these options, and treating them like dial settings, the number of nuisance alerts and leading indicators were optimized. The goal was to capture all leading indicators while minimizing the number of nuisances. Lean Six Sigma (L 6 S) design of experiment methodologies were employed. To optimize the results, Perl programming language was used to automate the massive amounts of telemetry data, control chart plots, and the data analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{most widely}} {{extended}} approach for automaticallydetecting anomalous behavior in space operations isthe use of out-of-limits (OOL) alarms. The OOL approach consists of defining an {{upper and lower}} threshold so that when a measurement goes above the upper limit or below the lower one, an alarm is triggered. Then engineers will inspect the parameter that is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>limits</b> and determine whether it is an anomaly or not and decide which action to take (for example, run a procedure). This is the original out-of-limits concept. The current OOL concept has evolved to cope with more situations such as distinguishing between soft and hard lim-its; for example, a soft OOL triggers a warning to pay atten-tion, a hard OOL triggers an error that demands attention. Soft limits are contained within hard limits. In addition OOL thresholds (soft and hard) can be configured so that differ-ent thresholds are applicable in different situations (for example, depending on the working mode of a given instru-ment). n Typically, automatic telemetry monitoring in space operations is performed by out-of-limits (OOL) alarms. This approach consists of defining an upper and lower threshold so that when a measurement goes above the upper limit or below the lower one, an alarm is triggered. We discuss {{the limitations of the}} out-of-limits approach and propose a new monitoring paradigm based on novelty detec-tion. The proposed monitoring approach can detect novel behaviors, which are often signa-tures of anomalies, very early — allowing engineers in some cases to react before the anomaly develops. A prototype implementing this monitoring approach has been imple-mented and applied to several ESA missions. The operational assessment from the XMM-Newton operations team is presented...|$|E
40|$|The Calspan {{electron}} beam fluorescence (EBF) measurement system is described {{along with the}} results of measurements made in hypersonic flow. Numerous self-emitting metallic species were identified, many of which may be associated with an aging/erosion process within the B 30 HST. Because there were only 16 tunnel runs, it was only possible to obtain spectral measurements over a limited range of wavelengths and time sampling periods. Many spectral features of the flow remain uninvestigated. Because flow self-emission is important to all optical diagnostic techniques, it is recommended that additional spectral studies by performed. The three {{electron beam}}-excited species that were identified are nitrogen, helium, and nitric oxide. The high metallic radiation background interfered with attempts to obtain the time-wise variation of N 2 density and He radiation with the optical fiber/PMT channels. In the case of the N 2 density measurements the result of interference was increased uncertainty. Unfortunately, the interference caused the time-wise He measurements to fail completely. It is recommended that the electron beam be modulated to provide discrimination against the background radiation in future N 2 density measurements. Careful data reduction produced useful measurements of N 2 vibrational temperature, even though the high background from metallic species significantly increased measurement uncertainty. Perhaps the recommended additional spectral studies would reveal N 2 (+) First Negative System band-pair regions having less background. Detection of the He arrival was easily accomplished with the spectrometer/array detector system. Because of this, it is recommended that this means of detecting He arrival be used in the future. With proper calibrations of the system an He number density could be obtained. Although the flow conditions were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>limits</b> for the run in which the NO spectrum was recorded, the usefulness of the NO spectrum for determination of free-stream rotational temperature was demonstrated and should be exploited in future experiments. Indeed, based on the strong NO signals, it is recommended that lower resolution NO spectra be obtained to provide a measure of NO vibrational temperature in the same manner that the N 2 temperature was obtained...|$|E
