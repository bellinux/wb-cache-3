25|$|Fudan has reconstructed {{its course}} system to suit {{education}} goals. A course scheme <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>education,</b> specialized education and basic education in {{arts and sciences}} has been implemented. Encompassing a complete and comprehensive range of disciplines, the courses <b>of</b> <b>general</b> <b>education</b> enable students to receive education in diverse fields. All of the 70-plus undergraduate majors of Fudan have been put into seven general categories so that students can benefit on a broader scale from the systematic discipline training. According to the Education Scheme for Arts and Sciences, course modules are determined by discipline systems and course suits, and credits by course modules. In this sense, Fudan provides students with more options for their college studies. In contrast with the traditional syllabus, the new module has appropriately decreased the gross credits and class hours. Along with minor programs and extracurricular academic activities, it contributes greatly to the intellectual development of undergraduate students, exposing them to {{a wider range of}} knowledge.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the status and {{development}} options <b>of</b> <b>general</b> infor­mal <b>education.</b> The discussion {{is based on the}} role that this kind of education had in Scandinavian countries, and on the definition <b>of</b> <b>general</b> informal <b>education</b> as an activity that stems from personal human needs, rather than from an individual's occupational or social role. This also characterises the learning process in <b>general</b> informal <b>education,</b> which distinguishes this kind of education from learning and education in the formal or informal occupational education. It is precisely due to the autonomy in determining the educational objectives and due to  the manner of learning characteristic <b>of</b> <b>general</b> informal <b>education,</b> that makes this kind of education a "school" for the development of civil society and is closely tied with the development of democracy and information society. The article first presents the position <b>of</b> <b>general</b> informal <b>education</b> in the documents of international organisations and its position in the long- and mid-term development plans of education or lifelong learning in several EU Member States.

25|$|Zürich {{benefits}} from {{the high level of}} investment in education that is typical of Switzerland in general and provides skilled labour at all levels. The city is home to two major universities, thus enabling access to graduates and high technology research.

Such characteristics are reflected in the high level of productivity the region enjoys and account for the opening of offices and research centres in the city by large corporations.|$|E
