25|$|In 1901 and 1902, he had {{back-to-back}} successes; Quality Street {{was about}} a respectable, responsible <b>old</b> <b>maid</b> who poses as her own flirtatious niece {{to try to win}} the attention of a former suitor returned from the war. Following that, The Admirable Crichton was a critically acclaimed social commentary with elaborate staging, about an aristocratic family and their household servants shipwrecked on a desert island. Under these difficult circumstances, a male household member seems better suited to taking on the responsibilities of leadership than the lord of the manor.|$|E

500|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{a new style}} of novel became popular in France. The serial format known as the roman-feuilleton {{presented}} stories in short regular installments, often accompanied by melodramatic plots and stock characters. Although Balzac's La Vieille Fille (The <b>Old</b> <b>Maid),</b> 1836, was the first such work published in France, the roman-feuilleton gained prominence thanks mostly to his friends Eugène Sue and Alexandre Dumas, père. Balzac disliked their serial writing, however, especially Sue's socialist depiction of lower-class suffering. Balzac wanted to dethrone what he called [...] "les faux dieux de cette littérature bâtarde" [...] ("the false gods of this bastard literature"). He also wanted {{to show the world}} that, despite his poor health and tumultuous career, he was [...] "plus jeune, plus frais, et plus grand que jamais" [...] ("younger, fresher, and greater than ever"). His first efforts to render a quality feuilleton were unsuccessful. Even though Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes ("A Harlot High and Low"), published in segments from 1838 to 1847, was celebrated by critics, Balzac complained to Mme. Hanska that he was [...] "doing pure Sue". He tried again in 1844 with Modeste Mignon, but public reactions were mixed. Two years later Balzac began a new project, determined to create something from his [...] "own old pen again".|$|E
500|$|Once {{the fourth}} Test got underway, England won the match {{to take the}} series. Partly {{prompted}} by Jardine, Eddie Paynter scored 83 having released himself from hospital. Jardine went on to make a painstaking 24, at one point facing 82 balls without scoring a single run. He was not proud of his batting performance, being shamefaced to Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton, and describing his batting to Bill O'Reilly as being [...] "like an <b>old</b> <b>maid</b> defending her virginity." [...] England also won the final Test ending on 28 February, with a final clash taking place between Jardine and Larwood. After a long bowling spell, Larwood was furious when Jardine sent him in to bat as nightwatchman but went on to score 98 runs. Later, Larwood broke his foot while bowling in the second innings, but Jardine was not convinced that he was seriously injured. He made him stay on the field until Bradman was out. Larwood, partly through this injury and partly through political repercussions from this series, never played another Test. Also in this match, Jardine enraged Harry Alexander by asking him not to run on the pitch as he was damaging it and giving his side an advantage. He proceeded to bowl hostile bouncers at Jardine, who was struck painfully {{to the delight of}} the crowd.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1912 West {{accused the}} famously libertine writer H. G. Wells of being [...] "the <b>Old</b> <b>Maid</b> among novelists" [...] in a provocative review in Freewoman of his novel Marriage. The review {{attracted}} Wells's interest and {{an invitation to}} lunch at his home. The two writers became lovers in late 1913. [...] Their 10-year affair produced a son, Anthony West, born on 4 August 1914; their friendship lasted until Wells's death in 1946.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 September 1668, John II Casimir abdicated the Polish–Lithuanian throne, and {{returned}} to France. The Polish monarchy was elective and Christina made an attempt to gain the right to rule Poland. She recommended herself being Catholic, an <b>old</b> <b>maid</b> and intended to remain one. She had Pope Clement IX’s support; but her failure seemed to please her since this meant that she could return to her beloved Azzolino. She left the city on 20 October 1668.|$|E

Her father's death made mortality more apparent to her, and she {{decided to become a}} mother at age 50. She later said of having children, [...] "Motherhood has completely changed me. It's just about the most completely humbling experience that I've ever had." ...|$|E
2500|$|Four months later, the Society {{staged a}} double bill of Gian Carlo Menotti's opera The <b>Old</b> <b>Maid</b> and the Thief {{along with his}} ballet The Unicorn, The Gorgon, and the Manticore. [...] It was very {{successful}} with {{both the public and}} critics alike. Successful presentations followed from November 1957 onwards: Fidelio; Ariadne auf Naxos; Idomeneo; a double bill of Schoenberg's Erwartung and Stravinsky's Le Rossignol (conducted by the composer); and a December 1961 The Magic Flute which resulted in an invitation from President John Kennedy at the White House for some excerpts from the opera.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{music videos}} were filmed set to [...] "Sloop John B" [...] and [...] "God Only Knows" [...] for the UK's Top of the Pops, both {{directed}} by Taylor. The first was filmed at Brian's Laurel Way home with Dennis acting as cameraman, the second near Lake Arrowhead. While the second film, containing {{footage of the}} group minus Bruce flailing around in grotesque horror masks and playing <b>Old</b> <b>Maid,</b> {{was intended to be}} accompanied by excerpts from [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice", [...] "Here Today" [...] and [...] "God Only Knows", slight edits were made by the BBC to reduce the film's length.|$|E

The proclamation went on to state that if arbitration were not adopted by noon that day all the <b>old</b> <b>maids</b> of the federation would strike--and strike they did.|$|R

2500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{mentions}} {{that some of}} Balakirev's character traits were present before his conversion but became intensified afterward. This was true of his general intolerance of viewpoints other than his own, [...] but especially so with his anti-Semitism. His attacks on Anton Rubinstein in the 1860s became petty and anti-Semitic, and Jews were not admitted to the Free School during his earlier directorship. However, it was after his conversion that he suspected everyone he disliked to be of Jewish origin, and that he hated the Jews in general because they had crucified Christ. He became belligerent in his religious conversations with friends, insistent that they cross themselves and attend church with him. [...] "All this medley of Christian meekness, backbiting, fondness for beasts, misanthropy, artistic interests, and a triviality worthy of an <b>old</b> <b>maid</b> from a hospice, all these struck everyone who saw him in those days", Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, adding that these traits intensified further in subsequent years.|$|E
