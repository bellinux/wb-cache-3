In the process, they secured twenty-three prisoners, some artillery pieces and a large quantity of ammunition. They also captured the town's water pumping machinery intact, but were forced to withdraw back to Jebaliye for water as the equipment ran <b>on</b> <b>gas</b> made from charcoal, {{which had to be}} converted before it could be used.|$|E
5|$|Early work on {{the study}} of the {{chemistry}} of rutherfordium focused <b>on</b> <b>gas</b> thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.|$|E

While the prospects for life <b>on</b> <b>gas</b> giants are unknown, {{it might be possible}} for a large moon of the planet to provide a habitable environment. Unfortunately tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet, and the star could destroy moons massive enough to be habitable over the lifetime of the system. In addition it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place.|$|E

5|$|Operating {{funds for}} the ferry system, reliant <b>on</b> <b>gas</b> taxes raised by the state, were {{left out of the}} 1989 budget because of a dispute in the state government. As a result, the MV Tyee and two {{additional}} passenger-only ferries intended to serve Vashon Island were pulled from service in June 1989. The three ferries were loaned to the San Francisco Bay Area after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake left the San Franciscoâ€“Oakland Bay Bridge closed for repairs. In January 1990, the ferries returned to the Seattle area, and began regular passenger service on April 23, 1990.|$|E

Drag released an EP, Gas Food Lodging, on 26 October 2003 through Dew Process. The band followed this up with several gigs in Brisbane; a tour down the East Coast of Australia was canceled when Middleton caught the flu.
