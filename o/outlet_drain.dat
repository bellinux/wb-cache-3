50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the <b>outlet,</b> <b>drain,</b> fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|E

The model as run for 30 year climate data. Various drain depth and spacing combinations and different weir setting were simulated. Simulation results showed that the xcess soil moisture was the main factor for yield reduction and the best conditions of controlled drainage and subirrigation were obtained when the depth of weir setting was the same as drain depth and these systems acted as conventional drains. Based on results, controlled drainage and subirrigation were not suitable because of high rainfall in the region. But the conventional controlled drainage system can be used for these fields, so that in wet season the system acts like a conventional or free drainage system and in paddy rice growth periods, it operates as controlled drainage by installing a weir setting <b>outlet</b> <b>drain...</b>|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: An {{essential}} nutrient for plant growth, phosphorus (P) is often implicated as {{a contributing factor}} to algal blooms. Lake Macatawa is a hypereutrophic lake located in west Michigan, and the watershed is dominated by row crop agriculture. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess agricultural tile drains as a source of P in the Macatawa Watershed. SUBJECTS: Nine tile <b>drain</b> <b>outlets</b> in the Macatawa Watershed from March 2015 – February 2016. METHODS: 1) Conduct a tile drain effluent survey by measuring soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) once per month; 2) investigate the change in tile drain P concentrations temporally over a one-year period; and 3) use seasonal algal bioassays to measure the bioavailability of P found within the tile drains. ANALYSIS: Kruskal-Wallis tests with a Holm’s adjustment compared P concentrations between sample sites and between sample dates. Linear regression was used to relate SRP concentration to algal growth after the bioassays. RESULTS: Tile <b>drain</b> <b>outlet</b> SRP and TP concentrations varied temporally and spatially. The SRP:TP ratio measured at the tile <b>drain</b> <b>outlets</b> had a significant, positive correlation with acreage drained by the tile system. Four of six bioassays resulted in a positive relationship between SRP and algal growth, but results from only one bioassay were statistically significant.

40|$|Abstract: Unsealed {{roads are}} {{necessary}} infrastructure required to manage forested catchments. They form linear {{features in the}} landscape that intersect, concentrate and redirect flow paths which can alter catchment hydrology and in-stream water quality. However, water quality is only affected if runoff and sediment generated on the roads are delivered to the streams. Road runoff and eroded sediment can enter the stream at 1) stream crossings, 2) via gullies at <b>drain</b> <b>outlets</b> that concentrate the flow {{all or part of}} the way to the stream, or 3) via diffuse overland flow. Hairsine et al. (2002) developed a simple probabilistic model for diffuse overland flow. It uses the concept of the ‘volume to breakthrough’, which is the volume of runoff required to enter an area before discharge is observed at the downslope boundary of that area. The model only requires variables of distance of <b>drain</b> <b>outlet</b> from the stream, road contributing area (or road length), road infiltration rate and a designer rainfall event to calculate runoff volume. The model has been applied to a number of forest catchments to assess the adequacy of road drainage. Where road drainage is determined to be inadequate, the model can be used to determine the location of “new drains ” by maximizing contributing road area as determined by the distance the <b>drain</b> <b>outlet</b> is from the stream. However, this method results in many new drains being placed close to existing drains along road segments.

40|$|ABSTRACT. SWAT is a GIS-based basin-scale model {{widely used}} for the {{characterization}} of hydrology and water quality of large, complex watersheds; however, SWAT has not been fully tested in watersheds with karst geomorphology and downstream reservoir-like embayment. In this study, SWAT was applied to test its ability to predict monthly streamflow dynamics for a 1, 555 ha karst watershed, Chapel Branch Creek, which drains to a large embayment and is comprised of highly diverse land uses. SWAT was able to accurately simulate the monthly streamflow at a cave spring (CS) <b>outlet</b> <b>draining</b> mostly agricultural and forested lands and a golf course plus an unknown groundwater discharging area, only after adding known monthly subsurface inputs as a point source at that location. Monthly streamflows at two other locations, both with multiple land uses, were overpredicted when lower lake levels were prevalent {{as a result of}} surface water flow to groundwater (losing streams). The model underpredicted the flows during rising lake levels, likely due to high conductivity and also a deep percolation coefficient representing flow lost to shallow and deep groundwater. At the main watershed outlet, a wide section performing as a reservoir embayment (R-E), the model was able to more accurately simulate the measured mean monthly outflows. The R-E storage was estimated by using a daily water balance approach with upstream inflows, rainfall, and PET as inputs and using parameters obtained by bathymetric survey, LiDAR, and downstream lake level data. Results demonstrated the substantial influence of the karst features in the water balance, with conduit and diffuse flow as an explanation for the missing upstream flows appearing via subsurface conveyance to the downstream cave spring, thus providing a more accurat...|$|R

This study presents {{the application of a}} cost-effective (< USD 2000), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to investigate frontal dynamics at a major <b>outlet</b> <b>draining</b> the western sector of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The UAV was flown over Store Glacier on three sorties during summer 2013 and acquired over 2000 overlapping, geo-tagged images of the calving front at ? 40 cm resolution. Stereo-photogrammetry applied to these images enabled the extraction of high-resolution digital elevation models with an accuracy of ? 1. 9 m which we used to quantify glaciological processes from early July to August 2013. The central zone of the calving front advanced by ~ 500 m whilst the lateral margins remained stable. In addition, the ice surface thinned by 3. 5 m m? 1 during the melt-season in association with dynamic thinning. Ice flux through the calving front is calculated at 2. 96 ? 107 m 3 d? 1, equivalent to 11 Gt a? 1, which is comparable to flux-gate estimates of Store Glacier's annual discharge. Water-filled crevasses were observed throughout the observation period, but covered a limited area (1200 to 12 000 m 2 of the ? 5 ? 106 m 2 surveyed area) and did not appear to exert any significant control over calving.
