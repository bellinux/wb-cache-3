2500|$|Moss was {{as gifted}} in sports cars as in Grand Prix cars. To his {{victories}} in the Tourist Trophy, the Sebring 12 Hours and the Mille Miglia he added three consecutive wins (1958–1960) in the gruelling 1000 km Nürburgring, the first two in an Aston Martin (in which he {{did most of the}} driving) and the third in a Tipo 61 [...] "birdcage" [...] Maserati, co-driving with the American Dan Gurney. The pair lost nearly six minutes when an <b>oil</b> <b>hose</b> blew off, but despite miserable conditions they made up the time and took 1st place.|$|E
2500|$|General Murray survived two plane crashes in his lifetime. The {{first was}} before the {{ejection}} seat and took place when he was instructing a student {{that was one of}} The Tuskeegee Airmen. They were flying in a single-engine, two-seater trainer with a slide-back canopy over Florida. An <b>oil</b> <b>hose</b> broke and they lost engine power. Murray was able {{to take control of the}} plane and land it in a swampy field, causing severe damage to the engine and belly of the plane. They were not injured. The second plane crash was when General Murray was an executive for an aerospace company and was aboard the company's business jet as a passenger. The plane began its descent for landing on a very cold winter day in Michigan. General Murray, concerned about an ice buildup, looked out the window over the wing and noticed large sheets of ice on the wings. He quickly notified the pilots, but it was too late. General Murray then observed the ice breaking off of the wings and being sucked into the jet engine intakes. The engines shut down, and the plane had to make an emergency landing on a partially iced-over lake. Upon the plane crashing, it immediately burst into flames. General Murray quickly opened the door and ushered out the pilots and the other executives he was traveling with. The water was now covered in aircraft fuel. The fuel ignited, leaving General Murray no escape. His only option was to dive into the flames that were on top of the water. He suffered burns that were, fortunately, not serious. He said that swimming in the icy waters was the worst of it! ...|$|E

The defective <b>oil</b> supply <b>hoses</b> were prone to degradation and eventual rupture, causing oil to rapidly leak and resulting in permanent engine damage.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the company}} grew the product {{categories}} diversified. There are three possibilities how designs made by Porsche Design can appear — Porsche Design brand products made exclusively for Porsche Design; products bearing the manufacturer's {{name and the}} writing [...] "Design by F.A. Porsche"; and products with no hint of Porsche Design at all. Porsche Design came up with several bathroom designs, a washing machine, furniture, knives, television receivers, desk lamps (one with three telescoping radio antennas attaching the light bulb holder to the base and one employing design aspects of a guillotine in its pull-out mechanism), tobacco pipes with air-cooled-engine-inspired cooling fins, pens made out of wire-cloth used in <b>oil</b> <b>hoses</b> for racing engines, computer monitors, computer external hard drives, coffee makers, and even a grand piano for an Austrian manufacturer Bösendorfer. The Design by F.A. Porsche mark is used no more, {{with the exception of}} the professional kitchen knives of CHROMA Cnife.|$|R
50|$|Tankers offload at LOOP by pumping crude <b>oil</b> through <b>hoses</b> {{connected}} to a Single Buoy Mooring (SBM) base. Three SPMs are located 8,000 feet (2.4 km) from the Marine Terminal. The SPMs are designed to handle ships up to 700,000 deadweight tons (635,000 metric tonnes). The crude oil then moves to the Marine Terminal via a 56-inch (1.4 m) diameter submarine pipeline. The Marine Terminal consists of a control platform and a pumping platform.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had undergone}} maintenance {{shortly before the}} flight. In order to perform this maintenance, {{it was necessary to}} disconnect a high-pressure <b>oil</b> <b>hose</b> from the engine cylinders. The investigation found that it had not been correctly reattached, thus starving the engine of oil.|$|E
5000|$|A minor {{problem was}} the <b>oil</b> <b>hose</b> from {{the lower part of}} the engine to the oil cooler. This was too short since a running engine was moving {{separate}} from the oil cooler. This hose was almost solid being under pressure and in time the oil cooler would crack. This was solved by connecting the oil hoses for the oil cooler to and from the engine [...] "up side down" [...] to make the lower hose, now connecting to the top of the oil cooler, longer and movable.|$|E

50|$|In the Irish Sea, 400 {{passengers}} {{aboard the}} Le Havre to Rosslare ferry arrived 10 hours late after being tossed in the storm. In Merseyside at the Tranmere Oil Terminal, high winds caused the Shell oil tanker Myrina to break loose (breaking 14 mooring lines and <b>oil</b> discharge <b>hoses)</b> and strand on a sandbank. Thirteen tugs re-floated the tanker {{on the next}} day's high tide. A recently opened landing stage for the Mersey Ferry was sunk, having cost 1.25 million pounds. The former Isle of Man steamer TSS King Orry (IV) broke her mooring and ran aground in the Lune estuary, while berthed at Glasson Dock waiting to be dismantled.|$|R

25|$|A CAF {{maintenance}} team {{arrived at}} China Lake on 31 March 1971 and in only nine weeks, {{with the help}} of more CAF volunteers, they restored all systems and replaced fuel, <b>oil</b> and hydraulic <b>hoses.</b> The restoration process involved cannibalizing parts from other B-29s at China Lake, installing instruments, having new window bubbles made and restoring controls to working order. After the CAF technicians ran the engines, tested propellers and landing gear, N4249 was made ready to fly again by 3 August 1971. They had a permit to make a single ferry flight out of China Lake although once it landed, the B-29 would be grounded.|$|R
40|$|On December 12, 2007, {{the second}} largest oil spill {{in the history of}} Norwegian oil {{exploration}} occurred on StatoilHydro's Statfjord Alpha platform. The spill was caused by a snapped 20 ″ <b>oil</b> off-loading <b>hose.</b> Thorough investigations by StatoilHydro [1] and by the Norwegian authorities [2] revealed the chain of events that led to this incident. One of the links in this chain was the unintended fast closure of the shuttle tanker's bow loading valve during off-loading. This closure initiated a pressure surge in the oil off-loading system. As part of the internal investigation by StatoilHydro, TNO carried out a water hammer analysis of the entire oil off-loading system, including the off-loading hoses to the seabed and further subsea piping up to the platform. These simulations revealed that high pressures could occur in the oil off-loading system due to fast closure of the bow loading valve followed by multiple reflections at diameter changes. The maximum pressures were more than 100 bar above the normal operating pressure of 10 bar. The diameter changes were introduced into the oil off-loading system to maximize the off-loading capacity. The results of the water hammer analysis provided the missing link between the fast closure of the valve and the damaged hose and also showed that this damage most likely occurred within 0. 5 second after the closure of the valve. Based on the results of this analysis, also other oil off-loading systems are being reinvestigated to prevent a similar incident to occur in the future. Copyright © 2009 by ASME...|$|R
50|$|By {{the summer}} of 2001 Pentland Ferries were ready to start regular sailings with their vessel the MV Pentalina-B to St Margaret's Hope. It was soon {{realised}} that even with these improvements {{there would still be}} problems and that a much longer pier would be needed. Fortunately an old floating dock was available for disposal at Lerwick. This was purchased, towed to St Margaret's Hope, where it was cleaned of all contaminants and then towed to Gills Bay where it was sunk to form a continuation of the pier thus greatly increasing its length. Old <b>oil</b> transfer <b>hoses</b> from the Scapa Flow oil terminal were used as fenders for the ferry while rock armour was dumped on the seaward side for protection against the waves. The tanks have been filled with concrete and the dock itself filled with the spoil from dredging to make more room for the ferry to manoeuvre. By the time all this work is finished the dock will be incorporated into the pier.At present it is designated as a wreck and exhibits two green lights at its seaward end, rather than a pier which shows two red lights. As all this work is funded by the ferry company at present (2006), work continues slowly as finances permit. It is planned to continue dredging to make sufficient room for a ferry to turn round if need be and then possibly extend the pier again at an angle at the seaward end to stop the swell which is sometimes too great for work at the linkspan. This will not be before {{the summer of}} 2008.|$|R

40|$|Issue: Practical rubber {{compounds}} {{require the}} incorporation of petroleum oils and plasticizers to make them processable. Best Practice: Rubber polymers are high viscosity liquids. Inorganic fillers and carbon black are added to reinforce the rubber polymer. This increases the viscosity even further. To reduce the viscosity, improve processing and flow and reduce cost softeners (oils and plasticizers) {{are added to the}} rubber compound. Almost all rubber compounds are softened. Levels used vary from 5 - 10 phr for high performance treads like aircraft and off the road tires to several hundred phr in highly <b>oil</b> extended EPDM <b>hose</b> and extruded goods. Plasticizing oils are arbitrarily divided into aliphatic, napththenic, and aromatic classes. The most widely used class is the aromatic oil. It is commonly added to passenger and truck tire treads, carcasses, and sidewalls as well as other components. Napththenic oils are added to white sidewalls and other components requiring non-staining properties. The recent trend in lowering the low rolling resistance of passenger tires has resulted in more napththenic oil being used in treads and carcasses. It should be noted that in the recycled rubber material, there is a residual oil from the original compounds in tires and non-tire products. A small amount of oil may volatize in service. However most of it is stil...|$|R
