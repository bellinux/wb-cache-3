5|$|Most Nahuatl dialects have {{stress on}} the {{penultimate}} syllable <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> In Mexicanero from Durango, many unstressed syllables have disappeared from words, and the placement of syllable stress has become phonemic.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the length}} of closure is {{defined in terms of}} time between the closure of the vocal tract after the {{preceding}} vowel, and the release before the following vowel, stops at the beginning or end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> do not have a fortis-lenis contrast. Orthographically in Wagiman, word-initial stops are written using the voiced Roman letters (b, d and g), but at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> voiceless letters (p, t and k) are used instead.|$|E
5|$|Stress in Khmer {{falls on}} the final {{syllable}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> Because of this predictable pattern, stress is non-phonemic in Khmer (it does not distinguish different meanings).|$|E

5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E
5|$|While a phoneme can be {{represented}} {{by more than one}} grapheme, each grapheme can be pronounced in only one way. This means that the actual pronunciation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> is always clear from its orthographic form.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions {{when they do not}} understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} {{insight into the}} use of dictionaries and contextual guessing by advanced English-language learners. This report identifies dictionary use and contextual guessing strategies used by these learners most often and least often. Participants were 100 international graduate students at a large southwestern U. S. university who completed a vocabulary learning strategy questionnaire. The results indicated that these learners consulted a dictionary most often {{to find out the}} pronunciation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>word</b> and least often to learn the frequency of use and appropriate usage <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unknown <b>word.</b> Participants most often based their guesses <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word’s</b> meaning from the paragraph’s main ideas and background information. Using the meaning of individual parts <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unfamiliar compound <b>word</b> (such as note-book) and the part <b>of</b> speech <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>word</b> were the least-used guessing strategies. </p...|$|R
5|$|Tolkien based Quenya {{pronunciation}} more on Latin than on Finnish. Thus, Quenya {{lacks the}} vowel harmony and consonant gradation present in Finnish, and accent {{is not always}} on the first syllable <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> Typical Finnish elements like the front vowels ö, ä and y are lacking in Quenya, but phonological similarities include the absence of aspirated unvoiced stops or {{the development of the}} syllables ti > si in both languages. The combination of a Latin basis with Finnish phonological rules resulted in a product that resembles Italian in many respects, which was Tolkien's favourite modern Romance language.|$|E
5|$|In Quenya, the {{stressing}} of a syllable is {{predictable and}} non-phonemic (i.e. the meaning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> never changes {{depending on the}} stress), but it is partly determined by syllable weight. Words of two syllables are stressed on the first syllable. In words of three or more syllables, the stress is on the penultimate syllable if this is heavy, otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable, i.e. the third-to-last syllable. In Quenya, heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a cluster of two consonants (ll, ld, mm, ss, etc.). Certain combinations of consonants, e.g. ny, ry, are also regarded as heavy. Medially hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta (not colloquially in Tarquesta) and a vowel before them is held to constitute a metrically long syllable. Quenya has also a secondary accent. The placement of stress and the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse.|$|E
5|$|In his lifetime, J. R. R. Tolkien {{never ceased}} to {{experiment}} on his constructed languages, {{and they were}} subjected to many revisions. Therefore, Quenya had many grammars with substantial differences between the different stages of its development. During the first conceptual stage of early Quenya c. 1910 to c. 1920, the language was called Elfin in English and Eldarissa in Qenya proper. While its development was a continuous process, Quenya underwent {{a number of major}} revisions in its grammar, mostly in conjugation and the pronominal system. The vocabulary, however, was not subject to sudden or extreme change. Tolkien sometimes changed the meaning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> but he almost never discarded it once invented, and he kept on refining its meaning, and countlessly forged new synonyms. Moreover, Elvish etymology was in constant flux. Tolkien delighted in inventing new etymons for his Quenya vocabulary. But after the publication of The Lord of the Rings (finished c. 1949–1950, published in 1954–1955), the grammar rules of Quenya went through very few changes and this version was then defined as late Quenya (c. 1950–1973).|$|E
