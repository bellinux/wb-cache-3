5|$|In 1985, Dallas {{electrician}} and rodeo cowboy Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) {{is diagnosed}} with AIDS and given 30 days to live. He initially refuses {{to accept the}} diagnosis, but remembers having unprotected sex {{with a woman who}} was an intravenous drug user. He is soon ostracized by family and friends and gets fired from his job, believed by family, friends and coworkers to have had homosexual relations, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Dr. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as this is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> determine if the drug is working.|$|E

It {{has been argued that}} efficient recirculation is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be viable. Electrons or ions move through the device without striking a surface, reducing conduction losses. Bussard stressed this; specifically emphasizing that electrons need to move through all cusps of the machine.|$|E

25|$|Large sharks {{species are}} apex predators in their environment, {{and thus have}} little fear of any {{creature}} (other than orcas) with which they cross paths. Like most sophisticated hunters, they are curious when they encounter something unusual in their territories. Lacking any limbs with sensitive digits such as hands or feet, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> explore an object or organism is to bite it; these bites are known as test bites. Generally, shark bites are exploratory, and the animal will swim away after one bite. For example, exploratory bites on surfers {{are thought to be}} caused by the shark mistaking the surfer and surfboard for the shape of prey. Nonetheless, a single bite can grievously injure a human if the animal involved is a powerful predator such as a great white or tiger shark.|$|E
25|$|Realizing {{what the}} Dragon means, Henry leads {{everyone}} {{back to the}} fountain, where he proceeds to wish for his family to be brought back, encouraging Emma, Regina, Gold, and Violet to do the same. Suddenly, the crystal starts to pulsate. Henry then climbs a statue and convinces the citizens of New York City to help them return magic to the world. The portal opens in the Bethesda fountain, and Gold walks through it. Hook, Snow, David, Jekyll and Zelena appear {{in front of the}} others. Regina, Henry, Emma, and Violet see them in the Bethesda fountain as they reunited. Unfortunately, Henry is left saddened that the crowd believed that the rescue was simply an illusion; Emma consoles him, explaining that it's the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> understand it. She was much like them until his near-death experience forced her to believe in magic.|$|E
25|$|Social class {{mobility}} {{could be}} low because of housing inequality. People who live or {{were born in}} the housing inequality, they have more problems to solve instead of making money. And what's more, Their children are less likely to get higher education in order to get into higher class in their futures. It could lower the social class mobility to our self and so does our next generation. The major problem of first generation is about earning money for family because of housing inequality. It's hard to get a loan from bank and lots of bills to pay. They just worry how to survive to tomorrow. But for our children, they deserve a better future, but under housing inequality, they need more time and money to get the same education as who are not suffering from housing inequality. These makes them give up their education easily but this is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get into higher class in the future. Not so many of people can make it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the poem}} Lalla Radha and the Churel, a priest warns the protagonist to not go near the Peepul trees {{because that is}} where the Churel lives and she might take him away and kill him. He still went to the Peepul tree and she called out to him in a sweet tone and seduced him until he went to her. Blinded by his desire, he did not notice that while he lay with her, his body seemed to get frailer until he died in a state of ecstasy. In The Female Element in Indian Culture, it says, “The Churel runs after and seeks to possess every man whom she meets, for, it is said, her carnal {{appetite}} remains unsatisfied in life”. She also possesses girls during dances, causing a trance. According to Persian legend, when travelers saw the tracks of a Churel in the dirt they would try to flee by heading in the opposite direction, but her reversed feet would inevitably lead them right into her grasp. The Patari and Majhwar think that she appears to take her victims to the mountains and the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be freed is if a goat is sacrificed.|$|E

After viewing the footage, they hold a bachelor party where Shawn questions all of the attendees. Shawn talks with Lacey Maxwell (Christine Chatelain), the sister of the groom, who asks him to get her bouquet from a locked cooler, but he can't. Before the wedding, the bouquets are passed out, and Lacey panics when hers isn't there. Lacey reveals she is a magician when she helps to calm down the flower girl. Shawn realizes who stole the ring and killed Manheim, but his realization occurs in the middle of the ceremony. Shawn interrupts the wedding with a [...] "psychic episode", and exposes Lacey to everyone.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down payment on a large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail.|$|E

She was the {{daughter}} of a wealthy cloth merchant, an ugly child who eventually entered into an arranged marriage and bore a daughter, Clara, whom she loved dearly. Clara was indifferent to her mother, though, and became engaged to a Spanish man and moved across the ocean to Spain where she married. Doña María visits her daughter, but when they cannot get along, she returns to Lima. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> communicate comfortably is by letter, and Doña María pours her heart into her writing, which becomes so polished that her letters will be read in schools for hundreds of years after her death.|$|R

5000|$|The Court distinguishes {{this case}} from Londoner v. City and County of Denver, a 1908 {{case in which}} the Court held that {{individual}} taxpayers had a right to a hearing before an individualized benefits tax was assessed. The apparent conflict between the two cases is explained by Justice Holmes's observation that in Londoner, [...] "a relatively small number of persons was concerned, who were exceptionally affected, in each case upon individual grounds..." [...] In contrast, here the taxpayers in Denver are affected equally, and in large numbers, and it would be an impractical impediment to government to afford all of them individual hearings. Instead, [...] "their rights are protected in the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be in a complex society, by their power, immediate or remote, over those who make the rule." [...] In other words, there was no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because the taxpayers of Denver retained the right to organize and vote.|$|R

Innovation {{is one of the most}} important elements concerning higher performance in company efficiency. This methodical definition takes a look at the main benefits of innovation on efficiency and hence on the efficiency and performance on the company as a whole. In this paper the results of the original research are discussed. For this analysis a questionnaire survey was used. Various factors of innovation performance development are being carried out with the help of secondary and finally also primary research in Czech manufacturing companies, as well as, a reflection of a company`s competitiveness and innovative activities from the manager`s point of view. My conclusion is that there are various factors influencing innovation performance of the company. Every company has a certain innovation potential, which should be explored, supported and utilized. All high-performance companies are, and must be, interested in systematic and continuous development of the innovation potential, based on identified factors, since it is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> how <b>they</b> <b>can</b> remain high-performance organizations...|$|R

[...] He acknowledged that, although there had been no restrictions on travel to Bahrain issued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as of two weeks prior to the race, and no objections to travelling to the country by the insurance companies that insure the teams, several teams shared similar reservations about the race going ahead. With the race scheduled to take place one week after the , it was further claimed that teams had been issued with two return tickets — one from Shanghai direct to England, and one from Shanghai to England via Bahrain — in the event of the Bahrain Grand Prix's cancellation. Ecclestone downplayed these comments, claiming that none of the twelve teams had expressed any reservations to him about racing, and adding that any team who failed to race would be in breach of the Concorde Agreement and potentially facing a financial penalty.|$|R
