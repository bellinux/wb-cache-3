The UN began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack <b>or</b> <b>take</b> hostage. More importantly, Gen. Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E

The instructor teaches basic and advanced techniques, ranging from rudder turns to maneuvers such as the tailslide, Lomcevak and Immelmann turn.|$|E

5|$|At this conference, {{which was}} {{organised}} by Britain with American support, Van der Byl {{rejected the idea}} of an interim British presence in Rhodesia during a transition to majority rule, which was identified {{as one of the few}} ways of persuading the Patriotic Front to endorse a settlement. The conference was adjourned by the British foreign minister, Anthony Crosland, on 14 December 1976, and ultimately never reconvened. The nationalist leaders said they would not return to Geneva <b>or</b> <b>take</b> part in any further talks unless immediate black rule were made the only topic for discussion. Soon after, on 7 January 1977, Van der Byl announced the Rhodesian government's rejection of every proposal made in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|During the 17 May 1992 Fairchild air show, Holland {{was again}} the command pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's {{aircraft}} again violated several safety regulations, including several low-altitude, steep turns {{in excess of}} 45° of bank and a high pitch angle climb, estimated at over 60° nose high which Holland finished with a wingover maneuver. The new wing commander, Colonel Michael G. Ruotsala, apparently took no action. One week later, the new DO, Colonel Capotosti, on his own initiative warned Holland that if he violated any more safety regulations, Capotosti would ground him (remove him from flying status). Capotosti did not document his warning to Holland <b>or</b> <b>take</b> {{any other kind of}} formal action.|$|E
5|$|During the game, Quickdraw must {{locate the}} wanted outlaws one by one. Once an outlaw {{has been found}} and shot (shooting the outlaw does not kill him, but only initiates a duel), the game shifts to the first-person {{targeting}} minigame. This time, the player must shoot the rapidly moving outlaw as quickly as possible. The player can either wait for the outlaw to draw, <b>or</b> <b>take</b> the initiative and shoot first, which will make the bandit draw his weapon as well. If the player successfully shoots an outlaw, a bounty is paid (increasing with every round), and a new outlaw enters the town.|$|E

5|$|During the night, Washington {{called a}} council {{of war and}} asked his {{officers}} whether they should stand and fight, attempt to cross the river somewhere, <b>or</b> <b>take</b> the backroads to attack Princeton. Although the idea had already occurred to Washington, he learned from Arthur St. Clair and John Cadwalader that his plan to attack Princeton was indeed possible. Two intelligence collection efforts, both of which came to fruition {{at the end of}} December 1776, supported such a surprise attack. After consulting with his officers, they agreed that the best option was to attack Princeton.|$|E
5|$|Early {{observations}} {{have revealed}} a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, {{but no more}} than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of km per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive specific orbital energy and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, give <b>or</b> <b>take</b> one and perhaps two orders of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|Hess did {{not build}} a power base or develop a coterie of followers.

He lived in a modest house in Munich. Although Hess had less influence than other top NSDAP officials, he was popular with the masses. After the Invasion of Poland and the start of World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second in line to succeed him, after Hermann Göring. Around the same time, Hitler appointed Hess's chief of staff, Martin Bormann, as his personal secretary, a post formerly held by Hess.|$|E

Kinne was questioned again {{on the morning of}} May 30, and Boldizs on May 31.

Kinne's brother Eugene was also questioned on May 31, but declined to answer questions.|$|E
5|$|Japanese radio {{intercepts}} did notice {{an increase}} in both American submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans, however, were not changed: Yamamoto, at sea in , assumed Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo, and did not communicate with him by radio, {{so as not to}} reveal his position. These messages were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons which remain unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans <b>or</b> <b>take</b> additional precautions.|$|E
5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts. The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them <b>or</b> <b>take</b> care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E
