Then the sources <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth that a traveler uses during travel are identified and, finally, the context <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth exchanges are reviewed. The gaps in the literature relating to <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth during travel are discussed with respect to relationships with others and the implications for decision making. A framework offering a broad scope of theory and approaches is then proposed as a means of addressing these gaps and accommodating future research in this field...|$|R

5|$|Although {{membership}} in the Klan was limited to men, Simmons—after losing control of the national organization—attempted to create a parallel white supremacist organization for women.

In 1924, Evans paid Simmons $145,000 for a promise to abandon the latter's claim to Klan leadership.|$|E

Whereas the process of phoneticization is constrained by phonological transformations (nasalization, voicing, de-voicing), the process of semanticization that occurs in word borrowing is abetted by sociocultural processes.

5|$|Among major {{structural}} elements used in poetry are the line, the stanza or verse paragraph, and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as cantos. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations <b>of</b> <b>words</b> and calligraphy. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called poetic forms or poetic modes (see following section), {{as in the}} sonnet or haiku.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion <b>of</b> <b>words</b> as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number <b>of</b> <b>words</b> learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition <b>of</b> <b>words.</b> Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E

5|$|German is the {{official}} and predominant spoken language in Germany.
