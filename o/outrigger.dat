30|$|The optimum {{locations}} of the <b>outriggers</b> to reduce DAS can be determined by an optimization method. Because the floors where the <b>outriggers</b> are installed are given as integer numbers, conventional gradient-based optimization methods cannot be directly used. In this study, a piecewise quadratic interpolation method was used to resolve the integrality requirement posed by the optimum {{locations of}} the <b>outriggers.</b>|$|R

5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the udema carried 14 to 18 {{pairs of}} oars. Rowers {{sat on the}} weather deck {{on either side of}} the main armament with the oar ports placed on a rectangular <b>outrigger</b> which improved their leverage. However, they were positioned {{on either side of the}} centerline battery and could not row under fire; in action, the udema had to rely on its sails for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Rush then {{engaged in}} a series of {{one-on-one}} matches with the scullers William Hickey, the Australian champion, and his brother Richard Hickey. Rush, being unfamiliar with rowing <b>outrigger</b> wager boats, on that occasion failed to win the championship from Hickey, but returned to the Lower Clarence with prize money totalling over £700.|$|E
5|$|The annual Queen Liliʻuokalani <b>Outrigger</b> Canoe Race, {{that follows}} an 18-mile course from Kailua Bay to Honaunau Bay, was {{organized}} in 1972 as an endurance training course for men, {{in preparation for}} the traditional Molokaʻi to Oʻahu canoe races. Women canoe teams were added in 1974. The race is held over Labor Day Weekend each year to coincide with Liliʻuokalani's birthday on September 2.|$|E
30|$|The {{differential}} axial shortenings (DAS) {{in a tall}} building {{should be}} considered in the design phase, and proper measures should be taken to reduce their unfavorable effects. In this study, <b>outriggers,</b> which have been designed to reduce the lateral displacements caused by wind and earthquake loads, were used to reduce DAS. The optimum locations of the <b>outriggers</b> to minimize the maximum DAS were determined by an optimization method. Since the floors where the <b>outriggers</b> were installed were given as integer numbers, a piecewise quadratic interpolation method was newly developed and applied to overcome the integrality requirement of the integer nonlinear programming. With the interpolated function, it was possible to carried out an unconstrained nonlinear optimization using the discrete analysis results from the finite element analysis of the axial shortening. A branch-and-test (BT) was added to complement the discontinuity of the piecewise quadratic interpolation. However, the solutions were not changed after the BT was used; therefore, it can be concluded that the BT is not required, and the piecewise quadratic interpolation method can be used for the integer nonlinear programming. The proposed optimization method stably yielded optimum solutions for a total of 24 cases that were examined with three analysis models, four <b>outriggers,</b> and two schemes for the sectional area of the <b>outriggers.</b> The optimum design results show that the optimum locations of the <b>outriggers</b> were the locations that can reduce the peak DAS. It was also noted that increasing the number of <b>outriggers</b> reduced the maximum DAS in the tall building. However, the maximum DAS was not significantly reduced when the number of the <b>outriggers</b> was greater than 2, even with the constant-area scheme, which linearly increased the total sectional area of the <b>outriggers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first multihull vessels were Austronesian canoes. They {{hollowed}} out logs to make canoes and stabilized them by attaching <b>outriggers</b> {{to prevent them}} from capsizing. This led to the proa, catamaran, and trimaran plus various <b>outriggers</b> throughout the Pacific.|$|R

5|$|A second I-215 {{was built}} to an order from OKB-1 as the I-215D (dooblyor, second prototype), to {{evaluate}} the bicycle or tandem landing gear configuration. It used wider-diameter paired wheels in a tandem arrangement that retracted into the fuselage, along with small <b>outrigger</b> wheels under the engine nacelles which retracted into fairings. The main undercarriage of the I-215D also incorporated a kneeling feature which could increase the incidence of the aircraft by 3° to assist take-off. Trials with this undercarriage arrangement were successful and {{paved the way for}} its use in other Soviet aircraft, including Dr. Brunolf Baade's Aircraft 150, then under development.|$|E
5|$|Daily life in Mau's {{village on}} Satawal {{involved}} harvesting taro and gathering breadfruit and coconut. The Satawalese people also raised chicken and pork and caught fish, their {{primary source of}} protein. A freshwater pond served as bathing facilities. Local materials were used to construct <b>outrigger</b> canoes called proa. The island's isolation helped preserve the lifestyle of the Satawalese people and Mau's role as a navigator. Even {{with the arrival of}} the Germans (1890) and the Japanese (1914) in Micronesia, Satawalese culture remained intact. American missionaries who arrived after World War II built the first church and school on Satawal.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Walker Whiskey Trophy events, a number of Rush's admirers and backers held a banquet in his honour, at which they {{presented}} him with an illuminated testimonial along with a sterling silver tea set, salver, and claret jug, valued at £200. These recognised his excellence as a sportsman, and his admirable qualities as a man. The salver was inscribed with a dedication, and each piece bore an inscribed caricature of Rush at the oars of an <b>outrigger</b> skiff. The silver items {{are now in the}} collection of the Clarence River Historical Society in Grafton, New South Wales.|$|E
30|$|In this study, <b>outriggers,</b> {{which are}} {{horizontal}} structures connecting a building core to distant columns {{to increase the}} lateral stiffness of a tall building, are proposed to reduce DAS. Conventionally, the permanent connection of <b>outriggers</b> to perimeter columns is delayed until {{the completion of the}} structure to avoid the development of shear forces that could be caused by DAS because the <b>outriggers</b> have been conventionally designed to reduce the lateral displacement caused by wind or earthquake loads. Special construction methods, such as delayed joints and adjustment joints with shim plates or oil jacks, have been proposed or used to minimize the impact of DAS during construction (Choi and Joseph 2012; Park et al. 2010). Although the main purpose of the <b>outriggers</b> is to limit the lateral drift of a tall building within an acceptable level (Wu and Li 2003; Hoenderkamp 2008; Lee and Tovar 2014), it is proposed that <b>outriggers</b> can also function as a measure to reduce DAS between core walls and perimeter columns. If the <b>outriggers</b> are designed to reduce DAS and lateral displacement, the additional stresses caused by DAS should be evaluated and considered during the design phase of a tall building.|$|R

50|$|For {{travel in}} the rougher waters of the ocean, dugouts can be fitted with <b>outriggers.</b> One or two smaller logs are mounted {{parallel}} to the main hull by long poles. In the case of two <b>outriggers,</b> one is mounted {{on either side of}} the hull.|$|R
5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the turuma carried 19 pairs (16 in {{the first}} two ships) of oars with four men per oar. Oarsmen rowed sitting on the weather deck, above the gun deck, with the oarports attached to a rectangular <b>outrigger</b> that was designed to improve the leverage. Despite this, turumas performed poorly under oars and were very difficult to move in any kind of contrary wind. In calm weather the average speed with oars was reported as low as half a knot.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} {{tandem landing gear}} layout of the first-generation Harriers, {{although}} each <b>outrigger</b> landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when taxiing. The engine intakes are larger {{than those of the}} first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On the underside of the fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is formed by a composite steel and concrete frame, with various setbacks in its profile, meaning {{the upper floors}} are much smaller in area than lower levels. <b>Outrigger</b> trusses {{at the top of}} the building and at the various setbacks help to stiffen the building's reinforced concrete core against the strong winds prevalent in the area. The base of the building features a small park, for which the tower is named.|$|E

5|$|The first archaeological {{evidence}} for human foraging on Madagascar dates to 2000BC. Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350BC and AD550 by Austronesian peoples arriving on <b>outrigger</b> canoes from Borneo. These were joined around AD 1000 by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa. Other groups continued {{to settle on}} Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more sub-groups of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} <b>outrigger</b> canoes from southern Borneo. Upon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture {{to clear the}} coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of megafauna, including giant lemurs, elephant birds, giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction. By 600AD groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Arab traders first reached the island between the seventh and ninth centuries. A wave of Bantu-speaking migrants from southeastern Africa arrived around 1000AD. They introduced the zebu, a type of long-horned humped cattle, which they kept in large herds.|$|E
5|$|Fruit, {{fish and}} wild pigs provide {{plentiful}} food, {{and at first}} the boys' life on the island is idyllic. They build a shelter and construct a small boat using their only possessions: a broken telescope, an iron-bound oar, and a small axe. Their first contact with other humans comes after several months when they observe two large <b>outrigger</b> canoes in the distance, one pursued by the other. The two groups of Polynesians disembark {{on the beach and}} engage in battle; the victors take fifteen prisoners, and kill and eat one immediately. But when they threaten to kill one of the three women captured, along with two children, the boys intervene to defeat the pursuers, earning them the gratitude of the chief, Tararo. The next morning they prevent another act of cannibalism. The natives leave, and the boys are alone once more.|$|E
50|$|The M816 Medium Wrecker {{is part of}} the M809 {{series of}} 5-ton 6x6 {{military}} trucks. It was made by AM General starting in 1970. It has a revolving hydraulic crane with an extending boom that can extend from 10-18 ft with a maximum lift capacity of 20,000 lb with <b>outriggers</b> and boom jacks to the ground. The boom capacity depends on boom extension and placements of truck <b>outriggers</b> and boom jacks. With boom full out and no <b>outriggers,</b> the capacity is only 3000 lb. The boom elevates to 45 degrees, swings 270.|$|R
50|$|<b>Outriggers</b> may be {{employed}} on certain vessels to reduce rolling. Rolling is reduced {{either by the}} force required to submerge buoyant floats or by hydrodynamic foils. In some cases these <b>outriggers</b> may be of sufficient size to classify the vessel as a trimaran; however on other vessels they may simply {{be referred to as}} stabilizers.|$|R

Also sailing were movie star Laura La Plante and her husband, director William A. Seiter, and, Western Auto founder George Pepperdine, who began a three-month {{tour of the}} Orient with his daughters. On arrival in Honolulu on 10June, City of Honolulu was adorned with flowers and received a welcome from airplanes and a flotilla of <b>outrigger</b> canoes that escorted her into the harbor. After a ten-day stay in the islands, she departed for Los Angeles, returning there on 26June.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier was {{typically}} {{used as a}} ground attack aircraft, though its manoeuvrability also allows it to effectively engage other aircraft at short ranges. The Harrier {{is powered by a}} single Pegasus turbofan engine mounted in the fuselage. The engine is fitted with two air intakes and four vectoring nozzles for directing the thrust generated: two for the bypass flow and two for the jet exhaust. Several small reaction nozzles are also fitted, in the nose, tail and wingtips, for the purpose of balancing during vertical flight. It has two landing gear units on the fuselage and two <b>outrigger</b> landing gear units, one near each wing tip. The Harrier is equipped with four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying a variety of weapons and external fuel tanks.|$|E
5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip <b>outrigger</b> wheels. A notable feature of the landing gear was the ability to pivot the main landing gear up to 20° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during crosswind landings. After {{a trip to a}} hobby shop for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E
