Thus, a large scale investment programme in {{a wide array of}} industries simultaneously is the answer.

Japan's decision to leave the Treaty in the 1930s, {{and the arrival of}} the Second World War, eventually made this limit irrelevant.|$|E

The {{following}} day, many of the mutinous ships abandoned the effort and rejoined loyalist forces in the inner harbor; first the light cruisers {{and most of the}} torpedo boats escaped from the guns of the mutineers, followed by several of the other larger vessels. By late in the day, only the men aboard Sankt Georg and a handful of destroyers and torpedo boats remained in rebellion. Only on the morning of 3 February, after the arrival of the s of the III Division, were the last of the mutineers convinced to surrender.

5|$|This {{measure of}} {{elasticity}} is {{sometimes referred to}} as the own-price elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> for a good, i.e., the elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> with respect to the good's own price, in order to distinguish it from the elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> for that good with respect to the change in the price of some other good, i.e., a complementary or substitute good.

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> {{elasticity}} <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} important in economics. At its most general level the elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> measures the percentage response in demand to a given percentage change in some other variable of interest. For example, we are often interested in the response <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> {{to changes in the}} price of the good concerned price – the own price elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> – but we may also be interested in the response to changes in income – the income elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> – or changes in the prices of other goods – the cross price elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand.</b> In a recent article for the Economic Review, Mark Russell shows how useful the concept <b>of</b> elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> can be for both economists and the business community.

5|$|As a result, {{there were}} a growing range <b>of</b> <b>demands</b> on the mounted police, and they {{struggled}} {{to cope with the}} changes. The rising population drove an increase in the criminal cases tackled by the force: less than 1,000 were investigated in 1900, but within four years the number of cases had risen to over 4,000. There was controversy around what role the mounted police should play in the new towns, and the force became concerned that these were pulling in police manpower, {{at the expense of the}} wider, less populated areas of the Prairies, where the patrolling system had already had to be cut back. A special railway branch was briefly established in 1888, using undercover officers positioned along the railway line to gather intelligence, and plans were put forward, but not enacted, to create a larger detective branch. Attempts were made to enforce the prostitution laws in the new towns – previously these had been largely ignored – with the police informally regulating the local sex industries.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Peace of Nisibis, Diocletian and Galerius returned to Syrian Antioch. At some time in 299, the emperors took part in a ceremony of sacrifice and divination in an attempt to predict the future. The haruspices were unable to read the entrails of the sacrificed animals and blamed Christians in the Imperial household. The emperors ordered all members of the court to perform a sacrifice to purify the palace. The emperors sent letters to the military command, demanding the entire army perform the required sacrifices or face discharge. Diocletian was conservative in matters of religion, a man faithful to the traditional Roman pantheon and understanding <b>of</b> <b>demands</b> for religious purification, but Eusebius, Lactantius and Constantine state that it was Galerius, not Diocletian, who was the prime supporter of the purge, and its greatest beneficiary. Galerius, even more devoted and passionate than Diocletian, saw political advantage in the politics of persecution. He was willing to break with a government policy of inaction on the issue.|$|E

40|$|The income {{elasticity}} <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> {{for a product}} measures the responsiveness <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> for the product {{to a change in}} disposable (after tax) income. To get the measure, one divides the percentage change in demand for the product by the percentage change in income. For example, if the demand for butter fell by 2 percent when incomes rose by 5 percent, the {{income elasticity}} <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> for butter is – 0. 4 percent. If demand for butter went up by 5 percent, the income elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> would be 0. 4. If instead it went up by 2 percent, the income elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> is 1.

5|$|The 2nd King's {{had been}} on the Indian subcontinent since 1877 and had fought in the Second Afghan War. The Third Burmese War punctuated the battalion's {{overseas}} service in the 1880s. Intent on deposing Upper Burma's King Thibaw and imposing imperial rule, Britain issued an ultimatum consisting <b>of</b> <b>demands</b> that were rejected as anticipated. The invasion began in November 1885 {{in the form of the}} Burma Field Force, which progressed up the Irrawaddy River via transports, enabling the rapid capture of frontier forts and the capital Mandalay. After the capital's seizure, the battalion provided an escort that oversaw the exile of Thibaw. A guerrilla campaign against the British followed the completion of Upper Burma's annexation on 1 January 1886, lasting for at least five years. For more than a year, the King's operated in small groups pursuing guerrillas in the Burmese jungle. Casualties numbered 12 officers and 256 men by the time the battalion had returned to India. In early 1900 the 2nd Battalion Liverpool Regiment was stationed at Gibraltar.|$|E
