5|$|The motion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> {{relative}} to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star,</b> {{as well as the}} structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. The components of motion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> consist of the radial velocity toward or away from the Sun, and the traverse angular movement, which is called its proper motion.|$|E
5|$|If a star {{displays}} magnetic {{surface activity}} such as starspots, then these features can be tracked {{to estimate the}} rotation rate. However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes {{over the course of}} their life span, so differential rotation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> can produce varying measurements. Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots has shown that these features can actually vary the rotation rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star,</b> as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star.|$|E
5|$|The {{luminosity}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> is {{the amount}} of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.|$|E

5|$|A dwarf {{planet is}} a planetary-mass object that {{is neither a}} planet nor a natural satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star,</b> and is massive enough for its gravity to crush it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), but has not cleared the {{neighborhood}} of other material around its orbit.|$|E
5|$|For {{at least}} a portion of its life, a star shines due to {{thermonuclear}} fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near {{the end of its}} life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star,</b> including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.|$|E

Thus, it is invisible to the unaided eye.|$|E
5|$|Most main-sequence {{stars with}} a {{spectral}} class between O5 and F5 {{have been found}} to rotate rapidly. For stars in this range, the measured rotation velocity increases with mass. This increase in rotation peaks among young, massive B-class stars. As the expected life span <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> decreases with increasing mass, this can be explained as a decline in rotational velocity with age.|$|E

5|$|Remote {{observation}} of electrons requires detection of their radiated energy. For example, in high-energy environments {{such as the}} corona <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star,</b> free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to Bremsstrahlung radiation. Electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation, which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using radio telescopes.|$|E

5|$|The {{break-up}} velocity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> is {{an expression}} {{that is used to}} describe the case where the centrifugal force at the equator is equal to the gravitational force. For a star to be stable the rotational velocity must be below this value.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of the radius and the mass <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite {{is the case for}} degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> {{interacts with the}} stellar wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E
