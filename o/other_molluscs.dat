5|$|Like most <b>other</b> <b>molluscs,</b> the {{excretory}} {{organs of}} bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, and <b>other</b> <b>molluscs</b> such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and}} other cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} types of shallow-water coral reef, {{including}} fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls; most occur in tropical and subtropical seas. They are very slow-growing, adding perhaps one centimetre (0.4in) in height each year. The Great Barrier Reef {{is thought to have}} been laid down about two million years ago. Over time, corals fragment and die, sand and rubble accumulates between the corals, and the shells of clams and <b>other</b> <b>molluscs</b> decay to form a gradually evolving calcium carbonate structure. Coral reefs are extremely diverse marine ecosystems hosting over 4,000 species of fish, massive numbers of cnidarians, molluscs, crustaceans, and many other animals.|$|E

5|$|Morphological {{analyses}} tend {{to recover}} a conchiferan clade that receives less support from molecular analyses, although these results {{also lead to}} unexpected paraphylies, for instance scattering the bivalves throughout all <b>other</b> <b>mollusc</b> groups.|$|R
50|$|The {{outer layer}} of pearls {{and the inside}} layer of pearl oyster and {{freshwater}} pearl mussel shells are made of nacre. <b>Other</b> <b>mollusc</b> families that have a nacreous inner shell layer include marine gastropods such as the Haliotidae, the Trochidae and the Turbinidae.|$|R
5|$|Octopuses {{and other}} coleoid {{cephalopods}} {{are capable of}} greater RNA editing (which involves changes to the nucleic acid sequence of the primary transcript of RNA molecules) than any other organisms. Editing is concentrated in the nervous system and affects proteins involved in neural excitability and neuronal morphology. More than 60% of RNA transcripts for coleoid brains are recoded by editing, compared to less than 1% for a human or fruit fly. Coleoids rely mostly on ADAR enzymes for RNA editing, which requires large double-stranded RNA structures to flank to the editing sites. Both the structures and editing sites are conserved in the coleoid genome and the mutation rates for the sites are severely hampered. Hence, greater transcriptome plasticity has come {{as the cost of}} slower genome evolution. High levels of RNA editing {{do not appear to be}} present in more basal cephalopods or <b>other</b> <b>molluscs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most <b>other</b> <b>molluscs.</b> The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E
5|$|The {{underside}} {{consists of}} a muscular foot, which has adapted to different purposes in different classes. The foot carries a pair of statocysts, which act as balance sensors. In gastropods, it secretes mucus as a lubricant to aid movement. In forms having only a top shell, such as limpets, the foot acts as a sucker attaching the animal to a hard surface, and the vertical muscles clamp the shell down over it; in <b>other</b> <b>molluscs,</b> the vertical muscles pull the foot and other exposed soft parts into the shell. In bivalves, the foot is adapted for burrowing into the sediment; in cephalopods it is used for jet propulsion, and the tentacles and arms are derived from the foot.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} <b>other</b> aquatic <b>molluscs</b> have similar {{responses}} to attack, including the gastropod clade known as sea hares.|$|R
5000|$|The {{presence}} of a single shell prompts comparisons to the cephalopod Nautilus, but besides its bilateral symmetry and direction of coiling, {{there is not a}} clear equivalence; Nautilus shell is notably different in the possession of septa (and thus a siphuncle). It bears a similar degree of similarity to most <b>other</b> <b>mollusc</b> groups, leading to speculation that it may reflect a relatively unchanged ancestral mollusc. [...] The shell itself is aragonitic, consisting mainly of a prismatic layer, lined with nacre.|$|R
50|$|Aplacophora is a {{monophyletic}} {{group of}} small, deep-water, exclusively benthic, marine molluscs {{found in all}} oceans of the world. All known modern forms are shell-less: only some extinct primitive forms possessed valves. The group comprises the two clades Solenogastres (Neomeniomorpha) and Caudofoveata (Chaetodermomorpha), which between them contain 28 families and about 320 species. The aplacophorans are traditionally considered ancestral to the <b>other</b> <b>mollusc</b> classes. However, {{the relationship between the}} two aplacophoran groups and to the other molluscan classes and to each other is as yet unclear.|$|R
25|$|Pearl oysters are not {{closely related}} to true oysters, being members of a {{distinct}} family, the feathered oysters (Pteriidae). Both cultured pearls and natural pearls can be extracted from pearl oysters, though <b>other</b> <b>molluscs,</b> such as the freshwater mussels, also yield pearls of commercial value.|$|E
25|$|Predatory marine snails {{such as the}} Naticidae use the radula plus an acidic {{secretion}} to bore {{through the}} shell of <b>other</b> <b>molluscs.</b> Other predatory marine snails, such as the Conidae, use a specialized radula tooth as a poisoned harpoon. Predatory pulmonate land slugs, such as the ghost slug, use elongated razor-sharp teeth on the radula to seize and devour earthworms. Predatory cephalopods, such as squid, use the radula for cutting prey.|$|E
25|$|Cephalopod eggs span a large {{range of}} sizes, from 1 to 30mm in diameter. The fertilised ovum {{initially}} divides {{to produce a}} disc of germinal cells at one pole, with the yolk remaining at the opposite pole. The germinal disc grows to envelop and eventually absorb the yolk, forming the embryo. The tentacles and arms first appear at the hind part of the body, where the foot would be in <b>other</b> <b>molluscs,</b> and only later migrate towards the head.|$|E
50|$|Mummichogs are omnivorous. Analyses {{of their}} stomach {{contents}} have found diatoms, amphipods and <b>other</b> crustaceans, <b>molluscs,</b> fish eggs (including their own species), very small fish, insect larvae, {{and bits of}} eelgrass.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-nine {{species of}} Pectinoidea (12 Propeamussiidae, 1 Entoliidae, 16 Pectinidae) are {{recorded}} from the Austral Islands, the southernmost archipelago of French Polynesia. One genus (Pectinidae: Lamellipecten n. gen.) and five species (Propeamussiidae: Parvamussium australanum n. sp., Cyclochlamys australensis n. sp., Cyclopecten ambiguus n. sp.; Pectinidae: Lamellipecten aduncus n. gen., n. sp., Mimachlamys erycina n. sp.) {{are new to}} science, and most others are new records for the archipelago. The near-shore fauna of Rapa has 12 species of Pectinidae, and half of these have narrow-range distributions. Such a remarkably high level of marine endemism is shared by <b>other</b> <b>mollusc</b> taxa on Rapa...|$|R
40|$|We {{analysed}} ontogenetic shape {{change in}} the planorbid limpet Ancylus fluviatilis (Muller, 1774) in two rivers in Southern Italy. We developed a new method to discriminate among different cohorts in Ancylus, based on principal component analysis. The method is useful when shape change during growth is allometric, as in our study model. We discovered that bivoltinism occurs in Ancylus in Southern Italy, contrary to previous accounts, which invariably describe A. fluviatilis as a semelparous and univoltine species, although acknowledging difficulty in discriminating among cohorts. The methods presented here may potentially help research in reproductive traits in many <b>other</b> <b>mollusc</b> populations where shape change during ontogeny is demonstrated to be allometric...|$|R
2500|$|Unlike most <b>other</b> <b>molluscs,</b> {{cephalopods}} do {{not have}} a morphologically distinct larval stage. [...] Instead the juveniles are known as paralarvae. [...] They quickly learn how to hunt, using encounters with prey to refine their strategies.|$|E
2500|$|Cephalopods {{exchange}} gases {{with the}} seawater by forcing water through their gills, which {{are attached to}} the roof of the organism. [...] Water enters the mantle cavity {{on the outside of the}} gills, and the entrance of the mantle cavity closes. [...] When the mantle contracts, water is forced through the gills, which lie between the mantle cavity and the funnel. [...] The water's expulsion through the funnel can be used to power jet propulsion. The gills, which are much more efficient than those of <b>other</b> <b>molluscs,</b> {{are attached to the}} ventral surface of the mantle cavity.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to {{the case}} in most <b>other</b> <b>molluscs,</b> the blood of ram's-horn snails {{contains}} hemoglobin.As a result, these animals are able to breathe oxygen more efficiently than <b>other</b> <b>molluscs.</b> The presence of this substance gives the body a reddish colour. This is especially apparent in albino animals.|$|E
40|$|National Basic Research Program of China [2010 CB 126403]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in the Xiamen University [IRT 0941]; Earmarked Fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System [CARS- 48]; Programme of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities [B 07034]In this study, we cloned a {{full-length}} cDNA encoding vitellogenin (Vg) in the Fujian oyster Crassostrea angulata. The complete Vg cDNA consists of 5160 nucleotides {{with a long}} open reading frame encoding 1641 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence shared high similarity with the Vgs of <b>other</b> <b>mollusc,</b> fish, nematode and arthropod species, particularly in the N-terminal region. We analyzed the spatiotemporal expression of caVg transcripts by Real-time Quantitative PCR. In common with <b>other</b> <b>mollusc</b> Vgs, the caVg gene was expressed primarily in the ovary, and the levels were 348 and 177 times higher in maturation and ripeness stages (P < 0. 01), respectively, than in the partially spent stage. There was negligible expression in male oysters. In situ hybridization analysis further localized caVg mRNA to the follicle cells (also named auxiliary cells) surrounding the oocytes in the ovary. Moreover, in vivo waterborne exposure experiments in early gametogenesis oysters showed that estradiol- 17 beta (E- 2) administration resulted in {{a significant increase in}} caVg mRNA expression. We conclude that caVg is synthesized in the follicle cell surrounding the vitellogenic oocyte in C. angulata, and directly passed to oocytes through the extracellular space without mediation through hemolymph. Also, we hypothesize that this process is mediated by E- 2 in a dose dependent. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

2500|$|Echinostoma {{have three}} hosts {{in their life}} cycle: a first {{intermediate}} host, a second intermediate host and a definitive host. Snail species such as Lymnaea spp. are common intermediate hosts for Echinostoma, although fish and <b>other</b> bivalve <b>molluscs</b> can be also be intermediate hosts for these parasites.|$|R
50|$|Mulinia lateralis is {{a filter}} feeder. The diet is mainly {{bacteria}} or other planktonic material. Like <b>other</b> bivalve <b>molluscs,</b> the animal raises its siphons {{to the surface}} of the sediment, draws water in though one and expels it through the other, having filtered out nutrient particles in the gills.|$|R
50|$|The Rare-spined Murex is {{an active}} predator, mainly feeding on <b>other</b> <b>molluscs</b> and barnacles.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{indication that}} whale carcasses could host specialized animal communities occurred in 1854 {{when a new}} mussel species was extracted from a piece of floating whale blubber. By the 1960s, deep sea trawlers unintentionally recovered <b>other</b> new <b>mollusc</b> species including limpets (named Osteopelta) attached to whale bones.|$|R
50|$|Urastoma cyprinae is {{believed}} to feed on the mucus secreted by its host and its presence alters the protease composition of gills in C. virginica. Urastoma cyprinae is negatively phototatic and is more attracted to oysters when compared to <b>other</b> <b>mollusc</b> species such as mussels and clams. Urastoma cyprinae attaches its anterior end to gill filaments, presumably in a feeding posture, and arches its body back and forth, wagging its posterior end, which bears the terminal orogenital pore, within the mucus that flows over the gills. Ingestion of foods {{is likely to be}} driven by the sphincters on the orogenital atrium. Urastoma cyprinae exhibits a marked seasonal pattern, with the highest levels of infection occurring during the summer and autumn, coinciding with the highest abundance of juvenile worms in the gills, and the lowest in winter.|$|R
50|$|In {{this way}} it secures its food, usually aquatic {{invertebrates}} including caddis worms and other aquatic insect larvae, beetles, Limnaea, Ancylus and <b>other</b> freshwater <b>molluscs,</b> and also fish and small amphibians.
