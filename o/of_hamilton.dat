5000|$|There now arose {{controversy}} as to {{the succession}} of the title. In 1777 it was incorrectly assumed by Captain William <b>Hamilton,</b> the great-great-great-great-grandson <b>of</b> John <b>Hamilton</b> <b>of</b> Coltness, younger son <b>of</b> John <b>Hamilton</b> <b>of</b> Udston, whose other son James Hamilton was the grandfather of the second Lord, and whose grandfather John Hamilton was {{the brother of the}} aforementioned Claude <b>Hamilton,</b> grandfather <b>of</b> the first Lord Belhaven and Stenton. William voted at the Election of Scottish Peers in 1790. However, it was resolved by the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords in 1793 that this vote was not valid. The title was instead determined in favour <b>of</b> William <b>Hamilton,</b> the seventh Lord. He was the son <b>of</b> Robert <b>Hamilton</b> <b>of</b> Wishaw (who was adjudged de jure sixth Lord), grandson <b>of</b> Robert <b>Hamilton,</b> [...] "Younger <b>of</b> Wishaw", son <b>of</b> Robert <b>Hamilton,</b> 3rd <b>of</b> Wishaw, son <b>of</b> William <b>Hamilton,</b> 1st <b>of</b> Wishaw, son <b>of</b> John <b>Hamilton</b> <b>of</b> Udston, grandson <b>of</b> John <b>Hamilton,</b> brother <b>of</b> the aforesaid Claude <b>Hamilton,</b> grandfather <b>of</b> the first Lord.|$|R
