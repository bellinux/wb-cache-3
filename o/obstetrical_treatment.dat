40|$|Although {{substantial}} {{research has}} been done showing how alienation (which in Ollman's terms means that "an essential tie has been cut in the middle") manifests itself in the domain of human labor, little has been done to discover how similar processes might operate in other domains. I examine women's images of their bodies while they are pregnant, using Lakoff and Johnson's method of looking for metaphors that are presupposed in our ordinary language. I uncover several central images, all of which display a marked sense of separation of self from the parts of the body, and a passive stance in which events are described as happening to rather than being brought about by the speaker. Turning to written texts, I find that the literature on childbirth (from opposite ends of the spectrum [...] popular literature advocating prepared childbirth on one end and obstetrical texts for medical students on the other) holds as assumption in common: that the uterus is an involuntary muscle. This is so despite evidence to the contrary cited in the texts themselves. I explore the implications of this imagery for <b>obstetrical</b> <b>treatment</b> of 'uterine inertia' and show the similarity between this imagery and ideas about women's physiology that were current in the 19 th century. ...|$|E
40|$|The Retro Placental Hematoma (RPH) or placental {{abruption}} untimely normally inserted paroxysmal is {{an accident}} that threatens maternal and fetal prognosis. It is a major emergency obstetric pathology and remains the second leading cause of maternal mortality after postpartum haemorrhage. It is actually very difficult to have an accurate evaluation {{the frequency of the}} HRP because it requires a complete table including Pathologists; or simple macroscopic or microscopic findings; or purely clinical diagnosis for some. Its occurrence requires appropriate resuscitation and adapted care to improve the prognosis. We report our study of 49 cases the HRP hospitalized in Obstetrics and Gynecology of Instruction Military Hospital Mohamed V in Rabat, diagnosed on a suggestive clinical picture and the presence of hematoma after examining the issue. This is a descriptive and comparative retrospective study over a period of one year. This study compared two groups: with HRP feotale death in utero and HRP without fetal death in utero. This study aims to evaluate neonatal mortality and maternal morbidity related to RPH and therapeutic modalities. This pathology formerly known pathology multiparous tends to reach more and more heifer. The important blood loss and delay the expulsion worse prognosis causing severe maternal morbidity hence the need to expand the indications for cesarean of retro placental hematoma regardless of the fetal state. Our study aims to contribute to reduce mortality and morbidity Fetomaternal by improving our work is stepping up efforts for a rapid decision-making, and we must educate what especially pregnant women of the risk factors to see from the beginning of symptoms. The pregnancy monitoring, early diagnosis of RPH, an <b>obstetrical</b> <b>treatment</b> adequate, and a resuscitation well driving can improve the prognosis of this disease...|$|E

40|$|Background: Balloon bionic midwifery {{has been}} applied in {{clinical}} obstetrics in China for 10 years, although played a certain role in controlling and {{improving the quality of}} obstetrics and caesarean section rate, but some questions have not been resolved. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the efficacy and safety of airbag midwifery. Materials and Methods: Primiparas (2410 cases) with various medical conditions were randomly divided into airbag and control groups undergoing the same <b>obstetrical</b> <b>treatments,</b> but airbag midwifery as a birthing option was chosen twice when the cervix was dilated to 2 - 4 cm during labor. Results: The duration of the first and second stages, as well as the total delivery process, of the airbag group was shorter than that for the controls. The natural delivery rate of the airbag group was higher than that of the control group. The forcep delivery rate, cesarean section rate, amount of vaginal bleeding within 2 h after delivery, rate of postpartum hemorrhage, fetal distress, and pitocin use in the airbag group were all lower than those in the control group. No significant difference in the rate of maternal and fetal complications was observed in the two groups. The bionic airbag midwifery approach did not contribute to the incidence rate of urine retention, leukocyte count, neutrophil proportion, and level of creactive protein and IL- 6 24 h after delivery. Conclusion: Airbag midwifery skill is a simple, effective, and safe procedure...|$|R
40|$|Symptomatic and {{asymptomatic}} bacteriuria {{is common}} in pregnant women. A history of previous urinary tract infections and low socioeconomic status are risk factors for bacteriuria in pregnancy. Escherichia coli {{is the most common}} aetiologic agent in both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection and quantitative culture is the gold standard for diagnosis. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria has been shown to reduce the rate of pyelonephritis in pregnancy and therefore screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria has become a standard of <b>obstetrical</b> care. Antibiotic <b>treatment</b> of asymptomatic bacteriuria is associated with a decrease in the incidence of low birth weight, but the methodological quality of the studies limits the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn. Debate exists in the literature as to whether treated pyelonephritis is associated with adverse fetal outcomes. There is no clear consensus in the literature on antibiotic choice or duration of therapy for infection. With increasing antibiotic resistance, consideration of local resistance rates is necessary when choosing therapy...|$|R
40|$|Trans{{catheter}} Arterial Embolization (TAE) is {{a method}} in which a catheter is inserted into an artery under fluoroscopy guidance. By using material that creates a thrombus, inserted through the catheter, the artery can be occluded and the bleeding stopped. Endoscopy is the treatment of choice in upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, but 10 % to 30 % of patients rebleed and needs other treatment options. Post Partum Hemorrhage (PPH) may evolve rapidly and can become life threatening. <b>Obstetrical</b> <b>treatment</b> will manage most cases, {{but in some cases}} emergency surgery is needed and in the worst case hysterectomy. The primary aim of this thesis was to evaluate the clinical usefulness, improve the TAE technique and compare the outcome of TAE with surgery used as “salvage therapy” in patients with upper GI bleeding. Evaluate TAE technique and the long-term effect on the menstrual cycle and fertility in severe PPH. To evaluate the clinical usefulness 13 patients were treated with TAE after endoscopic treatment failure and 5 were treated for recurrent hemorrhage after emergency surgery. The clinical outcome and mortality rate of 40 patients treated with TAE was compared with 51 patients treated with surgery of upper GI bleedings. In 13 patients the ulcer was marked with placement of a metallic clip at endoscopy to be able to locate the exact site of the bleeding ulcer during the TAE procedure. A retrospective study of 20 patients with severe PPH treated with bilateral TAE of the uterine artery was performed. TAE was found to be effective and an alternative to emergency surgery for control of massive upper GI bleeding. The 30 -day mortality was lower in the TAE group (3 %) compared to the surgical group (14 %). By marking the bleeding ulcer at endoscopy using a metallic clip the site of bleeding could be identified on angiography without extravasation of contrast media. No major impact on fertility or menstruation cycle was found in patients treated with TAE in PPH. TAE in PPH is safe and have no major long-term side effect. By using TAE in PPH hysterectomy can be avoided...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to examine the}} predisposing factors, the development, the causes and the {{treatment}} of dystocia in bitches. The investigation is based on 698 cases, treated in the veterinary faculty for obstetrics and reproductional disorders of the Hum-boldt Universität zu Berlin and the veterinary hospital for reproduction at the Freie Uni-versität Berlin. Of the patients treated during labour, 98. 3 % were cured. 0. 3 % of the nonsurgically treated bitches, 3. 5 % of the caesarian section with ovariohysterectomy and caesarian section with hysterotomy bitches, did not survive the surgery. The most common cause of death was liverdamage. The percentage of whelps born alive following nonsurgical treatment (80. 5 %) is much higher than the percentage of whelps born alive following surgical treatment. Within the range of non-surgical treatment, combining contraktion medication with an intrapartum spasmolytic (92. 2 %) of whelps per litter. An oxytocin treatment combined with manual obstetrical aid achieved the worst survival rate of whelps per litter, with 65, 4 %. If the labour requires manual support, it seems to be advisable to give intrapartum spasmolytics which have positive influence on complications in labour. 76. 9 % of the whelps survived a caesarian section with hysterotomy. The prognosis for a survival of a caesarian section with ovariohysterectomy is at 64. 0 % rather poor. In gen-eral the medical preparturitional treatment did not have a negative influence on the life expectancy of the whelps. With a percentage of 41. 0 %, the miniature breeds are over represented in comparsion to other breeds. The explanation for this is that the possibility of dystocia is much higher in small breeds. The average age of the obstetrically treated bitches was 4. 4 years. The average age of patients in relation to the causes of dystocia are higher in the following: weak contrac-tions (maternal) 4. 5 years and single whelps (foetal) 5. 2 years. It was noticeable that the higher the number of birth per bitch, the lower the chance of dystocia. 41. 4 % of the patients needing <b>obstetrical</b> <b>treatment</b> were bearing their first litter. 63. 1 days were established to be the average of gestation period. Singel whelps litters were carried longer (64. 0 days) than litters with 2 to 6 whelps (62. 3 % days) and litters with more than 6 whelps (62. 7 days). The length of labour before admission into the clinic was an average of 7. 7 hours. 42. 3 % of bitches were between 2 to 8 hours into labour when they entered hospital. 15. 8 % of cases where diagnosed with a delayed birth and 12. 8 % with an extremely delayed birth. 25. 6 % of the patients showed no signs of labour. 3. 4 % were brought to the hospital at the beginning (1 to 2 hours) of the labour. In this analysis the maternal dystocia (57. 6 %) outnumbers the foetal dystocia (42. 4 %). The most common cause of dystocia was uterine inertia (49. 7 %), followed by single whelps litters (16. 0 %) and positional abnormalities (12. 2 %). The whelps had the best chances of survival when the cause was uterine inertia (79. 0 %). However, in single whelp litters the chances of survival are only 50. 0 %. Labour ended successfully with non-surgical treatment in 260 bitches (37. 3 %) of all breeds. 60. 9 % of theses bitches were treated with a combination of contraction medica-tion and a intrapartum spasmolytic, with and without manual aid. The best result was achieved in maternal dystocia with non-surgical treatment (75. 5 %). In foetal dystocia, medical treatment played a minor role. Only single whelp litters and extremely large litters reacted well to this form of therapy. The need here of manual help during non-surgical treatment increased. Due to dystocia, 437 bitches or 62. 7 % of all dogs needed surgery. In 240 animals (54. 9 %) a conventional caesarian was necessary and in 197 animals (45. 1 %) a radical caesarian was necessary. It is to be mentioned, that the caesarian delivery played a cru-cial role in combating foetal dystocia. 72. 3 % of the birth complications due to foetal dys-tocia could only be managed with surgery. In maternal dystocia it where only 55. 7 %. Compared to maternal dystocia in cases of foetal dystocia, the percentage of radical cae-sarian is higher. Foetal dystocia is difficult to treat with medication. Regardless of the type of dystocia and its treatment, the more complications a patient has, the less likely the chances of survival for the whelps. The best chances of survival after maternal dystocia were achieved with non-surgical treatment and after foetal dystocia with conventional caesarian section, regardless of the number of complications...|$|E

Adverse <b>obstetrical</b> {{outcomes}} after <b>treatment</b> of precancerous cervical lesions: a Belgian multicentre study. BJOG 2012; 119 : 1247 - 1255. Objective To {{assess the impact}} of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) treatment on the risk of (spontaneous) preterm delivery (PD) and small for gestational age (SGA) at birth. Design A multicentre cohort study. Setting Maternity wards of four academic hospitals in Belgium. Population Ninety-seven exposed pregnant women (with a CIN treatment history) and 194 nonexposed pregnant women (without a history of CIN treatment). Methods A questionnaire and check of obstetrical files included socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors for PD, obstetrical history for all women and characteristics of the CIN treatment for exposed women. Pregnancy outcomes were recorded after delivery. The influence of previous treatment of CIN on pregnancy outcomes, adjusted for confounding variables, was assessed by Cox regression and lifetables (for the outcome gestational age at birth) and by logistic regression (for the outcomes PD and SGA at birth). Main outcome measures Occurrence of PD and SGA at birth. Results Seventy-nine per cent {{of the women in the}} database were multiparous; 16. 3 % of women with a previous excisional treatment spontaneously delivered preterm, compared with 8. 1 % of unexposed women [odds ratio (OR), 2. 19; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 97 - 4. 99]. When adjusting for confounding factors (ethnicity, HIV status, education, age, smoking and parity), the OR for PD was 2. 33 (95 % CI, 0. 99 - 5. 49). Excisional treatment did not have an impact on SGA at birth (OR, 0. 94; 95 % CI, 0. 41 - 2. 15). The depth of the cone was > 10 mm in 63. 5 % of the documented cases. Large cones, more than 10 mm deep, were associated with a significantly increased risk of PD (adjusted OR, 4. 55; 95 % CI, 1. 32 - 15. 65) compared with untreated women, whereas smaller cones (≤ 10 mm) were not significantly associated with PD (OR, 2. 77; 95 % CI, 0. 28 - 27. 59). The associations seen for PD with respect to the cone size did not hold for SGA at birth. Conclusions There was an increased risk of (spontaneous) PD after excision of CIN, in particular when the cone depth exceeded 10 mm. © © 2012 The Authors BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology © 2012 RCOG.
