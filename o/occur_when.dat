5|$|Acute leukemias of {{ambiguous}} lineage (also {{known as}} mixed phenotype or biphenotypic acute leukemia) <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the leukemic cells {{can not be}} classified as either myeloid or lymphoid cells, or where both types of cells are present.|$|E
5|$|In the home, {{accidents}} <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> hypochlorite bleach solutions {{come into}} contact with certain acidic drain-cleaners to produce chlorine gas. Hypochlorite bleach (a popular laundry additive) combined with ammonia (another popular laundry additive) produces chloramines, another toxic group of chemicals.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people suffer}} from {{allergic}} reactions after handling onions. Symptoms can include contact dermatitis, intense itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchial asthma, sweating, and anaphylaxis. Allergic reactions may not <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> eating cooked onions, possibly {{due to the}} denaturing of the proteins from cooking.|$|E
30|$|New call {{blocking}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> {{there are no}} enough resources to carry {{the service of a}} certain type of user in the system. Generally, for PUs, new {{call blocking}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> all N resources are being used by PUs. New call blocking for SUs <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the N[*]+[*]R resources are being used, while new call blocking for RUs <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the K resources of the RS sub-network are being occupied either by SUs or RUs.|$|R
25|$|A {{positive}} correct outcome <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> convicting {{a guilty}} person. A negative correct outcome <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> letting an innocent person go free.|$|R

5|$|The episode {{marked the}} first {{prominent}} appearance {{of more than one}} Observer, and follows the events that <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> one of them saves a girl from boarding a soon-to-be crashing plane. It featured two new guest stars, Peter Woodward and Eugene Lipinski.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{effects of a}} tropical cyclone <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> they cross coastlines, making landfall then it destroys ships and lives.|$|E
5|$|A tie can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> {{the scores}} of both teams are equal at the {{conclusion}} of play, provided that the side batting last has completed their innings. Only two matches have ended in a tie in Test cricket history, neither of which involved Sri Lanka.|$|E
5000|$|Single-author writing <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> {{one team}} member writes as a {{representative}} for the entire team. Single-author writing usually <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the writing task is simple.|$|R
25|$|A typeI error <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> convicting an {{innocent}} person (a miscarriage of justice). A typeII error <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> letting a guilty person go free (an error of impunity).|$|R
2500|$|Coexistence between {{competitors}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> [...] and [...] We {{can translate}} this as coexistence <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> {{the effect of}} each species on itself is greater {{the effect of the}} competitor.|$|R
5|$|Angular motions (or rotary motions) <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> {{an object}} is around another object {{increasing}} or decreasing the angle. The {{different parts of}} the object do not move the same distance. Examples include a movement of the knee, where the lower leg changes angle compared to the femur, or movements of the ankle.|$|E
5|$|Collisions <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> two galaxies pass {{directly}} through {{each other and}} have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering star formation. A collision can severely distort {{the shape of the}} galaxies, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.|$|E
5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal. Rebound symptoms are {{the return of the}} symptoms for which the patient was treated but worse than before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E

50|$|Jealousy is {{different}} from envy and rivalry. Envy <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> people want something valuable that someone else has. Rivalry <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> two people are competing for something that neither person has.|$|R
5|$|Every element has {{one or more}} {{isotopes}} {{that have}} unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances {{on the order of}} 1fm.|$|E
5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal. However, an alternate approach can be employed that makes use of gravitational microlensing events. These <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> a massive object passes {{in front of the}} more distant star and functions like a lens, briefly magnifying the image. The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{recombination}} is {{the process}} by which a strand of DNA is broken and then joined {{to the end of a}} different DNA molecule. This can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of viral evolution have shown that recombination has been rampant in the species studied. Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{transplant}} rejection <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> {{the host}} rejects the graft, GvHD <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the graft rejects the host. The underlying principle (alloimmunity) is the same, but {{the details and}} course may differ.|$|R
50|$|Pleiotropy {{can arise}} from several {{distinct}} but potentially overlapping mechanisms, such as molecular gene pleiotropy, developmental pleiotropy, and selectional pleiotropy. Molecular gene pleiotropy <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the gene product interacts with multiple other proteins or catalyzes multiple reactions. Developmental pleiotropy <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> mutations have multiple {{effects on the}} resulting phenotype. Selectional pleiotropy <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the resulting phenotype has multiple effects on fitness (perhaps depending on age, gender, etc.).|$|R

5|$|In those {{receiving}} heparin {{through an}} intravenous infusion, {{a complex of}} symptoms ("systemic reaction") may <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the infusion is started. These include fever, chills, high blood pressure, a fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and chest pain. This happens in {{about a quarter of}} people with HIT. Others may develop a skin rash consisting of red spots.|$|E
5|$|Large {{jumps in}} the {{successive}} molar ionization energies <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> removing an electron from a noble gas (complete electron shell) configuration. For magnesium again, {{the first two}} molar ionization energies of magnesium given above correspond to removing the two 3s electrons, and the third ionization energy is a much larger 7730kJ/mol, {{for the removal of}} a 2p electron from the very stable neon-like configuration of Mg2+. Similar jumps occur in the ionization energies of other third-row atoms.|$|E
5|$|Mars has {{the largest}} dust storms in the Solar System. These can vary from a storm over a small area, to {{gigantic}} storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> Mars is closest to the Sun, and {{have been shown to}} increase the global temperature.|$|E
50|$|Marine {{regression}} is a {{geological process}} <b>occurring</b> <b>when</b> areas of submerged seafloor are exposed above the sea level. The opposite event, marine transgression, <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> flooding {{from the sea}} covers previously exposed land.|$|R
50|$|Walking {{consists}} of alternating single-support and double-support phases. The single-support phase <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> one leg is {{in contact with}} the ground while the double-support phase <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> two legs are {{in contact with the}} ground.|$|R
50|$|Strictly speaking, {{penetration}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> a projectile {{enters a}} target without passing {{through it and}} perforation <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the projectile completely passes through the target, but the word penetration is commonly {{used to refer to}} either.|$|R
5|$|Myrmecia ants are {{frequently}} encountered by humans, and avoiding them is difficult. Wearing closed footwear such as boots and shoes {{can reduce the}} risk of getting stung; these ants are capable of stinging through fabric, however. A risk of being stung while gardening also exists; most stings <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> someone is gardening and is unaware of the ants' presence. Eliminating nearby nests or moving to areas with low Myrmecia populations significantly decreases the chances of getting stung.|$|E
5|$|Norovirus is {{the leading}} cause of {{gastroenteritis}} among adults in America, causing greater than 90% of outbreaks. These localized epidemics typically <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> groups of people spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants. People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended. Norovirus is the cause of about 10% of cases in children.|$|E
5|$|Rock {{units are}} first emplaced either by {{deposition}} {{onto the surface}} or intrude into the overlying rock. Deposition can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> sediments settle {{onto the surface of}} the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.|$|E
50|$|Active {{software}} metering <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> a user {{is specifically}} denied {{use of a}} metered application. Passive software metering <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> application use is simply recorded and no control is asserted over maintaining a maximum concurrent usage level.|$|R
50|$|Pure {{bundling}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> {{a consumer}} can only purchase the entire bundle or nothing, mixed bundling <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> consumers are offered {{a choice between}} purchasing the entire bundle {{or one of the}} separate parts of the bundle.|$|R
50|$|Definitions {{differ in}} where the shift into an antral {{follicle}} occurs in the staging of folliculogenesis, with some stating that it <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> entering the secondary stage, and others stating that it <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> entering the tertiary stage.|$|R
