5|$|Another area of {{interest}} is in assessing whether keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) {{would be better than}} Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
25|$|In the frequentist interpretation, {{probability}} measures a “proportion of outcomes.” For example, suppose {{an experiment}} is performed many times. P(A) is the proportion <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> with property A, and P(B) that with property B. P(B|A ) is the proportion <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> with property B out <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> with property A, and P(A|B ) {{the proportion of}} those with A out of those withB.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} on the relevance <b>of</b> uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> for demand for sports viewing. Using television viewing figures for eight seasons from the English Premier League, we show that uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> {{does not have the}} hypothesised effect on television audience demand. Separating uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> effects by season, the results show that, at best, uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> had imprecise effects on audiences in earlier seasons, but zero effects in later seasons. Television audiences have evolved to exhibit preferences for talent. We suggest that the notion of a pure sporting contest in which uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> matters is no longer relevant and more important {{is the extent to which}} sports teams and leagues can increase the quality of the talent on show...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} body {{of theoretical}} literature {{has argued that}} popular interest in sporting contests between teams is heavily influenced by {{how difficult it is}} to predict the result ex-ante. Empirical research has, however, been unable to reach a consensus on the magnitude <b>of</b> uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> on demand. In this article, we seek to resolve this impasse by distinguishing between uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> in the short run and uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> in the long run. We also show that it is important to control for the independent effect of absolute team strength when testing the uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> hypothesis. Using data on over 380 Test cricket matches played in England, Australia and New Zealand since 1980, we find that short-run uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> has a significant impact on attendance demand and that absolute team strength has better explanatory power for attendance demand than does long-run uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>outcome.</b> Our results suggest some policy implications for the management and organization of international cricket...|$|R
40|$|Quality outcome {{measures}} are {{the cornerstone of}} clinical research. A review <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> measures used in foot and ankle surgery research reveals that the issues of validity, reliability and responsiveness <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> measures have not been addressed. Most reports in the literature have attempted to evaluate patient perceptions <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> fol-lowing foot surgery. Underlying the many difficulties with these {{outcome measures}} {{is a lack of}} understanding of what patients perceive to be important in terms of out-come. Consequently none <b>of</b> the existing <b>outcome</b> meas-ures can claim to be valid measures of patient percep-tions <b>of</b> <b>outcome,</b> as there has been no research uncov-ering these perceptions.

25|$|Roughly speaking, the theorem {{states that}} {{although}} there are many series of results that may be produced by a random process, the one actually produced is most probably from a loosely defined set <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> that all have approximately the same chance of being the one actually realized. (This is a consequence of the law of large numbers and ergodic theory.) Although there are individual outcomes which have a higher probability than any outcome in this set, the vast number <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> in the set almost guarantees that the outcome will come from the set. One way of intuitively understanding the property is through Cramér's large deviation theorem, which states that the probability of a large deviation from mean decays exponentially with the number of samples. Such results are studied in large deviations theory; intuitively, it is the large deviations that would violate equipartition, but these are unlikely.|$|E

25|$|There are two clear {{limitations}} {{to the classical}} definition. Firstly, it is applicable only to situations {{in which there is}} only a 'finite' number of possible outcomes. But some important random experiments, such as tossing a coin until it rises heads, give rise to an infinite set <b>of</b> <b>outcomes.</b> And secondly, you need to determine in advance that all the possible outcomes are equally likely without relying on the notion of probability to avoid circularity—for instance, by symmetry considerations.|$|E
25|$|Standardized {{tests are}} {{perceived}} as being fairer than non-standardized tests, because everyone gets the same test and the same grading system.
