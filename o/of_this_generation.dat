5|$|Belgium {{has seen}} two talented waves since 1980, from which several players in {{defensive}} positions gained international fame. In the 1980s {{and the early}} 1990s, goalkeepers Jean-Marie Pfaff and Michel Preud'homme were elected best custodians at FIFA World Cups, while FIFA recognised midfielders Jan Ceulemans and Enzo Scifo as the propelling forces of Belgium's 1986 FIFA World Cup squad. In 2002, after all players <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> had retired, Marc Wilmots became Belgium's top scorer at the World Cup with five goals.|$|E
5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna {{to turn in}} what is easily her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal performance to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying {{over the heads of}} her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand a guitar revival took place and raised a new {{generation}} of alternative guitar bands often described as post-punk revival or garage rock revival. Prominent US bands <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> are White Stripes, The Strokes, and The Killers. New Weird America or sometimes called Freak Folk is a new movement emphasizing the artistic individuality of genre crossing artists such as Antony and the Johnsons, Joanna Newsom, The Dodos, Animal Collective and Cat Power.|$|E

5|$|During the 12 {{years in}} which Belgium failed to qualify for major tournaments, another golden {{generation}} matured, most of whom later featured in foreign top football leagues; as of July 2013, 12 Belgian national team players would play the next season in the English Premier League. Five players <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> gained both prime individual and team awards in foreign top competitions or European club competitions: defenders Vincent Kompany and Jan Vertonghen, wingers Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne, and forward Kevin Mirallas. However, as of November 2016 {{none of them were}} regarded by FIFA or UEFA to be the best at their position in any major international tournament yet.|$|E
5|$|The early 20th {{century is}} also {{marked by the}} {{presence}} of a group of composers called the generazione dell'ottanta (generation of 1880), including Franco Alfano, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Ildebrando Pizzetti, and Ottorino Respighi. These composers usually concentrated on writing instrumental works, rather than opera. Members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> were the dominant figures in Italian music after Puccini's death in 1924. New organizations arose to promote Italian music, such as the Venice Festival of Contemporary Music and the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. Guido Gatti's founding of the periodical il Piano and then La rassegna musicale also helped to promote a broader view of music than the political and social climate allowed. Most Italians, however, preferred more traditional pieces and established standards, and only a small audience sought new styles of experimental classical music.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> model <b>of</b> SHO {{gained a}} {{reputation}} of being trouble-prone due to {{a large number of}} engine failures at around the 50,000-mile mark due to separation of the camshaft from its sprocket. However, this problem can be rectified by having the camshafts welded. Possibly because <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> SHO sold substantially worse than its predecessor, with sales peaking at 9,000 in 1997. As a result, the SHO was discontinued outright after the 1999 model year.|$|R

25|$|With the {{vanishing}} of the Skylark coupe after 1972, the Century inherited the potent Gran Sport performance option. While the Stage I 455in³ (7.5L) V8 was somewhat diminished from its performance heyday due to emission controls, the Century GS coupes of 1973 to 1975 remained strong performers {{by the standards}} of the time. At the other end of the power spectrum, to meet fuel economy regulations, some later models <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> were equipped with 231in³ (3.8L) V6s.|$|E

In the fifth century, Pei Songzhi annotated the Sanguozhi by incorporating information from other sources to Chen Shou's original work and adding his personal commentary. Some alternative texts used in the annotations to Guo Jia's biography include: Fu Zi, by Fu Xuan; Wei Shu (Book of Wei), by Wang Chen, Xun Yi and Ruan Ji; Shiyu (Accounts <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>Generation),</b> by Guo Song.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} geology was of great {{interest}} during the colonial period. Rich coal bearing seams, gold and other minerals became much sought after resources. This {{led to the formation}} of the Geological Survey of India, the first superintendent of which was Thomas Oldham (1816–1878). With his interest in fossils, especially after his discovery of Oldhamia, he took considerable interest in the palaeontological aspects of India. He recruited Ferdinand Stoliczka to work on the Jurassic beds of Kutch. The work <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> of geologists led to globally significant discoveries including support for continental drift and the idea of a Gondwana supercontinent.|$|E

25|$|For 1976, {{the final}} year <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation,</b> all Olds 88s {{received}} revised grille work, rectangular headlamps and parking lamps directly below instead of in the bumper, with Delta 88 Royale models also getting spring-loaded stand-up hood ornaments. It was also {{the final year}} for the Holiday hardtop coupes and sedans, along with the 455 Rocket V8 and the optional airbag system that would generally become universal on production cars and trucks some 15 years later. A one-year only option on Delta 88 Royale Holiday coupes was the Royale Crown Landau package that included a stainless steel roof bar, padded rear quarter vinyl roof, special hood ornament and color-keyed wheelcovers.|$|E
25|$|Rudin {{was written}} by Turgenev in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Crimean War, when it became obvious to many educated Russians that reform was needed. The main debate of Turgenev's own generation was that of Slavophiles versus Westernizers. Rudin depicts a typical man <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> (known as 'the men of forties'), intellectual but ineffective. This interpretation of the superfluous man as someone who possesses great intellectual ability and potential, but is unable to realize them stems from Turgenev’s own view of human nature, expressed in his 1860 speech ‘Hamlet and Don Quixote’, where he contrasts egotistical Hamlet, too deep in reflection to act, and enthusiastic and un-thinking, but active Don Quixote. The main character of the novel, Rudin, is easily identified with Hamlet.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Olympic {{gymnastics}} {{team was}} to be chosen after the USSR Cup competition in Moscow on 19–22 June. For gymnasts <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> it was a make-or-break contest. The judges and Soviet officials wanted to determine whose gymnastics would stand up best under the extremely high pressure conditions that would exist at the Olympics. It was run according to procedures for the Olympic Games – a full 4 day competition of compulsories, optionals, AA and event finals. Elena had finished joint 6th at the 1976 USSR Cup but {{that turned out to}} be insufficient to be placed on the squad. She knew this time only a top 3 place would give her a spot on the team. Davydova won it comfortably and scored a 10 on floor. She finished 0.5 ahead of her nearest rival, Natalia Shaposhnikova, 0.8 ahead of Zakharova, nearly a full 1.0 ahead of Filatova and a galactic 3.375 ahead of Mukhina.|$|E

25|$|Australian models {{came with}} the CA20E SOHC 2.0l EFI and KA24E SOHC 2.4l EFI motors. Sadly for Nissan Australia, Project Matilda was not the success it had hoped, even with a twin built for Ford Australia called the Corsair, which was even less successful. This led to the {{collapse}} of Nissan’s Australian manufacturing operations in the early 1990s. Most of the early Bluebirds <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> sold in New Zealand were again assembled locally from CKD kits, as had been the case with almost all NZ-bound cars since the first generation in the early 1960s. The Japanese-made, NZ-assembled cars were replaced by Australian made U12 sedans at 'facelift' time though the Kiwi-built wagon, a body variant not made in Australia, carried on. NZ trim levels included SGS and ZX; like rival Toyota Australia, Nissan Australia, which ceased local manufacturing in 1994, was willing to build uniquely specified and badged models for its trans-Tasman customer.|$|E

The family custom was that children <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> had Chien as the first character of their forename, followed by the characters in the phrase Ying-Shiung-Hao-Jie, which means [...] "heroes and outstanding figures". Accordingly, she had an older brother, Chien-Ying, and a younger brother, Chien-Hao. Wu and her father were extremely close and he encouraged her interests passionately, creating an environment where she was surrounded by books, magazines, and newspapers.|$|E
5000|$|January 9, 1987 saw an {{extended}} roof feature available {{both with the}} Sambar Try trim level with the commercial version available with the standard height roof.

In April 1989, a six-valve engine producing [...] joined the regular engine, itself downgraded to 28 PS. The EN05 four-cylinder engine used in the Rex was never fitted to the KR/KT Sambar, as it would require lots of reengineering to a soon to be replaced platform. The Domingo was available with the 3-cylinder EF10 1000 cc engine starting in 1983.|$|R
