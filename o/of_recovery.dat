However, there is some evidence in business practice that customer recovery activities can be highly beneficial and profitable. Against this background, this study focuses on the conceptualization of antecedents <b>of</b> customer <b>recovery</b> success based on equity theory.

Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6–10% of people. Often people do not remember what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after a focal seizure. When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two.|$|E

5|$|Relatively speaking, bites {{from this}} species are not highly dangerous. In Britain {{there have been}} only 14 known {{fatalities}} since 1876—the last a 5-year-old child in 1975—and one near fatal bite of a 39-year-old woman in Essex in 1998. An 82-year-old woman died following a bite in Germany in 2004, although {{it is not clear whether}} her death was due to the effect of the venom. Even so, professional medical help should always be sought as soon as possible after any bite.

Contrarily to the reservoir filed scale simulation which indicated no variation in the oil recovery curve or even a negligible variation in water cut during 4500 days of injection, the 1 D small-scale modeling clearly indicates that the meaningful difference can be acquired, if the effect of aging time is taken into account within reservoir simulation.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Evaluation {{of results}} in a {{consecutive}} series of 29 prenatal diagnoses for the Cockayne syndrome. Methods: <b>Recovery</b> <b>of</b> DNA-synthesis in UV-irradiated cultured fetal cells was measured by scintillation counting of incorporated 3 H-thymidine. Semiquantitative autoradiographic assessment <b>of</b> the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> RNA-synthesis (RecRS) {{was used as an}} adjunctive method. Results: In 26 of the 29 pregnancies at risk, a definite diagnosis was directly made, based on normal (n = 23) or clearly reduced (n = 3) <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> DNA-synthesis in UV-irradiated cultured chorionic villus (CV) cells (n = 23) or amniocytes (n = 3). Adjunctive studies were performed in several pregnancies to corroborate the initial results. On three occasions initial results were unreliable, which required investigation <b>of</b> the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> RNA-synthesis (n = 2) or even additional amniocentesis (n = 1) to achieve a firm diagnosis. Thus, four affected fetuses were diagnosed in 29 pregnancies at risk (13. 8 %). Conclusion: Reliable prenatal diagnosis of the Cockayne syndrome can be made by the demonstration of a strongly reduced <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> DNA-synthesis in UV-irradiated cultured chorionic villus cells or amniocytes. Assessment <b>of</b> the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> RNA-synthesis was needed as an adjunctive method in rare cases of poor cell growth and DNA-synthesis. Copyrigh...|$|R
