5|$|Beaumont almost {{instantly}} became a boomtown with investors {{from around the}} state and the nation participating in land speculation. Investment in Texas speculation in 1901 reached approximately $235 million US (approximately $ in present-day terms). The level of oil speculation in Pennsylvania and other areas of the United States was quickly surpassed by the speculation in Texas. The Lucas gusher itself was short-lived; production fell to 10,000 barrels per day by 1904. The strike, however, was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of a much larger trend.|$|E
5|$|In October 1964, at a {{ceremony}} in honour of Soviet cosmonauts, Brezhnev called for the strengthening of the Party apparatus. This speech was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of a large campaign directed against Kosygin. Several newspapers, such as Pravda and Kommunist, criticised {{the work of the}} Council of Ministers, and indirectly Kosygin, its chairman, for planning the economy in an unrealistic fashion, and used the highly aggressive rhetoric previously used to condemn Khrushchev against Kosygin.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, R.E.M. {{set out on}} {{its first}} tour in six years. The tour was a huge {{commercial}} success, but the period was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> {{of a series of}} health problems that plagued the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a hernia. Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road. The band brought along eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album. The final three performances of the tour were filmed at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia and released in home video form as Road Movie.|$|E

He also says the forces of good have one major {{advantage}} over Sauron; the Ring is hidden, and that they should attempt to destroy it has not entered Sauron's mind.

25|$|Marseille won the 1993 final, {{defeating}} Milan, {{and becoming}} {{the first team to}} win the Champions League and the first European champions from France. They were later banned from defending their crown in what was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of a collapse which arose from domestic match fixing committed by chairman Bernard Tapie. The club was eventually stripped of their Ligue 1 championship after it was revealed that Tapie had cooked the club's financial books.

25|$|The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS) of the Rabbinical Assembly of Conservative Judaism has {{declared}} that Conservative Rabbis should not inquire into or accept evidence of mamzer status under any circumstances, rendering the category inoperative. In doing so, the CJLS distinguished the Conservative approach to Jewish law from the Orthodox approach, noting that Conservative Judaism regards Biblical law as <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> {{of a relationship}} rather than a final word, and that the Conservative movement regards it as its role and responsibility to revise Biblical law {{from time to time}} when such law conflicts with evolving concepts of morality.|$|E

25|$|One {{explanation}} for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Another {{explanation is that the}} newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and mitzvot before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offering—a measure of barley, typically animal fodder—and the Shavuot offering—two loaves of wheat bread, human food—symbolizes the transition process.|$|E
25|$|This was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> for the RCM. The {{advent of}} the Two Hundred Dollar Gold series was quickly joined by a Platinum series. These high quality {{collector}} coins solidified the RCM's entry into the luxury coin market. A four coin set with face values of $30, $75, $150, and $300 respectively were complemented by the high quality artwork that adorned these luxury items. Famed artists such as Robert Bateman and Glen Loates contributed to these collections with polar bear and bird designs. The issue price for these collections was around $1,990 and the casing was a walnut or burgundy (for 1994) case with a black suede four hole insert and a Certificate of Authenticity.|$|E

During a heated argument with him about it, after she discovers his deception, Jonathan loses his calm and slaps her. Maggie stays quiet about the physical altercation, and claims that the bruise on her face is due to a gym accident.

25|$|Despite all {{the foul}} weather facing the ABA, Mennenga, who {{was said to}} be an eternal optimist, hung on. There was one {{instance}} that was probably responsible for him relinquishing his position and BMX the sport he had help nurture, all together. On January 27, 1985, at the GT Supernationals in Pico Rivera, California, a disgruntled woman hurled a cup of coffee into the face of Mennenga. In all his years involved in BMX he had never been attacked physically, but that was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of his humiliation. After ABA security had to physically remove the spectator from the facility, she filed a false police report that Mennenga assaulted her. The Pico Rivera police came down to the track and arrested Mennenga during the event. The true story eventually came up and the charges were dropped and Mennenga released, but very likely the experience forever soured him on the sport he once loved.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{experiencing}} {{their highest}} chart positions {{to date in}} 1991 and 1992, the band had elected not to tour, having found the year-long Green tour draining. The Monster tour would be the group's first outing in six years. The tour, which played in arenas and amphitheaters, began in January 1995 with shows in Australia and Japan, and continued throughout Europe and the United States {{for the remainder of}} the year. Support acts included Sonic Youth and Radiohead. The tour was a huge commercial success, but the period was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of a series of health problems that plagued the Monster Tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a hernia. In spite of these factors, the group composed and debuted a number of new songs while on the tour, and recorded the bulk of New Adventures in Hi-Fi, their follow-up to Monster, while on the road. The band brought along eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the date}} of the conversion, and the extent of its {{influence}} beyond the elite, often minimised in some scholarship, are a matter of dispute, but at some point between 740 and 920 CE, the Khazar royalty and nobility appear to have converted to Judaism, in part, it is argued, perhaps to deflect competing pressures from Arabs and Byzantines to accept either Islam or Orthodoxy. Christian of Stavelot in his Expositio in Matthaeum Evangelistam (ca. 860–870s) refers to Gazari, presumably Khazars, as living in the lands of Gog and Magog, who were circumcised and omnem Judaismum observat—observing all the laws of Judaism. New numismatic evidence of coins dated 837/8 bearing the inscriptions arḍ al-ḫazar (Land of the Khazars), or Mûsâ rasûl Allâh (Moses is the messenger of God, in imitation of the Islamic coin phrase: Muḥammad rasûl Allâh) suggest to many the conversion took place in that decade. Olsson argues that the 837/8 evidence marks <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of a long and difficult official Judaization that concluded some decades later. A 9th-century Jewish traveller, Eldad ha-Dani, is said to have informed Spanish Jews in 883 that there was a Jewish polity in the East, and that fragments of the legendary Ten Lost Tribes, part of the line of Simeon and half-line of Manasseh, dwelt in “the land of the Khazars”, receiving tribute from some 25 to 28 kingdoms. Another view holds that by the 10th century, while the royal clan officially claimed Judaism, a non-normative variety of Islamisation took place among the majority of Khazars.|$|E

Reviewing Auden's first book, Poems (1930), Naomi Mitchison wrote [...] "If {{this is really}} <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning,</b> we have perhaps a master to look forward to." [...] But John Sparrow, recalling Mitchison's comment in 1934, dismissed Auden's early work as [...] "a monument to the misguided aims that prevail among contemporary poets, {{and the fact that}} ... he is being hailed as 'a master' shows how criticism is helping poetry on the downward path." [...] Joseph Brodsky claimed that he had [...] "the greatest mind of the twentieth century".|$|E

This was <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the Grimaldi's problems. In 1793 {{the leaders of the}} French Revolution annexed Monaco. The prince was imprisoned in France and his property and estates, including the palace, were forfeited to France.|$|E
