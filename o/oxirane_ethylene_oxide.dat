However, {{there is no}} information regarding kinetic of reaction of imides with oxiranes. In this article the kinetics of the reaction of cyclic monoimides: succinimide, phtalimide, and glutarimide, with <b>ethylene</b> and propylene <b>oxides</b> in presence of triethylamine in aprotic solvent was studied. The rate laws for those processes were established based upon on dilatometric measurements. I was said that cyclic monoimides react with oxiranes in presence of triethylamine to give N-(2 -hydroxyalkyl) imides as major product. This product react further with oxiranes in consecutive reaction. The kinetics of the reaction of cyclic mono-imides with oxiranes obey the following rate law: V = k 1 / 2 c 1 / 2 cat c 3 / 2 imide c 1 / 2 oxirane. Based upon kinetic data the following orders of reactivity of imides and oxiranes were obtained: phtalimide ≥ succinimide > glutarimide and <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> > propylene oxide. The solvent (DMF, DMSO and dioxane) effect was also studied. From temperature dependences the thermodynamic parameters: activation energy, enthalpy and entropy from linear Eyring plots were obtained...|$|R

40|$|Context. <b>Ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> (c-C 2 H 4 O), and its isomer {{acetaldehyde}} (CH 3 CHO), {{are important}} complex organic molecules {{because of their}} potential role {{in the formation of}} amino acids. The discovery of <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> in hot cores suggests the presence of ring-shaped molecules with more than 3 carbon atoms such as furan (c-C 4 H 4 O), to which ribose, the sugar found in DNA, is closely related. Aims. Despite the fact that acetaldehyde is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> has not yet been detected in cold sources. We aim to understand the chemistry of the formation and loss of <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> in hot and cold interstellar objects (i) by including in a revised gas-grain network some recent experimental results on grain surfaces and (ii) by comparison with the chemical behaviour of its isomer, acetaldehyde. Methods. We introduce a complete chemical network for <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> using a revised gas-grain chemical model. We test the code for the case of a hot core. The model allows us to predict the gaseous and solid <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> abundances during a cooling-down phase prior to star formation and during the subsequent warm-up phase. We can therefore predict at what temperatures <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> forms on grain surfaces and at what temperature it starts to desorb into the gas phase. Results.
