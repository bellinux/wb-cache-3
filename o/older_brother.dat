40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the hypothesis that}} maternal immunoreactivity to male-specific features of the foetus can increase developmental instability. We predicted that the participants' number of <b>older</b> <b>brothers</b> would be positively related to the fluctuating asymmetry of ten bilateral morphological traits. The participants were 40 adult male psychiatric patients and 31 adult male hospital employees. Consistent with the hypothesis, the participants' number of <b>older</b> <b>brothers</b> [...] but not number of <b>older</b> sisters, younger <b>brothers</b> or younger sisters [...] was positively associated with fluctuating asymmetry. The patients had significantly larger fluctuating asymmetry scores and tended to have more <b>older</b> <b>brothers</b> than the employees, but the positive relationship {{between the number of}} <b>older</b> <b>brothers</b> and fluctuating asymmetry was observed in both groups...|$|R

5000|$|Blanchard et al. {{argued that}} the fraternal birth order effect (the {{probability}} that a boy will be homosexual increases {{with the number of}} <b>older</b> <b>brothers</b> who have the same biological mother) appears to be limited to right-handed men. Moreover, the same study indicates that left-handed men without <b>older</b> <b>brothers</b> {{are more likely to be}} homosexual than non-right-handed men who have <b>older</b> <b>brothers.</b> As Blanchard et al. said in their report, [...] "the odds of homosexuality is higher for men who have a non-right hand preference or who have <b>older</b> <b>brothers,</b> relative to men with neither of these features, but the odds for men with both features are similar to the odds for men with neither".|$|R
