5|$|Paley {{considers}} how {{the whole}} of a system {{is more than the}} sum <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> This is seen to be so both in a mechanical watch and in living systems.|$|E
5|$|Known as baka or baka ni viti in Fiji, Ficus obliqua {{has many}} <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts</b> used in Fijian {{traditional}} medicine, and was previously {{held to be}} sacred there. Its white sap {{has been used for}} painful or swollen joints and limbs or boils, or diluted with water and drunk to improve breast milk. Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, and the leaves are applied to venereal lesions. The species has been traditionally used for boils in Samoa and Tonga.|$|E
5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is more than the sum <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E
50|$|Every {{real number}} can be {{essentially}} uniquely {{represented as a}} continued fraction, namely as the sum <b>of</b> <b>its</b> integer <b>part</b> and the reciprocal <b>of</b> <b>its</b> fractional <b>part</b> which is written as the sum <b>of</b> <b>its</b> integer <b>part</b> and the reciprocal <b>of</b> <b>its</b> fractional <b>part,</b> and so on.|$|R

5|$|Several burials (presumably of {{high-ranking}} benefactors and clergy) {{were made}} within the priory and 19th-century archaeologists found stone coffins during excavations. They are visible against the east wall, but their original location was not recorded. Two centrally placed grave slabs are visible below the east window. The priory once housed the Brus cenotaph, {{a memorial to}} its founders erected in 1521. It was removed in 1540 and dismantled. Most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts</b> were recovered and reassembled in the 19th century, and the reconstructed cenotaph is displayed in Saint Nicholas' Church next to the ruins.|$|E
5|$|The Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works {{locomotive}} acquired {{along with}} them could not be restored. Built in 1902, this locomotive was {{the oldest of the}} five locomotives purchased and was determined to have too many problems to be rebuilt. It was stored out of use in California for a period before being sold to an unknown locomotive broker. Some <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts</b> were used to help restore the four Baldwin locomotives, including its smokestack, which was fitted to the WDWRR's No. 4 locomotive.|$|E
5|$|The cycle {{consists}} of sixteen sonatas (thirteen {{of which are}} cast in binary form, the remaining three in ternary form) and four more freely structured interludes. The aim of the pieces is to express the eight permanent emotions of the rasa Indian tradition. In Sonatas and Interludes, Cage elevated his technique of rhythmic proportions {{to a new level}} of complexity. In each sonata a short sequence of natural numbers and fractions defines the structure of the work and that <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> informing structures as localized as individual melodic lines.|$|E
50|$|The {{district}} was eliminated during the administrative-territorial reform in 2009, most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>part</b> being divided between Dagda and Krāslava municipalities and three parishes in north-west joining Aglona Municipality.|$|R
50|$|The FV603 Saracen is a six-wheeled {{armoured}} {{personnel carrier}} built by Alvis {{and used by}} the British Army. It became a recognisable vehicle as a result <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>part</b> in the policing of Northern Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|Ismailli {{district}} was created {{with the center}} in the Ismailli village on November 21, 1931. Before {{the establishment of the}} district one <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>part</b> was in Goychay province, another one in Shamakhy province and the smallest part within Sheki province.|$|R

The RX is also manufacturered in Toyota's plant in Fukuoka, Kyushu, Japan for markets outside North America with 64 percent <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts</b> coming from Japan.|$|E

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, no {{corresponding}} concern has been presented yet about this problem. But we think this problem is interesting and meaningful because it depicts other important qualities of the Mathieu series, especially the asymptotic properties <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>part</b> sums.|$|R
30|$|Figure 4 {{presents}} the main abstractions related to requirements. Requirement is a property {{that must be}} exhibited by a product, some <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>part</b> (e.g., subsystem, module), or its development process. Requirement has description, identifier, version, type, state, owner, and stakeholders as its attributes.|$|R
50|$|After the Roman conquest in the Celtiberian Wars of {{the early}} second century BC, Segobriga {{must have been a}} hill fort or Celtiberian town. After the wars of Sertorius, it became the centre <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the plateau and {{controlled}} a large territory.|$|R
25|$|Lojban {{has been}} shown to be {{translated}} in some <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts</b> into predicate logic. There are also analogies between Lojban and combinatory logic.|$|E
25|$|Growth: {{maintenance}} of {{a higher rate of}} anabolism than catabolism. A growing organism increases in size in all <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> rather than simply accumulating matter.|$|E
25|$|The US-built Toyota Camry {{took the}} top spot in 2015 and 2016 as the most American-Made car with over 75percent <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts</b> and {{manufacturing}} coming from the United States.|$|E

25|$|The Evoque {{platform}}, named LR-MS, is {{loosely based}} on the Ford EUCD platform (which was used on the company's Freelander 2) but 90% <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts</b> were redesigned.|$|E
25|$|The G8 summits {{during the}} 21st century have {{inspired}} widespread debates, protests and demonstrations; and the two- or three-day event becomes {{more than the}} sum <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> elevating the participants, the issues and the venue as focal points for activist pressure.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} is remarkable for {{the level of}} miniaturisation and the complexity <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> which is {{comparable to that of}} fourteenth-century astronomical clocks. It has at least 30 gears, although mechanism expert Michael Wright has suggested that the Greeks of this period were capable of implementing a system with many more gears.|$|E
50|$|The first {{reference}} to the Island Bohemian Club dates back to 1908, when it held an annual general meeting {{under the name of}} the Old Codgers Club.

25|$|The {{value of}} asset-based {{analysis}} of a business {{is equal to the}} sum <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to fair market value wherever possible.|$|E
25|$|Just {{like other}} {{municipalities}} of Serbia, New Belgrade is further divided into local communities (Serbian: mesna zajednica). Apart from Bežanija and Staro Sajmište, no other neighbourhoods have historical or traditional names, as Novi Beograd {{did not exist}} as such. However, in the five decades of its existence, some <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts</b> gradually became known as distinct neighborhoods of their own.|$|E
