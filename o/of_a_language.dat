5|$|These symbols {{describe}} the features <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> above {{the level of}} individual consonants and vowels, such as prosody, tone, length, and stress, which often operate on syllables, words, or phrases: that is, elements such as the intensity, pitch, and gemination of the sounds <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language,</b> {{as well as the}} rhythm and intonation of speech. Although most of these symbols indicate distinctions that are phonemic at the word level, symbols also exist for intonation on a level greater than that of the word. Various ligatures of tone letters are used in the IPA Handbook despite not being found on the simplified official IPA chart.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly explained in terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified {{in the brain and}} not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|No {{official}} languages {{were recorded}} in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the national language. Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000, {{on the grounds that}} the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> law, French still had the character of an official language.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{official}} forms of their respective languages, the four linguistic regions of Switzerland also have their local dialectal forms. The role played by dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically: in the German-speaking regions, Swiss German dialects have become ever more prevalent since {{the second half of}} the 20th century, especially in the media, such as radio and television, and are used as an everyday language, while the Swiss variety of Standard German is almost always used instead of dialect for written communication (c.f. diglossic usage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language).</b> Conversely, in the French-speaking regions the local dialects have almost disappeared (only 6.3% of the population of Valais, 3.9% of Fribourg, and 3.1% of Jura still spoke dialects at the end of the 20th century), while in the Italian-speaking regions dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation.|$|E
5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language,</b> as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

40|$|The {{submitted}} M. A. thesis {{builds on}} the B. A. thesis entitled On general questions of psycholinguistics and develops factual points of departure related to the topic <b>of</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign <b>language</b> by <b>a</b> child. <b>A</b> part <b>of</b> the theoretical section {{is the definition of}} basic concepts in the field of psycholinguistics, in particular developmental psycholinguistics, and the design of the notion <b>of</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign <b>language</b> by <b>a</b> child. The primary goal of the study is to provide <b>a</b> comparative listing <b>of</b> the individual theories <b>of</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign <b>language</b> by <b>a</b> child, not only {{at the level of the}} mother tongue, but at the level <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second <b>language</b> as well. The basic theoretical concepts <b>of</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign <b>language</b> are based on linguistic, psychological and especially psycholinguistic scientific research. The other goals of the thesis include the definition of extensive variable determinants which participate in the process <b>of</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign <b>language</b> by <b>a</b> child and also influence the resultant level <b>of</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-native <b>language.</b> In the concluding part of the theoretical compilation, space is provided for the psycholinguistic aspects of adoption, such as enunciative, speech and written displays <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign <b>language.</b> The empirical part is built up in a way so that it highlights the applicability of the process <b>of</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign <b>language</b> by <b>a</b> child in a natural environment, i. e. in a bilingual family environment where the resultant process is the most effective and verifiable. For this reason, it is not possible to talk about learning <b>a</b> foreign <b>language</b> but rather about the adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second <b>language...</b>|$|R

25|$|Wittgenstein also ponders the {{possibility}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> that talks {{about those things}} that are known only to the user, whose content is inherently private. The usual example is that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> in which one names one's sensations and other subjective experiences, such that the meaning of the term is decided by the individual alone. For example, the individual names a particular sensation, on some occasion, 'S', and intends to use that word to refer to that sensation. Such a language Wittgenstein calls a private language.|$|E
25|$|Corpus {{planning}} {{refers to}} the prescriptive intervention in the forms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language,</b> whereby planning decisions are made to engineer changes {{in the structure of}} the language. Corpus planning activities often arise as the result of beliefs about the adequacy of the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> to serve desired functions. Unlike status planning, which is primarily undertaken by administrators and politicians, corpus planning generally is performed by individuals with greater linguistic expertise. There are three traditionally recognized types of corpus planning: graphization, standardization, and modernization.|$|E

25|$|When {{children}} reach about 15–18 {{months of}} age, language acquisition flourishes. There is {{a surge in}} word production resulting from {{the growth of the}} cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999) found that humans learn first about the sounds <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language,</b> and then move on to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and know that a new word is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> and word.|$|E
25|$|A {{large amount}} of {{research}} has studied how users <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> perceive foreign speech (referred to as cross-language speech perception) or second-language speech (second-language speech perception).

50|$|Language {{revitalization}} is also {{closely tied}} to the linguistic field of language documentation.

Furthermore, the task of documentation is often taken on with the goal of revitalization in mind.|$|R
50|$|Alternations provide {{linguists}} {{with data}} {{that allow them}} to determine the allophones and allomorphs <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language's</b> phonemes and morphemes and to develop analyses determining the distribution of those allophones and allomorphs.|$|R

25|$|Although it {{is unusual}} for allophones to be {{represented}} with distinct symbols in the written form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language,</b> these latter phones are distinguished in Tigrinya orthography. Tigriniya's predecessor language of Ge'ez also follows this unique allophonic system.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{dedicated}} government support for Esperanto means that replacing English {{as the global}} link language is rather limited. The spread <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>language</b> depends on economics, global politics, and a good support system backed with state support.|$|E
