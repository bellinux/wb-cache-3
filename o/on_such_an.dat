5|$|In early July 1915, {{while making}} {{plans for an}} {{offensive}} to break the deadlock that had developed around the Gallipoli Peninsula following the initial landings in April, {{the commander of the}} Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, had determined that an attack at Lone Pine could be used to divert Ottoman attention away from a main attack that would be launched further north around Sari Bair, Chunuk Bair and Hill 971. The Australian 1st Infantry Brigade was chosen to undertake the attack, and consisted of about 3,000 men, under the command of Colonel Nevill Smyth. Along with the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades, the 1st Infantry Brigade was part of the Australian 1st Division. The division's commander was Brigadier General Harold Walker, a British officer who had replaced Major General William Bridges as temporary commander after Bridges had been killed by a sniper in May. Walker did not like the idea of launching an attack at Lone Pine, let alone a mere diversion, but when General Sir Ian Hamilton, the British commander, insisted the attack proceed, through thorough planning, Walker endeavoured to give his troops the best chance of success possible <b>on</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> unfavourable battleground.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} wave of {{economic}} globalization began {{during the period}} of 1870–1914, marked by transportation expansion, record levels of migration, enhanced communications, trade expansion, and growth in capital transfers. During the mid-nineteenth century, the passport system in Europe dissolved as rail transport expanded rapidly. Most countries issuing passports did not require their carry, thus people could travel freely without them. The standardization of international passports would not arise until 1980 under the guidance of the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization. From 1870 to 1915, 36 million Europeans migrated away from Europe. Approximately 25 million (or 70%) of these travelers migrated to the United States, while most of the rest reached Canada, Australia, Argentina, and Brazil. Europe itself experienced an influx of foreigners from 1860 to 1910, growing from 0.7% of the population to 1.8%. While the absence of meaningful passport requirements allowed for free travel, migration <b>on</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation, particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of steam-powered boats over traditional sailing ships. World railway mileage grew from 205,000 kilometers in 1870 to 925,000 kilometers in 1906, while steamboat cargo tonnage surpassed that of sailboats in the 1890s. Advancements such as the telephone and wireless telegraphy (the precursor to radio) revolutionized telecommunication by providing instantaneous communication. In 1866, the first transatlantic cable was laid beneath the ocean to connect London and New York, while Europe and Asia became connected through new landlines.|$|E

He {{then worked}} in Investment Management at ScotiaMcLeod from 2007 to 2010, where he managed {{portfolios}} of high-net-worth clients that were worth {{a total of}} about $120 million. After taking time off from his career to earn a Master of Business Administration, Vipond worked in Strategy and Corporate Development at the Vancouver-based Goldcorp Inc. from 2012 to 2015 where he made a $2.6 billion unsolicited bid to buy Osisko Mining. In 2013, while working at Goldcorp, Vipond founded Mathers Pacific Capital Inc., which is based in Vancouver. Mathers Pacific Capital works with Vancouver-area companies to help them raise capital, complete mergers and acquisitions, and grow their businesses. In March 2015, Vipond became Vice President of Corporate Finance at Shoes.com, while also continuing to run Mathers Pacific Capital and the Corporate Finance Institute, which is a subdivision of Mathers Pacific Capital. Prior to joining Shoes.com, Vipond worked as a consultant for its owner, Roger Hardy and in 2014, spearheaded the firm's purchase of Shoeme.ca and OnlineShoes.com. These purchases helped bring Shoes.com into the online shoe-selling business and shortly after joining Shoes.com, he oversaw the completion of a non-brokered $45 million private placement. It was the largest such private placement ever completed by a Canadian e-commerce company. In 2014, Vipond taught a one-day course on mining valuation at Sauder School of Business that involved working through a mining acquisition opportunity and the impact <b>on</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> mining investment.|$|E

25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, the French government, {{which had}} taken a {{significant}} interest in the re-establishment and growth of its national aviation industries {{in the aftermath of}} the Second World War, developed a detailed request for a combined liaison/trainer aircraft, to be equipped with twin-turbofan engines. Among those companies that took interest in the government request were aircraft manufacturers Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation. Design work <b>on</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> aircraft commenced during the second half of the 1960s as a joint venture between Sud and Nord. In January 1968, Sud and Nord decided to proceed with the programme following an announcement by French engine company SNECMA announced that it was developing a suitable engine, the M49 Larzac. It was a conventional design for its class, a low-wing monoplane powered by a pair of turbofan engines, which were mounted upon nacelles attached to the rear fuselage.|$|E

25|$|Romney’s initial {{emergency}} {{budget proposal}} {{for fiscal year}} 2003 called for $343 million in immediate funding cuts, necessitating layoffs of state employees and cuts in aid to cities and towns for public safety and education. He explained in a televised address, “There's no time to restructure state government or remake state programs. <b>On</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> emergency timetable, there's just time for cuts.” He also proposed cuts in state expenditures for Medicaid, the government program providing {{health care for the}} poorest state residents. The cuts included caps in payments to medical providers (one example being through limiting payments for hospital stays to 20 days, no matter how sick the patient), increased stringency of the criteria for Medicaid eligibility, and rationing of access to higher-priced medications for Medicaid patients. Some 36,000 Massachusetts residents lost their Medicaid eligibility. The 2003 emergency budget revision proposal also included funding cuts affecting public colleges and universities, treatment for schizophrenic and other mentally ill patients, and various other social services.|$|E
25|$|The {{general rule}} {{that in every}} country {{designers}} use much the same means whereby a pattern is obtained holds good in China. There are forms of band decoration here which closely resemble those of Gothic Europe, and a chair from Turkestan (3rd century) might almost be Elizabethan, so like are the details. Screens of grill form, often found in the historically Islamic countries, are common, and the deeply grounded, closely arranged patterns of Bombay also have their counterparts. The imperial dais in the Chien-Ching Hall, Pekin, is a masterpiece of intricate design. The back consists of one central panel of considerable height, with two of lesser degree on either side luxuriously carved. The whole is crowned with a very heavy crest of dragons and scroll work; the throne also is a wonderful example of carved treatment, and the doors of a cabinet {{in the same building}} show how rich an effect of foliage can be produced without the employment of stalk or scroll. One might almost say, he wastes his talent <b>on</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> ungrateful material as wood. In this material fans and other trifles are carved with a delicacy that courts disaster.|$|E

The national flag should never be defaced by placing slogans, logos, lettering or pictures of any kind on it, for example at sporting events. The flag should not be draped on cars, trains, boats or other modes of transport; it should not be carried flat, but should always be carried aloft and free, except when used to drape a coffin; <b>on</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> occasion, the green should be {{at the head of the}} coffin.
