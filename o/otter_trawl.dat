Despite this, {{little is known about}} associated impacts to benthic habitat and communities. This thesis examines the impacts of <b>otter</b> <b>trawling</b> on bivalves living in sand, a bottom type occurring widely over the Grand Banks. Bivalves are dominant members of sandy bottoms on continental shelves and are good indicators of physical disturbance. Two broad categories of impacts to benthos from mobile fishing gear are direct harvest and incidental damage. Bivalves have low susceptibility to capture by groundfish <b>otter</b> trawls; <b>trawl</b> capture efficiency is on the order of 10 ⁻⁵. In order to investigate incidental impacts, a three-year <b>otter</b> <b>trawling</b> experiment was conducted on a fine to medium sand bottom on the northeastern Grand Bank. Each year a total of 12 trawl passes were made along the centre line of two 13 km by 200 m experimental corridors. Sampling was conducted inside experimental and adjacent reference corridors with a 0. 5 m² hydraulic grab. No significant effects of trawling were detected on bivalve populations in any year. Shallow burrowing species showed no significant changes in density or biomass and recruitment of juveniles ≤ 3 mm was apparent inside trawled corridors. The size structure of populations from trawled and reference areas were similar. Mean (± sd) percent major shell damage immediately after trawling was low, ranging from 2. 8 ± 6. 1 % to 13. 5 + 9. 4 %.

25|$|Otter {{trawlers}} {{usually have}} two gallows at the stern with towing blocks. The towing warps run through these, each regulated {{by its own}} winch.

50|$|Of {{importance}} {{in deciding whether}} a contract is frustrated is that the event cannot have been in any way induced by either of the parties.

This requires understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of human pressures and their impacts. Quantifying seabed recovery rates from 2 significant pressures in European waters, benthic fishing and aggregate extraction, is a significant step towards assessing sensitivity and cumulative impacts. Vessel monitoring system data were used to estimate the distribution and intensity of benthic fishing in UK (England and Wales) marine waters (2006 to 2007). Data were separated by towed bottom-fishing gears (scallop dredges, beam and <b>otter</b> <b>trawls)</b> and linked to habitat in a geographic information system. Recovery periods of seabed habitats were estimated by literature review, for gear types and fishing intensity. Recovery rates generally increased with sediment hardness, and habitats required longer periods of recovery from scallop dredging than from <b>otter</b> or beam <b>trawling.</b> Fishing pressure across the habitat-gear combinations was such that 80 % of the bottom-fished area {{was estimated to be}} able to recover completely before repeat trawling, based on mean annual trawl frequencies.
