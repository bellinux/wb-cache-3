Bridgwater Docks have been restored as a marina, but there is no navigable connection to the River Parrett, as the canal still transports drinking water for the people of Bridgwater.|$|E

The revelation that Allen {{would be an}} enemy of the <b>Order</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 14th Noah was well received by Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock and Chris Beveridge of the Fandom Post. However, Goodman criticized early-volume reliance on comedy rather than plot. Beveridge and Erkael of Manga News were impressed with Kanda's dark past. Douresseaux liked Allen's situation in volume 21 (due to the character's connections with the Noah), and wanted to see more of that and less of Kanda's fight with Alma Karma.|$|E
5|$|On 30 April 1969, the Working Committee for Nuclear Issues (AAA) was created. It met 27 {{times between}} 26 September 1969 and 25 October 1988.

On 1 November 1988, Federal Councillor Arnold Koller signed the dissolution <b>order,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> AAA ceased to exist on 31 December of that year, thus ending the 43-year Swiss nuclear weapons program.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Moser {{collected}} over 25,000 mycological specimens. He first described around 420 Cortinarius species and around 80 other species, including both agarics and boletes. He circumscribed three new genera: Singeromyces (1966), Stephanopus (1975) and Anamika (2002). Much of his research covered four key areas: the taxonomy of Agaricales—including the classical morphotaxonomy and the chemotaxonomy of the order—the toxicity of the chemical constituents of members of the same <b>order,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ecology of ectomycorrhiza.|$|E

5|$|After his AIF {{appointment}} was terminated, Weir resumed his {{service in the}} Citizen Military Forces (CMF). In 1917, {{he was awarded the}} Distinguished Service <b>Order</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Russian Empire Order of St. Anne, 2nd Class, with Swords, and was mentioned in dispatches for his performance at Pozières and Mouquet Farm. From 1917 to 1920, he was aide-de-camp to the Governor-General of Australia, Sir Ronald Craufurd Munro Ferguson. Weir retired from the CMF as an honorary brigadier general in March 1921, his last appointment being as commander of the 20th Infantry Brigade. He was only the second South Australia-born officer to reach the rank of brigadier general. On 31 March 1921, Weir was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 10th Battalion, a position he held for many years.|$|E
5|$|An {{average of}} 23.2 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched the event, with an {{estimated}} 750 million worldwide. Critics were generally positive, but noted {{that it was not}} as good as the opening ceremony. Some of the foreign reviews questioned whether everyone would have understood the nods to British film and television. George Michael was roundly criticised for his song choice while Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Russell Brand were criticised for not demonstrating the Olympic ethos in their past behaviour. Some performers were initially reluctant to appear, and other high-profile acts turned down invitations to perform at the ceremony. NBC in the United States and Prime TV in New Zealand were criticised by viewers for their broadcasts of the ceremony. There was also a concert in Hyde Park to close the Olympics, featuring Blur, New <b>Order,</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Specials.|$|E

5|$|Attacked {{from the}} north and south and facing the {{possibility}} of unrest elsewhere, Mindaugas was placed in an extremely difficult position, but managed to use the conflicts between the Livonian <b>Order</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Archbishop of Riga in his own interests. He succeeded in bribing Andreas von Stierland, the master of the Order, who was still angry at Vykintas for the defeat in 1236. In 1251, Mindaugas agreed to receive baptism and relinquish control over some lands in western Lithuania, for which he was to receive a crown in return. In 1252, Tautvilas and his remaining allies attacked Mindaugas in Voruta, sometimes considered to be the first capital of Lithuania. The attack failed and Tautvilas' forces retreated to defend themselves in Tverai Castle, in the present-day Rietavas municipality. Vykintas died in or about 1253, and Tautvilas was forced to rejoin Daniel of Galicia. Daniel reconciled with Mindaugas in 1254; the Black Ruthenian lands were transferred to Roman, the son of Daniel. Vaišvilkas, the son of Mindaugas, decided to join a monastery. Tautvilas recognized Mindaugas' superiority and received Polatsk as a fiefdom.|$|E
5|$|Born on {{a remote}} {{property}} in rural Queensland, Dallas showed an early interest in aviation. He travelled to England at his own expense following the outbreak of World WarI and became a pilot in the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) in August 1915. Initially seeing action with No.1 Naval Wing on the Western Front in Caudrons and Nieuport11s, he was chosen to test {{one of the earliest}} Sopwith Triplanes. This became his favourite type, and he achieved many victories with it through 1916–17, earning the Distinguished Service <b>Order,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Distinguished Service Cross and Bar. He was appointed commanding officer of No.1 Squadron RNAS in June 1917. On the establishment of the Royal Air Force on 1April 1918, he took command of No.40 Squadron. Flying Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, he achieved further victories before being killed in action on 1June 1918 while on patrol near Liévin in northern France. He was buried in Pernes.|$|E
5|$|Contemplating {{advocacy}} {{work and}} a run for city council in Newark after graduation from law school, Booker {{lived in the city}} during his final year at Yale. After graduation, he served as staff attorney for the Urban Justice Center in New York and program coordinator of the Newark Youth Project. In 1998, Booker won an upset victory for a seat on the Newark City Council, defeating four-term incumbent George Branch. To draw attention to the problems of open-air drug dealing and associated violence, he went on a 10-day hunger strike and lived in a tent and later in a motor home near drug-dealing areas of the city. Booker proposed council initiatives that impacted housing, young people, law and <b>order,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> efficiency and transparency of city hall, but was regularly outvoted by all of his fellow councilors.|$|E
