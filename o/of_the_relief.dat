5|$|Isidore van Kinsbergen {{was known}} as a perfectionist. During his work in Borobudur, he {{selected}} the statues and panels which had been preserved best to take pictures of. He preferred a non-frontal angle, which shows a better depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> and the skills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> maker. To stress its timeless beauty, van Kinsbergen blocked out the original background in the negative film instead of putting up a black curtain during photographing.|$|E

Spafford co-authored A Centenary of Relief Society as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Relief</b> Society General Board. Women in Today's World {{was published in}} 1971, and A Woman's Reach was published in 1975.|$|E
5|$|From {{the onset}} of the {{disaster}} authorities provided initial assistance. President Violeta Chamorro stated in her speech to her nation on September 2, 1992, that no international assistance was needed. However, the Red Cross did assist in some operations while the National Civil Defence carried out much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> operations, with wounded people being transported to the Hospital Leon and Lenin-Fonseca Hospital.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Rowan, who espoused the Relief position, {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1822 {{representing}} Jefferson and Oldham counties. He immediately became the leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Relief</b> faction in the House. When Relief partisans decided to appeal Williams and Lapsley to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was at the time the court of last resort in the state, Rowan was chosen to argue the appeal before the court alongside George M. Bibb and Lieutenant Governor William T. Barry. Their efforts failed, however, as the Court found the measure unconstitutional, upholding the decisions of the lower courts.|$|E
5|$|On November 20, 1985, {{one week}} later, rescue efforts began to cease. Nearly 4,000relief workers and rescue team members were {{still searching for}} survivors, with little hope of finding any. By then, the {{official}} death toll was registered at 22,540people; additional counts showed that 3,300 were missing, 20,000homeless, and 4,000injured. Looters raided the ruins and survivors faced concerns of typhus and yellow fever. For most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> workers, their job was over.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to serving}} as Relief Society general president, Spafford served on several stake Relief Society boards. She was then {{appointed}} to the General Relief Society board and named editor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Relief</b> Society Magazine, a position she held for eight years. In 1942, Spafford was called as second counselor to Relief Society president Amy B. Lyman, replacing Doona D. Sorensen. She served as second counselor until 1945, when she was appointed Relief Society general president.|$|E

5|$|The Pakistani {{government}} was severely criticised for its handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> operations following the storm, both by local {{political leaders in}} East Pakistan and in the international media. In the December national elections, the opposition Awami League gained a landslide victory, gaining 160 of the 162 East Pakistani seats. Continuing unrest between East Pakistanis and the central government trigged the Bangladesh Liberation War, which concluded {{with the creation of}} the state of Bangladesh. This {{is one of the first}} times that a natural event helped to trigger a civil war.|$|E
5|$|The final piece <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Relief</b> Route {{associated}} with US 113 was the Puncheon Run Connector, which {{would provide a}} direct connection between US 13 and DE 1 and US 113. The connector and its partial interchange with US 113 were built between 1998 and 2000. In 2003, the same year the last portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Relief</b> Route was completed, DelDOT requested US 113 be eliminated from Milford to Dover {{in favor of the}} sole designation of DE 1 from Milford to Dover. AASHTO denied DelDOT's application at their spring 2003 meeting because the state did not address the status of US 113 Alternate. The organization approved DelDOT's application to also eliminate US 113 Alternate in addition to the MilfordDover portion of US 113 at their annual meeting later in 2003. Bay Road became an unnumbered highway between Exit 95 at Dover Air Force Base and the old northern terminus of US113 at US13 in Dover.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, its {{original}} provenance remains unknown. The relief was not archaeologically excavated, and thus {{we have no}} further information where it came from, or in which context it was discovered. An interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> thus relies on stylistic comparisons with other objects for which the date and place of origin have been established, on {{an analysis of the}} iconography, and on the interpretation of textual sources from Mesopotamian mythology and religion.|$|E

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1633, the relief force, led {{personally}} by the king and numbering about 25,000 (20,000 in the Polish-Lithuanian army, according to Jasienica), arrived near Smolensk; they reached Orsha on 17 August 1633. By {{the first days of}} September, the main body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> forces approaching Smolensk numbered around 14,000. The Russian army, recently reinforced, numbered 25,000. Only when Cossack reinforcements, led by Timofiy Orendarenko and numbering between 10,000 and 20,000, arrived on 17 September would the Commonwealth army gain numerical superiority. The Cossacks under Orendarenko and Marcin Kazanowski would raid the Russian rear lines, freeing the Polish-Lithuanian units under Radziwiłł and Gosiewski to join the effort to break the siege.|$|E
5|$|Close to the {{controversial}} cave are other monuments. One {{of them is}} a small shrine consisting of a 7th-century rock carving of Anantashayana Vishnu, or reclining Vishnu with Lakshmi and Garuda in namaste posture. Vishnu is shown restarting the cosmic cycle by giving birth to all of existence. Above the reclining carved relief are the ten avatars of Vishnu – Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Buddha and Kalki. Between the Narasimha and Vamana is shown a relief of Brahma cord connected to Vishnu's navel. To the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> is depicted the Trinity – Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma, while to the right is a human couple and a mother cow with a calf feeding.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{tensions}} of the Cold War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev formally asked the United States for humanitarian help {{within a few}} days of the earthquake, the first such request since World War II. One hundred and thirteen countries sent substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union in the form of rescue equipment, search teams and medical supplies, but private donations and assistance from non-governmental organizations also had {{a large part of the}} international effort. While transporting some of these supplies to the region, a Soviet aircraft carrying 9 crew members and 69 military personnel and a transport plane from Yugoslavia were both destroyed in separate incidents. In support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> effort, recording artists united to produce several music-related contributions for the victims of the quake. A song was produced by a duo of French composers (including Charles Aznavour) and a studio album that featured songs donated by mainstream rock bands was released from the Rock Aid Armenia effort by the British music industry.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} fertile {{crescent}} civilizations {{are considered the}} oldest in history, {{at the time the}} Burney Relief was made other late bronze age civilizations were equally in full bloom. Travel and cultural exchange were not commonplace, but nevertheless possible. To the east, Elam with its capital Susa was in frequent military conflict with Isin, Larsa and later Babylon. Even further, the Indus Valley Civilization was already past its peak, and in China, the Erlitou culture blossomed. To the southwest, Egypt was ruled by the 12th dynasty, further to the west the Minoan civilization, centred on Crete with the Old Palace in Knossos, dominated the Mediterranean. To the north of Mesopotamia, the Anatolian Hittites were establishing their Old Kingdom over the Hattians; they brought an end to Babylon's empire with the sack of the city in 1531BCE. Indeed, Collon mentions this raid as possibly being the reason for the damage to the right-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of {{meetings}} beginning on 25 April, Eichmann met with Joel Brand, a Hungarian Jew and member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Relief</b> and Rescue Committee (RRC). Eichmann later testified that Berlin had authorised him to allow emigration of a million Jews in exchange for 10,000 trucks equipped to handle the wintry conditions on the Eastern Front. Nothing came of the proposal, as the Western Allies refused to consider the offer. In June 1944 Eichmann was involved in negotiations with Rudolf Kasztner that resulted in the rescue of 1,684 people, who were sent by train to safety in Switzerland in exchange for three suitcases full of diamonds, gold, cash, and securities.|$|E
5|$|Jacobsen quotes textual {{evidence}} that the Akkadian word eššebu (owl) corresponds to the Sumerian word ninna, and that the Sumerian Dnin-ninna (Divine lady ninna) corresponds to the Akkadian Ishtar. The Sumerian ninna can also be translated as the Akkadian kilili, {{which is also a}} name or epithet for Ishtar. Inanna/Ishtar as harlot or goddess of harlots was a well known theme in Mesopotamian mythology and in one text, Inanna is called kar-kid (harlot) and ab-ba--šú, which in Akkadian would be rendered kilili. Thus {{there appears to be a}} cluster of metaphors linking prostitute and owl and the goddess Inanna/Ishtar; this could match the most enigmatic component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> to a well known aspect of Ishtar. Jacobsen concludes that this link would be sufficient to explain talons and wings, and adds that nudity could indicate the relief was originally the house-altar of a bordello.|$|E

5|$|Keseberg {{brought a}} {{defamation}} suit against several members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> party who {{accused him of}} murdering Tamsen Donner. The court awarded him $1 in damages, but also made him pay court costs. An 1847 story printed in the California Star described Keseberg's actions in ghoulish terms and his near-lynching by the salvage party, reporting that he preferred eating human flesh over the cattle and horses that had become exposed in the spring thaw. Historian Charles McGlashan amassed enough material to indict Keseberg {{for the murder of}} Tamsen Donner, but after interviewing Keseberg he concluded that no murder occurred. Eliza Donner Houghton also believed Keseberg to be innocent.|$|E
5|$|No one at Truckee Lake {{had died}} during the interim between the {{departure}} of the first relief party and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said that her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by the organs of their father. The rescuers discovered that three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.|$|E
5|$|The A354 road {{connects the}} town to the A35 trunk road in Dorchester, and terminates at Easton on the Isle of Portland. The A353 road runs east from Weymouth {{to the south of}} Warmwell, where it connects with the A352 to the Isle of Purbeck and Wareham. The B3157 road runs west from Weymouth to the south of Bridport where it terminates and connects to the A35. In the 1980s the town centre was {{bypassed}} by the A354 to Portland, but the government's road building policy changed before a proposed relief road could be completed. Before completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relief</b> road, the A354 followed its original route through Upwey and Broadwey, where traffic problems were common at peak tourist times, particularly on event days such as the carnival.|$|E
40|$|Parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southwest Palace <b>of</b> Sennacherib (700 BC), {{which were}} located in Nineveh (Iraq), are now {{destroyed}} by the ongoing conflict in Iraq and Syria. The palace rooms used to be decorated with numerous Assyrian reliefs. Luckily, digital pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site are available thanks to an Italian expedition in 2002. <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> this research is to physically reproduce <b>the</b> destroyed <b>reliefs</b> using this photo database.
