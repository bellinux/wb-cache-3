500|$|St Mary's Lodge {{was built}} around 1470 as an {{addition}} to the late 12th-century buildings that formed the gatehouse at the main entrance to the abbey, – now the Marygate entrance to the gardens. Some remains of the 12th-century gatehouse can still be seen, in particular the archway attached {{to the side of}} the lodge. [...] The lodge is built of stone, and does not contain timber framing like the nearby Hospitium. [...] The lodge, along with the attached railings, gates and gate piers are all Grade I listed buildings, which means that they are of <b>outstanding</b> <b>interest.</b> [...] Originally, the lodge may have been used as a guesthouse for the abbey, and was the point where the poor could claim alms from the abbey. After the abbey's dissolution, the lodge became a courthouse until 1722, when part of the building became the Brown Cow pub. In 1840 John Philips, the Yorkshire Museum's curator, restored and converted it to use as his home while retaining its external appearance. [...] The lodge subsequently became used as offices, and during the early 21st century became the headquarters of the York Museums Trust.|$|E

5000|$|South Wales is an {{area with}} many {{features}} of <b>outstanding</b> <b>interest</b> to geologists, who have for long used the area for University field trips. [...] This varied and accessible region has provided a written record of geological interest that dates to the 12th century, when Giraldus Cambrensis noted pyritous shales near Newport. Some of the first published representations of fossils were of fossil plants from coal measures near Neath (Gibson late 17th century). The British geologists Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison did fundamentally important work in South Wales on Old Red Sandstone and the underlying rocks. The first volume of memoirs (1846) published by the Geological Survey contained a conspectus of the geology of South Wales that set a template for all future work.|$|E

50|$|Emmanuel Nwude is a Nigerian notable advance-fee fraud {{artist and}} former Director of Union Bank of Nigeria.

After Nick Leeson's trading losses at Barings Bank, and the looting of the Iraqi Central Bank by Qusay Hussein, the crime was the largest in banking history. After a large-scale attack on a town in Nigeria in August 2016, Mr. Nwude was alleged to be a ringleader and was arrested on murder charges. He remains in custody.|$|E

The latter could receive only the title retained by the vendor—in short, nothing. However, the case was ultimately decided in favor of P2, over P1. The courts of equity could not bring themselves to decide against a totally innocent (without notice) purchaser.|$|R
