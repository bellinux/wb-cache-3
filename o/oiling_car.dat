It derailed twelve kilometres away in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, Canada, igniting the Bakken light crude oil from 44 DOT-111 <b>oil</b> <b>cars.</b> Approximately 3-4 minutes after the initial blast, {{there was a second}} explosion from 12 <b>oil</b> <b>cars.</b> A series of smaller blasts followed into the early morning hours, igniting the oil of a total 73 <b>oil</b> <b>cars.</b> The disaster killed 42 people with five more missing presumed dead.|$|R

40|$|In this study,five {{contaminated}} soil samples with benzene, used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> and diesel {{were collected from}} five car workshops in Kuala Lumpur area,Malaysia. The microbial strains were isolated using selective media(agar containing crude oil,used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> and benzene). Microorganisms were identified by biochemical test and then used in biodegradation experiment of two types of crude oils(Miri and Masila) and used <b>car</b> <b>oil.</b> Qualitative determination of the degradation capacity of crude <b>oils</b> and used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> was driven in 24 well cell culture cluster-flat bottom,adding to each well nutrient broth medium,crude <b>oil</b> or used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> and the isolated microorganism cultured in the tubes(single and mixtures) and incubated at 27 -°C for 30 days. For hydrocarbons rate of biodegradation measurement,sterilized soil was distributed in petri dishes, 3 % w/w of two crude <b>oils</b> and used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> were added,separately and then supplemented with isolated strains(single and mixtures). One Petri dish {{was used as a}} control without any microbial addition. Absorbance was determined by spectrophotometer at 360 nm and at 340 nm for crude <b>oils</b> and used <b>car</b> <b>oil,</b> respectively. The effect of aeration,added NPK and added microbial degraders on biodegradation of Masila crude <b>oil</b> and used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> was studied. Soil was supplemented with 20 % Masila crude <b>oil</b> and used <b>car</b> oil,separately. The soil was distributed into containers. Container(1) was aerated twice a week,NPK 1 : 1 : 1 was added to container(2),mixture of all isolated strains with degrading capacity was added to container(3. Finally, NPK with continued aeration in addition to the microbial mixture were applied to the last container (4). One container was used as a control without any addition (soil and contaminant only). Colony Forming Unit (CFU) of total heterotrophic microbes and hydrocarbon utilizing microbes,PH and percentage of oils degradation were determined. 22 microbial strains were isolated and identified as,Achrombacter,Aeromonas,Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas,Corynebacterium,Penicillium,Enterobacteriaceae (Enteric rods),Actinobacillus,Streptomyces,budding yeast cells, Cladosporum and Geotrichum spp. The highest biodegradation result in Miri crude oil after 30 days were 54. 33 % and 84. 61 % for strain Z 13 (Corynebacterium spp.) and microbial mixture of the strains isolated from Rawang and Serdang area (MS),respectively. While in Masila crude oil was 33. 81 % for Strain A 3 (Klebsiella pneumonia) and 49. 47 % for microbial mixture of the strains isolated from Serdang (Smix). In used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> biodegradation experiment,strain Z 4 (Corynebacterium) had the highest degradation with 72. 9 %. While microbial mixture of the strains isolated from Kajang (Zmix) had 72. 4 % of degradation. In the experiment of the effect of aeration,added NPK and added microbial degraders on biodegradation,the aerated container showed 56. 62 % of degradation after 42 days in Masila crude oil,while the container which contained NPK and was aerated and supplemented with isolated strains showed 66 % degradation in used <b>car</b> <b>oil.</b> Generally,two bacterial species and one fungal species isolated were found to be effective degraders (Corynebacterium spp,Streptomyces spp. and Cladosporum spp,), respectively. The highest degradability by single strains was on used <b>car</b> <b>oil</b> which might be due to the adaptability of the isolated microbes to use it. The microbial mixtures showed higher effect on the biodegradation than the single strains. Aeration found {{to be the most important}} in the effect on the biodegradation results...|$|R

50|$|Some engines have an oil cooler, a {{separate}} small radiator {{to cool the}} engine <b>oil.</b> <b>Cars</b> with an automatic transmission often have extra connections to the radiator, allowing the transmission fluid to transfer its heat to the coolant in the radiator. These may be either oil-air radiators, as for a smaller version of the main radiator. More simply they may be oil-water coolers, where an oil pipe is inserted inside the water radiator. Though the water is hotter than the ambient air, its higher thermal conductivity offers comparable cooling (within limits) from a less complex and thus cheaper and more reliable oil cooler. Less commonly, power steering fluid, brake fluid, and other hydraulic fluids may be cooled by an auxiliary radiator on a vehicle.|$|R

Jeff D. Makholm examines why so many dangerous <b>oil</b> tank <b>cars</b> are on the rails, arguing that the main cause is a lack of federal licencing authority over oil pipelines. He writes that oil pipelines in America are governed by a myriad of regulatory agencies and authorities which makes expanding the pipeline system difficult and costly.
