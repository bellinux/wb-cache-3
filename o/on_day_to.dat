40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the efficacy of adding a 7 -day aprepitant schedule to a 5 HT 3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone for patients with germ cell tumors receiving first-line 5 -day cisplatin-based chemotherapy. METHODS: In a single-arm, open-label, multi-center, phase 2 trial, chemo-naive patients received aprepitant 125 mg PO (per oral) <b>on</b> <b>day</b> 1 and 80 mg PO <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 2 <b>to</b> 7, a 5 HT 3 receptor antagonist <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 <b>to</b> 5, and dexamethasone 8 mg <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 <b>to</b> 8. The primary endpoint was no emesis (vomiting or dry retching) during <b>days</b> 1 <b>to</b> 7 of cycle 1. RESULTS: Fifty patients were recruited. For cycle 1, proportions reporting no emesis <b>on</b> <b>day</b> 1, no emesis <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 <b>to</b> 7, no nausea <b>on</b> <b>day</b> 1, and no nausea <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 <b>to</b> 7 were 96, 82, 71, and 27 %, respectively. The efficacy was maintained in all cycles with over 80 % of patients reporting no emesis <b>on</b> any given <b>day</b> of any given cycle. Emesis was more common <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 4 <b>to</b> 7 (68 % episodes) than <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 <b>to</b> 3 (32 % episodes). Over any 24 -h period, 49 % of patients with emesis reported no more than two episodes, and 62 % of patients with nausea reported intensity as 3 or less on a scale from 0 to 10. There were no unexpected or serious adverse events reported. CONCLUSION: Adding 7 <b>days</b> of aprepitant <b>to</b> a 5 HT 3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone effectively controlled acute and delayed emesis with 5 -day cisplatin regimens. Days of nausea were more common than days of vomiting. I. N. Olver, P. Grimison, M. Chatfield, M. R. Stockler, G. C. Toner, V. Gebski, R. Harrup, C. Underhill, G. Kichenadasse, N. Singhal, I. D.

P.V.Narasimha Rao (28 June 1921 - 23 December 2004), an ardent devotee of Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, was also there. Being a scholar in multiple languages including Sanskrit, Narasimha Rao composed and read out a poem in praise of Kanchi Chandrasekharendra Saraswati almost instantaneously. Having heard it, Kanchi Paramachaarya instantaneously made some prosodic amendments to it. At the same time, Chandole Maharshi also composed a poem on Kanchi Paramachaarya and recited it loudly. Narasimha Rao has said to Kanchi Seer {{that there are some}} mistakes in the poem. But, Kanchi Paramachaarya said that by birth, by nature, by character and by scholarship, Chandole Saastri is an error-free personality. In fact, though both these Maharshis lived thousands of miles away, both used to be in communication with each other. Chandole Saastri's conversations with Goddess Bala <b>on</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> day basis are simultaneously heard by Kanchi Paramachaarya wherever he is. When both happened to meet at any place on certain occasions, Kanchi Paramachaarya used to ask Chandole Maharshi to recite these poetic conversations with Bala once again before him or He (Kanchi Seer) used to reproduce himself those conversations (which Chandole Maharshi had with Goddess Bala) and used to ask him to explain why he had to discuss those matters with Goddess Bala.

5000|$|Following his Lumina vine de la Răsărit lecture, Sadoveanu became {{noted for}} his {{positive}} portrayals of communization and collectivization. In particular, Sadoveanu offered praise {{to one of}} the major pillars of Stalinism, the 1936 Soviet Constitution. In 1945, claiming to have been [...] "flashed upon" [...] by [...] "Stalin's argumentation", he urged the public to read the document for its [...] "sincerity"; elsewhere, he equated reading the constitution with [...] "a mystical revelation". Adrian Cioroianu describes this as [...] "an office assignment" [...] from the ARLUS, {{at a time when the}} group was circulating free translated copies of the Soviet constitution. The enthusiasm of his writings also manifested itself in his public behavior: according to his ARLUS colleague Iorgu Iordan, Sadoveanu was emotional during the 1945 Soviet trip, shedding tears of joy upon visiting a day care center in the countryside. Running in the 1946 election, Sadoveanu blamed the old political class in general for the problems faced by Romanian peasants, including the major drought of that year. By then, his political partners were making use of his literary fame, and his electoral pamphlet read: [...] "There is no doubt that the thousands of people who have read his works will rush out <b>on</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> vote for him." [...] After 1948, when the Romanian communist regime was installed, Sadoveanu directed his praise toward the new authorities. In 1952, as Romania adopted its second republican constitution and the authorities intensified repression against anti-communists, Sadoveanu made some of his most controversial statements. Declaring the defunct kingdom to have been a [...] "long interval of organized injustice and crooked development in all areas", he presented the new order as an era of social justice, human dignity, available culture and universal public education.|$|E
