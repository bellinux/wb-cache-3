40|$|The {{investigations}} of local police officers for causing {{the deaths of}} unarmed civilians in Ferguson, Missouri and Staten Island, New York have generated significant national discourse about the fairness and transparency of grand jury proceedings. This article addresses one crucial aspect of this ongoing debate; that is, whether witnesses {{before the grand jury}} should be allowed {{to talk to each other}} and to the media about the contents of their testimony. In the federal system and in the majority of states that still employ the grand jury as an investigative and charging tool, <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> grand jury secrecy do not extend to the witnesses themselves. Only persons performing an “official function” before the grand jury are typically covered by the oath of secrecy. Absent a contract or court order, grand jury witnesses are free to talk with each other and to the media. Nevertheless, prosecutors often seek to handcuff grand jury witnesses in talking to others about their testimony by drafting one-sided cooperation agreements that impose <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> on grand jury witnesses in exchange for charging or sentencing concessions. Courts on occasion also impose gag orders on grand jury witnesses as part of formal immunity orders. In this article, the author argues that such efforts by prosecutors and courts to impose secrecy obligations on grand jury witnesses violate attorney discipline rules and the First Amendment. As importantly, they impede the target’s access to information essential to enable him to marshal a defense, thus undermining the grand jury’s historic function as a shield against unfounded prosecutions...|$|R

On the one hand, forensic medicine specialists owe a duty of confidentiality to the patient. On the other hand, they also owe a duty to third parties.

Objective As an international group with experience in pediatric research, biomarkers, and the ethics of research in children, we highlight the ethical issues of undertaking biomarker research in children in these environments. Discussion Significant issues include undertaking research in vulnerable communities, especially in developing countries; managing community expectations; obtaining appropriate consent to conduct the research; the potential conflicts of obtaining permission from an ethics review board in an economically developed country to perform research in a community that may have different cultural values; returning research results to participants and communities when the researchers are uncertain of how to interpret the results; and the conflicting ethical <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> maintaining participant <b>confidentiality</b> when information about harm or illegal activities mandate reporting to authorities.

40|$|Extract] Section 264 {{is one of}} a raft of {{provisions}} at the disposal of the Tax Office authorising it to require persons to furnish information and evidence to it. It sits alongside s 263, which is the primary provision authorising the Tax Office to have access to buildings and documents and to make copies: see [263. 10]. Section 264 complements this power by requiring any person to whom a notice is issued to furnish information, to attend and give evidence and/or produce documents. It is, however, an independent power and not dependent on the Tax Office first seeking to exercise its powers under s 263. It further complements s 162, which authorises the Tax Office to require a person to lodge a tax return or furnish further information about their financial affairs. Section 264 can, however, be directed to persons other than the taxpayer whose affairs are at issue. This power is not without its limitations and is reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. In particular, it must be appropriately authorised, exercised by notice in writing and contain sufficient particularity: see [264. 100]. It must be exercised bona fide and solely {{for the purposes of the}} Act: see [264. 420]. Furthermore, notices issued under s 264 (1) (b) must be issued for the purposes of identifying a person's income or income-tax assessment: see [264. 620]. The exercise of the power is not subject to any privilege against incrimination, but it is subject to legal professional privilege: see [264. 820]. It should be an acknowledged that the policy of the Tax Office is to only use the power under s 264 as a last resort as requests for information will, initially at least, be typically made on a less formal basis. As it is no defence to an addressee to argue an <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> persons concerned about breaching any <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> by supplying information to the Tax Office should request that a s 264 notice be issued to them. It should also be noted that, under s 353 - 10 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (TAA), the Tax Office has similar powers to those contained in ss 263 and 264 of ITAA 1936. While s 353 - 10 is the primary provision utilised by the Tax Office to acquire information in relation to a goods and services tax assessment, it is also relevant to the administration of the TAA (including the collection of income tax). In fact, it is the preferred information gathering power of the Tax Office for use in debt collection work. Section 264 is considered by the Tax Office as more suitable to lodgement activities – although if the Tax Office wishes to acquire books or documents then this can also be achieved pursuant a search warrant obtained by the Australian Federal Police under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (or by the Australian Crime Commission under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002). A failure to comply with a s 264 notice would amount to an offence under either s 8 C or 8 D of TAA, with the quantum of the penalties applicable dealt with in Taxation Administration Act 1953 s 8 E: see [264. 860]...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Confidentiality {{has been}} {{regarded}} as an essential attribute of arbitration over litigation due to its “private and confidential” nature in arbitral proceedings. Such attribute of arbitration has been subject to debates over recent years from different scholars {{in the world of}} arbitration. Two common law jurisdictions have been the result of such debates. The United Kingdom (England) who has for decades assumed the existence of an implied <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> in its arbitration proceedings while Australia has rejected such an implied obligation and have held that confidentiality is not an essential attribute of arbitration. In Tanzania, the current arbitration laws are silent with respect to confidentiality provisions {{and there seems to be}} no literature or any article written on the subject matter. This dissertation therefore aims to introduce the doctrine of confidentiality in Tanzania by examining the two common law approaches case-to-case basis and to show how a developing nation like Tanzania could implement one or combination of the different approaches into its arbitration system. Chapter 1 introduces the doctrine of confidentiality in arbitral proceedings by examining how different scholars have interpreted the concept and by distinguishing the doctrine from privacy. This chapter also covers the nature of confidentiality in arbitral proceedings and the main actors involved in preserving the confidentiality obligation in the arbitral process. Chapter 2 provides for an overview of the arbitration system in Tanzania as well covering the position of the doctrine in its arbitration proceedings. Chapter 3 gives a comprehensive overview of the doctrine of confidentiality in both England and Australia and its implementation to the Tanzanian arbitration system. Chapter 4 concludes and provides for recommendations with further research to be carried out on the doctrine of confidentiality in Tanzania in case of a future arbitration dispute arises on the subject matter...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers a}} narrow issue {{within the law}} of intellectual property that has been characterised as a problematic lacuna in the law of confidence. That is, whether direct liability is available through the composite jurisdiction in confidence in respect of the illicit acquisition of confidential commercial information in circumstances where liability is not otherwise available on an independent basis; that is, where the claim would otherwise fail as the act of acquisition is itself lawful. The resolution of this issue is relevant to the legal treatment of what is popularly termed ‘corporate espionage’. The argument is structured in four sections. Sections one and two consider {{the phenomenon of the}} illicit acquisition of confidential commercial information, its complex nature and function in the contemporary commercial context, and, the application of foundational legal principles drawn from property, tort and the developing English law of restitution to the issue identified. A comparative treatment of the issue is also presented in respect of the American law of trade secrets which offers protection against appropriation ‘by improper means’; a model which has received some credible academic support for partial-incorporation into English law. The third section considers the application of conventional confidence doctrine to the issue identified {{in the form of the}} sui generis action for breach of confidence. The argument considers whether an <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> might be implied or constructed between the parties, and, some older authority seemingly supportive of the imposition of liability through a conduct-based test of ‘surreptitious acquisition’. Consideration is also given to recent developments in the protection of personal privacy. These various approaches are rejected as inadequate, unsuitable, or insufficiently established to provide effective legal treatment of the problem. In the last section, the discussion proceeds from the proposition that Article 39 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, incorporating aspects of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, may be used as a basis for re-orienting the English law of confidence on the point.
