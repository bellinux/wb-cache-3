5|$|Cranor spent $42 million {{restructuring}} the company's operations worldwide. He invested an additional $50 million to refurbish outlets and $20 {{million on a}} new computer system to link outlet cash registers to the kitchen, drive-through window, manager's office and company headquarters. Cranor also expanded the chain into non-traditional locations, beginning with a 150 sq ft limited menu kiosk at a General Motors assembly plant in Dayton, Ohio. Between 1986 and 1991, the chain built a further 2,000 outlets to bring its total number to 8,500, and sales grew from $3.5 to $6.2 billion. The chain {{had to contend with}} the rise <b>of</b> <b>grilled</b> chicken as Americans became increasingly health conscious. KFC found itself competing against the growing El Pollo Loco restaurant chain, as well as with Burger King, which had just introduced the BK Broiler, a grilled chicken burger. Delays in product development, cramped kitchens and the ongoing franchisee contract dispute prevented the chain from rolling out a grilled product of its own.|$|E
5|$|International {{fast-food}} restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's {{have had a}} variety <b>of</b> <b>grilled</b> chicken sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, {{and was one of}} the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.|$|E

25|$|The purpose <b>of</b> <b>grilling</b> was {{to permit}} the {{canceling}} ink to be better absorbed into the stamp paper, thus preventing reuse of stamps by washing out the cancellation marks.

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>grilling</b> for 20 {{minutes on}} the hardness, {{cohesiveness}} and adhesiveness of poultry (breast muscle), pork (chop) and beef (hind leg) was observed. Hardness of chicken meat increased by the 5 th minute <b>of</b> <b>grilling</b> with subsequent stagnation to 15 th minute of grilling; after {{this time there was}} a sharp rise in hardness. By analyzing the cohesiveness of chicken meat, a decrease to the 10 th minute <b>of</b> <b>grilling</b> with subsequent rise was found. For pork and beef, hardness and cohesiveness increased to the 20 th minute <b>of</b> <b>grilling.</b> Adhesiveness showed upwards trend throughout the grilling time for all three types of meat. The highest weight losses in % (w/w) were exhibited, during grilling, beef (36. 5); then, poultry (31. 4) and the lowest values were for pork (26. 5) ...|$|R

5000|$|The first type <b>of</b> <b>grill</b> to be tried, termed by philatelists the [...] "A" [...] grill, {{was applied}} to the entire stamp. Stamps so treated were {{distributed}} to post offices for testing in August 1867, and apparently satisfactory, as National received a contract stipulating use <b>of</b> <b>grilling</b> for all stamps. However, the actual practice <b>of</b> <b>grilling</b> on a large scale had not been completely worked out, and the process significantly weakened sheets, resulting in tearing during perforation and general production handling. National soon switched to the use of a small rectangular pattern of indentations, and subsequent <b>grills</b> were all <b>of</b> this form.|$|R

500|$|One of the company's first {{forays into}} {{healthier}} products was in 1983 with introduction of its salad bar. The salad bar met with light to moderate success, but the company's franchise holders complained of high operating costs and a poor return on investment. Part of the product, a pita salad, was quickly {{dropped from the}} salad bar, as were {{plans to use the}} bar unit to boost breakfast sales. In 1987 the company augmented its salad bar with a test line of prepackaged salads, including chef and garden salads. The salad bar was eventually eliminated in favor of packaged salads. In 1990, BK introduced a new salad line accompanied by a licensing agreement with Paul Newman's Newman's Own, Inc., whose salad dressings accompanied the products. Burger King revamped its salad line again in 2004, with the introduction of its Fire Grilled Salad products. Burger King sought to differentiate this line of salads by packaging the warm meat toppings—a choice <b>of</b> <b>grilled</b> shrimp or broiled chicken—separately from the cold salad; this added the appearance of an additional layer of freshness. At one point in the United States, the salads are pre-made off-site. They are sold with two toppings and Ken's Foods Ken's Steakhouse brand salad dressing. Internationally, the salads vary in composition and style from market to market. In all markets, salads are one of the items targeted at female and health-conscious consumers. In parts of Europe, salads are sold under the [...] "King Delight" [...] or [...] "LA Range" [...] banner.|$|E

McDonald's has performed a rather large advertising campaign for the McArabia since its introduction in 2003, largely focusing on the Arabian-themed nature of the sandwich, and it appears to have worked well.

2500|$|Mehmed II {{established}} the basic {{layout of the}} palace. His private quarters would be located at the highest point of the promontory. Various buildings and pavilions surrounded the innermost core and winded down the promontory towards {{the shores of the}} Bosphorus. The entire complex was surrounded by high walls, some of which date back to the Byzantine acropolis. This basic layout governed the pattern of future renovations and extensions. The layout and appearance of Topkapı Palace was unique amongst not only European travellers, but also Islamic or oriental palaces. European travellers described it as [...] "irregular, asymmetric, non-axial, and [...] un-monumental proportions". Ottomans called it [...] "The Palace of Felicity". A strict, ceremonial, codified daily life ensured imperial seclusion from the rest of world. One of the central tenets was the observation of silence in the inner courtyards. The principle of imperial seclusion is a tradition that was codified by Mehmed II in 1477 and 1481 in the Kanunname Code, which regulated the rank order of court officials, the administrative hierarchy, and protocol matters. This principle of increased seclusion over time was reflected in the construction style and arrangements of various halls and buildings. The architects had to ensure that even within the palace, the sultan and his family could enjoy a maximum of privacy and discretion, making use <b>of</b> <b>grilled</b> windows and building secret passageways.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, the {{experiment}} <b>of</b> <b>grilling</b> was tried in 1867, where tiny squares were embossed into the paper after the stamp was printed, {{the idea being}} that this would break up the paper fibers and let more ink be absorbed into the paper. But this also made the stamps more prone to tearing, and grilling was abandoned around 1871. The more unusual types <b>of</b> <b>grills</b> are now among the great rarities of US stamps.|$|R
