5|$|From Alaska to Northern California, coastal {{cutthroat}} trout in sea-run, resident stream and lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run {{cutthroat trout}} fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat trout along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} cutthroat trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department <b>of</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Game,</b> the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat trout subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the mountainous}} and forested {{sections}} of the drainage basin lie protected under national forest lands. There are several campgrounds overseen by the U.S. Forest Service in {{the headwaters of the}} Potlatch River watershed. Fishing is also good in the Potlatch River and many of its tributaries. Anglers are only permitted to catch brook trout, cutthroat trout, and rainbow and steelhead trout. The Department <b>of</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Game</b> annually stocks fish in the river. Fishing is permitted on the Potlatch from its mouth upstream to where Moose Creek joins the river near Bovill, {{as well as on the}} East Fork.|$|E

5|$|Coyote {{attacks on}} humans are {{uncommon}} and rarely cause serious injuries, {{due to the}} relatively small size of the coyote, but have been increasingly frequent, especially in California. There have been two confirmed fatal attacks: one on a three-year-old named Kelly Keen in Glendale, California and another on a nineteen-year-old named Taylor Mitchell in Nova Scotia, Canada. In the 30 {{years leading up to}} March 2006, at least 160 attacks occurred in the United States, mostly in the Los Angeles County area. Data from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services, the California Department <b>of</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Game,</b> and other sources show that while 41 attacks occurred during the period of 1988–1997, 48 attacks were verified from 1998 through 2003. The majority of these incidents occurred in Southern California near the suburban-wildland interface.|$|E
5|$|Of the 28 {{fish species}} {{present in the}} forest, 11 are not native and have been {{introduced}} by humans. Rainbow trout, chinook salmon, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, and mountain whitefish are all native {{to some of the}} forest's waterways, while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's salmonids. The forest's management indicator species is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. Sockeye salmon are native to the Salmon River watershed {{in the northern part of}} the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of sockeye salmon. However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and Deadwood reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational fishing opportunities, the Idaho Department <b>of</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Game</b> stocks several of the forest's waterways with rainbow trout, while reservoirs are also stocked with Kokanee or chinook salmon and Lake Cascade is stocked with coho salmon and steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout.|$|E
5|$|Western {{burrowing}} owls {{were originally}} {{listed as a}} species of special concern by the California Department <b>of</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Game</b> in 1979. California's population declined 60% from the 1980s to the early 1990s, and continues to decline at roughly 8% per year. A 1992–93 survey reported little to no breeding burrowing owls {{in most of the}} western counties in the Bay Area, leaving only Alameda, Contra Costa, and Solano counties as remnants of a once large breeding range. Bald eagles were once common in the Bay Area, but habitat destruction and thinning of eggs from DDT poisoning reduced the California state population to 35 nesting pairs. Bald eagles disappeared from the Bay Area in 1915, and only began returning in recent years. In the 1980s an effort to re-introduce the species to the area began with the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group and the San Francisco Zoo importing birds and eggs from Vancouver Island and northeastern California, and there are now nineteen nesting couples in eight of the Bay Area's nine counties. Other once absent species that have returned to the Bay Area include Swainson’s hawk, white tailed kite, and the osprey.|$|E

5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed, including speckled dace, longnose dace, rainbow trout (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside shiner, sculpin, bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of rainbow trout, has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (rainbow) trout in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department <b>of</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Game</b> began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E

40|$|To obtain current {{data on the}} North American {{river otter}} (Lontra canadensis) {{population}} in Idaho, licensed trappers were mandated to surrender river otter carcasses through provisions of the Idaho Department <b>of</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Game’s</b> mandatory harvest report. Throughout the 2002 - 2003 and 2003 - 2004 trapping seasons, 237 river otter carcasses were collected. Necropsies were performed to assess age and sex, general body condition, reproductive rates, and concentrations of environmental contaminants in the livers. Reproductive rates were determined by counting corpora lutea and blastocysts in female river otters. Livers were dissected and concentrations of environmental contaminants were determined for the following toxins: mercury and other heavy metals, organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). No negative relationships were found between environmental concentrations and female reproductive rates or presence of sperm. The majority of otters had contaminant levels well within what is considered background levels. Data {{from the present study}} suggest the river otter population in Idaho is stable to increasing. Based on the results from the present study, I conclude that the Idaho Department <b>of</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Game’s</b> current management <b>of</b> river otters, including the existing harvest season and quota, are not a detriment to the population...|$|R

During 1973 and early 1974, several methods of determining population size were used to estimate the spawning population size of Pacific mackerel stocks north of Point Eugenia, Baja California.

Two alternate spawning biomass estimates also were obtained using partyboat catches fitted to regression lines. The estimates derived by these alternate methods are 4, 675 tons, and 8, 380 tons.
