5|$|Gomes Lourenço, of the Honour of Varzim, {{was a very}} {{influential}} knight and godfather of King Denis.

5|$|In a {{departure}} from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym Derwid. Mostly waltzes, tangos, foxtrots and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish actors' songs. Their place in Lutosławski's output {{may be seen as}} less incongruous given his own performances of cabaret music during the war, and in the light <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> by marriage to the famous Polish cabaret singer Kalina Jędrusik (who was his wife's sister-in-law).|$|E

5|$|Early {{shooting}} {{put more}} {{focus on the}} pool playing, but during filming Rossen {{made the decision to}} place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters.

For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up on top of him. Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat Fats.|$|E

5|$|Few {{people in}} London {{other than their}} close friends knew that the couple were not married. Hogg's family had heard rumours that he was {{planning}} to marry, and had been curious to know whom he had chosen. They were very upset after hearing of his plans for a union with Jane. His mother was unwilling to introduce Jane to their social circles as Mrs Hogg, which ensured that she would never visit them. Hogg did not enter his family's house in Durham for seven years after he informed them <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> with Jane. Word of their union spread throughout Durham, and Hogg stopped practising law there for some time because of the damage to his reputation. Several of their friends were supportive of their union. Mary Shelley particularly approved of their match, despite having earlier been jealous of the time Hogg had spent with Jane.|$|E
5|$|Henry Brougham became Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom after a Whig {{election}} victory. In 1833 {{he appointed}} Hogg to a lucrative {{position on the}} royal commission to examine the municipal corporations. Hogg became a fierce critic of the Municipal Corporations Act; he preferred a more deliberate and less ideological approach than most of his fellow commission members, and was {{considered by many to}} be an unusually conservative Whig. His commission work required him to be away from home for an extended period, which proved to be very difficult for Jane. She knew that Hogg was free to abandon her at any time because they were not legally married. After receiving his appointment, Hogg finally visited Norton House after a seven-year absence, but his family had not altered their opinion <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> with Jane.|$|E

During this period, influenced by his cousin, Emilio Sereni, he adopted the ideals of communism to which he remained loyal {{for the rest of his}} life. He formed a relationship with Helene Marianne Nordblom, a Swedish woman working in Paris as a nanny. Whether because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> with Marianne, his interesting work on isomers, or the deteriorating political situation in Italy, he turned down an opportunity in 1937 to apply for a tenured position at the University of Rome to stay in Paris.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> with Katz and the money she had received. Corzine was elected {{governor}} despite the scandal. In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone and e-mail to lobby for a renewal of the negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct.|$|E
5|$|Mark's early storylines often {{revolved}} around {{his relationship with}} Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer).

5|$|Nosaka {{attempted}} to brand the JCP as a populist party supporting Japan's peaceful transition into socialism, but his strategy was criticized {{within the party}} and within the Soviet Union.

He re-emerged to lead the JCP again in 1955, after which he {{attempted to}} disrupt the US-Japan Security Treaty by organizing public demonstrations, but he generally supported the JCP's role as a peaceful party. In 1958 Nosaka became Chairman of the JCP, a position he held until retirement {{at the age of}} 90, after which he was declared Honorary Chairman. Nosaka joined the faculty of Keio University, and he was widely idolized among left-wing intellectuals until shortly before his death, when the fall of the Soviet Union exposed controversial aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>relationship</b> with Stalin's Communist regime.|$|E
