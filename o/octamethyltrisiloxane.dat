40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on the {{thermodynamic}} optimization of organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) for power generation and CHP from different average heat source profiles (waste heat recovery, thermal oil for cogeneration and geothermal). The general goal is to provide optimization guidelines {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions, for subcritical and transcritical, regenerative and non-regenerative cycles. A parameter assessment of the main equipment in the cycle (expander, heat exchangers and feed pump) was also carried out. An optimization model of the ORC (available as an electronic annex) is proposed to predict the best cycle performance (subcritical or transcritical), in terms of its exergy efficiency, with different working fluids. The working fluids considered are those most commonly used in commercial ORC units (R 134 a, R 245 fa, Solkatherm, n-Pentane, <b>Octamethyltrisiloxane</b> and Toluene). The optimal working fluid and operating conditions from a purely thermodynamic approach are limited by the technological constraints of the expander, the heat exchangers and the feed pump. Hence, a complementary assessment of both approaches is more adequate to obtain some preliminary design guidelines for ORC units. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|At the {{trailing}} edge of supersonic high-pressure turbine vanes, a typical shock pattern, the so-called fish-tail shocks, originates {{due to the}} flow rotation imposed by its finite thickness. In addition, shock and shock/fan systems can arise in case of a post-expanded channel design or at off-design conditions. ORC turbine stator blades are particularly prone to this phenomena since they are designed to provide a high outlet Mach number, especially at the first stage. In the close proximity of the saturation curve, near the critical point, molecularly complex organic fluids for ORC applications may exhibit a number of non-ideal gasdynamic effects, including a remarkable dependency of the shock properties on the upstream thermodynamic state of the fluid, at a fixed upstream Mach number. The influence of thermodynamic conditions on the shock pattern is assessed {{as a function of the}} flow deviation and compared against the ideal gas case, for which the shock properties depends on the upstream Mach number only. Non-ideal effects are investigated here using siloxane vapor MDM (<b>Octamethyltrisiloxane,</b> C 8 H 24 O 2 Si 3), as an exemplary organic fluid.

In order to remove volatile organic compound from biogas, different processes can be used. A promising process for siloxane removal is their absorption in an organic solvent. In this work, three oils were tested to absorb the selected siloxanes: silicone oil 47 V 20, Seriola 1510 and Polyalphaolefin. Initially, the characterization of these oils was realized by measuring their viscosities and densities, depending on temperature. The second time, the absorption capacity of the siloxanes by selected oils was characterized through the determination of their Henry's constants, but also owing {{to the implementation of}} a wet-wall column. Both Henry's constants and removal efficiencies in continuous regime revealed that silicone oil (47 V 20) can be considered as the most efficient oil among the three selected siloxanes. Moreover, the cyclic siloxane (D 4) showed more affinity with oils than linear siloxanes.

Two different modes of operation are distinguished: pure electric power and {{combined heat and power}} generation. The siloxanes hexamethyldisiloxane (MM) and <b>octamethyltrisiloxane</b> (MDM) are chosen as working fluids. Moreover, the effect of using mixtures of these components is analysed. Regarding pure electricity generation, process simulations using the simulation tool Aspen Plus show an increase in second law efficiency of 1. 3 % in case of 97 / 03 wt % MM/MDM-mixture, whereas for the combined heat and power mode a 60 / 40 wt % MM/MDM-mixture yields the highest efficiency with an increase of nearly 3 % compared to most efficient pure fluid. Next to thermodynamic analysis, measurements of heat transfer coefficients of these siloxanes as well as their mixtures are conducted and Kandlikar’s correlation is chosen to describe the results. Based on that, heat exchanger areas for preheater and evaporator are calculated in order to check whether the poorer heat transfer characteristics of mixtures devalue their efficiency benefit due to increased heat transfer areas.

Toluene, n-octane, <b>Octamethyltrisiloxane</b> (MDM) and cyclohexane are the examined working fluids in the ORC.

Methods and Findings: More than 40 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including aliphatic, aromatic and halogenated hydrocarbons, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, ethers and terpenes were measured in a teaching hospital in France, from sampling in six sampling sites – reception hall, patient room, nursing care, post-anesthesia care unit, parasitology-mycology laboratory and flexible endoscope disinfection unit – in the morning and in the afternoon, during three consecutive days. Our results showed that the main compounds found in indoor air were alcohols (arithmetic means 6 SD: 9286958 mg/m 3 and 47. 9652. 2 mg/m 3 for ethanol and isopropanol, respectively), ethers (75. 66157 mg/m 3 for ether) and ketones (22. 6620. 6 mg/m 3 for acetone). Concentrations levels of aromatic and halogenated hydrocarbons, ketones, aldehydes and limonene were widely variable between sampling sites, due to building age and type of products used according to health activities conducted in each site. A high temporal variability was observed in concentrations of alcohols, probably due to the intensive use of alcohol-based hand rubs in all sites. Qualitative analysis of air samples led to the identification of other compounds, including siloxanes (hexamethyldisiloxane, <b>octamethyltrisiloxane,</b> decamethylcyclopentasiloxane), anesthetic gases (sevoflurane, desflurane), aliphatic hydrocarbons (butane), esters (ethylacetate), terpenes (camphor, a-bisabolol), aldehydes (benzaldehyde) and organic acids (benzoic acid) depending on sites...|$|E

The set-up is a standard one, in which a vessel containing the fluid under scrutiny is placed in a vertical oven for ~ 100 hours at a constant temperature T = Tstress. During the test, the pressure P is monitored to detect thermal decomposition of the fluid. After the test, the vessel is placed in a controlled thermal bath, where the pressure is measured at different value of the temperature T, with T < Tstress and T < Tc (Tc critical temperature). The resulting isochoric pressure-temperature dependence is compared to that obtained before the fluid underwent thermal stress. If departure from the initial fluid behavior is observed, significant thermal decomposition occurred and a chemical analysis of the decomposition products is carried out using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. The novelty of the set-up is the possibility of taking samples of both liquid and vapor phases of the fluid, a capability that was introduced to study thermal decomposition of mixtures, whose composition depends on the pressure and temperature, as well as to capture the more volatile products of thermal decomposition of pure fluids and mixtures.

40|$|Multi-objective {{optimization}} could be, in {{the industrial}} sector, a fundamental strategic approach for defining the target design specifications and operating parameters of new competitive products for the market, especially in renewable energy and energy savings fields. Vector optimization mostly enabled the determination {{of a set of}} optimal solutions characterized by different costs, sizes, efficiencies and other key features. The designer can subsequently select the solution with the best compromise between the objective functions for the specific application and constraints. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization problem addressing an Organic Rankine Cycle system is solved with consideration for the electric efficiency and overall heat exchangers area as quantities that should be optimized. In fact, considering that the overall capital cost of the ORC system is dominated by the cost of the heat exchangers rather than that of the pump and turbine, this area is related to the cost of the plant and so it was used to indirectly optimize the economic system performance. For this reason, although cost data have not been used, the heat exchangers area was used as a second objective function to minimize the plant cost. Pareto optimal solutions highlighted a trade-off between the two conflicting objective functions. <b>Octamethyltrisiloxane</b> (MDM) was considered organic working fluid, while the following input parameters were used as decision variables: minimum and maximum pressure of the thermodynamic cycle; superheating and subcooling temperature; and regenerator heat exchanger efficiency.

The fluids considered herewith are <b>octamethyltrisiloxane</b> (MDM, C 8 H 24 Si 3 O 2), decamethyltetrasiloxane (MD 2 M, C 10 H 30 Si 4 O 3), dodecamethylpentasiloxane (MD 3 M, C 12 H 36 Si 5 O 4), dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D 6, C 12 H 36 Si 6 O 6). The 12 -parameter functional form proposed by Span and Wagner has been selected because of its positive characteristics. Siloxanes are produced in bulk quantities and are mostly utilized in the cosmetics industry and, mixed, as high-temperature heat transfer fluids. Furthermore, they are used as working fluids in high-temperature organic Rankine cycle power plants. The available property measurements are carefully evaluated and selected for the optimization of equation of state parameters. For some of the fluids, experimental values are scarce, therefore ad hoc estimation methods have been used to supply more information to the procedure for the optimization of the parameters of the equation of state. In addition, saturated liquid density and vapor pressure measurements are correlated with the equations proposed by Daubert andWagner–Ambrose, respectively, to provide short, simple, and accurate equations for the computation of these properties. The recently developed isobaric ideal-gas heat capacity correlation for the selected siloxanes is included in the thermodynamic models. The performance of the newly developed equations of state is tested by comparison with experimental data and also with predictions calculated with the Peng–Robinson–Stryjek–Vera cubic EoS, as this model was adopted in previous technical studies.

The measurements were performed on the Test Rig for Organic VApors (TROVA) at the CREA Laboratory of Politecnico di Milano. The TROVA test-rig was built in order to investigate the non-ideal compressible-fluid behavior of typical expanding flows occurring within organic Rankine cycles (ORC) turbine passages. The test rig implements a batch Rankine cycle where a planar converging-diverging nozzle replaces the turbine and represents a test section. Investigations related to both fields of non-ideal compressible-fluid dynamics fundamentals and turbomachinery are allowed. The nozzle can be operated with different working fluids and operating conditions aiming at measuring independently the pressure, the temperature and the velocity field and thus providing data to verify the thermo-fluid dynamic models adopted to predict the behavior of these flows. The limiting values of pressure and temperature are 50 bar and 400 °C respectively. The early measurements are performed along the nozzle axis, where an isentropic process is expected to occur. In particular, the results reported here refer to the nozzle operated in adapted conditions using the siloxane vapor MDM as working fluid in thermodynamic regions where mild to medium non-ideal compressible-fluid effects are present. Both total temperature and total pressure of the nozzle are measured upstream of the test section, while static pressure are measured along the nozzle axis.

Numerical results using SU 2, the open-source suite for multi-physics simulation and design recently extended to deal with complex thermodynamic models of organic fluids, are compared here to experimental results from the Test-Rig for Organic VApours (TROVA) of the Laboratory of Compressible-fluid dynamics for Renewable Energy Applications (CREA), Politecnico di Milano. Experimental results regard supersonic expanding flows of siloxane fluid MDM (<b>Octamethyltrisiloxane,</b> C 8 H 24 O 2 Si 3) in non-ideal conditions representative of ORC applications. Three different geometries are considered {{for the assessment of}} the CFD solver. The first is a converging-diverging nozzle, representative of ORC supersonic stators, in which the fluid is accelerated to supersonic speed from highly non-ideal conditions, with inlet compressibility factor Z = Pv/(RT), computed using reference Equations Of State (EOS) for MDM fluid, as low as Z ~ 0. 81. The second geometry is a diamond-shaped airfoil at a neutral angle of attack. The airfoil is plunged into a supersonic flow at Mach 1. 5 and Z ~ 0. 9, in mildly non-ideal conditions. Oblique shock waves are observed at the airfoil leading edge and interact with the wind-tunnel walls and the rarefaction fan from the airfoil. This test case is useful to understand the physics of oblique shock-wall and shock-shock interactions in turbine cascades operating in off-design conditions. The third geometry is a supersonic backward facing step, in which the formation of an oblique shock is observed experimentally at the reattachment point past the step. The Mach number is around 1. 1 and the compressibility factor Z ~ 0. 89. This geometry is representative of the trailing edge of turbine blades and it is useful to study the formation of fish-tail shock waves. These NICFD flows are fairly well captured by the CFD solver, thus confirming the validity of both the thermodynamic models and of the CFD implementation, using both the Euler equations for inviscid flows with negligible thermal conductivity and the full Reynolds-averaged compressible Navier-Stokes equations, for non-ideal compressible turbulent flows.

40|$|Increasing the {{efficiency}} of conventional power plants is a crucial aspect in the quest of reducing the energy consumption {{of the world and}} to having sustainable energy systems in the future. Thus, within the scope of this thesis the possible efficiency improvements for the Wärtsilä 18 V 50 DF model gas engine based combine power generation options are investigated by recovering waste heat of the engine via Organic Rankine cycle (ORC).  In order to this, four different ORC models are simulated via Aspen Plus software and these models are optimized for different objective functions; power output and price per unit of electricity generation. These ORC models are: regenerative Organic Rankine cycle (RORC), cascaded Organic Rankine cycle with an economizer (CORCE), cascaded Organic Rankine cycle with two heat sources (CORC 2) and cascaded Organic Rankine cycle with three heat sources (CORC 3). In the cascaded cycle models there are two loops which are coupled with a common heat exchanger that works as a condenser for the high temperature (HT) loop and as a preheater for the low temperature (LT) loop. By using this common heat exchanger, the latent heat of condensation of the HT loop is utilized. The engine’s hot exhaust gases are used as main heat source in all the ORC models. The engine’s jacket water is utilized in the CORC 2 models as an additional heat source to preheat the LT working fluid. In the CORC 3 models engine’s lubrication oil together with the jacket water are used as additional sources for preheating the LT loop working fluid. Thus, the suitability of utilizing these two waste heat sources is examined. Moreover, thermodynamic and economic analyses are performed for each model and the results are compared to each other. The effect of different working fluids, condenser cooling water temperatures, superheating on cycles performance is also evaluated. The results show that with the same amount of fuel the power output of the engine would be increased 2200 kW in average and this increases {{the efficiency}} of the engine by 6. 3 %. The highest power outputs are obtained in CORC 3 models (around 2750 kW) whereas the lowest are in the RORC models (around 1800 kW). In contrast to the power output results, energetic efficiencies of the RORC models (around 30 %) are the highest and CORC 3 models (around 22 %) are the lowest. In terms of exergetic efficiency, the highest efficiencies are obtained in CORC 2 (around 64. 5 %) models whereas the lowest in the RORC models (around 63 %). All the models are found economically feasible since thermodynamically optimized models pay the investment costs back in average of 2 years whereas the economically optimized ones in 1. 7. The selection of the working fluid slightly affects the thermodynamic performance of the system since in all the ORC configurations <b>Octamethyltrisiloxane</b> (MDM) working fluid cycles achieve better thermodynamic performances than Decamethyltetrasiloxane (MD 2 M) working fluid cycles. However, the choice of working fluid doesn’t affect the costs of the system since both working fluid cycles have similar price per unit of electricity generation. The CORC 2 models obtain the shortest payback times whereas the CORC 3 models obtain the longest Thus the configuration of the ORC does affect the economic performance. It is observed from the results that increasing the condenser cooling water temperature have negative impact on both thermodynamic and economic performances. Also, thermodynamic performances of the cycles are getting reduced with the increasing degree of superheating thus superheating negatively affects the cycle’s performances. The engine’s jacket water and lubrication oil are found to be sufficient waste heat sources to use in the ORC models. ...|$|E
