Thames Ironworks right-half Charlie Dove received the Aston Villa kit from his father William Dove, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks. Bill Dove had been at a fair in Birmingham, close to Villa Park, the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> win.|$|E
5|$|Up to this point, Brown {{had scored}} 800 runs on tour {{at an average}} of 72.72, while Loxton had made 310 runs at 51.66. Harvey had scored only 296 runs at 42.29. The other five places in the top six were firmly entrenched in the hands of Barnes, Morris, Bradman, Hassett and Miller, who had all played in those {{positions}} regularly since the end of World War II. Brown gained selection out of position in the middle order in the First Test at Trent Bridge, while Loxton and Harvey watched from the sidelines. There was a chance <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> receive a last-minute call-up as Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week leading up to the Test, but the opener recovered. Brown made only 17 as Australia won by eight wickets.|$|E

25|$|Spofforth, {{having taken}} seven for 44 in this innings (making it {{fourteen}} for ninety in the match), bowled his last eleven overs for two runs and four wickets, those two runs and four wickets coming off his last seven deliveries. He was carried shoulder-high from the field. His break-backs {{had been almost}} unplayable on this wicket; indeed, Giffen believed that every single <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> have destroyed the stumps had not the bat got in the way.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Verlinde {{started work}} on his PhD at Utrecht University under the formal {{supervision}} of Bernard de Wit. He worked again with Herman and Dijkgraaf, and in practice the trio supervised themselves. The original arrangement was that only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> be working on the emerging field of string theory, {{but in the end}} all three of them wrote their theses on the subject. In September 1988 Erik defended his PhD thesis, which included the Verlinde formula.|$|E
25|$|After the {{collapse}} of Nazi Germany, many German women nicknamed Tr√ºmmerfrauen ("Rubble Women") participated in the rebuilding of Germany by clearing up the ruins resulting from the war. In the Soviet occupation zone, {{more than two million}} women were victims of rape. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> publish a memoir recalling this experience: Eine Frau in Berlin (A Woman In Berlin). As the Soviets entered German territory, German women typically had no choice, save suicide, to comply. Age did not matter with victimization crossing the generational strata entirely. Famed Russian author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, outraged by finding the body of a small girl murdered following a gang rape, wrote a scathing poem to mark the moment for posterity (right).|$|E

According to Rutten, he {{signed up for the}} match while under the influence and without any kind of earlier preparation, but he decided not to pull out. Another of his most famous fights was against Rene Rooze, who bit Rutten's ear during the match. In response, Bas landed a knee to the groin, which interrupted the match and caused a brawl.|$|E
25|$|In January 1962, {{the company}} hired Ken Richardson as a {{competition}} manager, {{with the intent}} that he would lead TVR's attempts to enter international racing. In March, Hopton entered three Grantura Mk2As in the 12 Hours of Sebring. The lightweight cars were prepared by chief mechanic David Hives and competition mechanic Bob Hallett, although only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> actually finish the race (the other two retiring early with mechanical failure.) TVR directors began to doubt the new leadership when they saw Bryan Hopton's tendency to overextend the company's finances in motor racing, {{as well as on}} indulgences such as luxury transport and hotels. This ill-fated race outing at Sebring was the last in a series of events that led to the departure of Trevor Wilkinson, whose resignation was accepted by the board of directors on 5 April 1962.|$|E
500|$|The various gauges for {{all three}} {{hydraulic}} systems were registering zero. The three hydraulic systems were separate, so that failure of any <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> leave the crew with full control, but lines {{for all three}} systems shared the same narrow passage through the tail where the engine debris had penetrated, and thus control surfaces were inoperative. The crew contacted United maintenance personnel via radio, but were told that, as a total loss of hydraulics on the DC-10 was considered [...] "virtually impossible", there were no established procedures for such an event.|$|E

500|$|Two shows debuting on 2006‚Äì07 NBC lineup, 30 Rock and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, {{revolved}} around the off-camera happenings on a Saturday Night Live-analogue sketch comedy series. Similarities between the two led to speculation that only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> be picked up. Baldwin said, [...] "I'd be stunned if NBC picked up both shows.

500|$|With this setback, Rossi {{began an}} {{important}} phase of his career. [...] He summarised this period in a memoir: [...] "The Decay of 'Mesotrons' (1939‚Äì1943): Experimental Particle Physics in the Age of Innocence", which he {{presented in a}} symposium at Fermilab in 1980. On 12 October 1938, the Rossis left for Copenhagen, where the Danish physicist, Niels Bohr, had invited him to study. [...] The couple {{had no intention of}} returning to Italy, and Bohr facilitated Rossi's search for a more secure position by sponsoring a conference attended by leading physicists. [...] He hoped that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> find Rossi a job, and soon, Rossi received an invitation to come to the University of Manchester, where Blackett was developing a major center of cosmic ray research.

Afterwards, Miz approached Curtis Axel and Bo Dallas, offering to make them [...] "the stars [...] deserve to be" [...] if they become his [...] "entourage". Later that night, the duo appeared in bear costumes during a in ring segment between Miz and Maryse, where they came to reveal themselves and ally with Miz by attacking Dean Ambrose. On June 26 episode of Raw, Miz and [...] "The Miztourage" [...] fought against Ambrose, Heath Slater and Rhyno, in a winning effort. On July 3 on Raw, after an argument with Raw General Manager Kurt Angle, Angle announced that Miz would make two defenses for the Intercontinental Championship; <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> take place that night against Slater and another on July 9 at the Great Balls of Fire pay-per-view against Ambrose. Miz subsequently defended his championship against Slater. At Great Balls of Fire, Miz defeated Ambrose to retain the title due to interference from the Miztourage. At the SummerSlam pre-show, Miz and The Miztourage defeated Jason Jordan and The Hardy Boyz (Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy) in a six-man tag team match.|$|E
