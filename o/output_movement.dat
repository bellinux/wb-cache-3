40|$|A {{programmable}} hybrid mechanism (PHM) is {{a combination}} of a servomechanism with a conventionally driven mechanism and has the potential to combine the advantages of both. A PHM can generate the <b>output</b> <b>movement</b> that is possible in a conventional mechanism and also permit these movements to be modulated using the servo-actuator. PHMs can offer batch-to-batch or even cycle-to-cycle programmability and thus allow development of machines that are capable of handling wider variations in products without incurring delays due to setups. A PHM can provide better tuning of motion characteristics than those obtainable from servomechanisms alone. It has also been claimed that due to the sharing of power between the main drive and the servo drive, the power rating necessary for the servo actuator can be lowered, thus offering a cost advantage compared to the system using only the servo-drive.

40|$|Countries in East Asia (EA) {{have made}} {{a great deal of}} {{progress}} in integrating their economies since the early 1990 s. There has been a sustained increase in intra-regional trade in EA. On finance, however, regional financial integration has been lagging behind trade integration and EA has reached out to global financial markets to effect deeper global integration. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the effects of intra-regional and extra-regional financial integration on changes in the pattern of EA's business cycle since 1990 to see whether there is any ground for "decoupling" of EA from the United States and the EU. On trade relations, the empirical results show that deepening trade integration contributes to more synchronized output movements among EA countries. There is also evidence that financial integration enhances more synchronization of output, but because its impact is not strong, the extra-regional integration does not necessarily dispute the prediction that EA's <b>output</b> <b>movement</b> has become more idiosyncratic than before, and therefore less closely tied with that of the United States.

The synthesis method of metamorphic mechanisms with the constraint forms and structures of metamorphic joints is described in steps.

40|$|Many people {{consider}} {{the brain to}} be the ultimate computer. Much like computers, the brain receives input information from the environment via various sensory receptors. The brain then processes that input information, formulates goals, and transmits information to create output movements that seek to achieve those goals. Again similar to computers, the brain has limits in its ability to transmit information. These limits can be studied using information theory, the branch of applied mathematics that gave rise to modern day computing. Although many researchers have studied the limits of the nervous system in transmitting input sensory information, little effort has been applied towards linking information in neural populations to movement. In this work, we created a novel method for estimating information transmitted by neural populations during a movement task using a limited number of trials per stimulus condition. Using this method, we found that the information transmitted by the population increased up to a limit, as the information required to be encoded by the task increased. We found that this limit was a function {{of the size of the}} population. Larger populations could transmit greater amounts of information. However, this relationship also appeared to reach a limit. Lastly, we found that the limit of information transmission is greater in a three-dimensional task compared to a two-dimensional task. We also studied neural activity during a brain-computer interface where the task dimensionality changed. We found that neurons changed their tuning to identical targets depending on whether they were encountered in the 2 D or the 3 D context. We present evidence that the observed changes are a motor system analogue to the phenomenon of dynamic range adaptation, which has been observed throughout various sensory systems. The neurons in the population adapted their tuning models to better utilize their limited range of firing rates to transmit information about desired <b>output</b> <b>movement.</b> Overall, this work opens up opportunities for future research investigating the role of motor cortex in transmitting contextually-encoded information...|$|E

The data were acquired from 37 pupils (20 boys, 17 girls) aged 10 – 13, at primary schools in Brno (CZE) in the period from 22 October to 26 October 2014 and subsequently from 12 November to 16 November 2014. PA was measured using the Actigraph GT 3 X accelerometer (Actigraph corp., USA) in the week when the clocks were changed, on 26 October 2014 and two weeks later. Three business days and two weekend days were measured. The monitored characteristics included those related to energy <b>output,</b> <b>movement</b> time according to intensity and the number of steps. Changes in measured characteristics after the clock shift were tested statistically using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Throughout the business days the pupils demonstrated more than med > 10000 steps a day and MVPA did not fall under med > 60 min/day. However, during the weekend these values did not exceed 6600 steps a day 39 min MVPA/day. When comparing the results of all the investigated PA factors before and after the clock shift, significant differences have been found only in boys during business days for moderate PA (p = 0. 02) and MVPA (p = 0. 04). The study has revealed substantial differences between PA of children during business days when compared to days off in the autumn period. However, the changes in the PA structure before and after the winter clock shift have only been diagnosed at the level of moderate PA and MVPA in boys, even though the daytime duration has been reduced significantly by more than one hour from 10 hours 23 minutes before to 9 hours and 16 minutes after the clock shift...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} five years, oil prices have {{escalated}} with prices reaching their highest level of $ 77 per barrel in August 2006, or relatively {{the same level as}} the second oil price shock {{at the end of the}} 1970 s. Even though the increasing oil price is significant, the impact on the economy as a whole is not the same as in the earlier oil shock. Whereas the previous oil price shocks had caused a severe economic slowdown in almost all countries, the current oil price shock coincides with the one of most favourable global economy in the past 35 years. The muted impact of oil price shock in the recent times is in part related to the different causes and nature of the shock. While shocks in the 1970 s and 1980 s were caused mainly by sizeable disruptions to oil supply, the recent oil price shock is caused by both the distortions in the supply side and the rapid increase in demand. To a large extent, the current oil price shock has been driven by unexpectedly buoyant demand for oil, particularly in the US, and by the rapidly growing emerging market countries, especially China which has almost doubled its demand for oil in the past 10 years. In contrast with increase in oil demand, world oil production has stagnated. This unbalanced supply and demand is worsened by lower oil inventories in industrial countries and by transportation bottlenecks both for crude and refined oil products that have increased the pressure on oil tanker rates. Taking into account the increasing world oil demand and geopolitical concerns over the security of future oil supplies, the high oil price is perceived to be persistent in the intermediate future. Similarly, the impact of the recent oil price shock has not been very significant in the SEACEN countries as well. Some of countries such as Korea and Taiwan experienced only a limited disruption during and after the shock. Other countries such as Malaysia and Papua New Guinea benefited as government revenue increased and further improved their economies. One plausible explanation for the limited impact of the oil price shock in Korea and Taiwan is that their economic structures have evolved and are now much less dependent on oil than they were in the 1970 s. The decreasing oil dependency in some SEACEN countries to some extent is a result of energy policies enforced by governments in the respective countries and has significantly reduced the impact of the oil price shock to the economy. However, empirical results show that subsidy policies in oil price cannot absorb the impact continually. In some countries such as Indonesia and Thailand, the prolonged higher oil price has increased the subsidy burden on the government budget. With regard monetary policy, empirical results show that in some SEACEN countries, monetary policy indicators to some extent are endogenous to oil price hikes. However, such a response only generates a small portion of the <b>output</b> <b>movement</b> due to oil price shocks. An aggressive monetary policy response to an oil price hike would not have succeeded in averting the downturn of the economy. Considering the limited role of monetary policy to economic growth, in anticipation of oil price shocks, monetary authorities would do better to focus their policies on the second round effect rather than on the first round effect of the oil shock. Since domestic oil prices in most countries are determined directly by the international oil price market, the first round effect of such an oil price hike on inflation are likely to be small. However, the second round effect of that oil price hike could be higher and therefore should be estimated appropriately. ...|$|E
