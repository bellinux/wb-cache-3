5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes. The task of raising Von der Tann was secured by Ernest Cox's salvage company. During preparation work, three workers were nearly killed when their <b>oxy-acetylene</b> cutters set off a major explosion. The blast tore holes in the still submerged vessel and allowed water into the compartment that had been emptied with compressed air; {{by the time the}} men were rescued, the compartment had refilled almost completely and the men were up to their necks. Nevertheless, the ship was successfully brought up on 7 December 1930, and scrapped at Rosyth by the Alloa Shipbreaking Company between 1931 and 1934.|$|E
25|$|For a basic <b>oxy-acetylene</b> rig, {{the cutting}} speed in light steel section will usually be {{nearly twice as}} fast as a petrol-driven cut-off grinder. The {{advantages}} when cutting large sections are obvious: an oxy-fuel torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a cut-off grinder is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term vibration white finger. <b>Oxy-acetylene</b> torches can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200mm (8inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200mm (8inches). Cut-off grinders are useless for these kinds of application.|$|E

25|$|In August 1915, a {{detachment}} of {{volunteers from the}} TEE (72 men) and LEE (39 men) proceeded to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. They were formed into 13 small detachments, each assigned to a Field Company of the RE to operate small <b>oxy-acetylene</b> searchlights to detect enemy raiding parties in No-Man's Land. Although these were used with some success for a few months, exposing a light drew heavy fire from the enemy, and the dangerous work earned the detachments the nickname of 'the suicide brigade'.|$|E
25|$|Welding gas {{pressures}} using <b>oxy-acetylene</b> are set {{in accordance}} with the manufacturer's recommendations. The welder will modify the speed of welding travel to maintain a uniform bead width. Uniformity is a quality attribute indicating good workmanship. Trained welders are taught to keep the bead the same size {{at the beginning of the}} weld as at the end. If the bead gets too wide, the welder increases the speed of welding travel. If the bead gets too narrow or if the weld puddle is lost, the welder slows down the speed of travel. Welding in the vertical or overhead positions is typically slower than welding in the flat or horizontal positions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxy-acetylene</b> can cut only low- to medium-carbon steels and wrought iron. High-carbon steels are {{difficult}} to cut because the melting point of the slag {{is closer to the}} melting point of the parent metal, so that the slag from the cutting action does not eject as sparks but rather mixes with the clean melt near the cut. This keeps the oxygen from reaching the clean metal and burning it. In the case of cast iron, graphite between the grains and the shape of the grains themselves interfere with the cutting action of the torch. Stainless steels cannot be cut either because the material does not burn readily.|$|E
25|$|The first German {{night air}} raids on the UK {{occurred}} on 19/20 January 1915. The first Anti-Aircraft (AA) searchlight in the Tyne Garrison {{was set up}} the following month by the RE {{on the roof of}} the CWS Flour Mills at Dunston, and later handed over to the TEE. This was an <b>oxy-acetylene</b> light. The first Zeppelin air raid on Tyneside, by Kapitanleutnant Mathy in L9, was on 14 April, and casualties were few. Afterwards an electric searchlight was set up at Carville power station, Wallsend, to work with a 3-inch AA gun operated by the Royal Garrison Artillery. This installation had just been completed when the second air raid on Tyneside took place on 15/16 June. Warning and blackout arrangements were inadequate, and L10 under Kapitanleutnant Hirsch caused considerable damage and casualties to industrial sites, including Palmer's.|$|E

At these speeds, aerodynamic heating caused the airframe's outer layer became hotter than an <b>oxy-acetylene</b> welding torch. The required acceleration required a new solid fuel mixture that burned ten {{times as fast as}} contemporary designs such as the Pershing or Minuteman.

The development and advantages of arc-based welding processes have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, <b>oxy-acetylene</b> welding equipment is quite versatile â€“ {{not only because the}} torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. Bell Canada cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fuelled torch kits as a soldering tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in manholes and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. As well, oxy-fuel cutting is still popular and <b>oxy-acetylene</b> cutting is utilized in many metal fabrication shops. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi, if subjected to a shockwave (caused for example by a flashback), acetylene decomposes explosively into hydrogen and carbon.|$|E
2500|$|Oxy-gasoline, {{also known}} as oxy-petrol, torches {{have been found to}} perform very well, {{especially}} where bottled gas fuel is not available or difficult to transport to the worksite. Tests showed that an oxy-gasoline torch can cut steel plate up to [...] thick {{at the same rate as}} <b>oxy-acetylene.</b> In plate thicknesses greater than [...] the cutting rate was better than oxy-acetylene; at [...] it was three times faster.|$|E
2500|$|At {{approximately}} 10:30am, {{workers at}} the Fresno County Industrial Road Camp, located [...] northwest of Coalinga, California, noticed the DC-3 trailing white smoke from its port engine.

[...] The aircraft caught fire and spiralled to the ground near Los Gatos Creek, exploding in a ball of fire. [...] The investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Authority discovered that a fuel leak in the port engine's fuel pump ignited and the slip-stream fanned the flames to a white hot intensity, acting like an <b>oxy-acetylene</b> torch, burning through the main-spar, causing the crash.|$|E
2500|$|The welder {{can adjust}} the <b>oxy-acetylene</b> flame to be {{carbonizing}} (aka reducing), neutral, or oxidizing. Adjustment {{is made by}} adding more or less oxygen to the acetylene flame. The neutral flame is the flame most generally used when welding or cutting. The welder uses the neutral flame {{as the starting point}} for all other flame adjustments because it is so easily defined. This flame is attained when welders, as they slowly open the oxygen valve on the torch body, first see only two flame zones. At that point, the acetylene is being completely burned in the welding oxygen and surrounding air. The flame is chemically neutral. The two parts of this flame are the light blue inner cone and the darker blue to colorless outer cone. The inner cone is where the acetylene and the oxygen combine. The tip of this inner cone is the hottest part of the flame. It is approximately [...] and provides enough heat to easily melt steel. In the inner cone the acetylene breaks down and partly burns to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which in the outer cone combine with more oxygen from the surrounding air and burn.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{mistakes}} and failures of logic {{occur in the}} serial. One example is that the film shows the Bat-Signal working in broad daylight.

50|$|The torch {{used for}} lead burning is a small, hot, gas flame. <b>Oxy-acetylene</b> is most {{commonly}} used, {{as it is}} easily portable. A small size #0 nozzle is usually used, sometimes with a miniature torch body, but the torch is otherwise {{the same as that}} used for steel or copper work. A variety of fuel gases may be used, but to achieve the high temperature needed, an oxygen supply is always used. Fuel gases may be acetylene, natural gas or hydrogen. Oxy-hydrogen is considered to be the best, but is not easily portable. Oxy-natural gas is cheapest and is often used on fixed workbenches. As it is less hot, it cannot be used for some awkward positional (overhead) welding. <b>Oxy-acetylene</b> is the most common, as much leadwork is carried out on site and this is easily portable.|$|E
50|$|Straightening of warped steel weldments is {{done with}} an <b>Oxy-acetylene</b> torch and is {{somewhat}} of an art. Heat is selectively applied to the steel in a slow, linear sweep.

50|$|Modern {{versions}} of differential hardening were developed when sources of rapidly heating the metal were devised, {{such as an}} <b>oxy-acetylene</b> torch or induction heating.

50|$|These {{limitations}} {{are the reasons}} why large high crown panels such as wings and fenders are often made in many pieces. The pieces are then welded together usually with one of two processes. TIG welding (Tungsten Inert Gas) produces less heat distortion, but produces a harder, more brittle weld that may cause problems when planishing/smoothing by hand, or in the wheeling machine. <b>Oxy-acetylene</b> welding joints don't have this drawback, provided {{they are allowed to}} cool to room temperature in air, but do produce more heat distortion. Panel joints may be achieved using autogenous welding - that is welding without filler rod (<b>Oxy-acetylene</b> or TIG processes), this is useful when finally smoothing the welding joints as it reduces the amount filing/grinding/linishing needed or almost eliminates it altogether. It also, more importantly, reduces heat distortion of the surface contour, which must be corrected on the wheel or with hammer and dolly.|$|E
50|$|Knife makers will {{sometimes}} contract {{out to a}} shop with the above capabilities to do blanking. For lower production makers, or lower budgets, other methods must suffice.
