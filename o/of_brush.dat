5|$|North Island is {{considered}} to have high conservation value with respect to its populations <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> bronzewing and Abrolhos painted buttonquail, and its dune, limestone and salt lake vegetation communities. The potential existence of historically significant artefacts on Record Hill, namely the bottle left by Wickham and Stokes in 1840, has not been assessed.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{standards}} of the Australian, American and Canadian kennel clubs specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, un-docked tail. There will often be a solid colour spot {{at the base of}} the tail and a white tip. The tail should be set moderately low, following the slope of the back. It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a reasonable level <b>of</b> <b>brush.</b>|$|E
40|$|When {{the tool}} leaves the part during {{machining}} operations, burrs can form {{as a result}} of material plastic flow. Wire <b>brushing</b> is one <b>of</b> burr removing methods. Low cost <b>of</b> <b>brushes</b> which can be mounted in a milling center gives the perspective of developing this method. The article was aimed at presenting the results <b>of</b> <b>brushing</b> process upon edge radius after wire <b>brushing</b> <b>of</b> AZ 91 HP magnesium alloy. Three kinds <b>of</b> <b>brushes</b> were tested with different types of fibers and the diameter of a single fiber. Brass and steel brushes were used...|$|R

Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil can be seen in the differing breadths <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> strokes. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} the ARVN central column was to advance down {{the valley of the}} Se Pone River, a {{relatively}} flat area <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> interspersed with patches of jungle and dominated by heights to its north and the river and more mountains to the south. Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets. The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to low cloud cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{damaging}} {{air attacks}} to their ships and landing forces, the Japanese proceeded {{with the construction}} of the naval seaplane base at Tulagi and Gavutu, receiving more shipments of troops and construction workers over the next several months. The base was soon operational with aircraft from the Yokohama Air Group which conducted air reconnaissance patrols throughout the surrounding area beginning on 6 May. On 27 May, the Japanese inspected the Lunga Point area on Guadalcanal as a possible location to build a large airfield. On 13 June, the Naval General Staff approved the construction of an airfield at that location and on 19 June, Admiral Inoue toured the site in anticipation of the airfield construction effort. The next day, Japanese troops began clearing the area <b>of</b> <b>brush,</b> and on 6 July, a 12-ship convoy delivered 2,000 Korean and Japanese construction workers plus 500 Japanese naval combat troops to conduct the airfield construction effort in earnest. The coastwatchers on Guadalcanal and Allied air reconnaissance observed the Japanese airfield construction efforts. Allied Catalinas and B-17s based at Port Moresby, Efate, Noumea, and Espiritu Santo frequently bombed the Japanese bases on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Gavutu over the next several months, but without causing significant damage. Several Japanese float fighters and one Allied bomber were destroyed in aerial combat during the missions.|$|E

25|$|As the Methodists {{started having}} {{problems}} piecing together the necessary property, other civic leaders including J.C. Nichols began pushing {{to create a}} cultural center on either side <b>of</b> <b>Brush</b> Creek, {{just east of the}} Country Club Plaza. According to this plan the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art and Kansas City Art Institute would be built north <b>of</b> <b>Brush</b> Creek around the estate of The Kansas City Star publisher William Rockhill Nelson and a private nonsectarian University of Kansas City (initially proposed as a junior college) would be built south of the creek. In addition, a hospital would be constructed around the estate of Kansas City Journal-Post publisher Walter S. Dickey. The hospital was never built.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} Eocene {{and the early}} stages of the Oligocene epoch (3224 mya), the climate of North America became drier, and the {{earliest}} grasses began to evolve. The forests were yielding to flatlands, home to grasses and various kinds <b>of</b> <b>brush.</b> In a few areas, these plains were covered in sand, creating the type of environment resembling the present-day prairies.|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} neutron {{reflectivity}} to measure concentration profiles <b>of</b> <b>brushes</b> <b>of</b> grafted chains in the melt. A method {{has been developed}} for permanently grafting end-functionalized polymers to a silicon substrate. By changing the matrix polymer surrounding the brush, we have investigated how the conformation <b>of</b> the <b>brush</b> depends upon {{the interaction between the}} matrix and brush polymers. We have observed strong stretching <b>of</b> the <b>brush</b> chains when the matrix and brush interact favorably, and collapse <b>of</b> the <b>brush</b> onto the substrate when they are immiscible. Comparisons have been made with theoretical predictions for the height and width <b>of</b> the <b>brush,</b> and experimental profiles have been compared with numerical self-consistent field theory. © 1995 American Chemical Society...|$|R

25|$|Some arson {{investigators}} and an FBI criminal profiler have deemed Orr to be possibly {{one of the}} worst American serial arsonists of the twentieth century. Federal ATF agent Mike Matassa believes that Orr set nearly 2,000 fires between 1984 and 1991. Furthermore, arson investigators cited that after Orr was arrested, the number <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> fires in the nearby foothill areas decreased by over ninety percent.|$|E
25|$|The Fulufjället massif {{is a high}} plateau deeply gouged {{by several}} rivers that flow into the mighty river Dalälven, which, far downstream, creates the unique {{topography}} of Färnebofjärden National Park. The geography is dominated by lichen, bare mountains, and valleys with dense old-growth forest. The heaths <b>of</b> <b>brush,</b> grass and lichens are unique in the Scandinavian Mountains, {{a result of the}} absence of grazing reindeers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{mathematical}} {{description of}} the wear processes <b>of</b> <b>brushes</b> <b>of</b> brush-type motors is described. The actions directed on increase of the lifetime <b>of</b> <b>brushes</b> are offered. The proposed mathematical model of the wear processes <b>of</b> <b>brushes</b> considers {{the highest number of}} parameters of a sliding contact, including sparking energy of windings switching and the mechanical condition of a commutator and bearings. The approach for evaluating the optimum pressure on the brush in order to increase its resource is offered. The real and the virtual lifetime tests of the universal motor considering changing of the mechanical state of the commutator and bearings during lifetime were carried-out. The constant force value acting on the brush which provides its lifetime increase by 11 % is proposed...|$|R

25|$|Poe Valley State Park and Poe Paddy State Park {{were built}} by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The young men of the CCC also worked to clear the regrowing forests <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> to prevent forest fires. They {{constructed}} roads throughout the forests, built state park facilities, constructed bridges on the state roads, planted trees for reforestation, and cleaned streams.|$|E
25|$|The new {{settlers}} {{cleared the}} land <b>of</b> <b>brush,</b> built extensive irrigation systems and roads, and introduced large-scale truck farming. In 1904 H. G. Stillwell, Sr., planted {{the first commercial}} citrus orchard in the area, thus opening the way for citrus fruit culture, one of the Valley's leading industries. The expansion of farming {{in the area and}} the railroad link to the north brought new prosperity to Brownsville and spurred a host of civic improvements.|$|E
25|$|Episodes with {{dialogue}} {{from the}} Ramayana are enacted using painted {{figures of the}} characters in profile, which strongly resemble the 18th-century Indian tradition of Rajput painting. The Rajput style <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> painting was principally enacted on manuscripts and commonly employed in the telling of epics such as the Ramayana. In the film they serve as a more traditional style of dramatic narrative, although the dialogue is frequently ironic, inappropriately modern or otherwise humorous.|$|E

25|$|Another early {{technique}} involved {{complete removal}} <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> and woody vegetation from an area. Tsetse tend {{to rest on}} the trunks of trees so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies. However, the technique was not widely used and has been abandoned. Preventing regrowth of woody vegetation requires continuous clearing efforts, which is only practical where large human populations are present. The clearing of woody vegetation has come to be seen as an environmental problem more than a benefit.|$|E
25|$|Beginning November 6, 1961, Los Angeles {{suffered}} {{three days}} of destructive bush fires. The Bel-Air—Brentwood and Santa Ynez fires destroyed 484 expensive homes and 21 other buildings along with 15,810 acres (64km²) <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> in the Bel-Air, Brentwood, and Topanga Canyon neighborhoods. Most of the homes destroyed had wooden shake roofs, which not only led to their own loss but also sent firebrands up to three miles (5km) away. Despite this, few changes {{were made to the}} building codes to prevent future losses.|$|E
