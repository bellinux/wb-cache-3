5|$|According to {{customary}} law, noblemen {{could not}} be sued outside the province until the 15thcentury.

Nevertheless, legal actions between Transylvanians and the inhabitants of {{other parts of the}} kingdom remained outside the jurisdiction of the voivodes. Litigants could appeal to the royal court against the decision of the voivode from the 14thcentury, but the voivode often remained involved in the proceedings.

5|$|Before the Crimean War, {{there was}} no {{official}} standardised system for recognition of gallantry within the British armed forces.

This structure was very limited; in practice awards of the Order of the Bath were confined to officers of field rank. Brevet promotions or Mentions in Despatches were largely confined to those who were under the immediate notice of the commanders in the field, generally members of the commander's own staff.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Florence was {{the first}} North Atlantic {{hurricane}} to produce hurricane-force winds {{on the island of}} Bermuda since Hurricane Fabian in September 2003. The seventh tropical storm and second hurricane of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season, Florence developed from a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic Ocean on September3. Due to unfavorable conditions, the system failed to organize initially, and as a result, the storm grew to an unusually large size. After several days, Florence encountered an area <b>of</b> <b>lesser</b> wind shear and intensified into a hurricane on September10. It passed just west of Bermuda while recurving northeastward, and on September13 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1399, Jadwiga {{gave birth}} to a {{daughter}}, baptised Elizabeth Bonifacia, but within a month the mother and daughter died, leaving Władysław sole ruler of the Kingdom of Poland and without an heir nor much legitimacy to rule the kingdom. Jadwiga's death undermined Władysław's right to the throne, and as a result old conflicts between the nobility <b>of</b> <b>Lesser</b> Poland, generally sympathetic to Władysław, and the gentry of Greater Poland began to surface. In 1402, Władysław answered the rumblings against his rule by marrying Anna of Celje, a granddaughter of Casimir III of Poland, a political match that re-legitimised his reign.|$|E
