5|$|In 1857, German chemist August Kekulé {{observed}} that carbon <b>often</b> <b>has</b> four other atoms bonded to it. Methane, for example, has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. This concept eventually {{became known as}} valency; different elements bond with different numbers of atoms.|$|E

The aircraft's self-defence suite includes various measures, such as flare and chaff dispensers capable of launching up to 250 flares and dipole chaff. Hostile radar uses are guarded against via an SPO-15 radar warning receiver.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{style of}} manga called Bara, which is {{typically}} written by gay men for a gay male adult audience. Bara <b>often</b> <b>has</b> more realistic themes than yaoi and {{is more likely to}} acknowledge homophobia and the taboo nature of homosexuality in Japan. While western commentators sometimes group bara and yaoi together, writers and fans consider them separate genres.|$|E
5|$|A {{juvenile}} <b>often</b> <b>has</b> a dark, brownish-grey nape {{that may}} look {{darker than the}} pale-edged black feathers. It has a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white throat, cheeks, and underparts. During the first winter, the bill shape of the young {{may not be as}} fully developed as that of the adult, and during the second winter, it much resembles the breeding adult, but with wing coverts lacking white spots.|$|E
50|$|Field shocks {{are highly}} {{variable}} and <b>often</b> <b>have</b> very uneven shapes. Even laboratory controlled shocks <b>often</b> <b>have</b> uneven shapes and include short duration spikes; Noise {{can be reduced}} by appropriate digital or analog filtering.|$|R

5|$|After Meredith is {{promoted}} to a resident, her younger half-sister Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) begins working at Seattle Grace as an intern. Meredith initially rejects Lexie's attempts {{to form a}} relationship, but slowly softens towards her. The sisters are very different people with different childhoods. Lexie had an idealistic family life and <b>often</b> <b>has</b> difficulty understanding her much darker sister, {{who does not have}} the same positive associations with family as Lexie.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} deep-sea sharks, the Izak {{catshark}} {{has a large}} heart suggestive of a relatively active lifestyle. It is a generalist that feeds {{on a wide variety}} of bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods; larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans and fewer fishes. At least some part of its recorded diet probably represents scavenging from fishery discards, given the presence of fast-moving, pelagic species that the shark is unlikely to have captured live. Polychaete worms, hydrozoans, gastropods, and hagfish eggs may also be occasionally ingested. This species <b>often</b> <b>has</b> nematode and flatworm parasites in its stomach.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male <b>often</b> <b>has</b> horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E

5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper <b>often</b> <b>has</b> long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E
5|$|Hellcats follows Marti Perkins, a pre-law {{college student}} at Lancer University, {{who lost her}} {{scholarship}} and has no other choice but to join the college's cheer squad, the Hellcats, {{in order to obtain}} a new one. There she meets her new roommate and team captain Savannah Monroe, the injured flyer Alice Verdura, her new partner Lewis Flynn and the Hellcats coach Vanessa Lodge who hopes to win nationals, otherwise the cheer leading program will be cut. All the while, Marti also has to deal with her financially unstable and sometimes irresponsible mother, Wanda Perkins, whom she <b>often</b> <b>has</b> to bail out of difficult situations, and her best friend Dan Patch.|$|E
5|$|Husbandry, {{especially}} if it is intensive, has a substantial environmental impact, occupying {{about a third of}} the earth's ice-free land, causing loss of habitat and emitting about half of all greenhouse gas worldwide. Since the 18th century, people have become increasingly concerned about the welfare of farm animals, and laws and standards are widely enforced in response. In culture, animal husbandry <b>often</b> <b>has</b> an idyllic image, featuring in children's books and songs, where happy animals live in attractive countryside. A similar image may be projected by petting farms and by historic farms that offer farmstays to paying visitors.|$|E

50|$|Photograph conservators can {{be found}} in museums, archives, and libraries, as well as in private practice. Conservators <b>often</b> <b>have</b> earned their Master’s degrees in art conservation, though many have also been trained through apprenticeship. They <b>often</b> <b>have</b> {{backgrounds}} in art history, chemistry, or photography.|$|R
5|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Mediterranean, some {{individuals}} have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but <b>often</b> <b>has</b> more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have {{the highest levels of}} the protein that causes this reaction.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of medieval cathedrals, those of England are cruciform. While most are of the Latin Cross shape with a single transept, several including Salisbury, Lincoln, Wells and Canterbury have two transepts, which is a distinctly English characteristic. The transepts, unlike those of many French cathedrals, always project strongly. The cathedral, whether of monastic or secular foundation, <b>often</b> <b>has</b> several clearly defined subsidiary buildings, in particular the chapter house and cloister.|$|E
5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} caring and socializing of the young. A female <b>often</b> <b>has</b> an older {{offspring}} with her to help in socializing the infant. Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for {{the first two years of}} their lives. The mother will carry the infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with it in the same night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E

5|$|The final moult of the nymph {{is not to}} {{the full}} adult form, but to a winged stage called a subimago that {{physically}} resembles the adult, but which is usually sexually immature and duller in colour. The subimago <b>often</b> <b>has</b> partially cloudy wings fringed with minute hairs; its eyes, legs and genitalia are not fully developed. Subimagos are generally poor fliers, and typically lack the colour patterns used to attract mates. After a period, usually lasting {{one or two days}} but in some species only a few minutes, the subimago moults to the full adult form, making mayflies the only insects where a winged form undergoes a further moult.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop can be {{distinguished}} from its close relative the Pacific pink scallop (Chlamys rubida) by the valves being less rounded and by the small curved spines on the ribs which give it a rough texture whereas the Pacific pink feels smooth. The glossy white interior of the spiny scallop's shell <b>often</b> <b>has</b> a purplish blotch near the umbone, not present in the Pacific pink.|$|E
