In his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, Lennon said, [...] " [...] another <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> think they made us. They didn't.

William Turner, in 1982 the {{marketing}} manager for Texas Instruments' consumer products group, said Cosby [...] "represents comfort, and people trust him". In 2014, one educator asked for comment said he remembered Cosby as a [...] "black male authority figure, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> folks that don't live on the edges of the country think of as a good black guy; they trust that guy".|$|E

McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel [...] "as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any {{musician}} could only dream of a legacy like that". She admires Springsteen for being [...] "so musically relevant after such {{a long period of}} time". She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: [...] "It's not about fame for her, it's about music". [...] " [...] shines in songwriting... He's just <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out", Swift says.

[...] In late January 2015, Butters and Fazekas revealed that Underwood {{is a product of}} the precursor to the Black Widow program. Regan did not know the character was a Black Widow when auditioning, but quickly learned after being cast, as the showrunners wanted her to change her then current red hair, in order to avoid being [...] "a tip to the audience, because of Natasha [...] They didn’t want to imply that every Black Widow had red hair and they didn’t want the audience to see it coming." [...] Regan trained with a Tae Kwan Do expert and studied Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow choreography from the films in preparation for the character's fight scenes, while Ottobre-Melton referenced her Black Widow status by using the colors red and black. Underwood's initial [...] "small-town girl from Iowa" [...] persona was based on Judy Garland's Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E

Etherington suggested that the 64-bit A7 processor will not reach its full potential until developers create applications supporting it. Myriam Joire of Engadget found that the iPhone 5S could benefit significantly from the A7 if developers created applications optimized for the 64-bit processor. Anand Lal Shimpi of AnandTech praised the phone's A7 processor, describing it as [...] "seriously impressive", and stated that it was the most [...] "futureproof of any iPhone ever launched. As much as it pains me to use the word futureproof, if you are <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> likes to hold onto their device for a while - the iPhone 5S is as good a starting point as any." [...] Scott Lowe of IGN also speaking highly of its 64-bit processor, [...] "which has a substantial lead in processing power over the HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4, accounting for a graphics boost of up to 32% and 38% in CPU benchmarks." [...] The debut of Apple's 64-bit A7 processor took rival Android smartphone makers by surprise, particularly Qualcomm whose own 64-bit system-on-chip was not released until 2015.|$|E
500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E

The rate of recidivism is so high in the United States that most inmates who enter the system are likely to reenter within a year of their release. Former inmate Wenona Thompson argues [...] "I realized that I became part of a cycle, a system, that looked forward to seeing me there.

In August 2009 Delany was named co-president of the Creative Coalition, joining Tim Daly in the leadership of the organization. Delany explained her support for the arts in an interview: [...] "I just think it's so important for children and the future of the country and people's general happiness.

2500|$|The {{variance}} in prevalence rates {{is reflected in}} people's inconsistent responses to the different components of sexual orientation within a study and the instability of their responses over time. [...] Laumann et al., (1994) found that among U.S. adults 20% {{of those who would}} be considered homosexual on one component of orientation were homosexual on the other two dimensions and 70% responded {{in a way that was}} consistent with homosexuality on only one of the three dimensions. Furthermore, sexuality may be fluid; for example, a person's sexual orientation identity is not necessarily stable or consistent over time but is subject to change throughout life. Diamond (2003) found that over 7 years 2/3 of the women changed their sexual identity at least once, with many reporting that the label was not adequate in capturing the diversity of their sexual or romantic feelings. Furthermore, women who relinquished bisexual and lesbian identification did not relinquish same sex sexuality and acknowledged the possibility for future same sex attractions or behaviour. One woman stated [...] "I'm mainly straight but I'm <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who,</b> if the right circumstance came along, would change my viewpoint". [...] Therefore, individuals classified as homosexual in one study might not be identified the same way in another depending on which components are assessed and when the assessment is made making it difficult to pin point who is homosexual and who is not and what the overall prevalence within a population may be.|$|E
