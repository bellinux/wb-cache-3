50|$|Oncofetal antigens are {{proteins}} {{which are}} typically present only during fetal development but {{are found in}} adults with certain kinds of cancer. These proteins are often measurable {{in the blood of}} individuals with cancer and may be used to both diagnose and follow treatment of the tumors. One example of an <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigen</b> is alpha-fetoprotein, which is produced by hepatocellular carcinoma and some germ cell tumors. Another example is carcinoembryonic antigen, which is elevated in people with colon cancer and other tumors. Other oncofetal antigens are trophoblast glycoprotein precursor and immature laminin receptor protein (also known as <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigen</b> protein). Oncofetal antigens are promising targets for vaccination against several types of cancers.|$|E

50|$|Cathepsin E is a {{protease}} {{found in}} animals, {{as well as}} various other organisms, that belongs to the aspartic protease group. In humans it is encoded by the CTSE gene located at 1q32 on chromosome 1. It is an intracellular non-lysosomal glycoprotein that is mainly found in the skin and in immune cells. The protein is an aspartyl protease that functions as a disulfide-linked homodimer, and has an oligosaccharide chain of the high-mannose type. It {{is a member of}} the peptidase A1 family, and therefore observes specificity similar to that of Pepsin A and Cathepsin D. Cathepsin E is an intracellular enzyme and does not appear to be involved in dietary protein digestion. It is found at highest abundance on the stomach’s epithelial mucus producing cell surfaces. It is the first aspartic protease present in the fetal stomach and is found in more than half of gastric cancers, leading to it appearing to be an <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigen.</b> Transcript variants utilizing alternative polyadenylation signals and two transcript variants encoding different isoforms exist for this gene.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY For the {{quantitative}} measurement of pancreatic <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigen</b> (POA), an enzyme immunoassay for POA has been developed, {{and is based}} on the sandwich method using antibody-coupled glass beads and enzyme (peroxidase) -labelled antibody. Serum POA concen-trations were increased significantly in patients with pancreatic cancer, but not in those with chronic pancreatitis or other miscellaneous diseases, or in normal subjects. It is concluded that the enzyme immunoassay could be used for the assay of POA and our results show that the determination of serum POA would be useful in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Presence of <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigen</b> relatively specific to human pancreatic cancer, designated as pancreatic <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigen</b> (POA), was first described by Banwo et al in 1974, 1 and we have reported high positivity of POA in pancreatic juice of patients with pancreatic cancer by a qualitative assay method of double immunodiffusion or counter electro-immunophoresis. 2 Attention has been focused on the detection of POA for the serological diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Until now, however, assay of POA has not been used widely because a quantitative assay procedure for POA has not been established. In this paper we describe a quantitative assay of POA using enzyme immunoassay, and its application as a clinical test for pancreatic cancer. ...|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{compare and}} clarify the {{cellular}} characteristics of morules in carcinomas in various organs {{and show that}} morules are distinct from epithelial cellular nodules. Methods: Twenty tumours were studied: two PBs, three WDFAs, three papillary lung adenocarcinomas, 11 ECs, and one papillary thyroid carcinoma. Numerous epithelial cell, oncofetal, and neuropeptide antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry. Catenin gene mutation was investigated. Results: Morules in PBs and ECs were uniform cell clusters distinct from squamous differentiation. All were immunonegative for epithelial cell and <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigens,</b> but those in ECs were positive for neurone specific enolase (NSE). Synaptophysin, encephalin, and somatostatin were sporadically immunopositive in PB morules. Morules were not seen in the other carcinomas and WDFAs, although morule-like features closely resembling morules histopathologically were seen. These were positive for epithelial cell and <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigens,</b> and showed squamous differentiation. Their nuclei were more atypical and slightly larger than those in morules. Morule-like features were seen in WDFAs. Catenin gene mutation was demonstrated in one EC and PB, and in two WDFAs. Conclusion: Morules were non-epithelial cell clusters showing neuronal differentiation. There were two types: endometrioid type, expressing NSE, and blastoma type, expressing neuropeptides.

40|$|Background: Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is an <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigen</b> over-expressed by many {{hepatocellular}} cancers (HCC). We previously {{demonstrated that}} HLA-A 2 -restricted epitopes derived from AFP are immunogenic in vitro and in vivo despite high circulating levels of this <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigen.</b> In order {{to test a}} more broadly applicable, HLA-unrestricted, inexpensive, cell-free vaccine platform capable of activating tumor antigen-specific CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells, we tested full length AFP in a plasmid DNA construct in combination with an AFP-expressing replication-deficient adenovirus (AdV) in a prime-boost vaccine strategy. Methods: HCC patients who had an AFP + tumor and previous treatment for HCC were screened and two patients received vaccination with three plasmid DNA injections followed by a single AdV injection, all delivered intramuscularly (i. m.). Results: The vaccine was well tolerated and safe. Both patients showed immunologic evidence of immunization. The first patient had a weak AFP-specific T cell response, a strong AdV-specific cellular response and recurred with an AFP-expressing HCC at nine months. The second patient developed a strong AFP-specific CD 8 + and CD 4 + cellular response and an AdV neutralizing antibody response, and recurred at 18  months without an increase in serum AFP. Conclusions: The AFP DNA prime-AdV boost vaccine was safe and immunogenic. Circulating anti-AdV neutralizing antibodies at baseline did not prohibit the development of AFP-specific cellular immunity. The patient who developed CD 8 + and CD 4 + AFP-specific T cell immunity had more favorable progression-free survival. The observations with these two patients support development of this vaccine strategy in a larger clinical trial.

Profound alterations of mucin O-glycans are observed in diseases such as cancer and inflammation, modifying the function of the cell and its antigenic and adhesive properties. Based on immunohistochemical studies, certain cancer- and inflammation- associated glycans have been defined as <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigens.</b> However, little or no chemical analysis has allowed the structural elucidation of O-glycans expressed on human fetal mucins. In this paper, mucins were isolated from different regions of the normal human intestine (ileum, right, transverse and left colon) of eight fetuses with A, B or O blood group. After alkaline borohydride treatment, the released oligosaccharides were investigated by nanoESI Q-TOF MS/MS (electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry). More than 117 different glycans were identified, mainly based on core 2 structures. Some core 1, 3 and 4 oligosaccharides were also found. Most of the structures were acidic with NeuAc residues mainly α 2 - 6 linked to the N-acetylgalactosaminitol and sulphate residues 3 -linked to galactose or 6 -linked to GlcNAc. In contrast to adult human intestinal mucins, Sda/Cad determinants were not expressed on fetal mucin O-glycans and the presence of an acidic gradient along the intestinal tract was not observed. Similar patterns of glycosylation were found in each part of the intestine and the level of expression of the major oligosaccharides was in the same order of magnitude. This study could help determining new <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigens,</b> which can be exploited for the diagnosis or the treatment of intestinal diseases...|$|R

(2) Immunofluorescence studies and complement dependent cytotoxicity test revealed that AES reacted with MCA-induced tumor cells (KMT- 17, KMT- 50) and fetal cells of the 16 th day, but did not react with fetal cells of the 10 th day and normal adult thymus cells. By the absorption test, it was demonstrated that KMT- 17 and KMT- 50 cells had the same absorptive capability against AES. (3) The same studies with multiparous sera (MPS) also revealed that MPS reacted with tumor cells and its reactivity tended to increase according to the frequencies of pregnancy. The activity of absorption against MPS was high with fetus of the 16 th day but weak with the 13 th and the 14 th day. No activity was seen with placenta of the 14 th and the 16 th day.

This report describes an adult case of GDC mimicking a mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas. This is the first report of a simultaneous increase in carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19 - 9 in GDC in the absence of malignancy.

In an attempt to characterize the proliferating cells in these conditions, we studied the expression of several antigens by immunohistochemical methods. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alpha 1 -antitrypsin (AAT), a hepatocellular export protein, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a marker of bile duct epithelial cells, and hepatitis B virus antigens (HBsAg, HBcAg), were localized by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method in 11 fetal livers, 10 cases of nodular transformation, and 7 cases of massive hepatic necrosis. AFP was the most prevalent antigen in fetal hepatocytes. Many hyperplastic hepatocytes in nodular transformation contained AAT, but not <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigens,</b> supporting the differentiated hepatocellular nature of these cells. A similar staining pattern was seen in two-cell-thick plates of hepatocytes in massive hepatic necrosis. In contrast, the ductlike structures at the periphery of necrotic lobules contained both AAT and CEA, suggesting that these cells exhibit features of hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells.

This study tested this presumption by selective suppression {{of one of these}} glycosyltransferases and then analysed the expressions of the enzymatic products of the other three glycosyltransferases. It was found that siRNA suppression of C 1 GalT markedly reduced the expression of Galb 1, 3 GalNAca- (Core 1) and in the meantime increased the expressions of sialyl-GalNAca- (sialyl-Tn), GalNAca- (Tn) and GlcNAcb 1, 3 GalNAca- (Core 3) -associated glycans in human colon cancer HT 29 and SW 620 cells.

40|$|Pancreatic <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigen</b> (POA) is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} useful tumor marker {{for the detection of}} cancer of the pancreas. However, reports on the biochemical characterization of POA have been contradictory. In the present study, biochemical and immunohistological characterizations of POA were performed with anti-fetal pancreas antibody specific to POA. POA of the fetal pancreas was located in the region of α(2) ~β on immunoelectrophoretograms, and the molecular weight was estimated to be about 200, 000 by gel filtration. POA did not react with anti-CEA, AFP, or ferritin antibodies in the Ouchtalony test. POA was also detected in extracts of cancerous pancreas by Ouchtalony test. From immunohistological studies with anti-POA serum, it was confirmed that POA was present in the cytoplasm of fetal and cancerous pancreas. Well differentiated tumor cells stained much more than poorly differentiated tumor cells. In conclusion, cancerous pancreas shares the same antigen, POA, with fetal pancreas, and the production of POA in cancerous pancreas is related to the degree of tumor cell differentiation...|$|E

Experimental results obtained by employing animal models have supported the design of clinical trials using a CEA-based vaccine for the treatment of different types of human cancers. This review reports findings from experimental models and clinical evidence on the use of a CEA-based vaccine for the treatment of cancer patients. Among the diverse CEA-based cancer vaccines, DCs- and recombinant viruses-based vaccines seem the most valid. However, although vaccination was shown to induce a strong immune response to CEA, resulting in a delay in tumor progression and prolonged survival in some cancer patients, it failed to eradicate the tumor in most cases, owing partly to the negative effect exerted by the tumor microenvironment on immune response. Thus, in order to develop more efficient and effective cancer vaccines, it is necessary to design new clinical trials combining cancer vaccines with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and drugs which target those factors responsible for immunosuppression of immune cells. This review also discusses relevant patents relating to the use of CEA as a cancer vaccine...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen {{patients}} with colorectal tumours, 15 {{patients with}} Crohn's disease (CD) and {{two groups of}} normal controls were investigated {{for the presence of}} spontaneous suppressor cell activity (SSCA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In comparison to the age and sex matched controls patients with colorectal carcinoma exhibited a significant increase in SSCA (P less than 0. 01). No evidence could be obtained that the suppressive effect was due to a soluble factor such as prostaglandins. In contrast, patients suffering from CD presented a decreased SSCA. No correlation was obtained between the enhanced SSCA in tumour patients and the clinical stage of the disease, levels of <b>oncofetal</b> <b>antigens</b> or serum immune complexes. Likewise in patients with CD no correlation was found between decreased SSCA and CD index or different serum parameters. When PBMC of the different test groups were incubated with histamine or cimetidine before they were added to the indicator system the suppressive activity remained unchanged. Also pre-incubation of normal PBMC with alpha-fetoprotein or carcinoembryonic antigen did not change the spontaneous suppressor cell activity. Whether the significantly enhanced in vivo activity of spontaneous suppressor cells in patients with colorectal carcinoma is one of the multifactorial mechanisms leading to the establishment of cancer or whether it rather represents a reflection of the immune system on colorectal tumour antigens remains unsolved...|$|R
