40|$|Abstract: IT-based Higher {{education}} {{is found to}} be a feasible and economical solution in improving the traditional education model [2, 14]. Consequently the e-learning portals have been evolved as experimental tools in implementing online courses with the existing classroom education [3, 6, 13]. For an on-line course to be successful, it is essential to provide a necessary resource environment available in on-line. This expects designers to implement their courses standing alone without a third party dependency. An experimental study has been carried to verify the feasibility of implementing a system architecture that can support course-related resources in stand-alone mode. This paper explains the development of a prototype system architecture which results by extending the services of a portal by integrating software tools used in the related courses. The resulting architecture is simple, distributed and cost effective. The supporting experimental work has been carried <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> test <b>bed</b> around <b>the</b> e-learning portal WebCT that is currently available in Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{ratio of}} 18O to 16O in ice and deep sea cores is {{temperature}} dependent, {{and can be}} used as a proxy measure for reconstructing climate change. During colder periods of the Earth's history (glacials) such as during the ice ages, 16O is preferentially evaporated from the colder oceans, leaving the slightly heavier and more sluggish 18O behind. Organisms such as foraminifera which combine oxygen dissolved in the surrounding water with carbon and calcium to build their shells therefore incorporate the temperature-dependent 18O to 16O ratio. When these organisms die, they settle <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sea <b>bed,</b> preserving a long and invaluable record of global climate change through much of the Quaternary. Similarly, ice cores on land are enriched in the heavier 18O relative to 16O during warmer climatic phases (interglacials) as more energy is available for the evaporation of the heavier 18O isotope. The oxygen isotope record preserved in the ice cores is therefore a [...] "mirror" [...] of the record contained in ocean sediments.|$|R
40|$|Natural gas {{represents}} today {{maybe the}} most valid alternative to conventional fuels for road vehicles propulsion. The main constituent of natural gas, methane, {{is characterized by a}} high autoignition temperature, which makes the fuel highly resistant to knocking: this allows a considerable downsizing of the engine by means of supercharging even under high compression ratio. Starting from these considerations, the authors realized a thermodynamic model of a 4 -cilynder s. i. engine for the prevision of in-cylinder pressure, employing a two-zone approach for the combustion and adding sub-models to account for gas properties change and knocking occurrence. An extensive experimental campaign has been carried <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> test <b>bed,</b> equipped with a naturally aspirated bi-fuel s. i. engine (i. e. an engine which can run either with gasoline or with compressed natural gas), so as to set the model constants to the best matching values.

40|$|Background. In {{most cases}} of {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM), a complication {{in the form}} of diabetic angiopathy of the lower limbs is diagnosed rather late when clinical manifestations of vascular pathology appear. Wellness activities at this stage are palliative, the pathology is not reduced. In this regard it becomes necessary to diagnose initial manifestations of diabetic angiopathy at the preclinical stage. The study aims at revealing a difference in microcirculation in the upper and lower limbs in patients with DM. This difference allows us to diagnose an initial stage of diabetic angiopathy of the lower limbs. For this purpose, we used a method of photoplethysmography. Materials and methods. The study involved three groups of people: a group of healthy individuals, a group of patients with DM of up to 5 years duration, and a group of patients with DM of over 10 years duration. Photoplethysmography was carried <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nail <b>beds</b> of their fingers and toes. Results. The test showed that in groups of diabetic patients {{there was a significant difference}} in the level of microcirculation in upper and lower limbs. This difference dept with increased duration of the disease and reflected the level of carbohydrate metabolism decompensation. This result made it possible to use this method at the early stages in the diagnosis of the formation of diabetic angiopathy of the lower limbs. Conclusions. One of the earliest signs of diabetic angiopathy onset is the appearance of asymmetry in the microcirculation of the hands and feet, revealed by photoplethysmography. The detection of diabetic angiopathy at the preclinical stage opens opportunities for active and effective prevention of vascular complications in DM and diabetic foot development...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} meteorites can provide chronological {{constraints}} upon {{the age of}} the ice cropping out at the Frontier Mountain meteorite trap (Antarctica) when their terrestrial age is placed in a glaciological context. Amongst the over 700 meteorites found so far, Frontier Mountain (FRO) 84001, 99028, 93005 and 93054 were most likely not wind-drifted across the ice field, since their masses (772 - 1665 g) are much heavier than the local similar to 200 g wind transport threshold. The four meteorites were found along a stretch of ice where a representative section of the Frontier Mountain blue ice crops <b>out.</b> Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> of englacial tephra layers, the structure of the ice along the section appears to be essentially an up-glacier dipping monocline. The C- 14 terrestrial age of FRO 8401, 99028 and 93005 are 13 +/- 2, 21 +/- 3 and 27 +/- 2 ky, respectively; the Ca- 41 /Cl- 36 age of FRO 93054 is 40 +/- 10 ky. The terrestrial ages of the four meteorites increase from the top to the bottom layers of the monocline. This geographic distribution is best explained by delivery of meteorites at the ice surface through the "ice-flow model" (i. e., englacial transport from the snow accumulation zone and exhumation in the blue ice area through ablation) rather than direct fall. Since the effect of ablation in decoupling terrestrial ages of meteorites and the age of <b>the</b> ice <b>on</b> which they sit must have been minor (most likely : 5 7 ky) based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> local ice dynamics, we conclude that {{the age of the}} bulk of the ice body currently under ablation at Frontier Mountain is up to similar to 50 ky old. This result has implications <b>on</b> both <b>the</b> meteorite concentrations mechanism at Frontier Mountain and the regional ice dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{fundamental}} {{aim of this}} research was to determine the biomechanical characteristics of <b>the</b> medical <b>bed</b> made of carbon steel and an assessment of its stability. To define the biomechanical characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> design, <b>the</b> finite element method (FEM) was applied. Additionally, the risk analysis was conducted according to the directives of ISO 14971 standard. Design/methodology/approach: The research was carried <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> typical rehabilitation <b>bed.</b> To define <b>the</b> biomechanical characteristics of this equipment, the finite element method was applied. Geometric model of medical bed, was discretized by means of SOLID 95 element. Appropriate boundary conditions imitating phenomena in the real system with appropriate accuracy were established. The aim of biomechanical analysis was calculation of displacements and stresses in <b>the</b> <b>bed’s</b> construction elements in a function of the applied loading. In order to carry out calculations, 3 models of diverse variants of loading were selected – safe working load - model 1, transverse stability - model 2 and longitudinal stability - model 3. Findings: The analyses showed the difference in displacements, strains and stresses in the characteristic points depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> selected loading. That also helped to determine maximal loading causing the exceeding of the yield stress of <b>the</b> <b>bed’s</b> components. Research limitations/implications: The limitations were connected with simplification of numerical model of femur {{as well as with the}} selected boundary conditions. Practical implications: The obtained results can be useful in the designing process (modification of requirements regarding design and construction, as well as materials used in the production of the device, and reduction of risk as far as possible to the patient). They prove that 3 D geometrical analysis works quite well for assistive medical devices design.
