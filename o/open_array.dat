40|$|Two-dimensional sparse arrays with hole-free {{difference}} coarrays, like billboard <b>arrays</b> and <b>open</b> box <b>arrays,</b> {{can identify}} O(N^ 2) uncorrelated source directions (DOA) using N sensors. These arrays contain some dense ULA segments, leading to many sensor pairs separated by Î»/ 2. The DOA estimation performance often suffers degradation due to mutual coupling between such closely-spaced sensor pairs. This paper introduces a new 2 D array called the half <b>open</b> box <b>array.</b> For a given N, this array {{has the same}} hole-free coarray as an <b>open</b> box <b>array.</b> At the same time, the number of sensor pairs with small separation is significantly reduced...|$|R

40|$|Sound {{reproduction}} systems using <b>open</b> <b>arrays</b> of loudspeakers {{in rooms}} suffer from degradations due to room reflections. These reflections {{can be reduced}} using pre-compensation of the loudspeaker signals, but this requires calibration of the array in the room, and is processor-intensive. This paper examines 3 D sound reproduction systems using spherical arrays of fixed-directivity loudspeakers which reduce the sound field radiated outside the array. A generalized form of the simple source formulation and a mode-matching solution are derived for the required loudspeaker weights. The exterior field is derived and expressions for the exterior power and direct to reverberant ratio are derived. The theoretical results and simulations confirm that minimum interference occurs for loudspeakers which have hyper-cardioid polar response...|$|R

40|$|Although {{classical}} {{object-oriented programming}} languages provide high-level modeling capacities (abstract data type, inheritance etc.), they remain low-level {{when it comes}} to data manipulation. Addressing this problem with object oriented programming languages is an important mission of today's research. Considerable work has already been done, leading to the development of tools such as object query languages, with mixed results. In this paper, we present the key points of a new approach to this problem. We propose an enhancement of object oriented programming at the core level, by integrating Array Programming, a high-level model for computing. Our solution is based on an extension to object oriented programming. This integration of object technology and Array Programming allows for high-level object-oriented programming. At the same time, it <b>opens</b> <b>Array</b> Programming to the powerful world of objects...|$|R
