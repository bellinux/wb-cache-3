40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{a number of}} {{different}} relationships between two kinds of (moral) obligation: those which have individuals as their subject, and those which have groups of individuals as their subject. I use the name collective <b>obligations</b> to refer to <b>obligations</b> of the second sort. I argue that there are collective <b>obligations,</b> in this sense; that such <b>obligations</b> can give rise to and explain <b>obligations</b> which fall on individuals; that because of these facts collective <b>obligations</b> are not simply reducible to individual obligations; and that collective <b>obligations</b> supervene on individual <b>obligations,</b> without being reducible to them. The sort of supervenience I have in mind here is what is sometimes called ‘global supervenience’. In other words, there cannot be two worlds which differ in respect of the collective <b>obligations</b> which exist in them without also differing in respect of the individual <b>obligations</b> which exist in them...|$|R
40|$|For decades, general {{international}} law has recognized that international <b>obligations</b> {{can be divided into}} two types, i. e. bilateral <b>obligations</b> and multilateral <b>obligations,</b> according to their own legal nature. Today, multilateral <b>obligations</b> are furthermore divided into erga omnes <b>obligations</b> and erga omnes partes <b>obligations.</b> The former is the <b>obligations</b> owed to the international community as a whole and the latter is the <b>obligations</b> owed to a group of States for the protection of a collective interest of the group. Contrary to general {{international law}}, for a long time, WTO law has been silent regarding the legal nature of <b>obligations</b> imposed on their Member States. It would be easy to consider GATT <b>obligations</b> as bilateral, because trade is a transaction between two states; that is to say, trade is bilateral behavior. However, WTO law is not as simple as GATT. WTO law treats not only goods but also services, intellectual property rights and other technical or sanitary matters, so that it would covers a wide range of rights and <b>obligations.</b> This article clarifies the legal nature of <b>obligations</b> accruing to Member States under the actual WTO law on the basis of {{general international law}}...|$|R

40|$|This article explores {{reciprocity}} {{within the}} exchange {{relationship between the}} employee and employer using the psychological contract framework. Specifically, we examine the bi-directionality of the norm of reciprocity. We hypothesize {{that there will be}} a positive relationship between perceived employer <b>obligations,</b> fulfilment of <b>obligations</b> and employee <b>obligations</b> and fulfilment. In addition, we hypothesize that employee fulfilment of <b>obligations</b> will be positively associated with perceived employer <b>obligations.</b> Using a longitudinal survey of 1400 public sector employees and 84 managers, our findings suggest that there is broad agreement between the two parties regarding the norm of reciprocity that governs the relationship. We found that perceived employer <b>obligations</b> at time 1 is positively associated with employees’ fulfilment of <b>obligations</b> at time 2 and perceived employer fulfilment of <b>obligations</b> at time 1 is positively related to employee <b>obligations</b> and fulfilment of <b>obligations</b> at time 2. Furthermore, we found that employee fulfilment of <b>obligations</b> at time 1 is positively associated with perceived employer <b>obligations</b> at time 2. Overall, these findings provide initial empirical support for the norm of reciprocity in exchange relationships from both the perspective of employees as well as managers, as employer representatives...|$|R

5|$|During the Western Han, farming peasants {{formed the}} {{majority}} of those who were conscripted by the government to perform corvée labor or military duties. For the labor service (gengzu 更卒), males aged fifteen to fifty-six would be drafted for one month out of the year to work on construction projects and perform other duties in their commanderies and counties. For the military <b>obligation</b> (zhengzu 正卒), all males aged twenty-three were to train for one year in one of three branches of the military: infantry, cavalry, or navy. Until they reached age fifty-six, they were liable to perform one year of active service as troops sent to guard the frontiers from hostile nomads or to act as guards in the capital city. Significant changes were made to this system during Eastern Han; a commuting tax could be paid by peasants if they wanted to avoid the one-month labor <b>obligation,</b> since hired labor became more popular in construction and other projects. The military service <b>obligation</b> could even be avoided if a peasant paid a commuting tax, since the Eastern Han military became largely a volunteer force. Other commoners such as merchants were also able to join the army.|$|E

40|$|An important, though oft neglected, {{distinction}} between multilateral treaty <b>obligations</b> separates <b>obligations</b> of the bilateral nature {{from those of}} the collective or erga omnes partes type. Multilateral <b>obligations</b> of the bilateral type can be reduced to a compilation of bilateral, state-to-state relations. They can be compared to contracts. Collective <b>obligations,</b> in contrast, cannot be divided into bilateral components. They are concluded in pursuit of a collective interest that transcends the individual interests of the contracting parties. The standard example of such <b>obligations</b> are those arising under a human rights treaty. In domestic law, collective <b>obligations</b> can be compared to criminal law statutes or even domestic constitutions. This essay examines the origins of the {{distinction between}} bilateral and collective <b>obligations,</b> as well as its major consequences, both in law of treaties and the law on state responsibility. On that basis, a wider typology of multilateral treaty <b>obligations</b> is suggested. In the exercise, <b>obligations</b> arising under the World Trade Organization are used as a case study. The argument is made that WTO <b>obligations</b> remain essentially of the bilateral type; they are not collective in nature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} need {{to share}} information in dynamic environments has created a requirement for risk-aware access control systems. In this paper, we present a metamodel for risk-aware authorization that captures the key aspects of a system in relation to risk mitigation. In particular, we develop various risk-aware models as instances of the metamodel that broadly differ {{in the form of}} risk mitigation that is used (system <b>obligations</b> and user <b>obligations</b> respectively), and study how those <b>obligations</b> are applied to reduce and account for the risk incurred by granting access. Unlike system <b>obligations,</b> an access control system cannot guarantee that user <b>obligations</b> are fulfilled. We propose two approaches to defining risk-aware authorization semantics that takes unfulfilled <b>obligations</b> into account: one is to restrict users’ future access because of prior failure to fulfill <b>obligations,</b> and the other is to “reward ” users who have been diligent in fulfilling their <b>obligations</b> by permitting risky access requests.
