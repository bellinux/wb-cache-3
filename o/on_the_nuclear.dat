5|$|The {{energy of}} an emitted photon is {{proportional}} to its frequency, so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum. Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} {{acts as a}} barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> face of the inner membrane.|$|E
5|$|The quarks {{are held}} {{together}} by the strong interaction (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held {{to each other in}} the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.|$|E

5|$|This was at {{odds with}} the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program, and {{resulted}} in pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons program. In 1953 the Atomic Energy Commission presented a set of draft amendments to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy for consideration. After some debate, this resulted in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.|$|E
5|$|When the LIFE {{project was}} first proposed, it focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> fusion–fission hybrid concept, which uses the fast {{neutrons}} from the fusion reactions to induce fission in fertile nuclear materials. The hybrid concept {{was designed to}} generate power from both fertile and fissile nuclear fuel and to burn nuclear waste. The fuel blanket was designed to use TRISO-based fuel cooled by a molten salt made from a mixture oflithium fluoride(LiF) andberyllium fluoride(BeF2).|$|E
5|$|In March 1942, Bush sent {{a report}} to Roosevelt {{outlining}} work by Robert Oppenheimer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> cross section of uranium-235. Oppenheimer's calculations, which Bush had George Kistiakowsky check, estimated that the critical mass of a sphere of uranium-235 was {{in the range of}} 2.5 to 5 kilograms, with a destructive power of around 2,000 tons of TNT. Moreover, it appeared that plutonium might be even more fissile. After conferring with Brigadier General Lucius D. Clay about the construction requirements, Bush drew up a submission for $85 million in fiscal year 1943 for four pilot plants, which he forwarded to Roosevelt on June 17, 1942. With the Army on board, Bush moved to streamline oversight of the project by the OSRD, replacing the S-1 Section with a new S-1 Executive Committee.|$|E

It flew bombing missions against Rota on 4 July, Truk on 8 July, and Marcus on 9 July. It returned to bomb Rota again on 12 and 14 July, and bombed Guguan on 18 and 19 July. It was flown by Albury and crew C-15 on two combat missions, {{one of which was}} aborted, and the other in which it used a pumpkin bomb to attack the railroad yards at Kobe on 24 July. Captain Bob Lewis and crew B-9 flew it to drop a pumpkin bomb on an industrial target in Koriyama on 29 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{name for}} the bikini design was coined in 1946 by Parisian {{engineer}} Louis Réard, the designer of the bikini. He named the swimsuit after Bikini Atoll, where testing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> bomb was taking place. Fashion designer Jacques Heim, also from Paris, re-released a similar design earlier that same year, the Atome. Due to its controversial and revealing design, the bikini was slow to be adopted. In many countries it was banned from beaches and public places. While still considered risqué, the bikini gradually {{became a part of}} popular culture when film starsBrigitte Bardot, Raquel Welch, Ursula Andress and othersbegan wearing them on public beaches and in film.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of morphological characteristics and gene sequences {{has supported the}} basal position within the genus long suspected of D.regia, often regarded as the most ancient of all extant Drosera species. Its distinct morphology and unique relict characteristics, ones it likely shared with the common ancestor of all Drosera such as the operculate pollen, led early researchers to suggest its ancient position in the genus. The first cladistic analysis based on rbcL and morphological data confirmed these ideas and suggested that D.regia formed a clade sister to all other Drosera surveyed, with Dionaeamuscipula forming a sister clade to all Drosera. Further analysis in 2002 based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> 18S rDNA, plastid DNA (rbcL, matK, atpB), and morphological data confirmed these relationships, supporting the basal position of D.regia in the genus and its close relationship with Dionaea and Aldrovanda. New analysis in 2003 revealed a close relationship between D.regia and D.arcturi, both of which clustered basally with respect to all other Drosera, suggesting a link between D.regia and all other Drosera through its relationship with D.arcturi.|$|E
