This allows the grated {{material}} to melt or cook in a different manner than the shreds of mostly uniform thickness produced by the grating blade <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> Hand-grated potatoes, for example, melt together more easily in a potato pancake than food-processed potato shreds.|$|E

30|$|In this question, {{we tried}} to study the process of rural user innovation. We find that the users {{were well aware of}} their local need and the {{constraints}} of their environment. This drives them to develop an idea of a product. For example, Patel got an idea to build a machine for stripping cotton, Prajapati got an idea to build a clay-based refrigerator, Jagni got an idea to attach ploughing implements to a motorcycle, Dahiya thought of using the gas produced in his kiln, and Kamboj got an idea to build a machine on the lines <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> The next step in the innovation process was to seek financial help to build the product, as all of them were poor. They primarily relied on informal means of obtaining finance either from family members or friends. All of them had little or no educational backgrounds and were not conversant with the process of obtaining financial support from financial institutions. Additionally, they had no collateral to submit to banks. After acquiring financial support from informal sources, they built an initial working prototype.|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{the time}} and cost {{involved}} in the product development {{is very important to}} stay competitive in the market. Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA) is a cost-reduction framework for designers to evaluate manufacturing aspects of a product design. A case study on an in-market food processor, this paper aims to demonstrate the significance of DFMA implementation on an Indian consumer product. Even though many DFMA case studies have been published till date, very few have dealt with the Indian consumer durables category. In this paper, various cost-reduction opportunities are identified in the design <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> manufactured by a reputed company in India. Using the DFMA study, design ideas are developed with an objective of reducing the overall manufacturing cost of the product. As a result of DFMA implementation, significant improvement in terms of the product’s architecture, assembly time and design efficiency is identified. Overall cost reduction of 0. 25 USD (United States Dollar) was achieved and an improvement in the Design for Assembly (DFA) index from 15. 99 to 19. 93 is reported. This procedure utilized in this paper can be adopted for any consumer durable products of similar type and design improvements and cost reduction can be achieved...|$|E

40|$|We {{model the}} domain of formal proof without allocating {{specific}} functions to the user or the computer. This allows us to define key attributes of proof succinctly.

This model is then used to understand some of the strengths and weaknesses <b>of</b> <b>an</b> existing system, PVS. 1 Introduction Many failures of poor designs may be attributed to a mismatch between the vision of the designer and the reality of the user's performance. This applies particularly to user interfaces of theorem proving assistants (TPAs). We take an initial step towards techniques for analysing interactive TPAs which help the designer to understand the essential structures being transformed {{and the nature of the}} proving activity.
