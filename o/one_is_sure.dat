25|$|Concurrent {{with the}} sonar readings, the {{floodlit}} camera obtained {{a pair of}} underwater photographs. Both depicted {{what appeared to be}} a rhomboid flipper, although sceptics have dismissed the images as the bottom of the loch, air bubbles, a rock, or a fish fin. The apparent flipper was photographed in different positions, indicating movement. The first flipper photo is better-known than the second, and both were enhanced and retouched from the original negatives. According to team member Charles Wyckoff, the photos were retouched to superimpose the flipper; the original enhancement showed a considerably less-distinct object. No <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> how the originals were altered.|$|E
25|$|Mattingly and Aaron {{struggle}} {{to find a way}} to turn on the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, and finally transmit the procedure to Swigert, who restarts Odyssey by transferring extra power from Aquarius. When the crew jettisons the Service Module, they are surprised to see the extent of the damage. As they release Aquarius and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, no <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> that Odysseys heat shield is intact. The tense period of radio silence due to ionization blackout is longer than normal, but the astronauts report all is well and splash down in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

After it has been taken for one day the Three Worms and all illnesses are immediately purged from the patient [...] If taken for three years, it will confer geniehood and <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> to be served by two fairies, who can be employed to summon the Traveling Canteen. This elixir can exorcize ghosts. When the unburied dead everywhere are possessing people and harming them, inflicting injuries upon our homes, and throwing up earthworks to obstruct people, no harm will come to us if this elixir is hung pointed toward the sources of disaster.

6000|$|... "Well, James, neither am I," [...] consented his cousin, helping {{himself from}} Lapham's Apollinaris bottle. [...] "There {{would be very}} little talking at dinner if one only said the things that <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> of." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was plenty}} to be curious about up at Nodwengu just then, since no <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> that civil war would not break {{out between the}} princes Cetewayo and Umbelazi, whose factions were present in force.|$|R
2500|$|Wu and Wong's {{match in}} the 1957 kung fu {{competition}} in Taiwan {{is the only}} documented proof of Wong's involvement in fighting competition; the only records of Wong's beimo matches are from eyewitnesses. Since beimo competition was held secretly, the loser often denied involvement in the fight afterward, or both sides would claim victory after the fight. For example, in the match between Ni Yuk Tong [...] (倪沃棠) and Wong, various accounts of the fight exist, and no <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> of where the fight took place, how the fighters performed, and who won. Thus, while many of Wong's students have referred to him as [...] "one of the greatest fighters of this century" [...] (i.e., the 20th century), those outside the wing chun community could doubt the claim's authenticity.|$|E

60|$|It {{was more}} {{sensible}} than Felix had expected. He {{was conscious of}} not understanding Clement, who always seemed to him like a girl, but if treated like <b>one,</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> to show himself in an unexpected light.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I am," [...] replied Rob, modestly; [...] "but {{these natural}} forces have really existed since the {{beginning}} of the world, and some <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> to discover them in time." [...] He was quoting the Demon, although unconsciously.|$|R
50|$|There is much {{speculation}} {{about the nature of}} whatever alien beings might have sent the signal. They must have been technologically superior, but no <b>one</b> can <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> whether they <b>were</b> virtuous or evil. Indeed, as the signal must have been sent long ago, no <b>one</b> can <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> whether they still exist.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm quite {{a philosopher}} about it. I want her money; {{and when one}} wants money, one should make up one's mind how much or how little one means to take,--and whether <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> to get it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] said Fairscribe, [...] "there is ill luck in averring till <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> of his facts. I {{will look}} back on a file of newspapers, and to-morrow you shall hear from me. Come, help yourself--I have seen you fill your glass higher." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And can {{you find}} two men to stick together, without feeling criminal, and without cringing, and without betraying one another? You can't. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> to go fawning round some female, then they both enjoy giving each other away, and doing a new grovel before a woman again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything perishes {{except the}} world {{itself and its}} keepers," [...] {{answered}} Ak. [...] "But while life lasts everything on earth has its use. The wise seek ways to be helpful to the world, for the helpful <b>ones</b> <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> to live again." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mirah hesitated {{before she}} said, [...] "I am too ready {{to speak of}} troubles, I think. It seems unkind to put {{anything}} painful into other people's minds, unless <b>one</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> it would hinder something worse. And perhaps I am too hasty and fearful." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Preston stared again. She was a pretty, {{intelligent}} woman, at whose {{dinner table}} <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> {{to hear the}} discussion of some [...] "modern problem": she believed herself to be a socialist. Her eyes sought Eleanor Goodrich's, who stood by, alight with excitement.|$|R
60|$|PRINCE PAUL. Ah, I {{am sorry}} you told me. It robs my visit {{of all its}} {{picturesqueness}} and adventure. I thought I was perilling my head by coming here, {{and you tell me}} I have saved it. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> to be disappointed if one tries to get romance out of modern life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to-day," [...] Karschoff insisted. [...] "To-day let us {{listen to}} {{the call of the}} world. Woman is at her loveliest in the spring. The Ritz Restaurant will look like a bouquet of flowers. Perhaps 'One for you and one for me.' At any rate, <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> of an omelette one can eat." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{should like}} to know, too, by what mysterious law of nature it is that before you have left your watch [...] "to be repaired" [...] half an hour, some <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> to stop you {{in the street and}} conspicuously ask you the time. Nobody even feels the {{slightest}} curiosity on the subject when you've got it on.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> of campaigns, I don't {{think that}} I could {{possibly}} {{bring myself to}} leave the service; {{but it is the}} probability of being kept, for three or four years at a time, doing nothing at Calcutta or Madras that decided me." ...|$|R
60|$|CONJURER. [Reflectively.] Ah, no <b>one</b> can <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of that {{till the}} tricks are told.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, if <b>one</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> of {{the nature}} of such a minx, Sir; for to own the truth, I would rather deal with a regularly-built Frenchman, who showed his guns honestly, and kept such a jabbering aboard that one might tell his {{bearings}} in the dark.--The creature spoke!" ...|$|R
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Yes, utterly sacrificed. Loveless {{marriages are}} horrible. But {{there is one}} thing worse than an {{absolutely}} loveless marriage. A marriage in which there is love, but on one side only; faith, but on one side only; devotion, but on one side only, and in which of the two hearts <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> to be broken.|$|E
6000|$|... "A little ill-humor {{is perhaps}} excusable," [...] was the {{tranquil}} answer. [...] "It is wisest not to prophesy until <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure,</b> you know. Now, I'm open, as I said, {{to do my}} best for you; but in that case you have just got to let me set about it independently. Usual or otherwise, it is my way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very strange! We {{left our}} cards, I know, yet they never {{asked us to}} their party this week, and now seem to have missed us again. I wished {{particularly}} to go, for <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> to meet all that is worth seeing, your knight among the rest. They are prim, strait-laced, exclusive people themselves; {{but it is a}} house worth going to.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Epistemological solipsism is {{the view}} that <b>one</b> can only <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of the {{existence}} of ones mind. The existence of other minds and the external world is not necessarily rejected but <b>one</b> can not <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of its existence ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{is there}} a chance, Peter? Although, if there is none, I quite {{agree with you that}} I would rather be drowned than shot down. If <b>one</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> of being killed by the first shot that would be the easiest death; but if we were only wounded they would {{probably}} hang us in the morning." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>One</b> thing <b>is</b> <b>sure,</b> that I have so devoted {{myself to}} you as to have killed wisdom in favour of love.|$|R
60|$|The {{lobby of}} the Hotel Cosmopolis is the exact centre of New York, the spot where at certain hours <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> of meeting {{everybody}} one knows. The first person that Nelly and Freddie saw, as they passed through the swing doors, was Jill. She was seated on the chair by the big pillar {{in the middle of}} the hall.|$|E
60|$|No--she had {{not been}} so much embarrassed as I had supposed. My {{imagination}} had got started on the wrong scent, and that is always hopeless; <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure,</b> then, to go straight on misinterpreting everything, clear through to the end. The young lady with her imperial Majesty was a maid of honor--and I had been taking her for one of her boarders, all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then to get away, to hide till <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure.</b> Put on the mackintosh. A man in {{a yellow}} mackintosh may have been seen to enter; let him be seen to go away. In some dark corner or some empty railway {{carriage}} take it off and roll it up. Then make for the office. Wait there for Ellenby. True as steel, Ellenby; good business man. Be guided by Ellenby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't tell, exactly. <b>One</b> thing <b>is</b> <b>sure,</b> he doesn't seem to {{remember}} anything of his trip to this out-of-the-way spot." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "No <b>one</b> can <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> {{how many}} lone {{children}} {{are there in}} the republic. About 9,000 are in internats and in orphanages." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1210 Pope Innocent III excommunicated High Duke Leszek. Mieszko IV Tanglefoot quickly conquered Kraków {{and took}} the title of High Duke. The excommunication bull was issued {{at the request of}} an {{anonymous}} Duke of Silesia, probably Henry (because Mieszko IV used the title Duke of Racibórz-Opole). The situation became quite confused and no <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> who held the real power.|$|R
