After Y. pestis overcomes the skin barrier, it encounters antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as Langerhans and dendritic cells. They transport the bacteria {{from the skin}} to the lymph nodes.

The symbiotic properties of these mutant strains were compared with those of the wild-type and O-antigen-deficient ΔwbiG strains. Upon introduction into Riptortus via the oral route, the <b>core</b> <b>oligosaccharide</b> mutant strains exhibited different rates of colonization of the insect midgut.

The Campylobacter waaF gene complements an S. enterica serovar Typhimurium waaF mutation and restores the ability to produce full-sized lipopolysaccharide. To examine the role of WaaF in C. jejuni, waaF mutants were constructed in strains NCTC 11168 and NCTC 11828. Loss of heptosyltransferase activity resulted in the production of a truncated <b>core</b> <b>oligosaccharide,</b> failure to bind specific ligands, and loss of serum reactive GM 1, asialo-GM 1, and GM 2 ganglioside epitopes. The mutation of waaF did not affect the higher-molecular-weight polysaccharide supporting the production of a LOS-independent capsular polysaccharide by C. jejuni. The exact structural basis for the truncation of the <b>core</b> <b>oligosaccharide</b> was verified by comparative chemical analysis. The NCTC 11168 <b>core</b> <b>oligosaccharide</b> differs from that known for HS: 2 strain CCUG 10936 in possessing an extra terminal disaccharide of galactose-β(1, 3) N-acetylgalactosamine. In comparison, the waaF mutant possessed a truncated molecule consistent with that observed with waaF mutants in other bacterial species. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R
40|$|Plesiomonas shigelloides is a Gram-negative {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{associated with}} gastrointestinal and extraintestinal infections, which especially invades immunocompromised patients and neonates. The lipopolysaccharides {{are one of}} the major virulence determinants in Gram-negative bacteria and are structurally composed of three different domains: the lipid A. the <b>core</b> <b>oligosaccharide</b> and the O-antigen polysaccharide. In the last few years we elucidated the structures of the O-chain and the <b>core</b> <b>oligosaccharide</b> from the P. shigelloides strain 302 - 73. In this paper we now report the characterization of the linkage between the core and the O-chain. The LPS obtained after PCP extraction contained a small number of O-chain repeating units. The product obtained by hydrazinolysis was analysed by FTICR-ESIMS and suggested the presence of an additional Kdo in the <b>core</b> <b>oligosaccharide.</b> Furthermore, the LPS was hydrolysed under mild acid conditions and a fraction that contained one O-chain repeating unit linked to a Kdo residue was isolated and characterized by FTICR-ESIMS and NMR spectroscopy. Moreover, after an alkaline reductive hydrolysis, a disaccharide alpha-Kdo-(2 -> 6) -GlcNol was isolated and characterized. The data obtained proved the presence of an alpha-Kdo in the outer core and allowed the identification of the O-antigen biological repeating unit as well as its linkage with the <b>core</b> <b>oligosaccharide...</b>|$|R

We sequenced O-antigen gene clusters from Shigella boydii serotypes 4, 5, 6, and 9 and also studied the O 53 - and O 79 -antigen gene clusters of E. coli, encoding O antigens {{identical to those}} of S. boydii serotype 4 and S. boydii serotype 5, respectively. In both cases the S. boydii and E. coli O-antigen gene clusters have the same genes and organization. The clusters of both S. boydii 6 and S. boydii 9 O antigens have atypical features, with a functional insertion sequence and a wzx gene located in the orientation opposite to that of all other genes in S. boydii serotype 9 and an rmlC gene located away from other rml genes in S. boydii serotype 6. Sequences of O-antigen gene clusters from another three Shigella clones have been published, {{and two of them}} also have abnormal structures, with either the entire cluster or one gene being located on a plasmid in Shigella sonnei or Shigella dysenteriae, respectively. It appears that a high proportion of clusters coding for O antigens specific to Shigella clones have atypical features, perhaps indicating recent formation of these gene clusters. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a key component of the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria. It comprises three dis-tinct regions: lipid A, an <b>oligosaccharide</b> <b>core,</b> and, commonly, a repeat unit polysaccharide O antigen. The O antigen is on...|$|E
40|$|Placental RNA has {{previously}} been shown to direct the synthesis of an asparagine-linked mannose-rich glycosylated form of the α subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG-α) in lysates derived from mouse ascites tumor cells. Glycosylation was dependent {{on the presence of}} homologous microsomal membranes, and the glycosylated protein was sequestered into the microsomal vesicles. Here we show that when Triton X- 100 is added after 60 min of translation and the incubation is continued, there is a shift of this glycosylated form to new discrete lower molecular weight proteins. The formation of these new proteins was not the apparent result of proteolysis because (i) treatment of the fully glycosylated protein or the proteins formed in the presence of Triton with endoglycosidase H resulted in the formation of a single protein migrating at the same rate on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels; (ii) the migration of nonglycosylated hCG-α synthesized in the presence of membranes isolated from tunicamycin-pretreated ascites tumor cells was not changed upon Triton addition; and (iii) the Triton-induced change was inhibited by mannonolactone, yeast mannan, and purified mannose oligosaccharides. It was also shown that little processing of the mannose-rich glycoprotein occurred in the presence of microsomal membranes alone. However, addition of the ribosome-free supernatant fraction to the glycoprotein resulted in processing. These data suggest that processing of the <b>oligosaccharide</b> <b>core</b> is a compartmentalized process in which removal of sugar, presumably mannose, requires a transfer of the glycoprotein from the endoplasmic reticulum to another component of the secretory cascade...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNod {{factors are}} {{substituted}} N-acyl chito-oligomers secreted by plant symbiotic bacteria of the Rhizobium family. Substitutions on the <b>oligosaccharide</b> <b>core</b> specify their recognition by host plants. A method using tandem mass spectrometry is proposed {{to locate the}} O-acetyl and O-carbamoyl substituents on the nonreducing terminal residue of the chito-oligomers. As model compounds, all the positional isomers of monoacetyl and monocarbamoyl esters of 1 -O-methyl-N-acetyl-α-D-glucosamine were synthesized. Oxonium ions (MH − CH 3 OH) + were generated by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS) and their decomposition was recorded on a tandem magnetic instrument. Large differences were observed in the relative abundances of ions resulting from elimination of water and of the O-ester substituent from metastable oxonium ions. Deuterium exchange reactions indicated parallel elimination pathways involving either exchangeable or carbon-linked hydrogens. The intensity ratios {{of some of the}} ions generated by collisions with helium atoms allowed the isomers to be distinguished. The main dissociation routes were identified. Metastable and collision-induced decomposition of the B 1 ions from Nod factors of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Azorhizobium caulinodans resembled that of the 6 -O-substituted N-acetylglucosamine models. Decomposition of the B 1 ion from Mesorhizobium loti and Rhizobium etli Nod factors, was similar to that of 3 -O-carbamoyl N-acetyl-glucosamine and different to that of the 4 -O isomer. 6 -O- and 3 -O-carbamoylation specified by the nodU and nolO genes, respectively, of Rhizobium. sp.
