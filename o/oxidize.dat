40|$|The {{levels of}} <b>oxidized</b> serum lipoproteins are {{increased}} in {{humans and animals}} with diabetes. We have examined the contribution of dietary <b>oxidized</b> lipids on the levels of <b>oxidized</b> lipoproteins. In both control and streptozocin induced diabetic rats, the <b>oxidized</b> lipid content of mesenteric lymph chylomicrons (CM) increased when increasing quantities of <b>oxidized</b> lipids were administered intragastrically. However, {{at all levels of}} administered <b>oxidized</b> lipids, the quantity of <b>oxidized</b> lipids in CM was greater in the diabetic animals. These results indicate that <b>oxidized</b> lipids are absorbed and packaged into CM and suggest that there is increased absorption of <b>oxidized</b> lipids in diabetic animals. In nondiabetic rats fed a fat-free diet, the levels of <b>oxidized</b> lipids in their serum lipoproteins were very low. When <b>oxidized</b> lipids were added to the diet, the quantity of peroxides in serum lipoproteins increased about fivefold. In diabetic animals fed a fat-free diet, there were also very low levels of <b>oxidized</b> lipids in their serum lipoproteins, and {{there was no difference between}} control and diabetic rats. However, when diabetic animals were fed a diet containing <b>oxidized</b> lipids, the quantity of <b>oxidized</b> lipids in their serum lipoproteins increased 16 -fold and were significantly greater than in controls. Thus, in both control and diabetic rats the quantity of <b>oxidized</b> lipids in the diet largely determines the levels of <b>oxidized</b> lipids in circulating lipoproteins. However, in diabetic animals the effect of diet is more pronounced. Together with the CM studies, these results demonstrate that dietary <b>oxidized</b> lipids make a major contribution to the levels of <b>oxidized</b> lipids in circulating lipoproteins and indicate that increased absorption of <b>oxidized</b> lipids in diabetic animals may play a role in the elevation of <b>oxidized</b> lipoproteins observed in this disorder...|$|R

Both <b>oxidized</b> R-limonene and <b>oxidized</b> linalool {{have recently been}} patch tested in an international setting, showing contact allergy in 5. 2 % and 6. 9 % of dermatitis patients, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To investigate concomitant reactions between <b>oxidized</b> R-limonene and <b>oxidized</b> linalool in consecutive dermatitis patients. METHODS: <b>Oxidized</b> R-limonene 3. 0 % (containing limonene hydroperoxides 0. 33 %) and <b>oxidized</b> linalool 6 % (linalool hydroperoxides 1 %) in petrolatum were tested in 2900 consecutive dermatitis patients in Australia, Denmark, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients reacted to either <b>oxidized</b> R-limonene or <b>oxidized</b> linalool. Of these, 25 % had concomitant reactions to both compounds, whereas 29 % reacted only to <b>oxidized</b> R-limonene and 46 % only to <b>oxidized</b> linalool. Of the 152 patients reacting to <b>oxidized</b> R-limonene, 46 % reacted to <b>oxidized</b> linalool, whereas 35 % of the 200 patients reacting to <b>oxidized</b> linalool also reacted to <b>oxidized</b> R-limonene. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the patients (75 %) reacted to {{only one of the}} oxidation mixtures, thus supporting the specificity of the reactions. The concomitant reactions to the two fragrance allergens suggest multiple sensitizations, which most likely reflect the exposure to the different fragrance materials in various types of consumer products.

The spot of Prx 6 on 2 D-GE undergoes a basic (isoelectric point, pI 6. 6) to acidic (pI 6. 2) shift by exposure to peroxide due to selective overoxidationof the active-site cysteine Cys- 47 but not of Cys- 91. However, we detected a tryptic peptide containing cysteine sulfonic acid atthe 47 th position from the basic spot and a peptide containing both <b>oxidized</b> Cys- 47 and <b>oxidized</b> Cys- 91 from the acidic spot ofPrx 6 after the separation by 2 D-GE. We prepared two types of <b>oxidized</b> Prx 6 s: carrying <b>oxidized</b> Cys- 47 (single <b>oxidized</b> Prx 6),and other carrying both <b>oxidized</b> Cys- 47 and Cys- 91 (double <b>oxidized</b> Prx 6).

40|$|Abstract—Oxidized lipoproteins {{may play}} a role in atherosclerosis. Recently, we have {{demonstrated}} that the levels of <b>oxidized</b> fatty acids in the circulation correlate directly with the quantity of <b>oxidized</b> fatty acids in the diet and that dietary <b>oxidized</b> fatty acids accelerate atherosclerosis in rabbits. The present study tests the hypothesis that <b>oxidized</b> cholesterol in the diet accelerates the development of atherosclerosis. Rabbits were fed a diet containing 0. 33 % nonoxidized cholesterol (control diet) or the same diet containing 0. 33 % cholesterol of which 5 % was <b>oxidized</b> (<b>oxidized</b> diet). Serum cholesterol levels increased to a similar extent in both groups, with the majority of cholesterol in the b-VLDL fraction. Moreover, in the serum b-VLDL fraction and liver, there was a significant increase in the <b>oxidized</b> cholesterol levels. Most importantly, feeding a diet enriched in <b>oxidized</b> cholesterol resulted in a 100 % increase in fatty streak lesions in the aorta.

The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine <b>oxidized</b> LDL concentrations in healthy dogs and cats, and to evaluate whether obesity affects <b>oxidized</b> LDL concentration, using 39 cats and 19 dogs that had visited 2 different veterinary clinics in Japan. We hypothesized that <b>oxidized</b> LDL concentrations measured against body condition score (BCS) may have a potential value in evaluating the qualities of accumulated or circulating lipids in obese dogs and cats that do not show signs of metabolic diseases. The mean <b>oxidized</b> LDL value in BCS 3 dogs (2. 4 ± 0. 9 μg/dl) was very similar to that of BCS 5 dogs (2. 2 ± 0. 3 μg/dl). The mean <b>oxidized</b> LDL value of BCS 4 dogs was 7. 2 ± 10. 3 μg/dl and the highest among three groups. BCS 4 dogs included two dogs whose <b>oxidized</b> LDL values were higher than the mean <b>oxidized</b> LDL value of healthy humans (11. 2 ± 0. 3 μg/dl). On the other hand, the mean <b>oxidized</b> LDL value of BCS 3 cats was 2. 5 ± 0. 9 μg/dl, and those of BCS 4 and 5 cats were higher than that of BCS 3, but there was no significant difference. The BCS 4 cat group included one cat with a higher <b>oxidized</b> LDL value, and the BCS 5 group also included two cats with <b>oxidized</b> LDL values higher than the mean <b>oxidized</b> LDL value of healthy humans.

However there is a dearth of evidence {{with regard to the}} amount of <b>oxidized</b> lipids consumed and its association with parameters of adiposity and glucose homeostasis in humans. Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} estimate the amount of <b>oxidized</b> lipids in common foods and the <b>oxidized</b> lipid consumption in the US population using the data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005 - 06. The second objective of this study is to investigate if there is an association between consumption of <b>oxidized</b> lipids with markers of adiposity and glucose tolerance. Methods- Foods with possible high <b>oxidized</b> lipid content were selected from the NHANES food frequency questionnaire. <b>Oxidized</b> lipid content /Peroxide Values (PV) of these foods were determined from published values in the literature. <b>Oxidized</b> lipid consumption was stratified into tertiles to determine the relationship between consumption of <b>oxidized</b> lipids and markers of adiposity.
