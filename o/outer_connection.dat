Such a line also had advantages for freight traffic. 1902, the Bypass Railway (Umgehungsbahn) was opened connecting the Magdeburg railway, the Lehrte Railway and the Hamburg Railway between Wildpark station (now Potsdam Park Sanssouci station) via Wustermark and Nauen. In the following years, {{the line was}} extended to Jüterbog on the Anhalt line and Oranienburg on the Prussian Northern line. In the 1920s, the Seddin marshalling yard {{was built on the}} Berlin-Blankenheim line and subsequently connected via Saarmund to Großbeeren on the Anhalt line. In the early 1930s a continuation of this link to the east via Schönefeld to Wuhlheide was planned, which would have approximated the route of the current outer ring. During the Nazi period the Outer Freight Ring (Güteraußenring) was built in 1940/41 to create a provisional connection from Teltow on the Anhalt line via Schönefeld to eastern Berlin, linking with the Stettin Railway at Berlin-Karow. It was significantly closer to Berlin’s southern outskirts that the previous plan and the current outer ring.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the safety performance of four exit ramp types and the major contribut-ing factors on motorcycle crashes and injury severity of motorcycle riders. A six-year crash data were collected in Florida, and a web-based survey (234 samples) was conducted. 573 crashes were found at 419 exits, including 178 diamond exits, 71 directional exits, 85 loop exits and 85 <b>outer</b> <b>connection</b> exits. For a diamond exit, both the survey and crash data showed that this type was safer and more preferable by motorcycle riders; while a loop exit was the most dangerous exit due to the sharp curve and a certain length of curve with limited visibility. For a directional exit, longer ramp lengths and the reverse curvature are the major factors causing motorcycle crashes. For an <b>outer</b> <b>connection</b> exit, the riders rated it as a safe type; however, the data showed higher average crash frequency and rate than those at diamond exits or directional exits.

30|$|Region {{partitioning}} is {{a fundamental}} aspect for ensuring a good performance. Ideally, compact regions with very few <b>outer</b> <b>connections</b> guarantee limited complexity, accuracy of the solution, and controlled computational time. In the considered scenarios, region partitioning is chosen {{in such a way}} that a unique generator is available in each region, and the region further includes those loads which are electrically closer (in terms of line impedance) to the generator. Since this corresponds to an excessively fine partitioning in Scenario 2), for the IEEE feeder, the region choice is made {{in such a way that}} a local controller is placed at each network bifurcation point, and the associated region corresponds to all those nodes which are electrically closer to it (in terms of line impedance).|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{calibration}} {{process is}} to use predictive models developed with data collected from other jurisdictions and apply them to the jurisdiction of interest by adapting the models for local conditions and characteristics specific to this jurisdiction. Given the large costs associated with data collection, this process is often the only method available to transportation agencies for estimating the safety of different transportation facilities. Thus, recalibrating models produced from other jurisdictions allows agencies to produce their own models at relatively low costs. The objective of the research was to recalibrate a set of crash prediction models for different ramp design configurations. The ramp design configurations addressed in this study included diagonal ramps, non-free-flow loop ramps, free-flow loop ramps, and <b>outer</b> <b>connection</b> ramps.

The results of the study have shown that more crashes occur on exit ramps than entrance ramps by a ratio of about 6 to 4.

The proposed layer-based design uses a bi-layer pattern of radial and spiral layer consecutively to generate functionally gradient porosity following {{the geometry of}} the scaffold.

The radial layers are generated with sub-region channels by connecting {{the boundaries of the}} medial region and the layer’s <b>outer</b> contour.

To ensure the fabrication of the designed scaffolds, both contours have been optimized for a continuous, interconnected, and smooth deposition path-planning. The proposed methodologies can generate the structure with gradient (linear or non-linear), variational or constant porosity that can provide localized control of variational porosity along the scaffold architecture.

40|$|LINGUISTIC TAXONOMY: DENSITY OF LANGUAGE SUBGROUPS, GROUPS AND FAMILIES Summary Language subgroups, groups, {{families}} and unities were investigated {{from the point}} of view of their dispersion in the way it was first proposed in (Тамбовцев 1986). We consider how compact this or that language taxon (i. e. subgroup, group, family or unity) on the basis of distribution of certain consonantal groups in the speech sound chain. Therefore, one can speak about a compact or disperse language family. If language taxon is compact, then its internal connections are shorter than its <b>outer</b> <b>connections.</b> Actually, the same notion of compact object is accepted in pattern recognition. The more compact the family, the more correctly its languages are chosen. If we put in the family a language, which does not belong to the family, then the dispersion of the family rises, thus it becomes less compact. If the language has a similar sound chain, then the dispersion of the group remains the same or becomes less. It means that the family became more compact. In this case we speak about the typological properties of the families. We measure the dispersion of a family by the sum of dispersions of 8 phonostatistical features: frequency of occurrence of labial, front, palatal, velar, sonorant, occlusive, fricative and voiced consonants. It is important that the features do not intersect. The values of the coefficient of variance (V) and T coefficient show the degree of dispersion. The principle is the greater the dispersion, the less compact the family. We have chosen the coefficient of variance and T coefficient since they both keep to the law of commensurability. Comparing different languages of different language {{families and}} different morphological structures was possible since all of them have the same 8 phonetic features mentioned above. We have considered Indo-European, Turkic, Mongolian, Tungus-Manchurian, Samoyedic, Finno-Ugric, Paleo-Asiatic, Austronesian, Australian and American Indian language families. The most compact is Mongolian (V = 10. 78 %; T = 0. 08), the least compact is Austronesian (V = 46. 21 %; T = 0. 90). Tungus-Manchurian (V = 17. 41 %; T = 0. 20) is more compact than Samoyedic (18. 29 %; T = 0. 16), Turkic (18. 77 %; T - 0. 21), Indo-European (V = 28. 00 %; T = 0. 61) or Paleo-Asiatic (V = 33. 89 %; T = 0. 46). Language groups are more compact than language families. Iranian group (V = 13. 21 %; T = 0. 09) of Indo-European language family is the most compact, the least compact is Romanian (V = 26. 25 %; T= 0. 33). Slavonic group (V = 15. 21 %; T = 0. 17) is more compact than Indo-Arien (V = 20. 40 %; T = 0. 23) or Germanic (V = 24. 51 %; T = 0. 29). Volga group of the Finno-Ugric language family (V = 17. 90 %; T = 0. 13) is more compact than Ugric (V = 27. 66 %; T = 0. 47) or Finnic (V = 29. 24 %; T = 0. 35) group. Altaic super-family is rather compact (V - 25. 97 %; T - 0. 45). It is more compact than Indo-European (V = 28. 00 %; T = 0. 61) or Paleo-Asiatic family (V = 33. 89 %; T = 0. 46). This fact supports those linguists who consider Altaic as a family, not a super family. Uralic super family is less compact than that (V = 28. 31 %; T = 0. 47), though it is more compact than Balkan (V = 29. 74 %; T = 0. 36) language unity (Sprachbund). Ural-Altaic language unity (V = 30. 98 %; T = 0. 88) is more (much more) compact than American Indian (43. 37 % 1. 07) language unity. Measuring the typological density of language taxons (subgroups, groups, families, unities) may help to understand how natural (or correct) these taxons are...|$|R

Detailed optical and near-infrared observations show that this object belongs to the class of the high-velocity gradient events as indicated by Si, S and Ca lines. The light curve shape and velocity evolution of SN 2002 dj appear to be nearly identical to SN 2002 bo. The only significant difference is observed in the optical to near-IR colours and a reduced spectral emission beyond 6500 A.

The theoretical differential oxygen abundance distribution (TDOD) predicted by the model maintains close to a continuous broken straight line. An application is made where a fictitious sample is built up from two distinct samples of halo stars and taken as representative of the inner Galactic halo. The related empirical differential oxygen abundance distribution (EDOD) is represented, to an acceptable extent, as a continuous broken line for two viable [O/H]-[Fe/H] empirical relations. The slopes and the intercepts of the regression lines are determined, and then used as input parameters to MCBR models.

The structure is a double hull design constructed of AS 4 / 3501 - 6 graphite epoxy with a zero {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} lay-up to prevent defocussing of the optics due to thermal loading. The overall design goal at MIT is to construct a space worthy structure. This thesis includes the preliminary design of the inner structure that houses the optics for the telescope. Design of the <b>outer</b> structure, the <b>connections</b> between the inner and the outer structure and detailed design of the inner structure are not included in this work. The analytical techniques used in this project included thermal analyses of structures in various earth orbits, determination of structural requirements from optical performance calculations, designing of near zero Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) laminates, consideration of manufacturing and material variations in design, strength analysis of composite laminates, and determination of vibration modes and associated frequencies of tubular structures with anisotropic sandwich construction. Experimental work included the building of co-cured honeycomb panels, curved panels, and tubular sections to verify the structure as designed was manufacturable. These efforts culminated in the production of a space-worthy component. Testing was preformed to verify the analysis and design. Testing included flatwise tension testing to verify integrity of the honeycomb bonding, tensile testing to verify stiffness calculations and experimentally determine the failure load for the desired lay-up, and testing to verify the CTE was within acceptable bounds to prevent the optics from defocussing. by Christopher Thomas Dunn.

In order to maintain a sealed and secure connection while in service, the connections are generally preloaded. To introduce this preload, the connections commonly have tapered threads and they are assembled by applying a certain make-up torque. The combination of the make-up torque and external loads results in a multiaxial stress distribution over the coupling, where the coupling’s threads act as stress raisers. When used in offshore environments, waves and currents cause dynamic loads acting on the pipelines. The {{pipe connections}} remain the weakest points because fatigue cracks can initiate in the connection’s threads. A wide variety of patented threaded pipe connection designs exists, all claiming to improve a connection’s fatigue life. However, experimental data for such designs, available in literature, is limited. Published studies generally comprise experiments on a single connection type. In addition, as no uniformity in testing setup, loading conditions and damage detection techniques exists, results from different studies can not be used for a detailed fatigue analysis to compare the designs. Furthermore, current design curves in codes and standards lead to overly conservative or inaccurate results. The aim of this work is to provide a better understanding of the fatigue mechanisms of threaded pipe connections and to study the effect of different design features on a connection’s fatigue life. Final goal is to formulate guidelines for new fatigue resistant connection designs. In this study, the API Line Pipe connection is used as a reference. Several modifications and design features are applied to this connection type. To simulate the influence of these modifications, a parametric 2 D axisymmetric finite element model, called ThreadGen, is developed. The results of this model are compared with a 3 D finite element simulation to prove its validity for both make-up and bending. In addition the results of the 2 D axisymmetric simulations are validated by static strain gauge measurements during a make-up test, an axial tension test, a bending test and an internal pressure test. The validated model is then used to evaluate the influence of connection properties and design features on the threaded connection’s behaviour. Test rigs are developed to perform fatigue experiments on three scales: the small scale experiments on 1 ” (33. 4 mm <b>outer</b> diameter) <b>connections</b> are performed in four-point bending; the medium scale tests on 4. 5 ” (114. 3 mm) connections are carried out under axial tension and in four-point bending; for full scale testing of specimens in the range of 150 mm to 500 mm in diameter a resonant bending fatigue setup is developed. A significant part of this work is dedicated to this last setup. Two plain pipes without a threaded connection are tested in the setup to characterize its dynamic behaviour and to measure the response of a pipe subjected to a certain excitation frequency. The testing of full scale threaded pipe connections in this setup is part of future research. The majority of the performed fatigue tests comprises small scale experiments. Several modified configurations are tested. For each configuration an S-N curve is constructed, so that the effect of a certain configuration on the connection’s fatigue life can be quantified. It is observed that a local modification of the threaded connection’s geometry as well as the connection’s contact conditions can have an important influence on the fatigue life of the connection. During the medium scale four-point bending tests, advanced measuring techniques are used to monitor the fatigue crack growth during the test. Although these are existing techniques, they are applied to crack sizing in threaded connections for the first time. A dynamic 3 D optical displacement measurement system is used to detect changes in the bending deflection shape of the pipe as a result of a propagating crack. Besides, a local crack opening measurement is carried out and modal analysis techniques are applied to monitor changes of the pipe’s eigenfrequencies. To visualize the crack fronts at different moments during the tests, a beach marking technique is used so that the exact crack shapes can be seen during post-mortem analysis. It is shown that a crack initiates at the root of the last engaged thread of the male part of the connection, and propagates gradually over a large segment of the circumference, forming a long shallow crack. When the crack penetrates the pipe wall, it rapidly increases in size along two crack fronts. The observed crack shapes do not have a semi-elliptical shape as commonly used in fracture mechanics. A fatigue crack growth analysis that considers the crack as an annular flaw, is effective in describing the crack growth behaviour. The results from the finite element simulations and the experimentally obtained S-N curves are combined in a multiaxial damage evolution law. Using this fatigue analysis, the observed trends in the fatigue lives of the configurations are explained. The general concept of using a connection’s thread load distribution as a measure for its fatigue life is proven to be inaccurate. The main reason for this is that the load distribution is related to the axial stresses over the connection. However, the fatigue life of a threaded connection is determined by the local multiaxial stress distribution and strain range around the root of the last engaged thread. These local conditions are not only the result of the load distribution, but they are also affected by the hoop stress introduced during make-up, which can additionally be affected by a changed connection stiffness. In addition, the multiaxial damage evolution law is used to analyse the influence of several features on a connection’s fatigue life. Not for all patented modifications an increased fatigue life is predicted when applied to the API Line Pipe connection. It is finally stated that to optimize a fatigue resistant connection, it is appropriate to combine several design features. The thread shape can be optimized to obtain a low stress concentration factor and reduce the local strains at the thread root. The connection global geometry and make-up conditions can be optimized to improve the load distribution over the threads and reduce local stresses and strains at the threads...|$|R
