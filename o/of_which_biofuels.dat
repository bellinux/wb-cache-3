40|$|The Danish energy {{production}} is partly based {{on fossil fuels}} and partly based on renewable energy sources <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>biofuels</b> is a significant element. In Denmark the cost price of fuels used for {{energy production}} is added a CO 2 tax. This tax is determined only according to the emission of greenhouse gases when the fuels are combusted. The objective of this work is to determine and include the emissions due to energy consumption during the procurement of Danish fuels in 1997. The means are to illuminate the energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gasses (mainly CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O), NOx and SO 2, which {{is not included in}} the regulation from the Danish government. Life Cycle Assessment on the procurement The study performed in this work is life cycle assessments on the pre-combustion life of fuels; straw, wood chips, Danish wood pellets, imported wood pellets, coal, oil and natural gas. The study is based on actual conditions regarding extraction, farming, cultivation, transportation, and machinery etc. for Danish fuels. The approach to the work has been to collect information regarding extraction methods related to the fossil fuels, and characteristic data related to the cultivation of bio fuels.

40|$|Commission policy {{proposals}} for a 10 % renewable energy use in road transport fuels by 2020, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>biofuels</b> {{is expected to}} be a significant part, were approved by the Council in March 2007. The Renewable Energy Directive (RED) concretises this policy and was decided in December 2008. The RED defines the environmental sustainability criteria that biofuels must adhere to in order to be counted as contributing towards the 10 % target, including for direct land use change. That decision includes a requirement for the Commission to report by 2010 on indirect land use change (ILUC) and, where appropriate, make proposals on how to address this issue. The Fuel Quality Directive (FQD), adopted at the same time as the RED, also includes sustainability criteria and targets a reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from fuels consumed in the EU by 6 % by 2020. Biofuels demand in the EU {{is expected to be}} satisfied through a mix of domestic production and imports. This will have an impact on world agricultural production and markets, and on agricultural land use. A similar impact can be expected from biofuels mandates in other major economies, including the US.

40|$|Transportation has {{continued}} to increase worldwide and fossil-fuel dependency is strong {{which leads to a}} number of problems, e. g. increased emissions of green-house gases (GHG) and risks related to energy security. Biofuels have until now been one of the few renewable alternatives which have been able to replace fossil fuels on a large scale. The biofuel share in relation to the total use of fuel in the transportation sector is still small, but in many places in the world political targets are set to increase the share of renewable fuels, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>biofuels</b> are supposed to be an important part. Within the European Union targets for renewable energy have been set, including within the transportation sector, where 10 % shall come from renewable sources by 2020 according to the EU Renewable Energy Directive (EU RES). Biofuels also need to fulfill the sustainability criteria in the EU RES, to be regarded as renewable. Depending on how biofuels are produced their resource efficiency varies, and the differences in environmental and economic performance can for instance be significant. The aim of this thesis is to describe and analyze conditions for a development towards increased and more resource-efficient production of biofuels in Sweden. The conditions have been studied from a regional resource perspective and from a biofuel producer perspective since it has been assumed that the producers are in possession of important knowledge, and potentially will {{play an important role in}} future biofuel development. The concept of resource efficiency used in this thesis includes an environmental and economic perspective as well as an overall societal dimension to some extent. The region of Östergötland in Sweden was used for the assessment of the resourcefocused biofuel potential for the year 2030, where two scenarios based on assessments regarding socio-technical development in relation to regional resources were used. The scenarios were based on semi-structured interviews with biofuel actors, literature studies and information from experts in the field. In the EXPAN (Expansion) scenario a continued development in line with the current one was assumed, but also an increased availability of feedstock primarily within the agricultural and waste sectors (also including byproducts from industry) for biofuel production. In the INNTEK (Innovation and Technology development) scenario greater technological progress was assumed to also enable the use of some unconventional feedstock besides increased available arable land and improved collection/availability of certain feedstock. Biomass feedstock from four categories was included in the potential: waste, agriculture, forestry and aquatic environments. One important feedstock which was not included in this study, but which is often included in studies of potential, is lignocellulosic material from the forest. This choice was also supported by the regional actors who judged it as less probable that there will be any large-scale use of such feedstock for biofuels in this region within the given timeframe. Regarding arable land available for biofuel production a share of 30 % was assumed at maximum in the region, of which 15 % is already used for cereal production for ethanol fuel. On these additional 15 % assumed to be available for biofuel production year 2030, ley cropping for production of biogas was assumed in this study. Aquatic biomass is often not included in biofuel potentials. Here, algae were assumed to be a potentially interesting substrate for biogas production since harvesting algae in for instance the Baltic Sea could be seen as a multifunctional measure, i. e., contributing additional environmental benefits such as reducing eutrophication. Based on the assumption that the energy need in the transportation sector will be the same in 2030 as in 2010, up to 30 % could be substituted with biofuels in the EXPAN scenario and up to 50 % in the INNTEK scenario, without seriously conflicting with other interests such as food or feed production. In the study of potential, production systems for biogas production were   prioritized since such systems were judged to have a large potential for resource efficiency. This is because they have a big capacity to utilize by-products and waste as feedstock, and also because they can contribute to closing the loops of plant nutrients, seen as an important goal in society, if the digestate is returned to arable land. The utilization of by-products and waste however in many cases requires cooperation between different actors in society. Within the research field of industrial symbiosis, cooperation regarding material and energy flows is studied from different perspectives, e. g. how such cooperation between actors evolves and to what extent such cooperation can contribute to improving the environmental and economic performance of systems. Both these perspectives are interesting in relation to biofuels since production often involves a large number of energy- and material flows at the same time as resource efficiency is important. How the producers organize the production when it comes to feedstock, energy, by-products and products and what influences this is therefore interesting to study. In this thesis four biofuel producers of three different biofuels (ethanol, biodiesel and biogas) on the Swedish market were studied, focusing on how they organize their biofuel production in terms of e. g. their material and energy flows, and how they intend to organize it in the future. The study is based on semi-structured interviews with the biofuel producers as well as literature studies. In all the cases, a number of areas of material and energy flow cooperation were identified and it could also be concluded that there had been some change regarding these patterns over time. Looking into the future a clear change of strategy was identified in the ethanol case and partly also in the biodiesel case where a development towards improved valorisation and differentiation of by-product flows was foreseen. If such a “biorefinery” strategy is realized, it can potentially improve the economic viability and resource efficiency in these biofuel producers. In the biogas cases, instead a strategy to lower the costs for feedstock through the use of lower quality feedstock was identified. This strategy also has a potential to increase economic viability and improve the resource efficiency. However, the success of this strategy is to a large extent dependent on how the off-set of the biofertilizer can be arranged regarding the economic challenges that the biogas producers’ experience, and yet no strategy for implementation regarding this was identified. The EU Renewable Energy Directive was mentioned in relation to most cooperation projects and therefore regarded as an important critical factor. All of the studied companies also struggle to be competitive, for which reason the importance of the direct economic aspects of cooperation seems to increase. Transporterna i världen ökar kontinuerligt och det fossila beroendet är fortsatt stort vilket medför flera problem, bl. a. ökade utsläpp av växthusgaser och en osäkerhet kring framtidens energiförsörjning. Biodrivmedel har hittills varit ett av de få förnyelsebara alternativ som kunnat ersätta fossila drivmedel i stor skala. Andelen biodrivmedel av den totala bränsleanvändningen inom transportsektorn är dock fortfarande liten, men på många håll i världen finns nu politiska mål för att öka andelen förnyelsebara drivmedel av vilka biodrivmedel förväntas utgöra en viktig del. Inom EU har mål för förnybar energi satts upp bl. a. inom transportsektorn där 10 % skall komma från förnybara energikällor senast år 2020 enligt EUs förnybarhetsdirektiv. Biodrivmedel måste dessutom, om de ska räknas som förnyelsebara, uppfylla direktivets hållbarhetskriterier. Beroende på hur biodrivmedel produceras är de olika resurseffektiva, med exempelvis betydande skillnader avseende miljömässig och ekonomisk prestanda. Syftet med den här avhandlingen är att beskriva och analysera förutsättningarna för en utveckling mot ökad och mer resurseffektiv produktion av biodrivmedel i Sverige. Förutsättningarna har studerats med ett regionalt resursperspektiv samt från ett  biodrivmedelsproducentperspektiv eftersom producenterna sitter på viktiga kunskaper och sannolikt spelar en betydande roll för den framtida utvecklingen. Resurseffektivitetsbegreppet som används i den här avhandlingen inkluderar ett miljömässigt och ett ekonomiskt perspektiv liksom ett övergripande samhälleligt perspektiv. När det gäller ett regionalt resursperspektiv har Östergötland använts för att med hjälp av två scenarier för år 2030 ta fram en biodrivmedelspotential utifrån en bedömning av en socio-teknisk utvecklingspotential i förhållande till regionala resurser. Scenarierna togs fram med hjälp av semistrukturerade intervjuer med aktörer i branschen, litteraturstudier och i vissa fall med hjälp av sakkunniga. I scenario EXPAN (expansionsscenario) antogs en fortsatt teknikutveckling i linje med den hittills-varande och en samtidig ökning av tillgängligheten av potentiella resurser inom framförallt jordbrukssektorn och avfallssektorn (inkluderat också restproduktsresurser inom industrin) för biodrivmedelsproduktion. I scenario INNTEK (Innovations och teknikutvecklingsscenario) har utöver ytterligare antagen tillgänglig jordbruksmark också större tekniksprång antagits som möjliggör användning av icke konventionella råvaror för biodrivmedelsproduktion, samt förbättrad insamling/tillgängliggörande av vissa råvaror. I potentialen har biomassa från fyra olika sektorer inkluderats; avfall, jordbruk, skogsbruk och akvatiska miljöer. En viktig biomassaresurs som inte inkluderats i denna potentialstudie, men som vanligen inkluderas i potentialstudier, är lignocellulosarika material från skogen. Detta var ett val som också stöddes av de regionala aktörerna som i den här studien bedömde det som mindre sannolikt att någon storskalig användning av sådana råvaror kommer att finnas i regionen inom den aktuella tidsramen. När det gäller jordbruksmark som kan utnyttjas för bioenergiproduktion så har en andel på 30 % antagits, varav 15 % redan idag utnyttjas till spannmålsodling för produktion av etanol. På de ytterligare 15 % som antas kunna tas i anspråk för biodrivmedelsändamål år 2030, har vallodling för biogasändamål antagits i denna studie. Akvatisk biomassa ingår ofta inte i bioenergipotentialstudier, men har inkluderats här eftersom alger skulle kunna vara ett intressant substrat för biogasproduktion, men också för att algskörd i akvatiska miljöer skulle kunna ses som en multifunktionell åtgärd med ytterligare miljönytta som t. ex. minskad övergödning i Östersjön. Med antagandet att energibehovet inom transportsektorn blir lika stort år 2030 som år 2010, skulle upp till 30 % av de fossila drivmedlen kunna ersättas av biodrivmedel i scenario EXPAN och upp till 50 % i scenario INNTEK, utan att större intressekonflikter skulle uppstå i förhållande till andra behov såsom mat eller foderproduktion. I potentialstudien har vidare produktionssystem för biogas prioriterats eftersom sådana system bedömdes ha stor potential när det gäller resurseffektivitet. Först och främst för att de har stor kapacitet när det gäller användning av restprodukter, men också för att de kan bidra till att sluta kretsloppet av växtnäringsämnen om rötresten återförs till åkermark. Nyttiggörande av restprodukter och avfall kräver emellertid i många fall samarbete mellan olika aktörer i samhället. Inom forskningsfältet industriell symbios studerar man bl. a. hur samarbeten kring energi- och materialflöden mellan aktörer uppstår och i vilken utsträckning samarbetsgraden kan bidra till att förbättra miljöprestandan och ekonomiska prestanda i systemen. Dessa perspektiv är intressanta i förhållande till biodrivmedel eftersom produktionen av dessa är förknippad med ett stort antal energi- och materialflöden samtidigt som resurseffektiviteten är viktig. Hur biodrivmedelsproducenterna organiserar produktionen när det gäller råvaror, energi, biprodukter och produkter och vad som styr detta är därför intressant att studera. I den här avhandlingen studerades hur fyra svenska biodrivmedelsproducenter för tre olika biodrivmedel (etanol, biodiesel och biogas) på den svenska marknaden har organiserat sin produktion, med fokus på energi- och materialflöden, samt hur de planerar att organisera den framöver. Studien baseras framförallt på semi-strukturerade intervjuer med aktörerna samt litteraturstudier. I samtliga fyra fall kunde ett antal samarbeten kring bl. a. material och energiflöden kartläggas samt hur dessa förändrats över tiden. När det gäller framtiden kunde en tydlig strategiomläggning ses i etanolfallet och delvis i biodieselfallet mot en valorisering och diversifiering av rest-/bi-produktflöden. Om denna ”bioraffinaderistrategi” lyckas kan den bidra till bättre lönsamhet och bättre resurseffektivitet. I biogasfallen fanns istället strategier för att försöka sänka råvarukostnader genom att hitta råvaror av lägre kvalitet. Också denna strategi kan öka lönsamheten och förbättra resurseffektiviteten, men detta förutsätter att avsättningen av biogödsel också kan lösas på ett lönsamt sätt. Detta är en fortsatt stor utmaning för biogasproducenterna. En av de viktigaste kritiska faktorerna för de olika samarbetsprojekten var EUs förnybarhetsdirektiv som nämndes i samband med de flesta samarbetsprojekt och som här sågs som en miljömässig drivkraft. Också det långsiktiga byggandet av gröna varumärken verkar vara en drivkraft, åtminstone när det gäller vissa samarbetsprojekt. Samtliga biodrivmedelsproducenter kämpar idag med lönsamheten varför också de ekonomiska aspekterna kring samarbeten är mycket väsentliga...|$|E

What is the spatial extent and composition of agricultural management systems that exist in the U. S. Midwest? 2. 	How does sub-grid scale edaphic variation impact our estimation of poplar biomass productivity across a gradient of spatial scales in the U. S. Midwest? 3. 	How do location and management interactions impact yield gap analysis of cellulosic ethanol production in U. S. Midwest? In the first chapter, I developed an algorithm to identify representative crop rotations in the U. S.

In the second chapter, a new algorithm is developed to reduce the computational burden of high resolution ecosystem modeling of poplar plantations in U. S.

40|$|The ethanol tariff {{is one of}} the {{instruments}} used by the government to encourage domestic ethanol production. Existing literature analyzing the market and welfare effects of the US ethanol tariff has concluded that removing the tariff would increase social surplus and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, due to the replacement of corn ethanol with lower cost and lower GHG intensive sugarcane ethanol. This paper re-examines these findings {{in the presence of a}} domestic cellulosic ethanol industry. The current RFS mandate requires 21 billion gallons of advanced <b>biofuel,</b> a portion <b>of</b> <b>which</b> could be met by any non-starch based biofuel that reduces emissions by at least 50 % compared to an energy equivalent amount of gasoline. Sugarcane ethanol has been classified as an advanced biofuel, and competes for market share with domestic advanced biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol. In addition, it also competes with corn ethanol for market share in the non-advanced biofuel market. The dual market for sugarcane ethanol raises the question <b>of</b> <b>which</b> domestic <b>biofuel</b> market the tariff protects. Our results show that the effect of removing the tariff on social welfare and GHG emissions is ambiguous and depends on <b>which</b> <b>biofuel</b> market the tariff is protecting. If the tariff protects the corn ethanol market, its removal increases welfare and GHG emissions. However, if the tariff protects the cellulosic ethanol market, removing the tariff could increase emissions. Whether the tariff protects either the corn ethanol or cellulosic ethanol market, or both depends on the relative costs and supply elasticities of the three types of biofuel. In general, the removal of the tariff leads to an increase in social surplus, although in some cases, such as when the excess supply elasticity of sugarcane ethanol is not very elastic, net welfare could decrease when the tariff is removed. Removal of the tariff also reduces the share of domestically produced fuel, and this effect is greater when the tariff is protecting both the cellulosic and corn ethanol markets, i. e. the removal of the tariff causes a reduction in the production of both biofuels. biofuel, ethanol tariff, fuel externalities, Agricultural and Food Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, Q 17, Q 18, Q 42,...|$|R

As {{a solution to this}} problem, co-production of H- 2 and ethanol, both <b>of</b> <b>which</b> are good <b>biofuels,</b> has been suggested. To this end, using Escherichia coli, activation of pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, which can generate more NADPH than the Embden-Meyhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, was attempted. Overexpression of two key enzymes in the branch nodes of the glycolytic pathway, Zwf and Gnd, significantly improved the co-production of H- 2 and ethanol with concomitant reduction of pyruvate secretion. Gene expression analysis and metabolic flux analysis (MFA) showed that, upon overexpression of Zwf and Gnd, glucose assimilation through the PP pathway, compared with that of the EMP or Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, was greatly enhanced. The maximum co-production yields were 1. 32 mol H- 2 mol(- 1) glucose and 1. 38 mol ethanol mol(- 1) glucose, respectively.

National legislation imposes a 5 % biofuels blend by 2010 and promotes their use for electricity generation too. The consumption of these renewable energy sources would contribute to change the actual energy model -based 90 % on fossil fuels- and also to reduce gasoil and natural gas deficits. Moreover, small agricultural producers from different regions of the country would receive benefits from their biofuels production: a share guaranteed for the national market as well as tax exemptions.

Currently, the bioconversion strategy is regarded as the most common approach for industrial utilization <b>of</b> lignocellulosic biomass, <b>which</b> explores natural microbial colonizers of lignocellulose or their lignocellulose-degrading enzymes to decompose the recalcitrant structural polymers to easily metabolizable monosaccharides which are subsequently converted to products (Balan 2014). Improving the bioconversion efficiency of lignocellulosic biomass has received increased attention from researchers in recent years.|$|R

40|$|Biofuels are {{promoted}} by governments {{as a replacement}} for fossil fuels in the transport sector. However, according to current scientific evidence, their use does not necessarily significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This article examines issues related to the regulation of biofuels’ life-cycle ghg emissions. It finds that a regulatory gap exists at the international level, whilst regulation at the domestic level faces limits or is insufficient to fill this gap. It remains to be seen whether, taking into account the scientific complexities, coherent international rules for biofuels will be adopted. Until then, a polycentric regulatory approach on the use <b>of</b> <b>biofuels,</b> <b>which</b> addresses the sustainability problem at multiple scales, thereby enabling experimentation and cross-influence among different levels of standard-setting, will remain in place across the world. The current approach entails a potentially beneficial learning process on how to properly regulate biofuels. However, there is a risk that national regulators will promote biofuels without knowing or ccounting exactly for {{the extent to which they}} contribute to greenhouse gas reductions...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{measures in}} pulp mills can potentially reduce the consumption <b>of</b> <b>biofuel,</b> <b>which</b> can instead be exported and used elsewhere. In this paper a methodology is proposed for analysing the robustness of energy efficiency investments in Kraft pulp mills or other industrial process plants equipped with biofuelled {{combined heat and power}} units, given uncertain future climate policy. The outlook for biofuel and electricity prices {{is a key}} factor for deciding if energy efficiency measures are cost competitive. CO 2 emission charges resulting from climate policy are internalized and thus included in electricity and biofuel prices. The proposed methodology includes a price-setting model for biofuel that assumes a constant price ratio between biofuel and electricity in the Nordic countries. Thirteen energy efficiency retrofit measures are analysed for an existing Swedish Kraft pulp mill. Special attention is paid to heatintegrated evaporation using excess process heat. Four possible energy market development paths are considered that reflect different climate policies. Pulp mill energy efficiency investments considered are shown to be robust with respect to uncertain climate policy. Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The UK {{transport}} sector has the fastest {{rate of growth}} in terms of primary (and end-use) energy consumption, and is currently responsible for 30 % of UK CO 2 emissions. Biofuels could significantly reduce the emissions from the road-{{transport sector}} if they were widely adopted. They {{have been shown to}} reduce carbon emissions, and may help to increase energy security. There are many different types <b>of</b> <b>biofuels,</b> <b>which</b> are produced from various crops and via different processes. Biofuels can be classified broadly as biodiesel and bioethanol, and then subdivided into conventional or advanced fuels. Such biofuels are assessed in terms of indigenous UK production potential, and whether they are able to meet the domestic take-up targets set by the British Government for the road-transport sector. The various types of biofuels currently available are examined, together with potential future conversion-technologies. In-vehicle performance of these biofuels is then compared with conventional fuels, and their potential carbon savings evaluated. Finally, the main drivers and barriers to the use of biofuels in the road transport sector are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} {{industrialization and}} transportation {{of the world}} has lead to a steep rise in the demand of petroleum based fuels. Petroleum based fuels are obtained from limited reserves. These finite reserves are highly concentrated in certain regions of the world and therefore to fulfill the demand {{of the rest of the}} regions they have to import the crude petroleum for the power production and industrialization. On the other hand the emissions from the fossil fuels are considered as a major source to the environment pollution and have an adverse effect on human health. Hence it is necessary to look for alternative fuels which can be produced from the available local resources and that could reduce the dependence on petroleum. Biodiesel is one <b>of</b> the <b>biofuels</b> <b>which</b> is renewable and environmentally friendly and can be used in diesel engines with little or no modifications. In the present study the Linseed oil (Linum Usitatissimum) biodiesel blend is chosen as an alternative fuel for the diesel engine. The linseed oil is blended with diesel up to 20 % with no major reduction in engine performance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{breakdown}} of β- 1, 4 -mannoside linkages {{in a variety}} of mannan-containing polysaccharides is of great importance in industrial processes such as kraft pulp delignification, food processing and production <b>of</b> second-generation <b>biofuels,</b> <b>which</b> puts a premium on studies regarding the prospection and engineering of β-mannanases. In this work, a two-domain β-mannanase from Thermotoga petrophila that encompasses a GH 5 catalytic domain with a C-terminal CBM 27 accessory domain, was functionally and structurally characterized. Kinetic and thermal denaturation experiments showed that the CBM 27 domain provided thermo-protection to the catalytic domain, while no contribution on enzymatic activity was observed. The structure of the catalytic domain determined by SIRAS revealed a canonical (α/β) 8 -barrel scaffold surrounded by loops and short helices that form the catalytic interface. Several structurally related ligand molecules interacting with TpMan were solved at high-resolution and resulted in a wide-range representation of the subsites forming the active-site cleft with residues W 134, E 198, R 200, E 235, H 283 and W 284 directly involved in glucose binding...|$|R
30|$|The {{relationship}} between crude oil, {{as a proxy}} for energy costs, and agricultural commodities (and dairy commodities in particular) has received attention in recent times. As stated by Baffes (2011), “any analysis of non-energy commodity markets cannot be undertaken in isolation to developments in energy markets”. This is underlined by the study of Huchet-Bourdon (2011), who found that butter and whole milk powder agricultural products had prices that most closely correlated with crude oil price over the last decade. In that study, the authors assume that this relationship might be due to the direct effect of crude oil price on agricultural commodity prices, through transportation and production costs. Another reason might be the increasing use of agricultural commodities for the production <b>of</b> <b>biofuel,</b> <b>which</b> provides a new link between oil and agricultural commodities. This points to relationships between crude oil, dairy products and vegetable oils, which are used for biofuel production (e.g. palm oil)—the latter also being considered a substitute for dairy products. In addition to these direct price links, there is the global concern that volatile energy prices may stimulate agricultural price volatility (Gardebroek and Hernandez 2013).|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{improvement}} of bacterial tolerance to or-ganic solvents is a main prerequisite for the microbial production <b>of</b> <b>biofuels</b> <b>which</b> are toxic to cells. For targeted genetic engineering of Escherichia coli to in-crease organic solvent tolerances (OSTs), we selected and investigated {{a total of}} 12 genes that participate in relevant mechanisms to tolerance. In a spot assay of 12 knockout mutants with n-hexane and cyclohexane, the genes fadR and marR were finally selected as the two key genes for engineering. Fatty acid degradation reg-ulon (FadR) regulates the biosynthesis and degradation of fatty acids coordinately, and the multiple antibiotic resistance repressor (MarR) is the repressor of the global regulator MarA for multidrug resistance. In the compet-itive growth assay, the ΔmarR mutant became dominant when the pooled culture of 11 knockout mutants was cultivated successively {{in the presence of}} organic sol-vent. The increased OSTs in the ΔmarR and ΔfadR mutants were confirmed by a growth experiment and a viability test. The even more highly enhanced OSTs in the ΔfadR ΔmarR double mutant were shown compared with the two single mutants. Cellular fatty acid analysis showed that the high ratio of saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids plays a crucial role in OSTs. Furthermore, the intracellular accumulation of OST strains was significantly decreased compared with the wild-type strain...|$|R
