40|$|AbstractLow {{in-vitro}} {{regeneration rate}} of oil palm {{is the main}} limitation for clonal mass propagation. To evaluate the in-vitro performance of oil palm mass propagation, an experiment comprising 167 <b>ortets</b> are established and evaluated for in-vitro traits. Genetic parameters are analyzed using anova, followed by Ward's clustering to classify the <b>ortets</b> and selection the best progeny. The results showed a high heritability value on callogenesis and embryogenesis rate. Ward's clustering on both traits produces five clusters. KN 16 progeny gives the best performance among 19 analyzed, where almost the <b>ortets</b> are belongs to the best cluster. Therefore, this progeny is recommended for further recloning...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{relationship}} between <b>ortets</b> and ramets (grafts) growing in the same environment or at widely different localities, clone trials were established with 20 and 45 clones, respectively, at two localities in central Sweden. The <b>ortets</b> selected were plus trees or trees with poor to normal growth and quality, and of considerably varying age. The characteristics studied in 1 - 3 years were stem dimensions; number of branches; branch length, diameter and angle; stem straightness; and cone yield. The variation among clones was studied and the components of variance estimated. The main source of variation were the site differences within each locality. The variation between clones was pronounced in most traits, particularly in cone yield, and increased with age. The repeatability in each clone was good in one test field but poor in the other. Correlations among various clone characteristics, e. g. cone production and graft habitus, {{have an impact on}} the gain to be obtained in a seed orchard.

40|$|Aims Intra-species <b>ortet</b> {{competition}} has significant effects on growth, sexual reproduction and clonal propagation of clonal plants. Iris japonica is widely distributed along open area of forest edges and under sparse forest canopies with higher light and water conditions in southern China. It affects other herbs by its dominance through clonal propagation. Our {{objective was to}} determine the effect of different initial ortets of I. japonica on clonal propagation and growth. Findings could provide a theoretical foundation for the management of understory vegetation with I. japonica. Methods From September 2007 to June 2008, we conducted a simulation experiment of I. japonica in which we replaced a <b>ortet</b> by an independent one-year ramet. We set up three treatments: one initial separate <b>ortet</b> (O), two initial separate ortets (T) and four initial separate ortets (F) in 0. 7 m × 0. 7 m, which represented the effect of intra-species <b>ortet</b> competition. Each treatment had 10 repeats, and we quantitatively measured characters of clonal propagation, leaves and biomass and allocation of clonal propagation in different treatments. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Important findings The number of new ramets per <b>ortet</b> of I. japonica was higher, and number of dead ramets per <b>ortet</b> was lower in O treatment than in T and F treatments. Number of primary and secondary daughter ramet (per <b>ortet)</b> and length, surface, volume and length per density of fine rhizomes and roots of I. japonica decreased with the increase of initial <b>ortet</b> (<b>ortet</b> competition). The number of highly withered and total withered leaves of mother ramet, and number of moderately withered, highly withered and total withered leaves of daughter ramet of I. japonica increased with the increase of initial <b>ortet</b> (<b>ortet</b> competition). Leaf area and number of leaves per <b>ortet</b> and number of leaves for daughter ramet per <b>ortet</b> of I. japonica significantly decreased, and leaf area ratio (LAR) per <b>ortet</b> significantly increased with the increase of initial <b>ortet</b> (<b>ortet</b> competition). Biomass of fine rhizomes, coarse rhizomes, clonal propagation, aboveground, belowground and total plant and allocation to fine rhizome and belowground of I. japonica significantly decreased, and allocation to coarse rhizome of mother ramet and aboveground significantly increased with the increase of initial <b>ortet</b> (<b>ortet</b> competition). In sum, with the increase of <b>ortet</b> competition, growth of I. japonica and status of its leaves were inhibited, and clonal propagation became weaker.

40|$|The current E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid {{breeding}} {{strategy of}} South Africa’s Forestry Industry {{is to maintain}} large breeding populations of both parental species in which parents are selected based on their general combining ability (GCA) estimates or predicted individual tree breeding values and are used for interspecific hybrid crosses. The hybrid material is first screened in seedling progeny trials after which superior individuals are selected and tested as clones. Although this strategy has delivered superior clones for commercial production in South Africa, {{it is a time}} consuming strategy to follow and more cost effective strategies are being investigated. In order to review the current hybrid breeding strategy, information on the genetic control of the traits of interest is needed for E. grandis x E. urophylla seedling and clonal populations. The main objectives of this study were therefore to firstly estimate genetic parameters for E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid seedling and clonal populations; secondly to investigate the correlation between E. grandis and E. urophylla parental (GCA) or individual breeding values and their general hybridising ability (GHA); and lastly to determine the correlation between E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid seedling <b>ortets</b> and their ramets. Results of our study indicated that non-additive genetic variation explained the majority of the total genetic variation in E. grandis x E. urophylla seedling and clonal populations. Due to the pre-eminence of non-additive variance, the pure-hybrid correlations were weak, especially for clonal populations. It would therefore seem that GCA or predicted individual breeding values are not good predictors of GHA for growth performance in the observed populations. Our study also indicated a weak coefficient of correlation between the growth performance of seedling <b>ortets</b> and their ramets. These results suggest that: firstly a hybrid breeding strategy to capture non-additive genetic variation should be adopted; and secondly that the first phase of screening E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid material as seedlings should be revisited.

RAPD variation within clones was trivial compared to the variation found even between full-sib clones. Genetic similarity decreased with pedigree distance. The pedigree of the material was successfully displayed by UPGMA clustering of the genetic similarity matrix, with parents generally clustering with their offspring. In a second experiment, 120 RAPD bands allowed the successful discrimination of selfs from their intra- and interprovenance half-sib outcrosses and again genetic similarity decreased with pedigree distance.

40|$|Conventionally, Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla (GU) hybrid {{material}} has first been tested as seedlings in progeny trials {{for at least}} four years before <b>ortets</b> were selected and ramets of the selected <b>ortets</b> were propagated to test in clonal trials. The primary constraint with this “conventional hybrid breeding strategy” (CHBS) is the time required to first test the hybrid material as seedlings. In order to address this, an “accelerated hybrid breeding strategy” (AHBS) was investigated to reduce the time spend on testing GU hybrid material as seedlings. However, it is of utmost importance to quantify the impact the AHBS might have on genetic gains and genetic information. With this in mind, two clonal populations have been established with genetic material that derived from the CHBS and the AHBS. The main {{purpose of this study is}} therefore to do a comparative study between the CHBS and AHBS to firstly quantify the genetic gains per unit time for GU hybrid clonal populations that have been derived from the CHBS and AHBS respectively; and secondly to obtain genetic parameters such as heritabilities, the ratio of dominance, clonal within family variance and the proportion of additive and non-additive genetic variance. The results of our study indicated that the percentage realised volume gains per year was higher for the AHBS (3. 7 %) than for the CHBS (1. 9 %) when compared to the GU commercial clone. Thus, shortening the testing time of GU seedlings had a positive impact on volume gains per year. With regards to genetic parameters, both the AHBS and CHBS clonal populations indicated that non-additive genetic variation explained majority (88 % and 71 % respectively) of the genetic variation. Due to the pre-eminence of non-additive genetic variation, the narrow sense heritabilties for the female and male effects were negligible for both clonal populations. Overall, the majority of the non-additive genetic variation was explained by the proportion of dominance variance, and less by the clone within family effect. These results suggest that: firstly the time spend on testing GU hybrid material as seedlings should be minimised; and secondly a hybrid breeding strategy to capture non-additive genetic variation should be adopted.

The gas exchange, vegetative growth and nutrient content variables were evaluated. There was no interaction between the water conditions and embryogenic lines for any variable. The moderate water-deficit stress significantly reduced the stomatic conductance, photosynthesis, transpiration and growth. Under waterlogged conditions, the seedlings developed root aerenchyma and pneumatophores as adaptation mechanisms, and their gas exchange or their micronutrient reduction and assimilation processes (with the exception of copper) were not affected. However, under permanent waterlogging, the seedlings had poor growth because of higher leaf respiration rates and probably pneumatophore maintenance and imitations in the absorption and transport of macronutrients. while the plants under partial waterlogging exhibited a growth pattern similar to that observed under optimal soil moisture conditions...|$|R

In the selection of clones for production their amenability to tissue culture and their pro lificness in shoot production are additional selection criteria...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the performance of 15 clones of the IAC 500 series of Hevea brasiliensis, developed at Instituto Agronômico (IAC), over a 12 -year period, in the northwest region of São Paulo State, Brazil. The 15 new clones evaluated are primary clones obtained from selected <b>ortets</b> within half-sib progenies. The clone RRIM 600, of Malaysian origin, {{was used as the}} control. Dry rubber yield performance over a four-year period, mean girth at the tenth year, girth increment before and during tapping, thermal properties of the natural rubber produced and other characters of the laticiferous system were evaluated. Forty percent of the clones were superior in comparison to the control for yield. Clone IAC 500 recorded the highest yield (66. 81 g per tree per tapping) over four years of tapping, followed by IAC 502 (62. 37 g per tree per tapping), whereas the control recorded 48. 71 g per tree per tapping. All selected clones were vigorous in growth. The natural rubber from this IAC clones showed thermal stability up to 300 ºC. No differences were observed in the thermal behavior of rubber among the IAC series and the RRIM 600 clones. The clones IAC 500, IAC 501, IAC 502, IAC 503 and IAC 506 are the more promising for small-scale plantations, due to growth and yield potential...|$|R
40|$|Summary. High quality DNA was {{isolated}} from Casuarina equisetifolia which is widely planted in tropics and subtropics for its multiple utilities. Two commonly used methods, CTAB based and the commercially supplied DNeasy TM Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Germany) were tested for their efficiency in isolating high {{quantity and quality}} DNA to be utilized for AFLP analysis. The CTAB based protocol was modified by introducing additional steps and manufacturer’s protocol was followed for the commercial kit. DNA yield and purity were monitored by gel electrophoresis and by determining absorbance under UV (A 260 /A 280 and A 260 /A 230). Both ratios were between 1. 9 and 2. 1, indicating the absence of contaminating metabolites. The average DNA yield obtained from 100 mg needle tissue using the CTAB based protocol and the commercial kit was 17 mg and 6 mg, respectively. Further, the purity of DNA was assessed by enzymatic digestion with EcoRI and HindIII and the DNA was also tested for suitability by AFLP-PCR analysis. A unique AFLP pattern was achieved for the five <b>ortets</b> tested showing the utility of DNA for fingerprint studies. Based on the quantity of isolated DNA, the CTAB based method is recommended for C. equisetifolia DNA extraction {{and it can be}} utilized for other Casuarina species with high content of fiber and phenolic compounds...|$|R
40|$|Winter {{survival}} in woody plants {{is controlled by}} environmental and genetic factors that affect the plant's ability to cold acclimate. Because woody perennials are long-lived and often have a prolonged juvenile (pre-flowering) phase, {{it is conceivable that}} both chronological and physiological age factors influence adaptive traits such as stress tolerance. This study investigated annual cold hardiness (CH) changes in several hybrid Rhododendron populations based on Tmax, an estimate of the maximum rate of freezing injury (ion leakage) in cold-acclimated leaves from juvenile progeny. Data from F 2 and backcross populations derived from R. catawbiense and R. fortunei parents indicated significant annual increases in Tmax ranging from 3. 7 to to 6. 4 C as the seedlings aged from 3 to 5 years old. A similar yearly increase (6. 7 ° C) was observed in comparisons of 1 - and 2 -year-old F 1 progenies from a R. catawbiense x R. dichroanthum cross. In contrast, CH of the mature parent plants (> 10 years old) did not change significantly over the same evaluation period. In leaf samples from a natural population of R. maximum, CH evaluations over two years resulted in an average Tmax value for juvenile 2 - to 3 - year- old plants that was 9. 2 C lower than the average for mature (~ 30 years old) plants.. A reduction in CH was also observed in three hybrid rhododendron cultivars clonally propagated by rooted cuttings (ramets) - Tmax of 4 -year-old ramets was significantly lower than the Tmax estimates for the 30 - to 40 -year-old source plants (<b>ortets).</b> In both the wild R. maximum population and the hybrid cultivar group, higher accumulation of a cold-acclimation responsive 25 kDa leaf dehydrin was associated with older plants and higher CH. The feasibility of identifying hardy phenotypes at juvenile period and research implications of age-dependent changes in CH are discussed...|$|R
