5|$|After {{leaving the}} Argonne National Laboratory in 1956, Zinn moved to Florida, where he founded his own {{consulting}} firm, General Nuclear Engineering, with {{its headquarters in}} Dunedin, Florida. The company {{was involved in the}} design and construction of pressurized water reactors. It was acquired by Combustion Engineering in 1964, and he became a vice president and head <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> division. He stepped down from this position in 1970, but remained a board member until 1986. He served {{as a member of the}} President's Science Advisory Committee from 1960 to 1962, and a member of the General Advisory Committee of the AEC and its successor, the Energy Research and Development Administration, from 1972 to 1975.|$|E
5|$|Anton was a {{scientist}} in Nazi Germany who, following a disagreement regarding the direction <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> program, is {{recruited by the}} US and flees via France, Spain, and Portugal. He becomes {{a part of the}} Manhattan Project, witnesses the tests, and travels to Hiroshima recording the aftermath. Anton regrets the consequences of the atomic bombs, attends the Pugwash Conference, but maintains his belief that it was necessary to end the war and prevented more deaths. He marries Sophie and becomes a professor at Columbia University in New York. With Sophie, he retires to a small town outside of Toronto.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, the Air Force {{decided to}} close three <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons {{stations}} at its SAC bases. In addition to Loring, other bases {{around the world}} were scaled back. As the B-1B Lancer was now predicted to become the mainstay of nuclear defense for the country, Loring was deemed unnecessary for nuclear weapons stationing. That same year, fears began to surface that Loring would be an {{on the list of}} the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. As a result, the community began to rally around the base, which at the time included 3,800 military personnel, 1,000 civilian employees, generated an $80 million payroll the previous year, and was the subject of $34 million in construction services.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the W23, an {{adaptation}} of the W19 nuclear artillery shell was developed specifically for the 16-inch guns. The shell had an estimated yield of , and its introduction made the Iowa-class battleship's 16-inch guns the world's largest nuclear artillery, and made these four battleships the only US Navy ships ever to have nuclear shells for naval guns. Although developed for exclusive use by the battleship's guns {{it is not known}} if any of the Iowas actually carried these shells while in active service due to the United States Navy's policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weaponry aboard its ships. In 1991 the United States unilaterally withdrew all <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> artillery shells from service, and dismantling of the US nuclear artillery inventory {{is said to have been}} completed in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado {{is capable}} of {{delivering}} air-launched nuclear weapons. In 1979, Britain considered replacing its Polaris submarines with either the Trident submarines or alternatively the Tornado as the main bearer <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> deterrent. Although the UK proceeded with Trident, several Tornado squadrons based in Germany were assigned to SACEUR to deter a major Soviet offensive with both conventional and nuclear weapons, namely the WE.177 nuclear bomb, which was retired in 1998. German and Italian Tornados are capable of delivering US B61 nuclear bombs, which are made available through NATO.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} came at {{a delicate}} time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing sanctions on Iran after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement was verified, most sanctions against Iran would be lifted, including all sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. sanctions against Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles would not be affected. In mid-January 2016, most sanctions were lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain terrorist groups and individuals responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5billion for victims and their families ($2million for pain and suffering and $6.88million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{isotopes}} of nobelium are known, {{with mass}} numbers 250–260 and 262; all are radioactive. Additionally, nuclear isomers {{are known for}} mass numbers 251, 253, and 254. Of these, the longest-lived isotope is 259No with a half-life of 58minutes, and the longest-lived isomer is 251mNo with a half-life of 1.7seconds. However, the still undiscovered isotope 261No is predicted to have a still longer half-life of 170min. Additionally, the shorter-lived 255No (half-life 3.1minutes) is more often used in chemical experimentation {{because it can be}} produced in larger quantities from irradiation of californium-249 with carbon-12 ions. After 259No and 255No, the next most stable nobelium isotopes are 253No (half-life 1.62minutes), 254No (51seconds), 257No (25seconds), 256No (2.91seconds), and 252No (2.57seconds). All of the remaining nobelium isotopes have half-lives that are less than a second, and the shortest-lived known nobelium isotope (250No) has a half-life of only 0.25milliseconds. The isotope 254No is especially interesting theoretically {{as it is in the}} middle of a series of prolate nuclei from 231Pa to 279Rg, and the formation <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> isomers (of which two are known) is controlled by proton orbitals such as 2f5/2 which come just above the spherical proton shell; it can be synthesized in the reaction of 208Pb with 48Ca.|$|E

25|$|Iran's {{nuclear program}} has been a subject of {{international}} debate for decades.

25|$|The central {{stars of}} {{planetary}} nebulae are very hot. Only when a star has exhausted most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> fuel can it collapse {{to such a}} small size.

This led to the idea that planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space {{at the end of its}} life.|$|E
25|$|In return, {{the state}} promised {{to comply with}} an {{agreement}} with the International Atomic Energy Agency which supports better monitoring <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> interests.

25|$|The {{suspicion}} intensified in {{the second}} half of the 1980s. As domestic media reports were published, uncovering secret nuclear developments, rumors about a possible Brazilian nuclear test emerged. One of the main Brazilian newspapers, Folha de S. Paulo, published an interview in April 1985 with a retired military officer who stated that the government planned to develop a nuclear device and explode it in 1990. During that same period, international papers denounced covert nuclear activities in Brazil, which reignited external questioning <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>nuclear</b> aspirations.|$|E
