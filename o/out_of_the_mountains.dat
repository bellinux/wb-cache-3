5|$|During {{the first}} 20 years of settlement, {{there was only}} limited contact between the {{settlers}} and Aboriginal people. Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted {{to set up a}} cattle farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven back <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains.</b> The rush of prospectors into the Kiandra area through the Brindabellas and the mountains {{to the west of the}} ACT as a result of the Kiandra goldrush led to conflict with the Aboriginal people. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the indigenous population had been significantly reduced.|$|E
5|$|Batista {{responded with}} an all-out-attack, Operation Verano, {{in which the}} army aerially bombarded forested areas and villages {{suspected}} of aiding the militants, while 10,000 soldiers commanded by General Eulogio Cantillo surrounded the Sierra Maestra, driving north to the rebel encampments. Despite their numerical and technological superiority, the army had no experience with guerrilla warfare, and Castro halted their offensive using land mines and ambushes. Many of Batista's soldiers defected to Castro's rebels, who also benefited from local popular support. In the summer, the MR-26-7 went on the offensive, pushing the army <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains,</b> with Castro using his columns in a pincer movement to surround the main army concentration in Santiago. By November, Castro's forces controlled most of Oriente and Las Villas, and divided Cuba in two by closing major roads and rail lines, severely disadvantaging Batista.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, Carpenter, with Captain Nolan {{as second}} in command, and three {{companies}} of troopers {{headed out to}} Sulfur Springs to deny that source of water to the Apaches. In the early light of day, Victorio saw a string of wagons rounding a mountain spur to the southeast and about eight miles distant, crawling onto the plain. Victorio sent a band of warriors riding <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> and attacked savagely. The wagons held a load of provisions for Fort Davis with a company of infantry riding {{in some of the}} wagons. The warriors were met with rifle fire, as the teamsters circled the wagons in defensive positions. Alerted by his Indian scouts, Carpenter and two companies charged to the rescue. The Apache attack disintegrated as the warriors fled in confusion to the southwest to rejoin Victorio's main force as it moved deeper into the Carrizo Mountains. Nolan's ambush was not ready and the scattered warriors were able to avoid them.|$|E

25|$|After Napoleon's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Aspern-Essling and his {{subsequent}} concentration of troops for a decisive battle, the Tyrolean revolt flared {{again and the}} rebels scored many successes in June and July.

25|$|With {{the further}} {{spread of the}} {{railroad}} networks in the 1890s and early 1900s, many new towns developed and thrived in the Alleghenies.

25|$|Bighorn sheep {{were among}} the most admired animals of the Apsaalooka (Crow) people, and what is today called the Bighorn Mountain Range was central to the Apsaalooka tribal lands. In the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area book, storyteller Old Coyote {{describes}} a legend related to the bighorn sheep. A man possessed by evil spirits attempts to kill his heir by pushing the young man over a cliff, but the victim is saved by getting caught in trees. Rescued by bighorn sheep, the man takes the name of their leader, Big Metal. The other sheep grant him power, wisdom, sharp eyes, sure-footedness, keen ears, great strength, and a strong heart. Big Metal returns to his people with the message that the Apsaalooka people will survive only so long as the river winding <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> is known as the Bighorn River.|$|E
25|$|In 1590, the Villa de San Luis de la Paz {{was founded}} {{named after the}} peace (paz) treaty between the Spanish and the Chichimeca. With the Spanish occupying most of the most {{productive}} land and its resources, the indigenous of the area became extremely impoverished. This eventually allowed the Spanish to negotiate peace with chiefs in exchange for basic goods such as blankets, clothes and food. This would bring temporary truces. For the long term, evangelization efforts would bring longer term submission. Franciscans and Augustinians worked to gradually modify the worldview of the Chichimecas and others until many moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> and into settlements and profess, at least nominally, the Catholic faith. However, the indigenous remained extremely marginalized and poor, losing both language and culture until most eventually intermarried with outsiders to produce mestizos.|$|E
25|$|A {{traveler}} going {{west from}} China must go either {{north of the}} Tian Shan through Dzungaria or south of the Tian Shan through the Tarim Basin. Trade usually took the southern route and migrations the northern. This is most likely because the Tarim leads to the Ferghana Valley and Iran, while Dzungaria leads only to the open steppe. The difficulty with the southern route was the high mountains between the Tarim and Ferghana. There is also another reason. The Taklamakan Desert of the Tarim is too dry to support much grass, and therefore lacked nomads likely to rob caravans. Its inhabitants lived mostly in oases formed where rivers ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> into the desert. These were inhabited by peasants who were unwarlike and merchants who {{had an interest in}} keeping trade running smoothly. On the other hand, Dzungaria had a fair amount of grass, few towns to base soldiers in and no significant mountain barriers to the west. Therefore, trade went south and migrations north.|$|E

500|$|After {{a retreat}} of {{approximately}} [...] {{in which his}} rear guard was continually harassed by the vanguard of his enemy, Moreau halted at Schliengen and distributed his army in a [...] semicircle along a ridge that commanded the approaches from Freiburg. He placed his right wing, commanded by Ferino, at the neighboring heights of Kandern (altitude [...] ) and Sitzenkirch, and his left wing at Steinstadt. His center occupied the village of Schliengen (altitude 820 feet or 250 meters), which lay about [...] from the Rhine river. His entire force guarded a front protected by a small stream, the [...] long Kander that meandered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> west of Kandern and plunged [...] into the Rhine when it passed Steinstadt. For extra protection, Moreau also posted a body of infantry {{in front of his}} center, giving it added depth. His position on the heights gave him the advantage in any approach; his troops could fire downhill on any advancing troops. The French position, in the chain of abrupt and woody heights, seemed nearly impregnable.|$|E

At this point, I-287 joins I-87 on the eight-lane New York State Thruway, passing over Metro-North Railroad's Port Jervis Line as it heads east <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> into suburban residential and commercial surroundings as it narrows to six lanes. After passing through the Village of Montebello, the freeway reaches an interchange with Airmont Road where it becomes the border between Montebello {{to the north and}} the [...] Village of Airmont to the south. Continuing to the east, the New York State Thruway becomes the border between Monsey and Airmont before separating Monsey from the Village of Chestnut Ridge to the south as it turns slightly to the east-southeast. After briefly running along the south edge of the Village of Spring Valley, where there is a westbound toll plaza for trucks, the highway fully enters Chestnut Ridge. In this area, it comes to the New York extension of the Garden State Parkway. [...] Following this junction, I-87/I-287 continues east into the Town of Clarkstown, coming to an exit for [...] NY59. After this, the road passes to the north of Nanuet, crossing under New Jersey Transit/Metro-North Railroad's Pascack Valley Line.

500|$|The South Koreans {{were holding}} {{positions}} at {{the northern end of}} the Kapyong Valley, having advanced [...] since relieving the 27th Brigade. However, anticipating a Chinese attack, the divisional commander—General Chang Do Yong—had halted his advance at 16:00 and ordered his two forward regiments—the 19th and the 2nd Infantry Regiments—to tie-in and develop defensive positions. Meanwhile, the 7th Infantry Regiment occupied reserve positions immediately behind the forward regiments. Suffering a reputation for unreliability in defence the South Koreans had been bolstered by the attachment of the New Zealand guns and a battery of [...] M101 howitzers from the US 213th Field Artillery Battalion. Regardless, left with only one hour to halt its advance and step up defences, the forward South Korean units were only able to occupy a series of hill-top positions while leaving the valleys and flanks exposed. Two Chinese divisions—the 118th and the 60th Division—struck at 17:00, easily infiltrating through numerous gaps between the badly organised defensive positions. Under pressure all along the front, the defenders gave ground almost immediately and soon broke. Abandoning their weapons, equipment and vehicles, they disintegrated and began to stream south <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> and through the valley, and by 23:00 Chang was forced to admit that he had lost all communication with his units. At 04:00 {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the New Zealanders to prevent their loss, however following reports that the South Koreans were making a stand they were ordered back up the valley the next morning with the Middlesex accompanying them as protection. By dusk it was clear that the South Koreans had in fact collapsed, and the guns were withdrawn again.|$|E
500|$|Édouard Mortier had marched from Passau and Linz toward Vienna, {{traveling}} {{on the north}} bank of Danube. [...] His newly created VIII Corps, known as Corps Mortier, consisted of three divisions, which were stretched [...] apart along the river between Marbach and Dürenstein. This over-extension left his Corps' northern flank unprotected, against Napoleon's specific instructions. Schmitt's plan capitalized on this mistake. On 11 November 1805, Kutuzov's column trapped one of Mortier's divisions, under command of Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan de la Peyrière. The Russians used a ruse to entice Gazan into {{an attack on a}} small force, and then trapped him between two columns. The French were surrounded at the front and rear by the Russians, caught on the flood plain at Dürenstein. They could neither move forward nor backward. A second French division arrived in mid-afternoon and attacked the Russians in the flank, but were themselves surprised when Schmitt led an additional Russian column <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains.</b> Gazan's division lost over 40 percent of its men, colors, and several guns. The battle lasted well into the night. In its waning moments, the French were evacuating across the Danube in a flotilla of boats. In the dark confusion, Schmitt was shot, probably by Russian musketry, in a field between the Waldstein and Heudürrgraben. Wilhelm von Kotzebue, a German in Russian service, later reported that the column came through the forest road and entered the main road on the river's edge; they immediately entered the cross-fire between Dupont's forward posts of Dragoons and the Dokhtoruv's Russians. He fell by Wadstein, and was buried on the battlefield with the dead of his Russian column. [...] Although his burial site has never been found, a monument for him was erected in a park in nearby Krems in 1811.|$|E
