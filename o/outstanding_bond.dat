40|$|This paper {{develops}} an overlapping-generations {{model with}} nominal wage rigidities and examines the welfare effects of debt policy during recessions. Issues of public debt stimulate aggregate consumption demand and create employment. Future generations then face both increased wage incomes and higher taxes. If {{the amount of}} outstanding bonds is already large, debt policy deteriorates the welfare of future generations by levying heavy taxes. By contrast, if the <b>outstanding</b> <b>bond</b> issue is relatively small, debt policy can be Pareto improving by creating more employment. Therefore, the welfare implications of debt policy during recessions can be discriminated from those during booms. debt policy, overlapping generations, welfare effects. ...|$|E
40|$|We study {{a dynamic}} {{setting in which}} a firm chooses its debt {{maturity}} structure endogenously over time without commitment. In our model, the firm keeps its promised <b>outstanding</b> <b>bond</b> face-values constant, but can control the firm’s maturity structure via the fraction of newly issued short-term bonds when refinancing its matured long-term and short-term bonds. As a baseline, we show that when the firm’s cash-flows are constant then {{it is impossible to}} have the shortening equilibrium in which the firm keeps issuing short-term bonds and default conse-quently. Instead, when the cash-flows deteriorate over time so that the debt recovery value is affected by the endogenous default timing, then a shortening equilibrium with accelerated de-fault can emerge. Self-enforcing shortening and lengthening equilibria exist, and the shortening equilibrium may be Pareto-dominated by the lengthening one...|$|E
40|$|Corporations {{that issue}} {{long-term}} debt are frequently {{faced with the}} opportunity to call the bonds and issue new bonds at more advantageous interest rates. When the current interest rate falls below the contractual interest rate on the outstanding debt, then computations must be made to evaluate the desirability of the refunding decision. This paper investigates the possibility of introducing the probabilities of different interest rates in the future, thus considering the desirability of postponing the refunding as well as the desirability of refunding now. There are four basic steps in the analysis of the decision whether or not to refund a currently <b>outstanding</b> <b>bond</b> issue prior to its maturity date. These steps are: a. the computation of the relevant cash flows (or the relevant costs), b. the choice of the rate of discount to be used in making the analysis, c. the treatment of uncertainty, d. the incorporation of qualitative factors. ...|$|E

Between 2003 and 2011, UC’s <b>outstanding</b> <b>bond</b> debt to investors more than doubled. Funds raised through borrowing were invested into medical centers, dormitories, and athletic facilities {{at the same time}} as core university functions were scaled back due to cuts in state appropriations. We argue that these divergent trends are best understood as the financialization of university governance. We first trace the precipitous growth of UC debt beginning in the early 2000 s. We then show howthe university has partnered with Wall Street firms to expand its borrowing activities through the use of a broad array of financial instruments. These changes occurred as UC’s administration empowered financial managers and recruited Wall Street veterans to positions as senior university executives and members of UC’s Board of Regents. Finally, we discuss the consequences for university governance of this reorientation towards financial strategies and financial markets...|$|E

This paper develops a theory of international currency portfolios that holds in general equilibrium, and that is therefore not subject to the criticisms directed at the portfolio balance literature of the 1980 s. It shows that, under plausible assumptions about fiscal policy, the relationship between the rates of return of different currency bonds is not correctly described by an arbitrage relationship but instead also depends on <b>outstanding</b> <b>bond</b> stocks. Other findings are: (1) There is a monotonically increasing relationship between domestic interest rates and the portfolio share of domestic currency denominated assets. This relationship is steep at low levels of government debt, and almost flat at high levels of government debt. (2) Optimal private sector foreign currency positions are negative, and their size is decreasing in exchange rate volatility. Under volatile exchange rates large negative aggregate net foreign asset positions can only be rationalized by assuming large public sector borrowing from foreign governments.

40|$|The {{possibilities}} {{to improve}} households' eligibility for long-term housing loans at fixed interest rates {{has been a}} current topic of public discussion. Yet, credit institutions have difficulties in granting such loans, unless they themselves can acquire fixed-rate funding. In many cases, the only feasible {{way for them to}} raise such funding is to issue bonds. In a number of countries, such arrangements are already in use. In this paper we present a cross-country study of housing finance by mortgage-backed bonds. The paper describes and analyses mortgage credit markets in Denmark, Sweden and the United States of America with respect to the institutional structure, loans and bonds characteristics, legal framework and the security underlying the system. We have found that all three markets differ and that these differences originate from the respective countries' national characteristics and financial histories. In Sweden and the United States in particular, the public sector has been involved in developing the system. Generally, long-term credit is offered in all three countries through relatively well-functioning, efficient markets. However, certain problems are common to all. First, the number of <b>outstanding</b> <b>bond</b> series is relatively large. Second, in many housing loans, the borrower has the option to repay the debt prematurely. In these cases, the credit institution may have to avoid maturity matching problems by issuing bonds with unknown maturity. We briefly review the history and present circumstances of Finnish bond issuing credit institutions to elucidate why such institutions play a marginal role. Long ago, bond-issuing mortgage institutions were {{an essential part of the}} Finnish financial market, but legislative obstacles to their operations almost killed the industry after World War II. The tax system favoured ordinary banks, and bond emissions were restricted by government regulations. Now, these legal obstacles have been abolished. In the light of both foreign and past domestic experience, such institutions have a market niche. Finally, we discuss some of the problems related to setting up a bond-financed mortgage credit market in Finland. housing loans; bonds; mortgage banks...|$|E
