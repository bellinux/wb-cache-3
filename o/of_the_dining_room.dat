5|$|After being {{purchased}} by the Guellers in 2004, the restaurant was redecorated and modernised, the décor having become shabby under previous owners. The new decorations included recessed lighting and fabric-covered walls. There is a fireplace in the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> with an 18th-century settle (a type of bench) beside it. Elements from the Reid and Long era remain, with the bar and ceilings still being recognisable from their time at the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 {{the kibbutz}} decided after four gatherings {{to appoint a}} team of members to discuss the {{privatization}} of electricity, food, mail, barbershop and cosmetics. Other services were to be kept under {{the responsibility of the}} kibbutz, these include: healthcare, education and welfare. The dispute mainly concerned the privatization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> At the end of the discussions, most privatization initiatives were rejected, and only a few minor changes that had no practical effect on the collective lifestyle were accepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the restaurant has been designed by the Russell Sage Studio, who also worked on other Ramsay establishments, The Savoy Grill and the York and Albany. The claret red theme of previous incarnations of the restaurant has been maintained, and was coupled in the design with leather and polished metalwork. The layout includes a chef's table for six people which overlooks the kitchen. The wine list includes more than 2,000 bottles of wine, and includes 34 different vintages of the French wine Pétrus. They are located in a circular glass room located in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1834, {{a chimney}} fire seriously damaged the house, with the {{exception}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> wing. This prompted Jackson to have the current 13-room Greek Revival structure built on the same foundation as the former house, which was completed two years later. The architects for the house were Joseph Reiff and William C. Hume, who were building Tulip Grove across the road.|$|E
25|$|During World War II {{the farm}} {{was hit by}} three Luftwaffe bombs in 1940. One landed on the East side of Cockrow Hill where the crater still remains. Another hit {{one end of the}} {{farmhouse}} and destroyed the kitchen, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> a bedroom and part of the attic. The house survived and but was not rebuilt in its original form and size. A third bomb damaged the South end of the tithe barn which was later repaired.|$|E
25|$|On March 9, {{the body}} of a 28th victim was found buried in a pit close to a {{barbecue}} grill in the backyard of the property: the victim was found wrapped within several plastic bags and wore a silver ring on the fourth finger of his left hand, indicating the possibility he had been married. One week later, on March 16, the skeletal remains of another victim were found buried beneath the joists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> floor, bringing the total number of bodies exhumed at 8213 West Summerdale Avenue to 29.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room's</b> {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} remodel in 1898 because of Ellwood's rise to national prominence through his barbed wire partnership with Joseph Glidden. The room was enlarged through <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> a semi-circular bay. Beyond the addition, {{the room was}} refurnished and redecorated to reflect the Georgian Revival alterations that were occurring on the home's exterior. Elements of Georgian Revival architecture that were incorporated into <b>the</b> Ellwood <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> remodel include, mahogany paneling with dentil molding around the windows and doors, a cornice with Classical details, and brackets. Almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room's</b> 1898 furniture and woodwork was custom made by Tobey & Company of Chicago and each piece is affixed with a dated brass plate. <b>The</b> main <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> table and chairs were cast in an early Georgian style and the table has twelve extra leaves which can extend it [...] <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room's</b> smaller table, situated within the bay addition, was used for Ellwood family breakfasts.|$|R
50|$|In 1908,Isak Glückstadt {{acquired}} the building. He was {{managing director of}} Den Danske Landmandsbank (now Danske Bank). In 1909, he renovated <b>the</b> oldest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> on <b>the</b> second floor and the balcony overlooking Amaliegade date from this renovation. <b>The</b> first expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house from <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century {{was replaced by a}} new wing on Amaliegade in the 1910s.

50|$|From 1887, {{the hotel}} forged a {{link with the}} local annual cricket festival and allowed guests {{attending}} <b>the</b> exclusive use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> connection was extended to the cricket ground in the late 1940s, when staff from the hotel would serve food and drink to the players.|$|R
25|$|The {{students}} did chores {{for two hours}} each day: the boys worked on the farm, in the garden or chopped firewood, while the girls did household duties, assisted with sewing, cooking and washing, and took care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> The students were provided with three meals a day, and were given {{plenty of time to}} sleep and play. Religious study was regularly kept up, and included church on Sunday and praying each morning and evening every day of the week. Every night at dinner, along with singing and praying, every student had to recite a verse, or part of a verse, of Scripture from the Bible.|$|E
25|$|Proposals were {{requested}} of Charles de Wailly and Claude Nicolas Ledoux. In {{spite of}} the negative opinions given by several of her circle, notably Gabriel, Mme du Barry decided to retain the project of Ledoux, then {{at the beginning of}} his career. The design was completed in 1770 and construction was carried out in 1771. The inauguration took place on 2 September 1771 in the presence of the King. A play by Charles Collé was performed, La partie de chasse de Henri IV, and dinner was served with music (the musicians complained about the exiguity of the platforms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> now shut off by mirrors) followed by a display of fireworks.|$|E
25|$|Along the {{southwest}} {{side of the}} peristyle, is the 2nd largest room in the Palace, the cenatio (or Triclinium) or Banqueting Room. Like the Aula Regia, it was extravagantly decorated, with several tiers of columns in exotic marbles and a frieze. It opened onto two courtyards with oval fountains {{to the north and}} south visible from the windows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> The centre of the southern wall of the hall has an apse surrounded by two passages which allow access to the library of the temple of Apollo. The floor of the hall is covered with marble concealing a hypocaust whose bricks date from the reign of Maxentius. This heating system suggests that this hall served as a banqueting hall in the winter and has been identified with the Cenatio Iovis mentioned in ancient literary sources.|$|E
50|$|Historically, upon {{entering}} a Shari's restaurant <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> area was divided by half, with one half {{on either side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entrance.

25|$|In {{the second}} level, the living {{quarters}} consist of 15 rooms divided among sleeping quarters, living room, antesala, dining room, kitchen (with an original 19th century stove), bathroom and studio/library. The layout {{responds to the}} L-shaped arrangement. A massive rectangular volume, divided in three spacious rooms with 15-foot high ceilings, faces west overseeing Paseo Atocha. The bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom and dining room are lined-up along the longitudinal axis, facing north overlooking Calle Castillo. This section of the quarters, the most private section of the house, also faces south, towards the interior courtyard. The entrance to each room in the longitudinal axis is accentuated {{by the use of}} a classical pediment framing each doorway. Each room facing the patio, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> at the eastern end, has a distinguishable feature of a double door system. First a double wooden door with adjustable louvers, crowned with a wooden fixed transom with frosted glass panel. Another solid mahogany double door is added, which covers the entire doorway.|$|E
500|$|Jirat-Wasiutyński {{notes that}} art {{historian}} Denys Sutton {{was the first}} critic to interpret Gauguin's self-portrait as [...] "demonic". This interpretation {{is illustrated by the}} pendant, the companion piece [...] Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan (1889), which visually complements the Self-Portrait. De Haan's devilish eyes and red hair shaped like horns in his portrait on the left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> where it was created in situ, corresponds to the snake held in Gauguin's hand in his self-portrait on the right door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> [...] Two books appear on the table in de Haan's portrait: Paradise Lost (1667–74) by seventeenth-century English poet John Milton, and Sartor Resartus by Thomas Carlyle. [...] These respective literary allusions, to Milton's Satan and to Carlyle's Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, a character described as both angelic and diabolical, play directly into de Haan's and Gauguin's corresponding self-portraits. Jirat-Wasiutyński argues that Gauguin portrays himself as a magus, as [...] "both seer and demonic angel".|$|E
500|$|Some of the servers at the Sci-Fi Dine-In wear roller skates, {{acting as}} carhops, while others improvise {{characters}} {{such as a}} police officer ostensibly in search of people who have sneaked into the theater without paying.

50|$|During {{restoration}} work in 2009 workmen {{uncovered a}} range <b>of</b> relics underneath <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> floorboards. <b>The</b> collection included a child's shoe, clay pipes, and a coin thought to {{date back to}} 1860. Upstairs rooms unveiled old beams which are thought to come from old sailing ships.|$|R
25|$|On {{the first}} floor are located the parlor, <b>the</b> library, two <b>dining</b> <b>rooms,</b> and <b>the</b> kitchen. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> {{is located in the}} western wing, off <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hallway, and was used {{primarily}} used by the family for smaller meals like breakfast or tea. The kitchen is also in the wing, directly adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> other <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> located in <b>the</b> front western side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main house, was used only for formal dinners and as the sitting room where the men would converse after dinner. The fireplace in the room was enclosed in marble when Buchanan bought Wheatland and had a furnace installed. Across the hall, on <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main house is the parlor, where the women guests would congregate after dinner. The library is located off the hallway in the east wing. The woodwork, doors, a bookcase, and a bookshelf built into the wall were grained to resemble oak. The shelves in the bookshelf no longer exist; but, <b>the</b> backboard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bookshelf is visible, as is the plaster wall made to resemble wood. Two mahogany bookcases, flanking the fireplace in the library, were furnished by Jenkins and having been sold to each successive owner by the previous one. The library was primarily used by Buchanan as the place to meet with guests.|$|R
50|$|A hotel of {{this size}} of course had several {{amenities}} and Raymond always set aside profits (or borrowed money) to add something he thought might be important for business. Even though the hotel only opened from December to April (it never opened year round), Raymond kept himself busy over the summer with some sort <b>of</b> improvement. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> was <b>the</b> largest {{room in the house}} able to seat 400 people. Pasadena City, which boasted of being a “dry” town, had an ordinance disallowing <b>the</b> sales <b>of</b> alcohol — except to the hotel guests.|$|R
500|$|A. A. Gill {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Sunday Times after {{the move to}} the Oak Room in late 1997. He summarised his visit by saying that [...] "If {{you are interested in}} the pursuit of excellence, then a table at the Oak Room is {{as high as you can}} go in this country, and close to as high as you can go in the world." [...] He recommended the starters of red mullet soup, the ballotine of salmon, and the chicken oyster served with a celeriac remoulade. He called his main course [...] "utterly simple and completely perfect"; it consisted of roast partridge with choucroute garnie. He called the interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> [...] "soft and thick and luxurious", adding that a painting by Mark Gertler and three bronzes by Rembrandt Bugatti were [...] "worth the entrance fee alone".|$|E
500|$|The {{dining room}} is devoted to Geoffrey Chaucer's The House of Fame {{and the art of}} story-telling, Crook {{explaining}} that [...] "tall stories are part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> rite". The hooded chimneypiece, of Devonshire marble, contained a bronze figure above the fireplace representing the Goddess of Fame; its hands and face were made of ivory, with sapphires for eyes. [...] It was later stolen. The tiles on the walls depict fairy stories, including Reynard the Fox, Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood. The room also shows Burges's innovative use of materials: Handley-Read observed that the Victorians had [...] "a horror of food smells" [...] and therefore the room was constructed using materials that did not absorb odours and could be washed. The walls are covered with Devonshire marble, surmounted by glazed picture tiles, while the ceiling is of sheet metal. The ceiling is divided into coffered compartments by square beams, and features symbols of the Sun, the planets and the signs of the Zodiac. Burges designed most of the cutlery and plate used in this room, which display his skills as a designer of metalwork, including the claret jug and Cat Cup chosen by Lord and Lady Bute as mementos from Burges's collection after his death. The panels of the wine cupboard were decorated by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hospital}} originally contained {{two sets}} of murals, commissioned by the Works Progress Administration in 1938. The first set of murals called [...] "The Circus" [...] were painted by Louis Schanker and located on the four walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> They consisted of eleven panels depicting clowns and other circus characters. The second series of murals, called [...] "Children at Work and Play", were created by Helen West Heller. The 23 panels portray children taking part in games and activities, and include disabled children. Both artists utilized tempera painting.|$|E
25|$|The {{renovation}} {{completed in}} 1896 made four major {{changes to the}} existing building. The house was re-oriented away from its existing veranda, and a new entrance facing campus replaced the existing entrance. On the second floor, a library and guest bedrooms were created, and a third floor was added, containing more guest rooms and the servants' quarters. A large northwest wing was also added to the existing house, located off <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and containing <b>the</b> kitchen, pantry, and storage areas.|$|R
5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{staff from}} <b>the</b> Ludlow {{incarnation}} <b>of</b> Hibiscus agreed {{to move to}} London to continue working at the restaurant, including head chef Marcus McGuinness and sommelier Simon Freeman. Hibiscus re-opened in October 2007 in its new location after following building works and planning delays. <b>The</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> London-based restaurant was decorated in orange and shades <b>of</b> brown. <b>The</b> walls were covered in pale-coloured wooden panels, and a chandelier designed {{as a series of}} globes hungs from <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>dining</b> <b>room's</b> ceiling.|$|R
2500|$|Adrien Hébrard, {{director}} of Le Temps, acquired and modified the château according to <b>the</b> taste <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. It is to him we owe the achievement, by Gaston Virebent and his son, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> whose walls are clad with ceramic panels carrying a blue pattern {{set into the}} wooden paneling, itself highlighted by gilding – and <b>the</b> restructuring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park. However, the restructuring involved ... <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> an admirable park whose trees furnished wood to a sawmill for two years ...|$|R
2500|$|The most {{perceptible}} {{element of}} de Forest's design aesthetic in the Deanery is his stenciling, a technique for which his Indian workshop was known. Geometric designs were stenciled {{on the walls}} or on the ceilings throughout the house, as, for example, on {{the ceiling of the}} Blue Room, as an upper border in the dining room, a mid-height border in the corridor between the studies, and as an upper border and on the ceiling in Mamie Gwinn's study. Even the floors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> were stenciled, as Thomas noted in a letter to de Forest: [...] "You remember it was so with my dining room. In four years the stenciling under the wax which we put on the floors was entirely worn off." [...] Several pieces of furniture were also transformed into [...] "art furniture" [...] by the addition of stenciled designs, possibly as a cost-saving measure, as the 1894–1896 renovations cost over $14,000.|$|E
2500|$|From 1967–69, renovations were undertaken: the {{original}} adobe brick chimney, which was crumbling, was removed; the front doorway was widened; and, in 1968, a dormer was added {{on the north}} side of the structure. Additional remodeling occurred from 1976–78 when additional bedrooms were created by enclosing the screened porch {{on the north side}} of the building, as well as remodeling of the existing bedrooms and bathroom. The rooms upstairs were also remodeled at this time, as well as the switching of the locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and kitchen, which were also updated. A statue of St. Francis, was installed in a small alcove next to the front door in 1980, brought in from the church in Lukachukai. Also in 1980, a mudroom by the rear entrance was also added. [...] A ﬁreplace was added to the south wall of the Friary’s living room on December 1, 1981, with a triple walled chimney pipe.|$|E
2500|$|Weber {{took charge}} of {{ordering}} the materials for the building. While many materials were delivered to the site by horse and wagon from Gallup, New Mexico, the stone for the cellar and foundation were quarried locally. The cellar was partial, existing only below the kitchen and dining area. The cost of construction was approximately $1500. This rectangular adobe building ﬁrst served a dual purpose as a chapel and Friars’ residence. In 1910 or 1911, it became solely a Friars’ Residence, which {{it continues to be}} today. The east side of the friary contained a large room consisting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and kitchen, along with a potbellied stove and chimney, as well as a smaller room which served as a parlor. The north side of the friary contained three bedrooms, as well as a room which contained the stairs to the attic. The south end of the building contained a single large room which was the chapel, which had a second potbellied stove and chimney. The chapel in the friary was only temporary, until a separate permanent structure could be built.|$|E
50|$|Decorative {{detail to}} the interior, {{such as the}} {{classical}} motifs on <b>the</b> cornices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drawing and <b>dining</b> <b>rooms,</b> is simple and classically inspired {{in accordance with the}} Georgian style.

The school slowly expanded, despite one Headmaster who worked his pupils like labourers. The school had enjoyed some financial security for many years, lessened in 1742 when the school sold Sir James Lowther an eight hundred and sixty-seven year mineral lease for much less than market value.|$|R
