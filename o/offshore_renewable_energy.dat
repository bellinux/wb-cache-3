25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War in 1991 {{marked a}} {{reduction}} in the demand for military ships and submarines, and the town continued its decline. The shipyard's dependency on military contracts at the expense of civilian and commercial engineering and shipbuilding meant it was particularly hard hit as government defence spending was reduced dramatically. As a result, the workforce shrank from 14,500 in 1990 to 5,800 in February 1995, with overall unemployment in the town rising over that period from 4.6% to 10%. The rejection by the VSEL management of detailed plans for Barrow's industrial renewal in the mid-to-late 1980s remains controversial. This has led to renewed academic attention in recent years to the possibilities of converting military-industrial production in declining shipbuilding areas to the <b>offshore</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> sector.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{an examination of}} the main international, regional and national legal regimes regulating marine <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> in England and Wales. Deriving from a complex patchwork of law and policy, developments have ensued {{in the absence of a}} distinct governing ‘legal regime’ and within a number of competing paradigms. This original synthesis attempts to identify lacunae, conflicts and connections within and between the span of legal genres that MRE evokes. Against a backdrop of climate change mitigation, the key findings show that despite the presence of political will for <b>offshore</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energies,</b> MRE development faces a number of legal obstacles, all of which seek to protect other important public and private interests. Although predominantly satisfactory at the international level (international law of the sea), national private property rights, environmental protection laws and regulatory development controls each encompass particular legal incongruities that have the potential to act as barricades to development. This thesis discusses these issues and reaches conclusions as to potential areas for reform. South West Regional Development Agency (studentship...|$|R

40|$|The Flying Wing Anchor (patent pending) {{is a new}} anchor {{concept that}} stabilizes <b>offshore</b> {{foundations}} for <b>renewable</b> <b>energy.</b> The anchor, with a wing-like shape, uses its weight to penetrate into the seabed by free-fall and mobilizes its full capacity by using the in-service load, {{so it is a}} new concept to optimize the sustainability of <b>offshore</b> foundations for <b>renewable</b> <b>energy.</b> A major challenge is to understand the trajectory of the anchor during loading because the anchor capacity depends on the final embedment depth and orientation. The objective {{of this study is to}} experimentally investigate the anchor behavior under pure static loading conditions that ultimately could be used to assess the anchor trajectory through an analytical model. Physical model tests were performed on the Flying Wing Anchor for four modes of pure loading: in-plane shear vertical, normal vertical, rotation and in-plane horizontal. The results were used to calculate dimensionless breakout factors for each failure mode. The breakout factors ranged from 2 to 18 depending on the pure loading mode for embedment ratios between 1 and 4. ...|$|R

30|$|Within {{the boom}} and bust scenario, {{prospects}} {{are expected to be}} considerably less favourable—due above all to a short-term horizon of all actors, more risk-averseness, a low level of environmental awareness and restricted public and private investment budgets. Fluctuating transport volumes result in obsolete fleets and port facilities. Extraction of oil and gas from the deep seas continues, though without the necessary investments, because commodity price fluctuations add to uncertainty. Coastal tourism and cruise tourism will be relatively stable, with a focus on northern Europe due to climate change effects. Only limited investments are expected in developing new technologies, with dimmed prospects for <b>offshore</b> wind, ocean <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> and blue biotechnology as a consequence.

40|$|In {{the area}} of <b>offshore</b> <b>renewable,</b> wave <b>energy</b> can give great contribution. There has been {{research}} for developing wave energy converters since {{the late eighteenth century}} when the first patent was applied for in 1799 [1], without any remarkable breakthrough. This master thesis will discuss the topic of wave energy conversion by a point absorber in heave with a directly coupled induction machine power take off. A wave to wire approach has been attempted in this thesis. The tool needed is a hydrodynamic model combined with a full model of an electrical generator. The tool is developed to investigate challenges for wave energy conversion by direct coupled induction machine as power take off. Simulations have been carried out in the time domain to study the motion of a point absorber in heave for energy extraction. Previous research in wind power technology show that the grid side converter will handle the voltage fluctuations; which is affected by the power fluctuations [2]. The wave power phenomena is more challenging, fluctuations occur for both long and short time scale. Spacing the platforms in accordance to the wave climate is shown to be a proper manner of approaching the power smoothing issue before entering the point of common coupling in the electric network. Results show that effort should be put into research for control strategies and generator control, bearing in mind that the rating of the converter and generator is directly affected by the torque demands. The choice of control strategy, point absorber, and generator should therefore be taken simultaneously, on the basis off economical aspects. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Offshore</b> marine <b>renewables</b> <b>energy</b> {{developments}} (MREDs), {{particularly in}} the light of extensive offshore wind farm development in shallow shelf seas, are expected to affect the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. Several activities linked to the installation and operation of MREDs each have their differential impacts onto the ecosystem. The benthos plays key roles in the ecosystem, supporting numerous ecosystem goods and services such as long-term carbon storage and food resources for higher trophic groups (e. g. fish, birds, mammals and including humans). Development of MREDs will initiate processes which are expected to affect benthic assemblages over various, currently unknown, spatial and temporal scales. This work provides a structured overview of ecological cause-effect relationships related to MREDs, based on a set of hypothesis-driven pathways supported by literature (> 230 publications reviewed). Furthermore, this work evaluated the sensitivity of benthic causeeffect relationships to potential effects of MREDs on different spatial and temporal scales and weighted the assessment by confidence in existing knowledge and the consistency of effects among habitats. The outcomes allowed identification of knowledge gaps about ecological processes, in order to prioritize the ‘known-unknowns’ and highlight priority research areas. Our results suggest that the sensitivity of the benthos to MREDs is much higher than previously indicated, particularly where cascading effects lead to changes in ecological functioning. Filling existing knowledge gaps and understanding ecological processes and patterns occurring at low-trophic levels, including those within the benthos, are essential to maintain ecological integrity key to the ecosystem and to society even under MREDs developments...|$|R
