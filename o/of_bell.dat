5|$|The presidential {{election}} of 1860 showed Kentucky's mixed sentiments {{when the state}} gave John Bell 45% of the popular vote, John C. Breckinridge 36%, Stephen Douglas 18%, and Abraham Lincoln less than 1%. Historian Allan Nevins interpreted the election results to mean that Kentuckians strongly opposed both secession and coercion against the secessionists.

5|$|As {{a member}} of the Joint Research and Development Committee with Spaatz, Devers took an {{interest}} in the development of helicopters, taking rides in different machines. He met with Larry Bell, the founder <b>of</b> <b>Bell</b> Aircraft. Bell's company was in a poor financial situation, and he was hoping that the Army would buy fifty of his new Bell 47 helicopters. Devers was impressed with the aircraft, and agreed to do so, although for $25,000 each rather than the $35,000 Bell was asking for, and found the money from Army Ground Forces funds. The Bell H-13 Sioux would go on {{to become one of the}} world's most recognizable helicopters.|$|E
5|$|During 1943, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{received}} 399 Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk fighter aircraft. Their arrival {{allowed the}} service to expand its combat force by forming five new Kittyhawk-equipped squadrons to join the three squadrons that had operated the type in the South West Pacific area since 1942. No.82 Squadron was formed at Bankstown, New South Wales, on 18June 1943. It was the third of the new Kittyhawk squadrons to be established, following No.84 Squadron in February and No.86 Squadron in March; No.78 Squadron was formed in July and No.80 Squadron in September. Commanded by Squadron Leader Stanley Galton, No.82 Squadron's original complement was 279, including fifteen officers. It {{was to have been}} equipped wholly with P-40M Kittyhawks but initially included a flight <b>of</b> <b>Bell</b> P-39 Airacobras. No.82 Squadron conducted training at Bankstown until April 1944, when personnel briefly moved to Hughes Airfield in the Northern Territory, before being redeployed to Townsville, Queensland, for further training.|$|E

50|$|By ringing a bell {{in a full}} circle, it {{was found}} in the early 17th century that the speed <b>of</b> the <b>bell</b> could be easily altered and the {{interval}} between successive soundings (strikes) <b>of</b> the <b>bell</b> could be accurately controlled. A set <b>of</b> <b>bells</b> rung in this manner can be made to strike in different sequences. This ability to control the speed <b>of</b> <b>bells</b> soon {{led to the development of}} change ringing where the striking sequence <b>of</b> the <b>bells</b> is changed to give variety and musicality to the sound.|$|R
50|$|Instruments {{regularly}} {{used both}} as pitched and as unpitched percussion include many types <b>of</b> <b>bells.</b> Lincoln Cathedral, for example, has three bell towers, two containing bells used as unpitched including a chiming clock, {{and the third}} containing a pitched ring <b>of</b> <b>bells.</b>|$|R
5|$|From the Octagon, Princes Street {{initially}} rises as {{it passes}} through a commercial district formerly {{commonly known as the}} Top 100, crossing the outer Octagon of Moray Place before descending through the original cutting <b>of</b> <b>Bell</b> Hill towards the Exchange. The Top 100 theoretically takes its name from the 100 retail businesses which line Princes Street from the Octagon to the Exchange, although the actual number of businesses is not one hundred. This part of the city is sometimes seen as the creative heart of Dunedin, with numerous art galleries, video production companies, and the city's professional theatre (the Fortune Theatre) all being based in the area from Moray Place to Rattray Street.|$|E

Nick is shot and Sally stays with him; she produces a suicidal fireball that torches both her and Nick to ashes and severely burns the Other Side Fringe Division's principal investigator Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel).

Olivia follows her alternate counterpart and encounters Bell, who insists he did not betray their location to the Fringe Division and tells her that Walter is in trouble. Walternate is seen in the room housing the doomsday device Peter will be a part of, and leaves with its final component.|$|E
40|$|The logical {{foundations}} <b>of</b> <b>Bell's</b> inequality are reexamined. We {{argue that}} {{the form of the}} reality condition that underpins Bell's inequality comes from the requirement of solving the quantum measurement problem. Hence any violation <b>of</b> <b>Bell's</b> inequality necessarily implies nonlocality because of the measurement problem. The differences in the implications of deterministic and stochastic formulations <b>of</b> <b>Bell's</b> inequality are highlighted. The reality condition used in Bell's inequality is shown to be a generalisation of Einstein's later form of realism. Comment: 15 page...|$|R

We prove that the locality condition is irrelevant to Bell in equality.

5|$|Princes Street was {{developed}} during Dunedin's 1860s boom from the Central Otago gold rush, and consequently {{is one of}} New Zealand's most historic streets, with about 70 buildings in close proximity listed on the New Zealand Historic Places Trust Register.

In the years following the gold rush, Princes Street was the heart of Dunedin's central business district, but much of the city's main retail area has now shifted north to George Street.|$|E

Somerset Maugham; Lucy Crown, an adaptation of the novel by Irwin Shaw; and Motive. In 1978, while touring England and Ireland in productions of Motive, Baker met stage actor Donald Burton, who became her third husband. She also appeared in American stage productions of Georges Feydeau's 13 Rue de l'Amour, Forty Carats, and Goodbye Charlie.|$|E
5|$|The Bilbie family <b>of</b> <b>bell</b> founders and clockmakers {{lived and}} worked in Chew Stoke for more than 200 years, from the late 17th century until the 19th century. They {{produced}} more than 1,350 church bells, which were hung in churches all over the West Country. Their oldest surviving bell, cast in 1698, is still giving good service in the local St Andrew's Church. The earliest Bilbie clocks date from 1724 and are highly prized. They are mostly longcase clocks, the cheapest with 30-hour movements in modest oak cases, but some have high quality eight-day movements with additional features, such as showing the high tide at Bristol docks. These latter clocks were fitted into quality cabinet maker cases and command high prices.|$|E

5|$|Two local founders, John Pass and John Stow, {{offered to}} recast the bell. Though they were inexperienced in bell casting, Pass had headed the Mount Holly Iron Foundry in {{neighboring}} New Jersey and came from Malta, {{which had a}} tradition <b>of</b> <b>bell</b> casting. Stow, on the other hand, was only four years out of his apprenticeship as a brass founder. At Stow's foundry on Second Street, the bell was broken into small pieces, melted down, and cast into a new bell. The two founders decided that the metal was too brittle, and augmented the bell metal by about ten percent, using copper. The bell was ready in March 1753, and Norris reported that the lettering (which included the founders' names and the year) was even clearer on the new bell than on the old.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{generally}} {{performed well}} {{at the end of}} the medieval period, helped by buoyant demand for manufactured and luxury goods. Cornish tin production plunged during the Black Death itself, leading to a doubling of prices. Tin exports also collapsed catastrophically, but picked up again over the next few years. By the turn of the 16th century, the available alluvial tin deposits in Cornwall and Devon had begun to decline, leading to the commencement <b>of</b> <b>bell</b> and surface mining to support the tin boom that had occurred in the late 15th century. Lead mining increased, and output almost doubled between 1300 and 1500. Wood and charcoal became cheaper once again after the Black Death, and coal production declined as a result, remaining depressed for the rest of the period – nonetheless, some coal production was occurring in all the major English coalfields by the 16th century. Iron production continued to increase; the Weald in the South-East began to make increased use of water-power, and overtook the Forest of Dean in the 15th century as England's main iron-producing region. The first blast furnace in England, a major technical step forward in metal smelting, was created in 1496 in Newbridge in the Weald.|$|E
