5|$|Evolutionary {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the origin and descent of species, and their change over time. It employs scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines, for example, those with special training in particular organisms such as mammalogy, <b>ornithology,</b> botany, or herpetology, but are of use in answering more general questions about evolution.|$|E

5|$|It {{was one of}} the texts, {{along with}} Thomas Bewick's {{contemporaneous}} A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804) that made <b>ornithology</b> popular in Britain, and, with the 1676 Ornithologia libri tres of Francis Willughby and John Ray, helped to make it the object of serious study. The book includes a description of the cirl bunting, discovered by Montagu in 1800 near his home in Kingsbridge, Devon.|$|E
5|$|Pennant {{received}} his early education at Wrexham Grammar School, {{before moving to}} Thomas Croft's school in Fulham in 1740. At the age of twelve, Pennant later recalled, he had been inspired {{with a passion for}} natural history through being presented with Francis Willughby's <b>Ornithology.</b> In 1744 he entered Queen's College, Oxford, later moving to Oriel College. Like many students from a wealthy background, he left Oxford without taking a degree, although in 1771 his work as a zoologist was recognised with an honorary degree.|$|E
5|$|The Ornithological Dictionary is George Montagu's best-known work, and the {{one that}} {{established}} his reputation as a pioneer of British <b>ornithology.</b> He compiled the book at his home Knowle House, near Kingsbridge in Devon. It was published soon after the first volume of Thomas Bewick's illustrated handbook, A History of British Birds, which appeared in 1797. It does not describe what is now called Montagu's harrier, which he separated from the hen harrier in 1803, after the publication of the book.|$|E

5|$|The playhouse was rebuilt {{with help}} from the people of Shawnee on Delaware, the Seabees, the Hughes Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, The National Trust, a Community Development Block Grant, and others. Charles Campbell Worthington also {{established}} the Worthington Society, a society dedicated to <b>ornithology</b> which was directed by Charles W. Miller. The society caught over 300 pigeons on the grounds in less than three months.|$|E
5|$|William Yarrell's A History of British Birds {{was first}} {{published}} as a whole in three volumes in 1843, having been serialized, three sheets every two months, over the previous six years. It is not a history of <b>ornithology</b> but a natural history, a handbook or field guide systematically describing every species of bird known to occur in Britain. A separate article of about six pages, containing an image, a description, and an account of worldwide distribution, together with reports of behaviour, is provided for each species.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Thomas {{developed}} {{an interest in}} archaeology, entomology, and <b>ornithology,</b> as well as drawing. In 1913 his family made plans for him to join the Royal Navy, although he failed the entrance exam due to alleged poor eyesight. At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, Lethbridge was sent to Wellington College in Berkshire, while his mother and siblings moved to Buckhurst in Wokingham, Berkshire. In February 1919 Violet and her children moved to Manor House in Finchampstead, where Jacintha and Bill became seriously ill {{as a result of a}} flu pandemic; the former survived but Bill died in March.|$|E

He was the founder chairman of the Mersey Estuary Conservation Group and Research Committee of the Liverpool Bay Wader Study Group.|$|R
5|$|Beebe {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Brazil in 1915, {{for the purpose of}} capturing more birds for the zoo. This expedition was an important turning point for Beebe in several ways. Beebe had far more field experience than either of the two others accompanying him on the expedition, G. Inness Hartler and Herbert Atkins, making this his introduction to the role of a mentor. During this expedition, Beebe was also amazed to discover the number and variety of organisms living under a single tree, and pioneered the method of studying a small area of wilderness for an extended amount of time. This expedition marked the beginning of a shift for Beebe from <b>ornithology</b> to the study of tropical ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|In November 1897, Frank Chapman {{sponsored}} Beebe {{to become}} an associate member of the American Ornithologists' Union, and the following month Beebe gave his first professional lecture on <b>ornithology</b> to a society called Uncle Clarence's Bergen Point Culture Club. In 1899, although he had completed all of the required courses for a degree in science from Columbia except for mathematics, he decided to forgo his studies {{in favor of an}} invitation from Osborn to work at the New York Zoological Park which was about to open. Several factors contributed to this decision, including both excitement at being part of the zoo, and the sense that his studies were putting too much of a strain on his family's finances.|$|E
5|$|Michelson {{was born}} in 1951 in Washington D.C., the only son of Carroll and Evelyn Michelson, and is related to Christian Michelsen, the first Prime Minister of Norway. Michelson {{attended}} the Burgundy Farm Country Day School during the sixth through eighth grades where he developed an appreciation for botany and <b>ornithology.</b> While at Fort Hunt High School he was President of the Fort Hunt Amateur Rocket Club which built large (2m x 5cm) instrumented solid fuel rockets that were launched at the Camp Pickett artillery range in Blackstone, Virginia.|$|E
50|$|Poteat has {{published}} two books of poems, <b>Ornithologies</b> (Anhinga Poetry Prize, 2006) and Illustrating the Machine that Makes the World (University of Georgia Press/Virginia Quarterly Review, 2009), {{as well as}} a chapbook, Meditations (Poetry Society of America National Chapbook Award, 2004). He has won prizes and fellowships from bodies including The Literary Review, Bellingham Review, The Millay Colony, Virginia Commission for the Arts and Virginia Center for Creative Arts. He was named the 2011-2012 Donaldson Writer in Residence at The College of William & Mary.|$|R
25|$|Falcons {{can live}} into their mid-teens, with larger hawks living longer and eagles {{likely to see}} out middle-aged owners. Through the captive {{breeding}} of rescued birds, the last 30 years have seen a great rebirth of the sport, {{with a host of}} innovations; falconry's popularity, through lure flying displays at country houses and game fairs, has probably never been higher in the past 300 years. Ornithologist Tim Gallagher, editor of the Cornell Lab of <b>Ornithology's</b> Living Bird magazine, documented his experiences with modern falconry in a 2008 book, Falcon Fever.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007 the Avenue Washlands Nature Reserve near Chesterfield {{was opened}} and won {{first place in}} the Conservation {{category}} for Restoration Sites in the British Trust for <b>Ornithology’s</b> Business Bird Challenge. In the same year, a Lottery grant allowed the trust to extend its educational programme with Grounds for a Change, transforming Derbyshire school grounds into wildlife havens and outdoor learning spaces. It also took over management of Drakelow Nature Reserve in the south of the county, an important wetland site playing host to over 200 species of birds.|$|R

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a diurnal feeder. According to the Cornell Lab of <b>Ornithology,</b> {{the species}} {{is one of the}} strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. Its diet consists of the seeds {{from a wide variety of}} annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, teasel, dandelion, ragweed, mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E
5|$|Coimbatore {{is a major}} {{educational}} hub. The first {{college of}} Coimbatore, Government Arts College, was opened in 1875. The first engineering college in the city, the Arthur Hope College of Technology (now known as the Government College of Technology, Coimbatore), was started by G.D. Naidu in 1945 followed later by private engineering colleges PSG College of Technology and Coimbatore Institute of Technology in the 1950s. The Air Force Administrative College, established in 1949, is the oldest training institute of the Indian Air Force. Coimbatore Medical College was opened in 1966 and also city has another Government run ESIC Medical College. The Government law college started functioning from 1978. The agricultural school established in 1868 was converted into a full-fledged agricultural university Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in 1971 and the Sálim Ali Centre for <b>Ornithology</b> and Natural History was opened in 1990.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} first record of presumed {{twinning}} in eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) {{and provide a}} review of previously reported twinning events in wild birds. A nest containing twin eastern bluebird nestlings was monitored in 2013 in central Pennsylvania and reported to the Cornell Lab of <b>Ornithology’s</b> NestWatch program, a national program where volunteers submit data on wild nesting birds. A presumed double-yolked egg of a free-living eastern bluebird pair hatched successfully, and twin nestlings lived for 11 days in a nest box shared by three siblings. Due to the rarity of twinning in wild birds, engaging the public to monitor large numbers of nests {{is the most likely}} approach to documenting twinning in wild populations, and citizen science provides the infrastructure for individuals to share observations...|$|R
25|$|Sora nest {{success rates}} vary across {{locations}} and years. In the literature addressing sora apparent nest success, {{the proportions of}} successful nests varied from 0.61 in Michigan to 0.833 in Minnesota. In western New York, the nest success rate of 6 sora nests was 0.43, and the daily nest success rate was 0.97. Using data from the Cornell Laboratory of <b>Ornithology's</b> nest record program, nesting success rate of soras in North America was estimated as 0.529 over a 28-day period (n=108). On a site in Alberta, 80.6% of eggs successfully hatched, while the following year only 59.6% of eggs hatched. The authors conclude that diminished water level interacting with predators and trampling by cattle resulted in decreased hatching success. During late summer, soras are flightless for a period during their post-nuptial molt.|$|R
40|$|Data {{from the}} British Trust for <b>Ornithology’s</b> Constant Effort Scheme, an an-nual bird-ringing {{programme}} in which catch effort is standardised, are routinely used to index abundance, productivity and adult survival. Efficient {{models have been}} developed for each. Such a monitoring scheme, based on ringing across a number of sites, is perhaps unique in providing this combination of demographic information and makes the data particularly amenable to an integrated approach to population modelling. We develop a Bayesian approach and a deterministic pop-ulation model uniting abundance, productivity and survival. The method is applied to Constant Effort Site data for Sedge Warblers Acrocephalus schoenobaenus. The possibility of “transient ” birds needs to be incorporated within the model and we demonstrate how the current methodology can be efficiently extended to use dat...|$|R
