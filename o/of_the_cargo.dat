40|$|<b>The</b> {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> {{demand is}} based on <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> a system engineering technique which includes 12 conditional factors. Firstly the intercontinental trade, <b>the</b> latest development <b>of</b> logistics and <b>the</b> influences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> changes in prices and <b>the</b> supply <b>of</b> air <b>cargo</b> transport are explained in detail. During the next step <b>the</b> reciprocal influence <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors is discussed separately and formally interpreted. As a result a formal method to estimate the volume and <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> demand is developed. <b>The</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rudiments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> supply includes an explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principal settings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market. Apart from <b>the</b> segmentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supply into three different levels of quality, an approach to assess <b>the</b> individual features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> supply is proposed. Following this <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> volume <b>of</b> all European airports is systematically analysed. First <b>the</b> belly volume <b>of</b> passenger aircraft is observed, distinguishing the intercontinental and the continental volume. Moreover <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> transport on board of all-cargo aircraft counted at European airports is analysed. From this a formal model to explain <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> volume <b>of</b> an individual airport is evolved. This {{is based on}} <b>the</b> premise <b>of</b> widely liberal terms <b>of</b> competition within <b>the</b> air cargo-market and {{takes into account the}} Western European conditions. <b>The</b> air <b>cargo</b> supply is modelled analogous to <b>the</b> basic conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision making process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> industry. <b>The</b> suitability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model for forecating is derived from ist application at the Munich airport. For the first time it is possible to consider <b>the</b> full variety <b>of</b> all conditional factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> volume systematically. It can thus be concluded that <b>the</b> supply <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> industry finally determines the volume and <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> <b>of</b> an airport.

5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station at the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> module.|$|E

5|$|After the British {{settlement}} at Sydney Cove {{was established}} in 1788, {{a significant part of}} the Chinese porcelain shipped to Australia came via British traders living in India. Operating under licences issued by the British East India Company, who held a commercial monopoly in the Far East, this trade was known as the 'Country Trade', the Indian ships were called 'Country Ships' and their captains 'Country Captains'. Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> of ships wrecked during the early colonisation of Australia show that the Country Trade played an important role in getting supplies, including Chinese porcelain traded via India often in Indian-built vessels, to the early Australian colonies.|$|E
5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> {{and the top of}} the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E

For {{over a decade}} though, <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> carriers' market share has been growing at lower rates than <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> market itself. Despite these difficulties and IATA's efforts to simplify air cargo processes by introducing electronic documentation, most shipments are still accompanied by printed documents - up to 30 and more per shipment. It is <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research to analyse <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system, which lead to the challenges <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> industry is currently faced with. It is analysed, which role <b>the</b> various players <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system and its environment play and who is driving developments in <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> industry. Furthermore it is reflected, to what extent ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), namely electronic documentation for air <b>cargo,</b> impact <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system’s dynamics and whether they can contribute to strengthen <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> industry again. Based on a historic review <b>the</b> main players <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system are identified and <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> their role is described in a first step. Applying a systems theoretic approach <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system are reflected. This analysis reveals that, whilst there is information available regarding <b>the</b> structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system's environment, very little is known regarding the structures within <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system itself and between its players: the freight forwarders, <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> carriers and <b>the</b> handling agents. In order to close this research gap, in a second empirical step, structured expert interviews with key players <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire air <b>cargo</b> system (freight forwarders, handling agents, air {{cargo carriers}}, shippers and consignees, IT providers, IATA, customs) were held. Based on these interviews dynamics within <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system are reflected and <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> electronic documentation on these structures is analysed. The research shows that <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> ICT and particularly electronic documentation are a necessary, but not sufficient step for rendering air cargo profitable again. Instead, {{it is essential for}} the players within <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> system to redefine their own role as well as their mode of cooperation and communication...|$|R
5|$|On most crude-oil tankers, {{a special}} crude oil washing (COW) system {{is part of}} the {{cleaning}} process. The COW system circulates part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> through the fixed tank-cleaning system to remove wax and asphaltic deposits. Tanks that carry less viscous cargoes are washed with water. Fixed and portable automated tank cleaning machines, which clean tanks with high-pressure water jets, are widely used. Some systems use rotating high-pressure water jets to spray hot water on all the internal surfaces of the tank. As the spraying takes place, the liquid is pumped out of the tank.|$|E

The re-entry module itself would have been enlarged to accommodate the larger crew, and the modifications made to the spacecraft for the MOL program would have been incorporated, including the hatch in the heat shield, which would have been used to provide access to the cargo module. In the event of a launch failure, the launch escape system developed for the Apollo spacecraft would have been used to propel the re-entry module clear of the rocket.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, {{the design}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> holds led to {{considerable}} difficulty for the ground crew, especially baggage handlers at the airports. The cargo hold had its doors located directly underneath the aircraft, so each item of baggage or cargo {{had to be}} loaded vertically upwards {{from the top of}} the baggage truck, then slid along the hold floor to be stacked inside. The individual pieces of luggage and cargo also had to be retrieved in a similarly slow manner at the arriving airport.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a molecular transport system in molecular communication {{that uses the}} machinery in living cells.
