Despite Johnson's active support for the bill, it failed to pass. In 1892 he wrote an article which was published in the Perkins Institute for the Blind publication The Mentor, [...] "Keep the Schools Out of Politics", decrying the appointment <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>administrators,</b> educators and trustees on the institute's Board of Regents based on affiliation with the West Virginia Democratic Party instead of qualifications.|$|E
