40|$|In {{this paper}} {{influence}} of behavioral factors (overconfidence and risk aversion) on financial decision making of economic subjects is analyzed. For this purpose {{two kinds of}} experiments were conducted: asset market and risk aversion experiments. In conducted asset market sessions subjects, based on their pre-experimental overconfidence scores, were assigned to two types of markets: the least <b>overconfident</b> <b>ones</b> formed five “rational” markets and the most <b>overconfident</b> <b>ones</b> formed five “overconfident” markets. Data collected from ten experimental sessions revealed that individual performance and trade activity were overconfidence dependent. Even small variations in miscalibration among players of the same “type”, comprising each of the asset markets, were sufficient to cause this effect. In {{the second part of}} experiment, post hoc assessment of risk aversion was implemented in a sample of former participants of the asset market experiment (32 persons). The presented evidence suggests that risk aversion was not among the factors that had influence on individual engagement in trade activity or performance. It was concluded that in the sample, for which risk aversion measurements were obtained, experimental market outcomes were overconfidence and not risk aversion driven. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{individual}} payoff effects of overconfident self-perception in teams. In particular, we {{demonstrate that the}} welfare of an overconfident agent in a team of one rational and <b>one</b> <b>overconfident</b> agent or a team of two overconfident agents can be {{higher than that of}} the members of a team of two rational agents. This result holds irrespective of the assumption about the agents' awareness of their colleague's bias. Moreover, we show that an overcondent agent is always better of when he is unaware of a potential bias of his colleague. ...|$|R
40|$|Smoothing {{approaches}} to the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem in robotics are superior to the more common filtering approaches in being exact, better {{equipped to deal with}} non-linearities, and computing the entire robot trajectory. However, while filtering algorithms that perform map updates in constant time exist, no analogous smoothing method is available. We aim to rectify this situation by presenting a smoothingbased solution to SLAM using Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) that can perform the trajectory and map updates in constant time except when a loop is closed in the environment. The SLAM problem is represented as a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) over which LBP is performed. We prove that LBP, in this case, is equivalent to Gauss-Seidel relaxation of a linear system. The inability to compute marginal covariances efficiently in a smoothing algorithm has previously been a stumbling block to their widespread use. LBP enables the efficient recovery of the marginal covariances, albeit approximately, of landmarks and poses. While the final covariances are <b>overconfident,</b> the <b>ones</b> obtained from a spanning tree of the GMRF are conservative, making them useful for data association. Experiments in simulation and using real data are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. This study {{examines}} {{the prevalence of}} overconfidence in the perceived risk of committing crime and whether such overconfidence is related to criminal behavior. Methods. Two samples were used-a sample {{of high school students}} who committed minor offenses and a sample of serious juvenile offenders most with felony arrests. Overconfidence in risk was estimated as the difference between the perceived risk of arrest for one's self and for a generalized other. The proportion of over- and underconfident persons were estimated in both samples, while pooled and random effects logit models were used to estimate the effect of risk on both self-reported offending and arrest within the sample of serious offenders. Results. A large proportion of youth were found to be overconfident with respect to their perceived risk, with a higher prevalence in the conventional high school sample. Within the sample of serious juvenile offenders, being <b>overconfident</b> about <b>one's</b> own risk was found to be related to both self-reported offending and arrest, net of a base rate measure of others' risk. Conclusions. We outline a theory of the relationship between overconfidence and crime that links overconfidence with a self-attribution bias and biased updating of perceived risk with new information.

40|$|In {{explaining}} {{the prevalence of}} the <b>overconfident</b> belief that <b>one</b> is better than others, prior work {{has focused on the}} motive to maintain high self-esteem, abetted by biases in attention, memory, and cognition. An additional possibility is that overconfidence enhances the person’s social status. We tested this status-enhancing account of overconfidence in six studies. Studies 1 through 3 found overconfidence leads to higher social status in both short and longer-term groups, using naturalistic and experimental designs. Study 4 applied a Brunswikian (1956) lens analysis and found that overconfidence leads to a behavioral signature that makes the individual appear competent to others. Studies 5 and 6 measured and experimentally manipulated the desire for status and found that the status motive promotes overconfidence. Together, these studies suggest that people might so often believe they are better than others because it helps them achieve higher social status...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Lingaraju makes a heavy {{contract}} {{deal with}} few business people, {{who want to}} construct a factory in the village which is hazardous to the people. Simultaneously, it’s time for elections in the town. Lingaraju is <b>overconfident</b> that no <b>one</b> comes as his opposition. But Seenu decides {{to stand in the}} election and become president of the village so that he could reach superior position than Seeta and he could marry her. In the beginning no one comes for his support because he is an irresponsible lout of the village, but with Seeta’s inspiration he succeeds in achieving villagers following and affection by doing all good deeds which Lingaraju cannot do these long years. After seeing Seenu’s following, Lingaraju gets hesitated, {{at the same time he}} comes to known his son Rajesh (Ravi Varma) is loving Seeta. So he makes a plan and arranges his son's engagement with Seeta, to demoralize Seenu. Even then Seenu challenges on Lingaraju that he would defeat him. The remaining story is how Seenu achieves his both objectives.|$|R
40|$|People unconsciously exhibit overconfident {{behaviour}} in {{the capital}} market. Previous empirical research demonstrates {{that there is no}} conclusive result whether male or female investors tend to be more overconfident. The purpose of this research is to investigate whether male investors tend to be more <b>overconfident</b> than female <b>ones</b> in an emerging capital market such as in Indonesian capital market. According to this experimental research design, all participants are classified into two groups based on their score of overconfidence, namely less informed investors, and more informed investors. This research employs three different types of treatments, but only two treatments will be analysed consisting of the state of no available market information, and the provision of good news. The result demonstrates that male and female investors perform the same level of overconfidence when there is no available market information. Male and female investors are more likely to perform higher mean of prediction errors when they are classified as less informed investors. Referring to both the more and the less informed investors, female investors tend to be more overconfident than male investors when the market provides a signal of good news. gender; overconfidence; price errors; prediction errors; trading activity; probability; overconfident behaviour; unconscious behaviour; capital markets; male investors; female investors; emerging markets; Indonesia; less informed investors; more informed investors; available information; market information; news provision; good news; investments; entrepreneurs; entrepreneurialism; management. ...|$|R
