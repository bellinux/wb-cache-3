5|$|For {{short-range}} missile (throwing) weapons, a Roman infantryman {{would probably}} had either a long throwing-spear <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> short javelins (lanceae) {{and half a}} dozen plumbatae (weighted darts) with an effective range of about 30m. Ammianus talks of a variety of missiles being thrown by the Alamanni in the battle: spicula (a kind of long pilum-type javelin, also known as an angon), verruta missilia (short throwing-spears) and ferratae arundines (probably darts and franciscas: throwing-axes). Overall, there appears little difference in the throwing-missile capability of the contenders. Ammianus indicates that the Roman infantry ranks were obliged to hold their shields above their heads for much of the time due to the volume of missiles raining down on them.|$|E

25|$|This is {{something}} that a Muslim gynecologist can tell you {{if you need to}} or not… There used to be a lady who used to do this for women, or, I mean, young girls. She is expected to cut only the tip of the sexual sensitive part in the girl, so that she is not hypersexually active. This is the purpose... you see in societies where circumcision of girls is completely prohibited, hypersexuality takes over the entire society, and a woman is not satisfied with one person, <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> <b>or</b> <b>three.</b> This, God forbid, is now happening even in Muslim societies where they prohibit circumcision. They use a mistake in practice to prohibit the tradition, and they end up causing a lot of damage on the extreme side of the sexual life of the woman.|$|E

25|$|Andes {{made her}} final three cruises {{in the first}} half of 1971. All were winter cruises in the Atlantic: the first to South and West Africa, the second to Rio de Janeiro and the third to the Caribbean. Passengers could take either one cruise <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> of them in succession. But Andes was {{becoming}} unreliable. On the first cruise she twice suffered boiler trouble. When in Cape Town she stayed on for boiler repairs, after which she was three days late. On the second cruise the drive shaft for the forced-draught fan to Andes central boiler sheared, and as she left Rio de Janeiro her steering gear failed. On the third cruise, in the Caribbean, Andes had both boiler and engine trouble and ended up a day late.|$|E

It reached number 14 the following week with 201,000 downloads. After its official premiere as the second single from Bangerz, the track peaked at {{number one in the}} United States in its fourth week, heavily assisted by online streaming credits from its recently released music video; this gave Cyrus her first number-one single in the country. It sold 477,000 copies that week, becoming the third-highest single sales week of 2013, behind the 582,000 units moved by [...] "I Knew You Were Trouble" [...] by Taylor Swift and the 557,000 units moved by [...] "Roar" [...] by Katy Perry.

2500|$|One of {{the appeals}} of the Almanack {{was that it}} {{contained}} various [...] "news stories" [...] in serial format, so that readers would purchase it year after year {{to find out what}} happened to the protagonists. One of the earliest of these was the [...] "prediction" [...] that the author's [...] "good Friend and Fellow-Student, Mr. Titan Leeds" [...] would die on October 17 of that year, followed by the rebuttal of Mr. Leeds himself that he would die, not on the 17th, but on October 26. Appealing to his readers, Franklin urged them to purchase the next year <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> or four editions to show their support for his prediction. The following year, Franklin expressed his regret that he was too ill to learn whether he or Leeds was correct. Nevertheless, the ruse had its desired effect: people purchased the Almanack to find out who was correct. (Later editions of the Almanack would claim that Leeds had died and that the person claiming to be Leeds was an impostor; Leeds, in fact, died in 1738, which prompted Franklin to applaud the supposed impostor for ending his ruse.) ...|$|E
