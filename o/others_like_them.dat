5|$|Since the 1980s, several parties, {{including}} the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the British Heart Foundation, the City of New York, and the Spanish government, {{have argued that}} Burger King has contributed to obesity and unhealthy eating behaviors in Western nations by producing products that contain large amounts of salt, fat, trans-fat and calories. After its purchase by TPG Capital from former parent company Diageo in 2002, the company introduced several large, over-sized products including its European BK XXL line, the British Angus burger six-pack, the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line. These new offerings, and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>them,</b> have resulted in further international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size and increased amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats in these items. Many consumer groups have accused Burger King and other fast food restaurant chains of failing to provide healthier alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Alomar {{made her}} {{first and only}} {{appearance}} in Resident Evil 5. According to the character's backstory, her parents {{died when she was}} eight years old in an apparent factory accident and she was taken in by her uncle. Eventually, Alomar ran away and was found by a truck driver who was part of a rebel militia group. She later joined the group and soon learned that the factory accident her parents had died in was actually a test of a bio-organic weapon (BOW) by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella Corporation. With the help of the local government, Umbrella destroyed Alomar's village and its inhabitants after the test was complete. When Alomar was 15, she was contacted by U.S. operatives to sabotage Umbrella's attempt to sell a BOW. With Alomar's help, the deal was stopped and she was offered a chance {{to start a new life}} in America. Alomar accepted, was speaking fluent English within months and enrolled at a university two years later. After graduation, her benefactor recruited her to join the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA). While Umbrella had dissolved years before this, Alomar's hatred of Umbrella and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> led her to join. She was assigned to a unit for eight months of training, in which she excelled and was chosen to become an agent assigned to the BSAA's West African department. When BSAA agent Chris Redfield is sent to intercept a black market BOW sale in the fictional African country Kijuju, Alomar is assigned to be his partner and guide.|$|E

500|$|Nathan F. Cobb {{was named}} after a ship builder, born in 1797 from Eastham, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. Cobb and his family moved from Eastham to Northampton County, Virginia before {{purchasing}} Sand Shoal Island, which later became Cobb Island. It was on Cobb Island, in 1839, that Nathan founded Cobb's Salvaging Company with his sons. They specialized in wrecking and salvaging stranded vessels along the shallow Mid-Atlantic coastline. The Cobbs had a remarkable record; not one person drowned {{in any of the}} rescue efforts for the 37 or more ships stranded off their island. The success of the salvaging company earned them the sobriquet [...] "Rothschilds among the toilers of the sea". Despite the company's notable prosperity, the Cobbs were often praised for their humanity and general regard for human life, [...] "Often a crew of ten or twenty would be landed on the island from stranded vessels without a penny, and they were tenderly cared for as though they were millionaires." [...] This practice was a rare creed among wreckers in the 19th century. The Cobbs and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> transformed the act of salvaging which led way to the forming of the United States Life-Saving Service; this later merged into what is now the United States Coast Guard.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer {{published}} [...] "Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster", a paper {{describing the}} first mutations that affected an animal's behavior. Wild-type flies show an activity rhythm with a frequency {{of about a}} day (24 hours). They found mutants with faster and slower rhythms, as well as broken rhythms—flies that move and rest in random spurts. Work over the following 30 years has shown that these mutations (and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>them)</b> affect a group of genes and their products that form a biochemical or biological clock. This clock is found {{in a wide range}} of fly cells, but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly's central brain.|$|E

40|$|Terrorist {{organizations}} {{change over}} time because of processes such as recruitment and training as well as counter-terrorism (CT) measures, but {{the effects of these}} processes are typically studied qualitatively and in separation from each other. Seeking a more quantitative and integrated understanding, we constructed a simple dynamic model where equations describe how these processes change an organization’s membership. Analysis of the model yields a number of intuitive as well as novel findings. Most importantly it becomes possible to predict whether counter-terrorism measures would be sufficient to defeat the organization. Furthermore, we can prove in general that an organization would collapse if its strength and its pool of foot soldiers decline simultaneously. In contrast, a simultaneous decline in its strength and its pool of leaders is often insufficient and short-termed. These results and <b>other</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> demonstrate the great potential of dynamic models for informing terrorism scholarship and counter-terrorism policy making. ...|$|R
2500|$|But Miller also staffed {{his team}} {{with a number of}} young who came from outside of the mines, and often unions altogether. Many of them were idealistic {{progressives}} who supported Miller's reformist cause and had filled critical roles in the presidential campaign. These appointments and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> caused friction in the Miller administration from the start. [...] "He suddenly felt he was not educated enough to run the Union. [...] He relied on some of the college people who were non miners and they tended to isolate Arnold from the coal miners." [...] The college-educated staffers also alienated other, less educated, more conservative, leaders such as Trbovich, who claimed the young staffers were [...] "leftwing radicals from New York and Boston..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elnathan [...] "Nat" [...] Flatman (1810 – 20 August 1860), born Holton St. Mary, Suffolk, was {{the first}} Champion flat racing jockey of Great Britain. He began his thirty-four-year racing career as an {{apprentice}} jockey at age fifteen and by 1840 he was the dominant rider in British racing, winning the Champion Jockey title thirteen years in a row. During his career, Flatman won the patronage of many significant owners, including Lord George Bentinck, the Earl of Chesterfield, Admiral Rous, Lord Stradbroke and Lord Derby. [...] For these owners, and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> he won most of the important Thoroughbred horse races in England, including ten Classics, and some significant races in France. [...] He continued to ride until the paddock accident that incapacitated him and ultimately led to his death {{at the age of}} 50.|$|E
2500|$|Much American fictional {{literature}} {{has focused on}} issues of racism and the black [...] "racial experience" [...] in the US, including works written by whites such as Uncle Tom's Cabin, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Imitation of Life, or even the non-fiction work Black Like Me. These books, and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>them,</b> feed into {{what has been called}} the [...] "white savior narrative in film", in which the heroes and heroines are white even though the story is about things that happen to black characters. Textual analysis of such writings can contrast sharply with black authors' descriptions of African Americans and their experiences in US society. African American writers have sometimes been portrayed in African-American studies as retreating from racial issues when they write about [...] "whiteness", while others identify this as an African American literary tradition called [...] "the literature of white estrangement", part of a multipronged effort to challenge and dismantle white supremacy in the US.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} half of the century, the novel in France was still {{dominated}} by the chivalric novels of the Middle Ages (in their prose versions) such as: Les Quatre fils Aymon (or Renaud de Montauban), Fierabras, Ogier le Danois, Perceforest and Galien le Réthoré. From 1540 on however, the genre was dominated by foreign productions, most notably the Hispano-Portuguese multi-volume adventure novels Amadis de Gaule, Palmerin d'Olive, Primaléon de Grèce and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>them.</b> The first of these, Amadis of Gaul [...] in its celebrated French translation/adaptation by Nicolas de Herberay des Essarts [...] became the de facto code of conduct of the French court from Francis I through Henry IV and was emulated in jousts and in manners. Of similar tone and content (albeit in verse), the Italian epic poems Roland amoureux (Orlando Innamorato) by Matteo Maria Boiardo and Roland furieux (Orlando furioso) by Ludovico Ariosto (and, at the end of the century, Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered) were also enormous successes (French translations of these works were often in prose). Finally, the Italian Luigi Pulci's Morgant le géant, a comic version of the chivalric novel, was an important model for Rabelais's giants.|$|E
2500|$|While {{these works}} and <b>others</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> {{that would follow}} were {{accepted}} by the listening public at large, detractors accused Copland of pandering to the masses. Music critic Paul Rosenfeld, for one, warned in 1939 that Copland was [...] "standing in the fork in the highroad, the two branches of which lead respectively to popular and artistic success." [...] Even some of the composer's friends, such as composer Arthur Berger, were confused about Copland's simpler style. One, composer David Diamond, {{went so far as}} to lecture Copland: [...] "By having sold out to the mongrel commercialists half-way already, the danger is going to be wider for you, and I beg you dear Aaron, don't sell out [...] yet." [...] Copland's response was that his writing as he did and in as many genres was his response to how the Depression had affected society, as well as to new media and the audiences made available by these new media. As he himself phrased it, [...] "The composer who is frightened of losing his artistic integrity through contact with a mass audience is no longer aware of the meaning of the word art." ...|$|E
