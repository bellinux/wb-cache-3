500|$|HUAC {{achieved}} {{its greatest}} fame and notoriety with its {{investigation into the}} Hollywood film industry. In October 1947, the Committee began to subpoena screenwriters, directors, and other movie industry professionals to testify about their known or suspected membership in the Communist Party, association with its members, or support of its beliefs. It was at these testimonies that {{what became known as}} [...] "the $64,000 question" [...] was asked: [...] "Are you now <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> ever {{been a member of the}} Communist Party of the United States?" [...] Among the first film industry witnesses subpoenaed by the Committee were ten who decided not to cooperate. These men, who became known as the [...] "Hollywood Ten", cited the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and free assembly, which they believed legally protected them from being required to answer the Committee's questions. This tactic failed, and the ten were sentenced to prison for contempt of Congress. Two of the ten were sentenced to six months, the rest to a year.|$|E

2500|$|At {{one point}} in the {{beginning}} of the proceedings, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Joe Biden asked Thomas if he believed the Constitution granted any sort of property rights to individuals as described in Richard Epstein's book Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain, which had been published by Harvard University Press in 1985. Biden held the book up for Thomas to see and denounced its contents. In his book, Epstein argues that the government should be regarded with the same respect as any other private entity in a property dispute. The Cato Institute later paraphrased Biden's general line of questioning in the hearing as, [...] "Are you now <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> ever been a libertarian?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the Feinberg Law was implemented, the New York Superintendent of Schools, William Jansen, {{began calling}} in {{teachers}} for questioning. Union leaders and active members were {{asked the same}} question being asked of those subpoenaed before the House Un-American Activities Committee, [...] "Are you now <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> ever {{been a member of the}} Communist Party?" [...] On the advice of counsel, most refused to answer on the grounds that the question was a violation of section 26a of the New York Civil Service Law that prohibited questioning civil service employees about their political affiliation. Those who refused to answer the question, Adler among them, were dismissed for [...] "insubordination and conduct unbecoming a teacher." [...] Adler was suspended in 1952 and dismissed in 1954.|$|E

2500|$|Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-Wisc.) asked, [...] "Are you now, <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> ever been, {{a member}} of the Communist Party," [...] while he was {{chairman}} of the Senate Government Operations Committee Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Admitting to a previous Communist Party membership was not sufficient. Witnesses were also required to [...] "name names," [...] to implicate others they knew to be Communists or who had been Communists in the past. Academy Award winning director Elia Kazan testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities that he had belonged to the Communist Party briefly in his youth. He also [...] "named names," [...] which incurred enmity of many in Hollywood. Other entertainers such as Zero Mostel found themselves on a Hollywood blacklist after taking the Fifth, and were unable to find work for a while in the show business. Pleading the Fifth in response to such questions was held inapplicable, since being a Communist itself was not a crime.|$|E

However, the validity of polygraph tests have been questioned by researchers {{to the point that}} they are rarely cited as a source of legal evidence in countries such as the United States, and as such the use of the polygraph test on the show has been criticized, at one point to prove the legitimacy of the lie detector test Jeremy Kyle performed a live on stage test with the question [...] "are you, <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> ever been a llama?" [...] which he replied yes, which was identified as a lie. It is not 100% accurate, with research indicating that results are little better than chance.
