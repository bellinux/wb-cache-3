5|$|Admirals wore a {{shoulder}} strap of sky-blue cloth, edged with black, that was four {{inches long and}} one inch and three-eighths wide embroidered with gold one-quarter <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> in width. They had five stars spaced equally, the two on the ends six-tenths <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> in diameter, and the three intermediate stars six-eighths <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> in diameter.|$|E

5|$|It was {{a double}} system, that is, {{the sound was}} on a {{different}} piece of film from the picture.... In essence, the sound was captured by a microphone and translated into light waves via a light valve, a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit. The sound reaching this ribbon would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm, focusing the resulting light waves through the slit, {{where it would be}} photographed {{on the side of the}} film, on a strip about a tenth <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> wide.|$|E

Eventually Titanics structure will collapse, and she will be reduced to a patch of rust on the seabed, with any remaining scraps of the ship's hull mingled with her more durable fittings, like the propellers, bronze capstans, compasses and the telemotor.|$|E
5|$|Written by Roger Dixon, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} on January 16, 1967. The basic story idea had the TARDIS bring the Doctor and his companions to the Nevada Desert, where they discover they have been shrunk to a tenth <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> in height. To make matters worse, they learn that the local ants have been made super-intelligent by atomic bomb tests and plan {{to take over the}} Earth.|$|E
5|$|Francis, {{having heard}} Elizabeth's screams, enters the dungeon. Nicholas confuses Francis for Bartolome, and knocks him unconscious. He straps {{him to a}} stone slab located {{directly}} beneath a huge razor-sharp pendulum. The pendulum {{is attached to a}} clockwork apparatus that causes it to descend fractions <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> after each swing, ever closer to Francis's torso. Catherine arrives just in time with Maximillian, one of the servants. After a brief struggle with Maximillian, Nicholas falls to his death in the pit. Francis is removed from the torture device. As they leave the basement, Catherine vows to seal up the chamber forever. They slam and lock the door shut, unaware that Elizabeth is still alive, gagged and trapped in the iron maiden.|$|E

50|$|Used for the {{automation}} {{of industrial}} valves, actuators {{can be found}} in all kinds of process plants. They are used in waste water treatment plants, power plants, refineries, mining and nuclear processes, food factories, and pipelines. Valve actuators play a major part in automating process control. The valves to be automated vary both in design and dimension. The diameters of the valves range from one-tenth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>inch</b> to several feet.|$|R
5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, {{it was hard to}} make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close-up, but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E
5|$|In New York, Edouard {{produced}} strong {{waves and}} storm tides {{of one to}} twoft (0.3 to 0.6m), causing overwash along southern Long Island due to high tide. Coastal flooding occurred, including in Hampton Bays where the waves flooded one road and covered another with sand. The flooding trapped six cars, while the strong waves forced several beaches to close. Because the hurricane moved through the New York Shipping Channel, numerous ships reported winds of over hurricane status, though winds remained below tropical storm force on land. A boat capsized {{off the coast of}} Jones Beach Island, though its passengers were not injured. A Celebrity Cruises cruise ship, the MV_Zenith suffered damage from 30 to 50ft (nine to 15m) waves, injuring several passengers and crew members. Rainfall was minimal, peaking at less than a half <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> in eastern Long Island.|$|E
5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, {{to the spot where}} the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch.</b> The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E

5|$|Newton (test plate) {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats {{at different stages of}} completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E
5|$|Once {{he began}} to play football, as a junior, he {{achieved}} instant success as a running back, running 65 {{yards for a touchdown}} on his first high school carry. At , he was not especially large, but his speed and strength {{made him one of the}} team's featured players. John J. Jefferson High School was integrated with neighboring Columbia High School that year; Payton and his teammates were upset that their head coach, Charles L. Boston, had become an assistant and Payton boycotted some of the spring practices in protest, but returned during the fall season. He then earned statewide honors as a member of Mississippi's all-state team, leading Columbia to an unexpected 8â€“2 season. His performance helped ease the local tensions surrounding desegregation. Tommy Davis, Columbiaâ€™s football coach, claimed that he could always count on Payton when the team needed to score. Paytonâ€™s statistics proved that was no exaggeration: he scored in every game during his junior and senior years. He was named to the all-conference team two years in a row. Payton also led the Little Dixie Conference in scoring his senior year and made the all-state team. In addition to excelling at football, Payton averaged 18 points a game for Columbiaâ€™s basketball team, leaped three-quarters <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> short of 23 feet in the long jump, played baseball, and continued to drum in the school band.|$|E
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by Â½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E

50|$|The engine {{initially}} displaced 379 cuin L, {{though the}} potential for larger displacements was engineered into the design. It had SOHCs actuating the valves via roller-tipped rockers mounted on rockershafts flanking the centrally located camshaft. Just like the FE Cammer, this allows splayed valves. It has <b>a</b> bore spacing <b>of</b> 4.53 <b>inches,</b> <b>a</b> stroke <b>of</b> 3.74 <b>inches,</b> <b>a</b> bore <b>of</b> 4.015 <b>inches,</b> and <b>a</b> deep-skirted thinwall casting block with cross-bolted mains.
