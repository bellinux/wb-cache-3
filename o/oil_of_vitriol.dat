25|$|Sulfuric acid (alternative {{spelling}} sulphuric acid) is {{a highly}} corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula H2SO4 and molecular weight 98.079 g/mol. It is a pungent-ethereal, colorless to {{slightly yellow viscous liquid}} that is soluble in water at all concentrations. Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards. The historical name of this acid is <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitriol.</b>|$|E

Humans have processed common salt (sodium chloride) for over 8000 years, using it first as a food seasoning and preservative, and now also in manufacturing, agriculture, water conditioning, for de-icing roads, and many other uses. Many ionic compounds are so widely used in society that they go by common names unrelated to their chemical identity. Examples of this include borax, calomel, milk of magnesia, muriatic acid, <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitriol,</b> saltpeter, and slaked lime.

Some of the earliest discussions on the origin and properties <b>of</b> <b>vitriol</b> {{is in the works}} of the Greek physician Dioscorides (first century AD) and the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD). Galen also discussed its medical use.

[...] Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1493–1541), better known as Paracelsus, discovered the analgesic properties of diethyl ether around 1525. It was first synthesized in 1540 by Valerius Cordus, who noted some of its medicinal properties. He called it oleum dulce vitrioli, a name that {{reflects the fact that}} it is synthesized by distilling a mixture of ethanol and sulfuric acid (known at that time as <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitriol).</b> August Sigmund Frobenius gave the name Spiritus Vini Æthereus to the substance in 1730.|$|E
2500|$|IUPAC {{rules are}} often not {{followed}} for simple ethers. The trivial names for simple ethers (i.e., those with none or few other functional groups) are a composite of the two substituents followed by [...] "ether". [...] For example, ethyl methyl ether (CH3OC2H5), diphenylether (C6H5OC6H5). As for other organic compounds, very common ethers acquired names before rules for nomenclature were formalized. Diethyl ether is simply called [...] "ether," [...] but was once called sweet <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitriol.</b> Methyl phenyl ether is anisole, because it was originally found in aniseed. The aromatic ethers include furans. Acetals (α-alkoxy ethers R–CH(–OR)–O–R) are another class of ethers with characteristic properties.|$|E
2500|$|Salt (sodium chloride) is soluble {{and is used}} {{to enhance}} the taste of food. Substances with similar {{properties}} {{came to be known}} as salts, in particular Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate, found in a bitter saline spring in the English town of Epsom). Lead acetate was called sugar of lead. However, other names like sugar of lead (lead(II) acetate), butter of antimony (antimony trichloride), <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitriol</b> (sulfuric acid), and cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate) borrowed their language from the kitchen.

Accordingly, when the same trough was charged {{with a mixture of}} 200 water, 9 <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitriol,</b> and 4 nitric acid, the consumption of zinc was at each plate 2.786, and for the whole battery 111.5, equivalents.

When the trough was charged with a mixture of 200 water, 16 muriatic acid, and 6 nitric acid, the loss per plate was 2.11, or for the whole battery 84.4, equivalents. Similar results were obtained with my battery of twenty pairs of four-inch plates (1129.). Hence it is evident that the nitric acid was of great service when mingled with the sulphuric acid; and the charge generally used after this time for ordinary experiments consisted of 200 water, 4-1/2 <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitriol,</b> and 4 nitric acid.|$|E

6000|$|For when Salt of Tartar runs per Deliquium, is {{not this}} done by an Attraction between the Particles of the Salt of Tartar, and the Particles of the Water which {{float in the}} Air {{in the form of}} Vapours?

Or why does not Salt of Tartar draw more Water out of the Air than in a certain Proportion to its quantity, but for want of an {{attractive}} Force after it is satiated with Water?

And when Water and <b>Oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vitriol</b> poured successively into the same Vessel grow very hot in the mixing, does not this Heat argue a great Motion in the Parts of the Liquors? And does not this Motion argue, that the Parts of the two Liquors in mixing coalesce with Violence, and by consequence rush towards one another with an accelerated Motion? And when Aqua fortis, or Spirit of Vitriol poured upon Filings of Iron dissolves the Filings with a great Heat and Ebullition, is not this Heat and Ebullition effected by a violent Motion of the Parts, and does not that Motion argue that the acid Parts of the Liquor rush towards the Parts of the Metal with violence, and run forcibly into its Pores till they get between its outmost Particles, and the main Mass of the Metal, and surrounding those Particles loosen them from the main Mass, and set them at liberty to float off into the Water?

60|$|When Arsenick with Soap gives a Regulus, {{and with}} Mercury {{sublimate}} a volatile fusible Salt, like Butter of Antimony, doth not this shew that Arsenick, {{which is a}} Substance totally volatile, is compounded of fix'd and volatile Parts, strongly cohering by a mutual Attraction, so that the volatile will not ascend without carrying up the fixed? And so, when an equal weight of Spirit of Wine and <b>Oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vitriol</b> are digested together, and in Distillation yield two fragrant and volatile Spirits which will not mix with one another, and a fix'd black Earth remains behind; doth not this shew that <b>Oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vitriol</b> is composed of volatile and fix'd Parts strongly united by Attraction, so as to ascend together in form of a volatile, acid, fluid Salt, until the Spirit of Wine attracts and separates the volatile Parts from the fixed? And therefore, since Oil of Sulphur per Campanam is of the same Nature with <b>Oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vitriol,</b> may it not be inferred, that Sulphur is also a mixture of volatile and fix'd Parts so strongly cohering by Attraction, as to ascend together in Sublimation. By dissolving Flowers of Sulphur in Oil of Turpentine, and distilling the Solution, {{it is found that}} Sulphur is composed of an inflamable thick Oil or fat Bitumen, an acid Salt, a very fix'd Earth, and a little Metal. The three first were found not much unequal to one another, the fourth in so small a quantity as scarce to be worth considering. The acid Salt dissolved in Water, is the same with Oil of Sulphur per Campanam, and abounding much in the Bowels of the Earth, and particularly in Markasites, unites it self to the other Ingredients of the Markasite, which are, Bitumen, Iron, Copper, and Earth, and with them compounds Allum, Vitriol, and Sulphur. With the Earth alone it compounds Allum; with the Metal alone, or Metal and Earth together, it compounds Vitriol; and with the Bitumen and Earth it compounds Sulphur. Whence it comes to pass that Markasites abound with those three Minerals. And is it not from the mutual Attraction of the Ingredients that they stick together for compounding these Minerals, and that the Bitumen carries up the other Ingredients of the Sulphur, which without it would not sublime? And the same Question may be put concerning all, or almost all the gross Bodies in Nature. For all the Parts of Animals and Vegetables are composed of Substances volatile and fix'd, fluid and solid, as appears by their Analysis; and so are Salts and Minerals, so far as Chymists have been hitherto able to examine their Composition.|$|E

The amalgamation is best effected by sprinkling a few drops of mercury upon the surface of the zinc, the latter being moistened with the dilute acid, and rubbing with the fingers or two so as to extend the liquid metal over the whole of the surface.
