5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves {{at the door of}} a workhouse were {{at the mercy of the}} porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging <b>or</b> <b>sleeping</b> in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E
5|$|Epstein {{died of an}} {{overdose}} of Carbitral, a form of barbiturate <b>or</b> <b>sleeping</b> pill, in his locked bedroom, on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler had knocked on the door, and then hearing no response, asked the housekeeper to call the police. Epstein was found on a single bed, dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single bed. At the statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident; caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral in his system, combined with alcohol. It was revealed {{that he had taken}} six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol they reduced his tolerance to lethal levels.|$|E

25|$|Although each {{nociceptor}} {{can have}} a variety of possible threshold levels, some do not respond at all to chemical, thermal or mechanical stimuli unless injury actually has occurred. These are typically referred to as silent <b>or</b> <b>sleeping</b> nociceptors since their response comes only on the onset of inflammation to the surrounding tissue.|$|E
25|$|Public places: Parks, bus or train stations, public libraries, airports, public {{transportation}} vehicles (by continual riding where unlimited passes are available), hospital lobbies or waiting areas, college campuses, and 24-hour businesses such as coffee shops. Many public places use security guards or police to prevent people from loitering <b>or</b> <b>sleeping</b> at these locations {{for a variety}} of reasons, including image, safety, and comfort.|$|E
25|$|A couch, bench, {{or other}} {{arrangement}} of seats {{next to each}} other may have armrest at the sides or arm rests in between. The latter may be provided for comfort, but also for privacy (e.g., in public transport and other public places), and in some park benches, to prevent homeless people from lying down <b>or</b> <b>sleeping</b> on the bench. Arm rests reduce both desired and undesired proximity between people seated side by side. A loveseat in particular, has no armrest in between two seating positions.|$|E

From his side or his navel springs the trunk of a tree or vine which ascends, branching to either side. On the branches, usually surrounded by formally scrolling tendrils of foliage, are figures representing the ancestors of Christ. The trunk generally ascends vertically to Mary and then Christ at the top.|$|E
25|$|From the 314 {{personnel}} aboard Voyager at {{the time}} of the collision, 14 officers, 67 sailors, and one civilian dockyard worker were killed, including Stevens and all but two sailors of the bridge crew. The majority of those killed had been in the forward section of Voyager when the collision occurred, off duty and relaxing <b>or</b> <b>sleeping.</b> Only three bodies were recovered, one of them being that of Stevens. They were buried on 14 February, and the missing were declared dead on 17 February. Memorial services were held around Australia on 21 February. There were no casualties aboard Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|Incidents of {{physical}} abuse, sexual abuse or rape {{can result in}} dangerous outcomes to {{the victim of the}} criminal act. Victims may suffer from extreme anxiety, fear, helplessness, confusion, eating <b>or</b> <b>sleeping</b> disorders, hostility, guilt and shame. Managing the response usually encompasses coordinating psychological, medical and legal considerations. Dependent upon legal requirements in the region, mental health professionals may be required to report criminal activity to a police force. Mental health professionals will usually gather identifying data during the initial assessment and refer the patient, if necessary, to receive medical treatment. Medical treatment may include a physical examination, collection of medicolegal evidence, and determination of the risk of pregnancy, if applicable.|$|E

25|$|Tsetse flies {{transmit}} {{a similar}} disease to humans, called African trypanosomiasis - human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) <b>or</b> <b>sleeping</b> sickness. An estimated 70 {{million people in}} 20 countries are {{at different levels of}} risk and only 3-4 million people are covered by active surveillance. The DALY index (disability-adjusted life years), an indicator to quantify the burden of disease, includes the impact of both the duration of life lost due to premature death and the duration of life lived with a disability. The annual burden of sleeping sickness is estimated at 2 million DALYs. Since the disease tends to affect economically active adults, the total cost to a family with a patient is about 25% of a year’s income.|$|E
25|$|Research done {{in animals}} {{has shown that}} {{subjects}} recovering in an enriched environment 15 days after having a stroke had significantly improved neurobehavioral function. In addition these same subjects showed greater capability of learning and larger infarct post-intervention {{than those who were}} not in an enriched environment. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment had a considerable beneficial effect on the learning and sensorimotor functions on animals post-stroke. A 2013 study also found that environmental enrichment socially benefits patients recovering from stroke. Researchers in that study concluded that stroke patients in enriched environments in assisted-care facilities {{are much more likely to}} be engaging with other patients during normal social hours instead of being alone <b>or</b> <b>sleeping.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brown ended San Francisco's {{policy of}} {{punishing}} people for feeding the homeless. San Francisco continued {{to enforce its}} policy regarding {{the conduct of the}} homeless in public places. In 1998, Brown supported forcibly removing homeless people from Golden Gate Park and police crackdowns on the homeless for drunkenness, urinating, defecating, <b>or</b> <b>sleeping</b> on the sidewalk. Brown introduced job training programs and a $11 million drug treatment program. San Francisco, then the United States' 13th largest city, had the nation's third largest homeless population at a peak of 16,000. In November 1997, he requested nighttime helicopter searches in Golden Gate Park. The Brown administration spent {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} creating new shelters, supportive housing, and drug treatment centers to address homelessness, but these measures did not end San Francisco’s problem with homelessness.|$|E

25|$|The group put {{themselves}} through challenges that {{forced them to}} find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, <b>or</b> <b>sleeping</b> on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold. For example, {{no one in the}} group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing. During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out {{in order to make a}} jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot. At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.|$|E
25|$|The frontoviks had to live, {{fight and}} die in small {{circular}} foxholes dug into the earth with enough room {{for one or two}} men with slit trenches being to connect what the Germans called “Russian holes”. The soldiers were usually not issued blankets <b>or</b> <b>sleeping</b> bags, even in the winter. Instead, the frontovik slept in their coats and shelter-capes usually on pine, evergreen needles, fir boughs, piled leaves or straw. In the winter, the temperature could drop as low as -60°F (-50°C), making General Moroz (General Frost) as much an enemy as the Germans. Spring started in April and with it came rains and snowmelt, making the battlefields into a muddy quagmire. Summers were dusty and hot while with the fall came the rasputitsa (time without roads) as heavy autumn rains once again turned the battlefields into muddy quagmires that made the spring rains look tame by comparison.|$|E
25|$|Each leg of The Amazing Race {{generally}} {{consists of}} teams leaving {{from the previous}} Pit Stop and traveling to a different location (often in a different country), where they perform two or more tasks, generally including one Detour and one Roadblock, before being given instructions {{to go to the}} next Pit Stop. It is each team's goal to complete each leg as quickly as possible, as the first team to check in at the Pit Stop will win a prize; the prizes have included all-expenses paid trips, new cars or other vehicles, money, entertainment provided during the Pit Stop, and recently advantages to be used during the race (see Express Pass, Salvage Pass, and Double Your Money). The last team to arrive at the Pit Stop will generally be eliminated from the competition, but occasionally the team is allowed to continue racing although they will be given a Race-imposed disadvantage in the next leg (see Non-elimination leg). When teams are otherwise not performing tasks or traveling during a leg, they are free to use their time as they see fit, although they will often resort to eating cheaply <b>or</b> <b>sleeping</b> outside a location to save their Race money.|$|E
