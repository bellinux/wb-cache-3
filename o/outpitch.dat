In his first, on September 16 at Shibe Park, he allowed seven hits (including home runs by Gus Zernial and Eddie Joost) and seven earned runs to take the loss in a 7-1 victory by the Philadelphia Athletics. In his second start on September 27, however, he threw a complete game, 7-4 victory over the Detroit Tigers at Sportsman's Park, <b>outpitching</b> veteran Tiger right-hander Fred Hutchinson.

50|$|A rough outing {{against the}} St. Louis Cardinals {{followed}} on September 9, pinning Cambria {{with his second}} career defeat. But eleven days later, Cambria faced his hometown Mets in his home borough, as the starting pitcher {{in the second game}} of a doubleheader at Shea Stadium. The Mets had won the opening game to climb within 2 games of the first-place Pirates, and Cambria drew reigning Cy Young Award winning pitcher Tom Seaver as his opponent in the nightcap. But Cambria <b>outpitched</b> Seaver, allowing only two earned runs in 5 innings. He left the game with his team ahead 5-3, and although the Pirate bullpen allowed the Mets to tie the score at five in the seventh inning, denying Cambria the win, Pittsburgh came back to win 9-5. They eventually won the division title by five games over the second-place Cubs. Cambria did not appear in the 1970 NLCS, which the Pirates dropped in three straight games to the Cincinnati Reds.|$|R
25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} season on March 31 against the San Francisco Giants at Dodger Stadium. Starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw <b>outpitched</b> Giants ace Tim Lincecum, {{striking}} out nine batters in seven shutout innings, as the Dodgers won 2–1. After the game, a Giants fan was seriously injured {{after he was}} assaulted in the Dodger Stadium parking lot. The incident would provoke increased security at future home games {{as well as a}} joint fundraiser by the two teams in support of the man's family. Back on the field, the Dodgers took the second game of the series also, as some aggressive baserunning by Matt Kemp and two Giants errors were just enough offense to back a solid start by Chad Billingsley in the 4–3 win. Matt Cain and three relievers combined to shut out the Dodgers 10–0 the following day, as Ted Lilly and Kenley Jansen each gave up four runs in the loss. A big seventh inning, including an RBI triple by Marcus Thames helped Hiroki Kuroda and the Dodgers take the series with a 7–5 victory in the finale.|$|R
50|$|The Pittsburgh Pirates {{released}} catcher LeRoy Jarvis to the Seals as partial {{payment for}} the rights to Werle in January 1949. As a National League rookie Werle survived a ninth inning rally at Ebbets Field in May 1949 to beat the Dodgers, 5-3. He surrendered seven runs, three in the last inning, when Bob Ramazzoti homered. Pirates chief scout, Pie Traynor, favored Cliff Chambers over Werle, and predicted Chambers would win more games in 1949. Werle shut out the Cincinnati Reds on seven hits on July 4, 1949. It was the second game of a doubleheader and lifted the Pirates into sixth place in the National League. Werle pitched in relief for Pittsburgh in 1950. In June he came on for his second relief stint in two days. Tommy Holmes homered off of him in the eight inning, breaking a 6-6 tie and giving the Boston Braves the win. Werle <b>outpitched</b> All-Star Larry Jansen with a two-hitter on July 15 at Forbes Field. The Pirates beat the New York Giants 2-1. On April 17, 1951, Werle provided effective relief in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals. He retired the side without a hit {{in the top of the}} seventh after Murry Dickson walked the bases loaded. Only a single run scored when Red Schoendienst hit a sacrifice fly which plated Solly Hemus. He went 8-6 for the Pirates in 1951.|$|R
50|$|In 1931 in {{the first}} game of the Dixie Series championship, Birmingham's 43-year-old Ray Caldwell <b>outpitched</b> 22-year-old Dizzy Dean, who had {{guaranteed}} a win. The Barons won the series 4 games to 3. In 1936 four monumental steel-frame light towers designed and fabricated by the Truscon Steel Company of Youngstown, Ohio were erected, allowing for night games. In 1938, Woodward sold the park to Ed Norton, a local businessman. In 1940 Norton sold it to the Cincinnati Reds. At that time new outfield fences were built inside the original walls to reduce the field dimensions. G. J. Jebeles of Birmingham purchased the park in 1944. A ladies' rest room was added and the outfield fence reduced again in 1948. In 1949 ownership changed hands again, going to a partnership of Al DeMent, Al Belcher, and Rufus Lackey. They added a small restaurant in the entrance building in 1950 and installed additional box seats, necessitating the relocations of the dugouts farther down the baselines. In 1958 Belcher gained a majority share and control of the park. In 1964 General Manager Glynn West purchased 1000 wooden seats from New York City's Polo Grounds and installed them at the park. Belcher sold Rickwood Field in 1966 to the City of Birmingham, but retained a lease for the remainder of that year.|$|R
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on April 14 {{to begin a}} four-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Kuroda struggled with his control in the opener as the Dodgers lost 9–5. Jon Garland made his first {{start of the season}} the next day, but he was wild and the Dodgers were pounded 11–2. Clayton Kershaw had his first poor outing of the season in game 3 of the series, as the Dodgers lost 9–2 to extend their losing streak to five games. The Dodgers snapped that streak the following day as Billingsley pitched eight shut out innings, while striking out eleven. Matt Kemp hit a walk-off two run home run {{in the bottom of the}} ninth for the 2–1 win. The Dodgers then began a four-game homestand with the Atlanta Braves. Prior to the first game, the Dodgers called up their 2010 minor league player of the year, Jerry Sands, who doubled in his first at-bat and later picked up his first RBI to back solid pitching from Ted Lilly in the Dodgers 2–1 win. Brandon Beachy <b>outpitched</b> Kuroda in the next game, as the Braves broke open a tight game with an eight run ninth inning to pull off a 10–1 rout. Jon Garland bounced back from his rough debut to pick up the complete game victory, as Andre Ethier had three hits including a home run and Juan Uribe had four RBI in the Dodgers 6–1 victory. Matt Kemp hit a two-run walk off home run in the 12th inning as the Dodgers beat the Braves 5–3 to end the series.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, Braves manager Bobby Cox {{designated}} Leibrandt {{the starter}} for Game 1 of the World Series against the Minnesota Twins. Leibrandt got the start {{by virtue of}} his long post-season rest and the fact he was the only Braves starter who had ever pitched in the Metrodome. Leibrandt lost as he pitched decently but was <b>outpitched</b> by Jack Morris. Leibrandt is best known for surrendering a walk-off home run to future Baseball Hall of Famer Kirby Puckett in Game 6 of that series. The first pitch of the inning was a change-up, which Puckett took for strike one. The next one was a similar high and outside fastball, which Puckett took for ball one; pitch three was another fastball for ball two. The fourth pitch, and last pitch of the game, was a weak, high change-up that failed to break. Puckett made solid contact and sprinted for first, as was his usual practice. Only after he saw first base coach Wayne Terwilliger throw up his hands in victory did Puckett realize he had hit a home run. Leibrandt was called upon to enter the game in a highly unfamiliar role [...] - [...] as a reliever late in the extra-inning game, and very late at night. Cox endured some criticism for the move because the Braves still had several relievers at their disposal including left-hander Kent Mercker and right-handers Jim Clancy and Mark Wohlers, but the move made sense on another level, because Leibrandt was the only pitcher left on their roster who had previous World Series experience, and although Leibrandt had been subpar in his Game 1 start, the three hitters scheduled to bat for the Twins in the 11th had been a combined 0 for 6 against Leibrandt in that game, including two strikeouts of Puckett.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, for {{the sixth}} {{consecutive}} year, Halladay was Toronto's opening-day starter, improving his own club record. He lost 3–2 in a pitcher's duel with New York's Chien-Ming Wang. His first win of the season came in his next start against Boston, when he <b>outpitched</b> Josh Beckett in his season debut. In his third start, Halladay pitched a complete game against the Texas Rangers, in a 4–1 win. Three of his nine complete game efforts resulted in losses due to Toronto's underachieving offense early in the season. In fact, those three complete game losses came in three consecutive starts. On June 20 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Halladay was struck in the temple by a line-drive off the bat of Nyjer Morgan. The ball caromed off Halladay's head and was caught by third baseman Scott Rolen, ending the inning. Halladay was able to {{walk back to the}} dugout, but was taken out of the game for safety concerns. Although he was given {{a clean bill of health}} for his next start, it was later suggested by television commentators that Halladay may have in fact suffered a temporary lapse in recognition of what happened on the play. Halladay pitched his 10th career shutout against the Seattle Mariners on June 30. He limited them to four hits in his sixth complete game of the season. The shutout tied him with the Cardinals' Mark Mulder for 10th among active pitchers. On July 11, 2008, Halladay pitched his 7th complete game and second shutout of the season against the New York Yankees, allowing 0 runs on 2 hits for his 38th career complete game. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve. He pitched in the fourth inning, yielding only one hit and striking out Lance Berkman. In his last start of the season, he fittingly pitched a complete game against the Yankees to win his 20th game of the year. In so doing, he became the first pitcher to win five games against the Yankees in a single season since Luis Tiant in 1974. In addition, he led the AL with a 1.05 WHIP. Halladay finished second in the 2008 American League Cy Young Award voting, behind Cliff Lee of the Indians. He also led the AL with 9 complete games, and struck out a career-high 206 batters (two more than his 2003 season) as well as posted a 2.78 ERA (the second-best of his career) that was second only to Cliff Lee's 2.54 ERA. Halladay also became just the fourth pitcher in major league history to post two seasons of 200 strikeouts and fewer than 40 walks. He was presented the George Gross/Toronto Sun Sportsperson of the Year award.|$|R

Pablo Sandoval ripped his team-leading fourth home run of the season onto the green monster. On Patriots' Day, the Red Sox played their traditional 11 am game and quickly scored four runs in the first two innings, after Tampa Bay took a two run lead in the first.
