5|$|The PC port was {{outsourced}} by Eidos Montréal by Nixxes Software, {{who also}} worked with Eidos on multiple projects including the PC port of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. The decision to <b>outsource</b> the PC port was made because the team {{wanted to make a}} quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a deep understanding of the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so the PC and console versions were as close as possible in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a DirectX 11 that the PC version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra anti-aliasing options. The controls and HUD were customized to work with a computer keyboard. The initial response to the announcement of the PC port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by Advanced Micro Devices. The game was also ported to Apple Inc.'s OS X platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the porting was handled by Feral Interactive, who had made a name for themselves porting titles such as Bioshock and Max Payne to the platform.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{popularity}} and growth in <b>outsourcing</b> {{has resulted in}} many different <b>outsourcing</b> arrangements, from strategic and business process <b>outsourcing</b> to selective and tactical <b>outsourcing,</b> on a national or global scale. <b>Outsourcing</b> is frequently considered a vital ingredient to corporate restructuring and business improvement initiatives. However, it is often treated as a fixed discreet event such as a make or buy decision. As the rational and strategic implications of <b>outsourcing</b> vary, so too does the required <b>outsourcing</b> process and performance measures. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to review and synthesis available empirical literature on <b>outsourcing</b> frameworks and performance management techniques, and develop a framework for measuring <b>outsourcing</b> performance. Research Approach: A sample of empirical academic publications on <b>outsourcing</b> frameworks and performance measures, across various scholarly journals constitute the main data for analytical purposes. It is compiled from searches of the main academic databases. The studies in the sample are clustered according to their main research areas, with a narrative approach being used to review developments in each area. Following analysis of the reviewed literature, a number of the frameworks and their measures are adapted and integrated to develop a conceptual framework for measuring <b>outsourcing</b> performance. Findings and Originality: This conceptual based framework brings an integrated perspective to <b>outsourcing.</b> It develops a dynamic process of strategic alignment between environmental drivers, corporate <b>outsourcing</b> objectives, the <b>outsourcing</b> process and the performance measures. The proposed conceptual framework seeks to integrate the environmental and organisational <b>outsourcing</b> drivers down into the <b>outsourcing</b> process, culminating in a managed <b>outsourcing</b> relationship. Research Impact: For both the researcher and practioner, the measured <b>outsourcing</b> framework will provide a more holistic approach when considering and implementing <b>outsourcing.</b> Practical Impact: This paper is a first step towards developing a framework for measuring <b>outsourcing</b> performance, which practioners will be able to apply when considering, analysing and managing an <b>outsourcing</b> initiative...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between <b>outsourcing</b> and development in Nairobi. The key research question for this study is what are the impacts of <b>outsourcing</b> practices conducted by organisations in Nairobi? Data were obtained from questionnaires distributed in December 2010. A total of 85 profit-making firms in Nairobi with a sample of 165 management employees were selected for this study. The empirical findings obtained relate to four <b>outsourcing</b> theories. Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) Theory focuses on the cost savings that result from <b>outsourcing.</b> Agency <b>Outsourcing</b> Theory centres on <b>outsourcing</b> firms hiring agents to achieve productivity. Hiring agents may result in permanent staff being retrenched and additional <b>outsourcing</b> personnel being contracted and job creation and/or job loss results. Expectation Confirmation Theory (ECT) emphasises the importance of an <b>outsourcing</b> provider conforming to quality management principles. Resource Based Theory (RBT) proposes that organisations need a collection of resources and capabilities to execute <b>outsourcing</b> successfully. Findings further suggested that <b>outsourcing</b> can yield positive and/or negative outcomes depending on risks encountered, the business environment, company policies, function/s to be <b>outsourced,</b> and the competence and commitment of an <b>outsourcing</b> vendor. To further enhance the positive impact of <b>outsourcing</b> three improvements need to be executed: formulation of standard policies, price regulations, and commitment of <b>outsourcing</b> firms in adhering to set contract deadlines. It is suggested that the following would allow organisations to gain more from <b>outsourcing</b> in the future: the adoption of international/offshore <b>outsourcing</b> practices, more commitment by <b>outsourcing</b> consultants, the standardisation of charges for <b>outsourcing</b> contracts, and the use of new technology that would improve how <b>outsourcing</b> is conducted.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{test the}} nine corollaries {{concerning}} the determinants of <b>outsourcing</b> relationship dimensions, strategic manoeuvres, clients’ and service providers’ evaluation regarding <b>outsourcing</b> category and <b>outsourcing</b> relationship types. The paper has the purpose of reviewing the concept of <b>outsourcing</b> in relation to FM, dealing with service providers’ performance {{and its effect on}} clients before providing a comprehensive discussion of <b>outsourcing.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual approach is adopted, suggesting that a study of <b>outsourcing</b> relationship between clients and service providers from these theoretical perspectives is used to develop corollaries about the relationships between the strategic manoeuvres identified and the different dimensions of <b>outsourcing</b> relationship. The corollaries are examined using non-parametric tests. Findings – The model of the facilities management (FM) <b>outsourcing</b> relationships presented in the paper shows performance of <b>outsourcing</b> services through evaluation of <b>outsourcing</b> categories on current and future FM contracts of clients and service providers. As a template of <b>outsourcing</b> relationships, the model is the context for predicting the important <b>outsourcing</b> categories to the future four FM <b>outsourcing</b> contracts, such as building maintenance, security, cleaning and catering. On prediction of those FM contracts, there is an inclination to the types of in-house and technical expertise on category of FM <b>outsourcing</b> relationship types from clients, whilst there is an equal inclination to the type of in-house <b>outsourcing</b> category from service providers. Originality/value – Management on <b>outsourcing</b> relationships between clients and service providers is now essential for effective <b>outsourcing</b> in FM.
