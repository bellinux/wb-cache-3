500|$|During his career, Jack won {{the respect}} of both {{teammates}} and opponents. Dan Dierdorf, a Hall of Fame tackle, said that Youngblood was [...] "by far the toughest opponent I faced in my career", a thought echoed by Viking Hall of Fame tackle Ron Yary who said, [...] "There wasn't anybody who was tougher to block than Jack". Other NFL greats such as Hall of Fame tackles Bob Brown and Rayfield Wright, rank Jack among the top players they faced. Opposing quarterbacks ranked Youngblood highly, with two of them, Fran Tarkenton and Roger Staubach, stating that Jack was the top defensive lineman they faced in their careers. [...] Hall of Fame defensive tackle Merlin Olsen paid Youngblood the highest compliment by stating that Jack was the [...] "perfect defensive end". [...] Running backs also entered the chorus, [...] "I remember bouncing off Jack Youngblood {{and it was just}} like a pillar of strength <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the defense," [...] Rocky Bleier recalled. [...] "Jack played hurt, he played tough, and he was a great opponent." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{selected}} them," [...] she nodded, [...] "every one of them, {{and loved}} {{them onto the}} walls myself. Although Dick did quarrel with me over that Vereschagin. He agreed on the two Millets and the Corot <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> and <b>on</b> that Isabey; and even conceded that some Vereschagins might do in a music room, but not that particular Vereschagin. He's jealous for our local artists, you see. He wanted more of them, wanted to show his appreciation of home talent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will {{stroll on}} to St. Denis and back with Jeanne and Virginie; Madame Moulin {{can sit down}} <b>on</b> that log <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> and go <b>on</b> with her knitting; you, Victor, can ramble on with mademoiselle by that path through the field; we will agree to meet here again in an hour." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{a totally}} {{different}} world," [...] Adams explained to his wife. [...] "It is colder and stormier <b>over</b> <b>there.</b> The forest <b>on</b> the north slopes is full of down-timber and the cliffs are stupendous. I wish you girls {{were back in the}} settlement," [...] and in this wish Ward heartily joined.|$|R

The fleet which brought the troops <b>over</b> landed <b>there</b> <b>on</b> a cape a little to the westward of the region shown upon the map. From the place where they landed they marched across the country, as seen by the track upon the map, toward the Seine. They took possession of the towns on the way, and plundered and wasted the country.|$|R

I went <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> sailing <b>on</b> the 7 th of Apri l last, I think. I was not <b>over</b> <b>there</b> prior to that.

5000|$|In the nonreduction type, {{unlike the}} other three, the shared noun occurs as a {{full-fledged}} noun phrase in the embedded clause, which has {{the form of a}} full independent clause. Typically, it is the head noun in the main clause that is reduced or missing. Some languages use relative clauses of this type with the normal strategy of embedding the relative clause next to the head noun. These languages are said to have internally headed relative clauses, which would be similar to the (ungrammatical) English structure [...] "see the girl <b>over</b> <b>there</b> is my friend" [...] or [...] "I took see the girl <b>over</b> <b>there</b> out <b>on</b> a date". This is used, for example, in Navajo, which uses a special relative verb (as with some other Native American languages).|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you do, do you? Comin' to {{your senses}} a little. Gettin' tired walkin' so much. I {{should like to}} know what your gentlemen <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the East Side think about the strike, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, at this time, heigh! And I {{suppose they}} think <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the East Side that it 'd been wise to strike {{before we got}} the Elevated." [...] Conrad again refused to answer, and his father roared, [...] "What do you think?" ...|$|E

5000|$|John Paul Young {{said of the}} recording, [...] "We {{actually}} did 'Love Is in the Air' because we needed something for the German market. 'Standing in the Rain' became a hit in the clubs <b>over</b> <b>there</b> and then <b>on</b> the charts, so we needed a follow-up. I'd been to Germany and heard the music. It was electronic mania, all clicks and electronic buzzes. So George and Harry gave it the treatment." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ramon Dekkers fought some of {{the best}} fighters Thailand had to offer. Especially in the {{beginning}} it was hard for Dekkers to fight at full Thai rules. The scoring methods were different than he was used to in Europe. [...] "In Thailand {{it is very difficult to}} win other than by knocking your opponent out. It has happened to me in many of my fights that I have lost on [...] "points" [...] while fighting in Thailand. It's normal <b>over</b> <b>there</b> losing <b>on</b> points but it can be very frustrating.", Dekkers stated in an interview in 1993. Dekkers also blamed some of his losses to his many injuries. Despite his defeats the Thai fight fans had a great respect for Dekkers' determination and ability.|$|R
60|$|ASHER. I've been turning {{something}} {{over in my}} mind. And the country looked so fine and fresh I crossed the covered bridge {{to the other side}} of the river. When George was a child I used to go <b>over</b> <b>there</b> with him <b>on</b> summer afternoons. He was such a companionable little shaver--he'd drop his toys when he'd see me coming home from the office. I can see him now, running along that road <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> stopping to pick funny little bouquets--the kind a child makes, you know--ox-eyed daisies and red clover and buttercups all mixed up together, and he'd carry them home and put them in a glass on the desk in my study.|$|R
60|$|And yet, suddenly, I {{recognized}} Hamilton. I {{recognized him}} without effort, without a shock, without a start. There he was, strolling toward the Harbour Office with his stiff, arrogant dignity. His red face made him noticeable at a distance.

6000|$|... "It {{always makes}} me laugh," [...] he said, [...] "whenever I pass this spot. It {{seems to me like}} such an awful good joke.

6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} have," [...] replied Mr. Marcy. [...] "This is Lake Shiver. Don't you see, away <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> {{the other side}} of the open water below us, that little dark spot in the icy wall? That is the frozen polar bear. Take your glass and see if it isn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{speak to}} me. Don't {{recognize}} me," [...] Del cautioned sharply, as he spoke, buttoning his nose-strap across his face, which served to quite hide his identity. [...] "There's a water-hole <b>over</b> <b>there.</b> Get down <b>on</b> your belly {{and make a}} blind at gettin' a drink. Then go on by your lonely to the claims; I've business of my own to handle. And {{for the love of}} your bother don't say a word to me or to the skunk. Don't let 'm see your face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, boy, it's all right. We {{can lose}} a game, and to lose one like that--it's {{as good as}} winnin'. Say! I'm a liar if I didn't see 'em Place hitters turnin' gray-headed! Listen! That game <b>over</b> <b>there</b> was tough <b>on</b> all the kids, you most of all, of course. But you all stood the gaff. You've fought out a grillin' big game away from home. That's over. You'll never go through that again. But it was the makin' of you.... Here, look this over! Mebbe it'll cheer you up." ...|$|R

Matches are played on Saturdays over 18 weeks, usually commencing with the first Saturday in May. These matches, based on a limited overs one-day format, consist of 90 overs, with the side batting first allowed a maximum of 45 <b>overs.</b> <b>There</b> are restrictions <b>on</b> the maximum number of overs any one bowler can bowl.

6000|$|The Glass Cat now {{came back}} to {{their side of the}} river, walking under the water, and said to the Wizard: [...] "They're getting frightened <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the island because they're both growing smaller every minute. Just now, when I left them, both Trot and Cap'n Bill were only about half their natural sizes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be <b>over</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> {{her desk}} by the door, I think," [...] said Kalon, with that massive innocence of manner {{that seemed to}} acquit him wholly.

6000|$|... "That is so, Ralph. There is {{scarcely}} a man, woman, or child {{in this part}} of Dorsetshire who does not know that there are more goods run, on that piece of water <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> than <b>on</b> the whole south coast of England. I sincerely trust that nothing will ever bring about his recall. Personally, I would pay two or three hundred a year, out of my own pocket, rather than lose him. There is no such place anywhere for the work; why, there are some fourteen or fifteen inlets where goods can be landed at high water and, once past the island, I don't care how sharp the revenue men may be, the betting is fifty to one against their being at the right spot at the right time.|$|R
5000|$|Previously, Ryan {{published}} an autobiographical novel called There’s A Man With a Gun <b>Over</b> <b>There</b> based <b>on</b> {{his experiences in}} the US Army as a detective and translator investigating black marketing in Germany during the Vietnam era. In this novel, Ryan, trained as poet and drafted into the military, {{is a kind of}} innocent abroad as he learns the very high price of essentially becoming a fascist for the American Empire and the remnants of Nazi Germany. Nominated by its publisher for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, There’s a Man With a Gun <b>Over</b> <b>There</b> is about what could happen to anyone in the US Army, and a cautionary tale about America’s War Machine. Publisher Martin Shepard describes the author as [...] "the Norman Mailer of this generation." [...] Poet, screenwriter, playwright, and winner of a “Genius” Award from the MacArthur Foundation, Naomi Wallace comments that in reading the novel she is astonished by [...] "the battle of consciousness Ryan has with himself concerning right, wrong, war, lies: all are in continuous flux and deeply alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|He cast a hurried glance {{around the}} room as if he half {{expected}} to see the original start up before him, and then eagerly seized it and hurried with it to the light. Yes! yes! It was SHE,--she as {{she had lived in}} his actual memory; she as she had lived in his dream. He saw her sweet eyes, but the frightened, innocent trouble had passed from them; there was the sensitive elegance of her graceful figure in evening dress; but the figure was fuller and maturer. Could he be mistaken by some wonderful resemblance acting upon his too willing brain? He turned the photograph <b>over.</b> No; <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the other side, written in her own childlike hand, endeared and familiar to his recollection, was her own name, and the date!
