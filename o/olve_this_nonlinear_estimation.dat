40|$|Abstract This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} estimating the intrinsic parameters of the 3 D Velodyne lidar {{while at the same}} time computing its extrinsic calibration with respect to a rigidly connected camera. Existing approaches to solve <b>this</b> <b>nonlinear</b> <b>estimation</b> problem are based on iterative minimization of nonlinear cost functions. In such cases, the accuracy of the resulting solution hinges on the availability of a precise initial estimate, which is often not available. In order to address this issue, we divide the problem into two least-squares sub-problems, and analytically solve each one to determine a precise initial estimate for the unknown parameters. We further increase the accuracy of these initial estimates by iteratively minimizing a batch nonlinear least-squares cost function. In addition, we provide the minimal observability conditions, under which, it is possible to accurately estimate the unknown parameters. Experimental results consisting of photorealistic 3 D reconstruction of indoor and outdoor scenes are used to assess the validity of our approach. 1 Introduction and Related Work As demonstrated in the DARPA Urban Challenge, commercially available highspee...|$|R

Though {{the theory is}} applicable for any parameterization, we use a model for which objects are approximated by patches of spheres, cylinders, and planes [...] -primitive objects. These primitive surfaces are special cases of 3 -D quadric surfaces. Primitive surface estimation is treated as parameter estimation using data patches in two or more noisy images taken by calibrated cameras in different locations and from different directions. Included {{is the case of}} a single moving camera. Though various techniques can be used to implement <b>this</b> <b>nonlinear</b> <b>estimation,</b> we discuss the use of gradient descent.

It is shown that the estimation procedure can be viewed geometrically as a cross correlation of nonlinearly transformed image patdes in two or more images. Approaches to object surface segmentation into primitive object surfaces, and primitive object-type recognition are briefly presented and discussed. The attractiveness of the approach is that maximum likelihood estimation and all the usual tools of statistical signal analysis can be brought to bear, the information extraction appears to be robust and computationally reasonable, the concepts are geometric and simple, and close to optimal accuracy should result.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} algorithms to fuse relative {{and absolute}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) navigation sensors, suitable for micro planetary rovers, {{to provide a}} more accurate estimation of navigation information, specifically, attitude and position. Planetary rovers have extremely slow speed (~ 1 cm/s) and lack conventional navigation sensors/systems, hence the general methods of terrestrial navigation may not be applicable to these applications. While relative attitude and position can be tracked in a way similar to those for ground robots, absolute navigation information is hard to achieve on a remote celestial body, like Moon or Mars, in contrast to terrestrial applications. In this study, two absolute attitude estimation algorithms were developed and compared for accuracy and robustness.

40|$|Long-range alpha {{detection}} (LRAD) {{has been}} used to measure alpha particles emitting contamination inside decommissioned steel pipes. There exists a complex nonlinear relationship between input parameters and measuring results. The input parameters, for example, pipe diameter, pipe length, distance to radioactive source, radioactive source strength, wind speed, and flux, exhibit different contributions to the measuring results. To reflect these characteristics and estimate alpha radioactivity as exactly as possible, a hybrid partial least square back propagation (PLSBP) neural network approach is presented in this paper. In this model, each node in the input layer is weighted, which indicates that different input nodes have different contributions on the system and this finding has been little reported.

Representative numerical results are discussed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed nonlinear strategy in accurately sensing the applied angular rate.

40|$|A {{recently}} found {{extension of the}} Nijboer-Zernike approach to optical aberrations allows analytic computation of the intensity point-spread function in the focal region of an optical system. Here, the exit pupil function is expanded as a Zernike series, with a complex coefficient of the single aberration, and the contribution {{of each of the}} terms of this series to the complex-amplitude point-spread function U in the focal region has an analytic form. This representation of U, and hence of the intensity point-spread function I = | U | 3 ̆csup 3 ̆e 23 ̆c/sup 3 ̆e, is highly efficient since normally a pupil function is already accurately described by a few ß's. In this paper, the inverse problem of retrieving the ß's from a given intensity I in the focal region is studied. A computation scheme for solving <b>this</b> <b>nonlinear</b> <b>estimation</b> problem, under the assumption of small-to-medium-large aberrations, is proposed. The key step is to linearize the theoretical intensity, comprising the ß's as unknowns, by deleting second-order terms, and to optimize the match between the linearized, theoretical intensity and the given intensity in the focal region. The special case of a small pure-phase aberration pupil function is separately considered. For general pupil functions (also containing amplitude errors) or larger pure-phase aberrations, the linearization error(s) cannot be ignored. By adopting a predictor-corrector approach, the effect of linearization can be eliminated iteratively and this yields accurate or even perfect retrieval of aberrations well beyond the diffraction limit. Although the method was developed for lithographic applications, with numerical apertures = 0. 60 and almost-ideal point sources, it has potential applications to more general light optics settings (microscopy, astronomy, [...] .). The application range of the method is, furthermore, extended in this paper to cover the medium-high numerical aperture range (= 0. 80) and to the case that the lateral size of the illumination source is comparable to the diffraction unit.
