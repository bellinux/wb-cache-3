5000|$|It is {{important}} for vintners {{to distinguish between the}} <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> and its close relatives, the grape and vine mealybug. The <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> has longer, thinner, and more crooked filaments than does the vine mealybug, making the <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> look comparatively untidy. The most distinctive feature of the <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> is the set of two to four exceptionally long caudal filaments growing from the posterior of large nymphs and adult females. The insect's waxy secretion accumulates heavily on these filaments, making it appear to have several long [...] "tails".|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the high}} {{toxicity}} and strict regulation of organophosphate pesticides, some Californian vintners have imported natural parasites of the <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> from Chile, particularly Pseudaphycus flavidulus and Leptomastix epona. Such efforts have so far produced indeterminate results; the <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> is capable of encapsulating and killing the eggs of L. epona and L. dactylopii, for example, rendering those parasites ineffective. On the other hand, significant success in reducing <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> populations has resulted from isolating them from their symbiont ants.|$|E
50|$|The female <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> sex {{pheromone}} has {{the unfortunate}} property of sometimes attracting parasitic wasps (such as Tetracnemoidea peregrina), {{and is therefore}} a kairomone.|$|E
50|$|Male <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybugs</b> do not feed, {{and have}} very short lifespans (2-3 days); males will spin cocoons shortly after hatching, where they develop wings. Upon {{emerging}} from their cocoons, male <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybugs</b> will fly toward {{the scent of}} the female's sex pheromone, mate as many times as possible, then die. Given the male's short lifespan, the timing of the female's emission of sex pheromone is crucial; females will emit the pheromone day and night around the time of male emergence (especially in the spring), then cease immediately after fertilization. <b>Obscure</b> <b>mealybugs</b> generally mate at dusk and at dawn.|$|R
50|$|<b>Obscure</b> <b>mealybugs</b> {{exhibit a}} high degree of sexual dimorphism; females are flightless, larger, and longer-lived than the winged males, who cannot feed and die {{immediately}} after mating.|$|R
5000|$|Being in {{the order}} Hemiptera (so-called [...] "true bugs"), <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybugs</b> undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis; nymphal young closely resemble adults in body shape, take six to nine weeks to mature, and retain the use of all six legs throughout their entire lives. Depending on temperature, <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybugs</b> may complete 2-3 generations per year; females will lay clutches of several hundred orange eggs in cottony sacs, from which nymphs will hatch and emerge after about 5-10 days.

50|$|Pseudococcus viburni (formerly Pseudococcus affinis (Maskell), and {{commonly}} known as the <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> and tuber mealybug) is a close relative of the grape mealybug (P. maritimus) and a pest of the vineyards of New Zealand, the Central Coast of California, and the tea gardens of northern Iran. Unlike the grape mealybug, the <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> is not native to California, having most likely been introduced to the region from either Australia or South America {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to control <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> populations in commercial greenhouses and vineyards, using both synthetic pesticides and introduced mealybug parasites. Since the obscure mealybug's waxy coating and habit of seeking sheltered feeding sites protect it from water-based pesticides, oil-based organophosphate pesticides (among the more toxic of pesticides) are most effective in reducing population density, though such pesticides can harm plants if applied after the first budding. Even so, some New Zealand <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> populations have developed a resistance to organophosphate pesticides.|$|E
50|$|The <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> {{is thought}} to have evolved in Australia or South America. Its history in North America is not clear; from 1900 (when P. maritimus, the grape mealybug, was first described) to 1960, the <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> was variably misidentified as or synonymized with P. maritimus, P. longispinus, P. obscurus Essig, P. capensis Brian, P. malacearum Ferris, and P. affinis (Maskell). This taxonomic {{confusion}} has hampered attempts to trace the exact origin of the species, but its presence in both Australia and South America strongly suggests that it is of Gondwanan origin.|$|E
50|$|Male <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybugs</b> are tiny, fragile insects {{with long}} {{antennae}} {{and a single}} pair of wings. They bear a strong resemblance to common house flies, but have two white wax tail filaments.|$|R
50|$|<b>Obscure</b> <b>mealybugs</b> {{feed on the}} phloem {{of vines}} and woody-stemmed plants, {{especially}} pear and apple trees and grape vines. Some individuals are vectors for infectious pathogens and can transmit them from plant to plant while feeding; mealybug-spread grapevine leafroll associated virus type III (GRLaV-3), in particular, has wreaked havoc among the grapes of New Zealand, reducing the crop yield of infected vineyards by up to 60%.|$|R
50|$|<b>Obscure</b> <b>mealybugs</b> {{lay eggs}} all year long, and during winter, under {{the bark of}} trees and vines (though there is no true dormancy). These {{overwintering}} populations include individual mealybugs from all stages of development, but are dominated by eggs and first instars; overwinter mortality for young nymphs is high, but a few individuals (normally the ones quickest to hatch) will survive and feed on the first spring leaves. Mortality in non-overwintering generations is greatly decreased.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} a pest in North America, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and Iran, {{especially}} in vineyards and fruit orchards. The <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> has caused particularly substantial damage to vineyards in the Central Coast of California, {{where it is}} an introduced species and has no natural predators.|$|E
50|$|The <b>obscure</b> <b>{{mealybug}}</b> {{more closely}} resembles the grape mealybug {{than it does}} the vine mealybug, but the two can be distinguished {{by the color of}} the defensive fluid they secrete when disturbed; grape mealybugs secrete reddish-orange fluid, while obscure mealybugs secrete clear fluid. When crushed, the obscure mealybug's body contents (guts) are pinkish-grey.|$|E
50|$|The {{bodies of}} nymphal and adult female obscure {{mealybugs}} are rectangular, with rounded anterior and posterior ends. Adult females range from 1-5mm in length. Like all mealybugs, the <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> covers its {{body in a}} white, waxy secretion which accumulates in clumps along thin filaments protruding from its exoskeleton. This clumpy secretion lends the mealybug its characteristic mealy appearance.|$|E
50|$|Female {{mealybugs}} excrete honeydew, a thick, sugary fluid {{created as}} a byproduct of digestion (large colonies of mealybugs can produce enough honeydew to seep through bark and leaves, leaving shiny, sticky patches on {{the exterior of the}} plant). Some ants have developed a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybugs,</b> tending and protecting the insects from natural enemies to increase the production of honeydew, on which the ants feed.

40|$|Traps baited {{with sex}} pheromones {{were used to}} monitor field populations of longtailed and <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybugs.</b> Lures loaded with 25 {{microgram}} doses of racemic pheromones remained effective for at least 3 months. Pheromones could also be combined to make lures that attracted several species simultaneously. The numbers of insects caught in traps was correlated with mealybug abundance, indicating that pheromone traps {{can be used in}} place of laborious manual sampling to monitor populations. The efficacy of using pheromone traps to monitor seasonal fluctuations in mealybug popultations was demonstrated. Obscure, vine, and longtailed mealybugs were shown to reproduce only through sexual reproduction. Copulatory behavior for both sexes was stereotypical across all species. Female and male mealybugs were capable of multiple copulations in a single day and over multiple days. Female reproductive output did not increase with multiple copulations. Male longevity and activity levels were minimally affected by constant exposure to pheromone, and males typically lived 4 - 5 days after emergence as adults. This better understanding of mealybug reproductive biology has implications for the use of pheromones for monitoring and control of mealybugs. Several pieces of evidence suggest that the sex pheromone is produced somewhere on the hind pair of legs, probably from translucent pores that are only present on their hind legs of adult females. More males were attracted to body sections of females with the hind pair of legs, and extracts of these legs strongly attracted males. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of the pores on the hind coxae of adult females. Elucidating the site of pheromone production provides the key baseline data required for studies of the biosynthesis of the irregular terpenoids that comprise the sex pheromones of various species...|$|R

FPMS responded by increasing isolation distances and implementing a comprehensive virus screening program using the new methodology. The critical problem was the lack of information on leafroll virus epidemiology. When the distribution of infected plants in the old vineyard was mapped, new infections were frequently adjacent to known diseased grapevines. This study examined the ability of mealybugs, a putative leafroll vector, to transmit this group of viruses.

40|$|The {{absence of}} {{effective}} pest monitoring {{has resulted in}} an increase in populations of the <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> Pseudococcus viburni (Signoret) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) in pome fruit orchards in the Western Cape Province of South Africa recently. The sex pheromone for P. viburni was recently identified and synthesized. Flight activity of adult male P. viburni was monitored by placing and servicing three, evenly spaced pheromone-baited traps per orchard in three pome fruit growing regions used for the study. Fortnightly fruit sampling was done by randomly picking three fruits per tree for the duration of each fruit season, dissecting and noting mealybug infestation. The biweekly male P. viburni trap catch information and fruit infestation data collected over two seasons were correlated. There was a positive and significant relationship between the fruit infestation and number of P. viburni adult males caught in pheromone-baited traps (r 2 = 0. 454, P < 0. 001). The action threshold level was estimated to be 2. 5 male P. viburni caught per trap per fortnight at an economic threshold of 2 % fruit infestation.

40|$|Thesis (MScConsEcol (Conservation Ecology and Entomology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Pseudococcus viburni (Signoret) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) (<b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug),</b> is {{a common}} and serious pest of apples and pears in South Africa. Consumer and {{regulatory}} pressure to produce commodities under sustainable and ecologically compatible conditions has rendered chemical control options increasingly limited. Information on the seasonal occurrence of pests {{is but one of}} the vital components of an effective and sustainable integrated pest management system needed for planning the initiation of monitoring and determining when damage can be expected. It is also important to identify which orchards are at risk of developing mealybug infestations while development of effective and early monitoring tools for mealybug populations will help growers in making decisions with regards to pest management and crop suitability for various markets. It is also essential to determine the presence and efficacy of naturally occurring biological control agents in orchards so as to ascertain the potential of biological control as a viable alternative in orchards. However, under the current integrated pest management protocol, it has been difficult to determine this, due to the sporadic and relatively low incidence of mealybug infestations in some orchards, or by simply relying on naturally occurring field populations of biocontrol agents. Knowledge of the environmental conditions under which P. viburni population levels may become destructive is also essential for timing the release of insectary reared natural enemies as well as understanding the population ecology of this pest and its natural enemies. Information was gathered regarding the seasonal phenology of P. viburni and its natural enemies in pome fruit orchards in the Western Cape Province during the 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09 growing seasons. Seasonal population studies showed that P. viburni has multiple overlapping generations with all life stages present throughout the year. The highest orchard infestations occurred during the summer period until early winter (January to early June). This was followed by a decrease in population from late June to November, before another increase in December. Presence-absence sampling of mealybugs on the host plant revealed that woody parts of the tree, such as the trunk and old stems were the most preferred sites for mealybug habitation, due to the availability of protected refuge sites. Migration of mealybug populations to newer growth and the upper sections of the tree crown, such as the new stems, leaves and eventually the fruit, was observed from December throughout the summer period until the early winter in June. Fruit colonization in both apples and pears commenced in January, when the fruit had developed a size sufficient for P. viburni to penetrate and occupy spaces such as the fruit core, calyx and stem end. There was no evidence of P. viburni occurring beneath the soil surface or on the roots of host trees. Two natural enemies of mealybugs, namely Pseudaphycus maculipennis (Mercet) and Coccidoxenoides perminutus (Girault), were found to be active in apple and pear orchards in the Western Cape. However, the status of C. perminutus as a parasite of P. viburni still needs to be verified despite evidence of emergence from P. viburni mummies, which was not sufficient enough to suggest that it is a useful biological control agent. Seasonal abundance trends of the two natural enemies revealed that their lifecycle is synchronized with that of the host. However, {{there was no evidence of}} P. maculipennis activity in Ceres. No predators were found during the course of this study. The rate of P. viburni parasitism at harvest was 46. 52 %, with P. maculipennis and C. perminutus constituting 98. 966 % and 1. 034 % of the parasitoids recovered from mealybug mummies, respectively. Studies on the use of pheromone traps as early monitoring tools for P. viburni showed that there was a positive and significant relationship between the fruit infestation and number of P. viburni adult males caught in pheromone-baited traps (r 2 = 0. 454). The action threshold level was estimated to be 2. 5 male P. viburni caught per trap per fortnight at an economic threshold of 2 % fruit infestation. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Pseudococcus viburni (Signoret) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) (ligrooswitluis), is ‘n algemene en ernstige plaag van appels en pere in Suid-Afrika. Druk deur verbruikers en regulasies om kommoditeite onder volhoubare en ekologies verenigbare toestande te produseer het chemiese beheeropsies toenemend beperk. Inligting oor die seisoenale voorkoms van plae is een van die essensiële komponente van ‘n effektiewe en volhoubare geïntegreerde plaagbestuurprogram. Dit is in die aanvanklike beplanning van monitering en om te bepaal wanneer skade verwag kan word. Dit is ook belangrik om boorde vroegtydig te identifiseer wat die risiko het om witluisbesmettings te ontwikkel. Die ontwikkeling van effektiewe en vroeë moniteringstegnieke vir witluisbevolkings sal produsente help met besluitneming rakende plaagbestuur en die geskiktheid van gewasse vir verskeie markte. Dit is ook noodsaaklik om die teenwoordigheid en effektiwiteit van biologiese beheer agente wat natuurlik in boorde voorkom te bepaal ten einde die potensiaal van biologiese beheer as ‘n lewensvatbare alternatief vas te stel. Onder die huidige geïntegreerde plaagbestuurprotokol was dit egter moeilik om laasgenoemde te bepaal weens die sporadiese en relatiewe lae voorkoms van witluisbesmettings in sommige boorde of deur bloot staat te maak op die veldpopulasies van biologiese beheer agente wat natuurlik voorkom. Kennis van die omgewingstoestande waaronder P. viburni bevolkingsvlakke skadelik raak is ook noodsaaklik vir die beplanning van vrylating van biologiese beheer agente, asook om die bevolkingsekologie van hierdie plaag en sy natuurlike vyande te verstaan. Inligting oor die seisoenale fenologie van P. viburni en sy natuurlike vyande in sagtevrugte boorde in die Westelike Kaapprovinsie is gedurende die 2007 / 08 en 2008 / 09 groeiseisoene versamel.

Producers rely heavily on chemicals that cause increased risk to health, the environment and ecology, rapid resistance development in key insect pests and pesticide residues on crops. The increased concern regarding the impact of these pest management practices on the environment and alternative pest management strategies are being investigated. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) have been identified as being promising biological control agents of key insect pests. The two EPN genera that have shown promise for use as biological control agents within an integrated pest management programme areSteinernema and Heterorhabditis. Commercialisation and the successful use of EPNs to control pests in North America, Australia, Europe and Asia have confirmed the effectiveness of these organisms as biological control agents. Unfortunately, EPNs in large enough numbers for commercial field applications are not yet available on the South African market. Large numbers of EPNs can be produced through either in vivo or in vitro culturing practices. The objective {{of this study was to}} streamline the in vivo production process by using two endemic EPN species, Heterorhabditis zealandica (SF 41) and H. bacteriophora (SF 351). These EPN isolates have been shown to be effective control agents of codling moth Cydia pomonella, false codling moth Thaumatotibia leucotreta, <b>obscure</b> <b>mealybug</b> Pseudococcus viburni, and the banded fruit weevil Phlyctinus callosus. A comparative study was conducted to identify suitable host insects for EPN production of local H. zealandica (SF 41) and H. bacteriophora (SF 351) strains. Hosts were selected according to their susceptibility to the two EPN species used, their general availability and the ease and cost of rearing. Wax moth larvae Galleria mellonella (WML) and mealworms Tenebrio molitor (MW) were selected as hosts. In order to produce nematodes of consistent quality, a continuous source of host insects reared on a standardised diet was required. WML and MW were each reared on five different diets in the dark at ± 26 °C. A superior diet for each host was selected according to the diet that produced, on average, the larvae with the highest body mass within a specific timeframe. The heaviest WML, at an average weight of 0. 19 g per larva, were produced on a diet consisting of 118 g wheat flour, 206 g wheat bran, 118 g milk powder, 88 g brewer‟s yeast, 24 g wax powder, 175 ml honey and 175 ml glycerol. The heaviest MW larvae weighed, on average, 0. 0154 g per larva, and were produced on a diet consisting of 100 % wheat bran. To confirm the hypothesis that a linear relationship exists between the weight of a host and the number of nematodes produced from that host, a study was conducted to determine the number of H. zealandica and H. bacteriophora produced per g of host. WML, MW, codling moth larvae and false codling moth larvae were weighed individually and inoculated with the two nematode species respectively. In addition, nematode production in frozen MW and WML was tested. The number of nematodes harvested from each host was counted, and the average number of nematode progeny produced in each host was calculated. A significant linear correlation between the weight of WML and MW and the number of H. zealandica and H. bacteriophora respectively produced confirmed the hypothesis that nematode production within the specified host increases with an increase in host weight. WML produced the highest number of H. zealandica and H. bacteriophora per g of host (1 459 205 ± 113 670 and 1 898 512 ± 94 355), followed by MW larvae (836 690 ± 121 252 and 414 566 ± 67 017). Lower numbers of H. zealandica and H. bacteriophora per g codling moth (57 582 ± 10 026 and 39 653 ± 8 276) and per g false codling moth (192 867 ± 13 488 and 97 652 ± 23 404) were produced. Successful infection of a suitable insect host is one of the key factors in an efficient in vivo nematode production process. Three inoculation techniques were compared using H. zealandica and H. bacteriophora: inoculation with a pipette; shaking of hosts in the nematode inoculum; and immersion of hosts in the nematode suspension. With each inoculation technique, WML and MW were used as host larvae and were inoculated with nematodes at a concentration of 200 infective juveniles (IJs) / larva. The percentage mortality of insect hosts was determined after two days, and EPN infectivity, confirmed by colour change and dissection, after seven days. The highest percentage EPN infection was obtained using pipetting for both nematode isolates and hosts. Nematode infection rates for all nematode-host combinations obtained with pipetting were above 90 %, with the exception of MW inoculation with H. bacteriophora, where the percentage of infection obtained was 76 %. The current study conclusively demonstrated that variations in infection levels occur, depending on the inoculation technique used. In an additional effort to enhance infectivity during inoculation, H. zealandica, H. bacteriophora and MW were subjected to host-stressor regimes and to nematode- infectivity-enhancing additives. Three treatments, plus a control treatment, were compared. Exposing MW to 70 °C tap water prior to inoculation did not increase infection levels. On the contrary, reduced infection levels were observed with host immersion in 70 °C tap water followed by inoculation with H. bacteriophora, compared to the control. Only 12 % infection was obtained compared to the 48 % infection achieved in the control. Infection obtained using H. zealandica was 21 %. Treating H. zealandica and H. bacteriophora IJs withMn 2 +SO 4. H 20 in a suspension, prior to inoculating MW, did not significantly enhance nematode virulence. Inoculation of MW with treated H. zealandica IJs led to an infection rate of 81 %, compared to the control, with which 80 % infection rate was obtained. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora caused 47 % MW infection, compared to the control, which was subject to 48 % infection. A combination of the two above-mentioned treatments did not enhance the infection levels either. Immersing MW into 70 °C tap water prior to inoculation with nematodes treated with Mn 2 +SO 4. H 20 led to infection levels of 13 % and 9 % respectively when H. bacteriophora and H. zealandica were used. Future research is required to optimise the protocol used in this study of subjecting MW and local nematode isolates to stressor regimes. The ability of two formulations to maintain biological activity and virulence of H. zealandica was investigated. A quality standard control measure was used to measure the percentage survival and virulence of formulated H. zealandica over a period of 21 days. IJs were formulated into Pesta granules and coconut fibres, while nematodes stored in tap water served as the control. The numbers of live H. zealandica in Pesta granules and coconut fibres decreased drastically after seven days of storage. The survival of nematodes in Pesta granules dropped to 9. 79 % after 21 days compared to the control, where the survival rate was 79. 79 %. Nematode survival in coconut fibres was even lower, at 25. 84 % after seven days and 2. 25 % after 21 days. After 21 days in storage, 100 %+of nematodes survived in the control for coconut fibres. The application of the standard quality control measure, which was used to determine the virulence of formulated H. zealandica, proved to be ineffective. Higher MW mortality rates were obtained in the control where no nematodes were added to larvae, compared to where nematodes were added in varying dosages. However, adjusting certain aspects in the protocol of this quality control measure specifically to accommodate local conditions could possibly make it a more effective tool for measuring endemic nematode virulence. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die landboubedryf in Suid-Afrika word oorheers deur die gebruik van insekdoders. Vervaardigers steun swaar op chemikalieë wat toenemend gesondheids-, omgewings- en ekologiese risiko's, asook die snelle ontwikkeling van weerstand in sleutelinsekteplae veroorsaak, en wat reste van plaagdoders op gewasse laat. Na aanleiding van toenemende besorgdheid oor die impak van hierdie plaagbestuurspraktyke op die omgewing, word alternatiewe plaagbestuurstrategieë ondersoek. Entomopatogeniese nematodes (EPNs) is geïdentifiseer as belowende biologiese beheeragente van sleutelinsekteplae. Die twee EPN genera wat belofte inhou vir gebruik as biologiese beheeragente binne 'n geïntegreerde plaagbestuursprogram is Steinernema en Heterorhabditis. Kommersialisering en die geslaagde gebruik van EPNs om insekplae te beheer in Noord-Amerika, Australië, Europa en Asië, het die doeltreffendheid van hierdie organismes as biologiese beheeragente bevestig. Ongelukkig is EPNs in groot genoeg getalle vir kommersiële aanwending in die veld nog nie op die Suid-Afrikaanse mark beskikbaar nie. Groot getalle EPNs kan deur in vivo en in vitro teling verkry word. Die doelwit van hierdie studie was om die in vivo produksieproses te stroomlyn deur die gebruik van twee endemiese EPN spesies, Heterorhabditis zealandica (SF 41) en H. bacteriophora (SF 351). Hierdie EPN isolate is deur navorsing bewys om doeltreffende beheeragente van kodlingmot Cydia pomonella, vals kodlingmot Thaumatotibia leucotreta, ligrooswitluis Pseudococcus viburni, en gebande vrugtekalanders Phlyctinus callosus te wees. 'n Vergelykende studie is gedoen om geskikte gasheerinsekte vir EPN produksie van plaaslike H. zealandica (SF 41) en H. bacteriophora (SF 351) isolate te vind. Gashere is geselekteer op grond van vatbaarheid vir die EPN spesie wat gebruik word, en algemene beskikbaarheid en gemak en koste van teling. Wasmotlarwes Galleria mellonella (WML) en meelwurms Tenebrio molitor (MW) is as gashere gekies. Ten einde nematodes van konsekwente kwaliteit te teel, word 'n deurlopende bron van gasheerinsekte benodig wat op 'n gestandaardiseerde dieet voed. WML en MW is onderskeidelik op vyf verskillende diëte geteel by ± 26 °C in die donker. Die beste dieet vir elke gasheer is gekies op grond van die dieet wat, gemiddeld, die swaarste larwes binne 'n spesifieke tydsraamwerk opgelewer het. Die swaarste WML, teen 'n gemiddelde massa van 0. 19 g per larwe, is geteel op 'n dieet wat bestaan het uit 118 g koringmeel, 206 g semels, 118 g melkpoeier, 88 g brouersgis, 24 g verpoeierde was, 175 ml heuning en 175 ml gliserol. Die swaarste MW larwes het gemiddeld 0. 0154 g per larwe geweeg en is geteel op 'n dieet van 100 % semels. Ten einde die hipotese te bevestig dat 'n lineêre verwantskap bestaan tussen die massa van 'n insekgasheer en die aantal nematodes wat deur daardie gasheer geproduseer word, is 'n studie gedoen om die aantal H. zealandica en H. bacteriophora per gasheergram te bepaal. WML, MW, kodlingmotlarwes en vals kodlingmotlarwes is individueel geweeg en met infektiewe larwes van die twee onderskeidelike EPN spesies geïnokuleer. Daarbenewens is die vermeerdering van nematodes in bevrore MW en WML ook getoets. Die aantal nematodes wat in elke gasheer geoes is, is getel, en die gemiddelde nematode-afstammelinge in elke gasheer bereken. 'n Beduidende lineêre korrelasie tussen die massa van WML en MW en die aantal H. zealandica en H. bacteriophora wat onderskeidelik geproduseer is, het die hipotese bevestig dat nematode-vermeerdering binne hierdie gashere toeneem namate die gasheermassa toeneem. WML het die meeste H. zealandica en H. bacteriophera per gasheergram opgelewer (1 459 205 ± 113 670 en 1 898 512 ± 94 355 onderskeidelik), gevolg deur MW larwes (836 690 ± 121 252 en 414 566 ± 67 017 onderskeidelik). Laer getalle H. zealandica and H. bacteriophora per gram kodlingmot (57 582 ± 10 026 en 39 653 ± 8 276) en per gram vals kodlingmot (192 867 ± 13 488 en 97 652 ± 23 404) is egter geproduseer. Een van die sleutelfaktore vir die doeltreffendheid van die in vivo vermeerdering van nematodes is geslaagde gasheerinfeksie. Drie inokulasietegnieke is dus geëvalueer en vergelyk deur H. zealandica en H. bacteriophora te gebruik: inokulasie met 'n pipet, skud van gashere in 'n nematode-inokulum, en gasheerindompeling in 'n nematode-suspensie. WML en MW is as gashere gebruik vir elke inokulasietegniek, en is geïnokuleer met nematodes wat uit 'n konsentrasie van 200 infektiewe larwes (ILs) / insek larwe bestaan het. Die persentasie dooie insekgashere is na twee dae bepaal, en infeksie soos bevestig deur kleurverandering en disseksie, na sewe dae. Die hoogste persentasie infeksie deur sowel nematode-isolate as gashere te gebruik, was met die pipet-tegniek. Die infeksiekoerse vir alle nematode-gasheerkombinasies met die pipet-tegniek was hoër as 90 %, met die uitsondering van MW-inokulasie met H. bacteriophora, waar die infeksie 76 % was. Hierdie studie toon dat afwykings voorkom in die mate van gasheerinfeksie, na gelang van die inokulasietegniek wat gebruik is. In 'n bykomende poging om infeksie na inokulasie te verhoog, is H. zealandica, H. bacteriophora en MW onderwerp aan stressors en bymiddels om nematode-infeksie te bevorder. Drie behandelings, asook 'n kontrole-behandeling, is vergelyk. Infeksievlakke het nie verhoog deur MW voor inokulasie aan kraanwater van 70 °C bloot te stel nie. Inteendeel, laer infeksievlakke is opgemerk waar gashere in kraanwater van 70 °C gedompel is en daarna met H. bacteriophora geïnokuleer is, vergelyke met die kontrole. Gasheerinfeksie van slegs 12 % is verkry, vergelyke met 48 % in die kontrole. Infeksie van 21 % is met H. zealandica verkry. Die virulensie van nematodes het nie beduidend toegeneem deur H. zealandica en H. bacteriophora IL in 'n suspensie met Mn 2 +SO 4 H 20 te behandel voor MW geïnokuleer is nie. Inokulasie van MW met behandelde H. zealandica IL het tot 'n infeksie van 81 % gelei, vergelyke met die kontrole waar 'n infeksie van 80 % behaal is. H. bacteriophora het 'n MW-infeksie van 47 % veroorsaak, vergelyke met die kontrole se infeksiekoers van 48 %. 'n Kombinasie van die twee bogenoemde behandelings het eweneens nie gasheerinfeksievlakke verhoog nie. Die indompeling van meelwurms in kraanwater van 70 °C voor inokulasie met nematodes wat met Mn 2 +SO 4 H 20 behandel is, het tot gasheerinfeksie van 13 % en 9 % onderskeidelik gelei wanneer H. bacteriophora en H. zealandica gebruik is. Toekomstige navorsing is nodig om die protokol te verbeter wat in hierdie studie gebruik is om MW en plaaslike nematode-isolate aan stressors te onderwerp. 'n Ondersoek is gedoen na die vermoë van twee formulasies om biologiese aktiwiteit en virulensie van H. zealandica te onderhou. 'n Kwaliteitsstandaardtegniekis gebruik om weekliks die persentasie oorlewing en virulensie van geformuleerde H. zealandica oor 'n tydperk van 21 dae te meet. IL is in Pesta korrels en klappervesel geformuleer, terwyl nematodes in kraanwater gedien het as kontrole. Die aantal lewende H. zealandica in Pesta korrels en klappervesel het drasties verminder na sewe dae in die formulasie. Oorlewing van nematodes in Pesta korrels het gedaal tot 9. 79 % na 21 dae vergyleke met die kontrole, waar 79. 79 % oorleef het. Nog minder nematodes - 25. 84 % - het na sewe dae in die klappervesel oorleef, en slegs 2. 25 % na 21 dae. Na 21 dae van berging het 100 %+ van nematodes oorleef in die kontrole vir klappervesel. Die toepassing van die kwaliteitsstandaardtegniek om die virulensie van geformuleerde H. zealandica te bepaal, het ondoeltreffend geblyk. Verhoogde MW sterftesyfers is verkry in die kontrole waar geen nematodes by die inseklarwes gevoeg is nie, vergelyke met die byvoeging van hoër dosisse nematodes. Nietemin, die aanpassing van sekere aspekte in die protokol van hierdie kwaliteitsbeheermeting om spesifiek plaaslike toestande in ag te neem, sou dit moontlik 'n meer doeltreffende middel kon maak om die virulensie van endemiese nematodes te bepaal...|$|E
