5|$|P.N.03 was {{developed}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> schedule {{in an attempt}} to offset Capcom's poor fiscal year. However, the game received mixed reviews and failed commercially. Several critics found the game repetitive and unintuitive. They were divided on its gameplay mechanics: some disliked its controls—specifically the inability to move and shoot simultaneously—while others compared it favorably to golden age arcade games. Mikami repurposed ideas from P.N.03 in his 2010 game Vanquish.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{groundbreaking}} {{was held}} on October 27, 1938, near Carlisle; Commission Chairman Walter A. Jones thrust the first shovel into the earth. Turnpike construction was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> schedule, since completion of the road was originally planned by May 1, 1940. After the groundbreaking, contracts for finishing the former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels, grading the turnpike's right-of-way, constructing bridges and paving were awarded. By July 1939, {{the entire length of}} the turnpike was under contract.|$|E

5|$|The film, {{independently}} {{produced and}} financed by Hitchcock, {{was shot at}} Revue Studios, the same location as his television show. Psycho was shot <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> budget of $807,000, beginning on November 11, 1959, and ending on February 1, 1960. Filming started {{in the morning and}} finished by sixp.m. or earlier on Thursdays (when Hitchcock and his wife would dine at Chasen's). Nearly the whole film was shot with 50mm lenses on 35mm cameras. This trick closely mimicked normal human vision, which helped to further involve the audience.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} The Walt Disney Company's 1937 feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs profoundly {{influenced}} many Japanese animators. In the 1960s, manga artist and animator Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified many Disney animation techniques {{to reduce costs}} and {{to limit the number}} of frames in productions. He intended this as a temporary measure to allow him to produce material <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> schedule with inexperienced animation staff. Three Tales, aired in 1960, was the first anime shown on television. The first anime television series was Otogi Manga Calendar, aired from 1961 to 1964.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} after the line's construction, {{increased}} subway ridership led to longer trains, and thus longer platforms, in the 1940s and early 1950s. The City Hall station, built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> curve, {{would have been difficult}} to lengthen, and it was also quite close to the far busier Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall station. In addition, the new, longer trains had center doors in each car, which were an unsafe distance from the platform edge. Movable platform extensions were installed to fill the gap similar to the ones at the South Ferry, Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall (which no longer has gap fillers), Times Square, and 14th Street–Union Square stations, which had a similar problem.|$|E
25|$|It also re-established Sakuraba's {{proficiency}} {{in dealing with}} larger opponents and placed him back in line for another shot at Wanderlei Silva in Pride's next event, this time to decide Pride's inaugural 205-pound champion. Usually prone to humorous entrances, it was a somber and focused Sakuraba that came down the aisle for his rematch with Silva. As with Jackson, Sakuraba was able to score an early takedown in the bout, where he then worked from Silva's guard. After several minutes searching for an opening, he finally found one when Silva attempted to escape to his feet. Sakuraba locked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> guillotine choke, but was countered by a slam from Wanderlei which ended up breaking his collar bone. Not willing {{to let him go}} on so hampered, his corner threw in the towel between rounds.|$|E
25|$|In round 13, Franklin {{effectively}} dragged Hawthorn {{over the}} line for a win against their arch-rival in Essendon. He kicked five goals for the match, but his last two were the standouts - the final one in particular, a goal from the boundary line <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> angle after having run from half-back, which was later chosen as Goal of the Year. Franklin kicked five goals in Round 17 against St Kilda after returning from an ankle injury; despite his performance, the Saints forced a draw during the final seconds of the match. In round 22, Franklin kicked six goals against Collingwood, helping the Hawks clinch a three-point come-from-behind victory against the eventual premiers. It {{was the first time}} that he had kicked more than five goals since 2008. Frankin was named as centre half-forward in the 2010 All-Australian team, his second selection.|$|E

5000|$|Since the Deitch/Snyder {{team had}} seen {{only a handful}} of the {{original}} Tom and Jerry shorts, and since the team produced their cartoons <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tighter</b> budget of $10,000, the resulting films were considered surrealist in nature, though this was not Deitch's intention. The animation was limited and jerky in movement, compared to the more fluid Hanna-Barbera shorts. Background art was done in a more simplistic, angular, Art Deco-esque style. The soundtracks featured sparse and echoic electronic music, futuristic sound effects, heavy reverb, and dialogue that was mumbled rather than spoken. According to Jen Nessel of The New York Times, [...] "The Czech style had nothing in common with these gag-driven cartoons." ...|$|R
50|$|The Commonwealth Film Festival {{started in}} June 2002 {{as a project}} of the Spirit of Friendship Festival in {{conjunction}} with the Commonwealth Games in Manchester. Its opening night featured Arjun Sajnani’s ‘Agni Vasha’, and overall the festival screened over 100 features and 275 short films. The second edition focussed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tighter</b> programme and thus helped the festival develop an international reputation for its intelligent programming and good hospitality. Delegate networking and public access were further developed whilst maintaining the informal and friendly atmosphere of the festival. It rapidly established itself as an annual landmark event dedicated to the worldwide promotion of Commonwealth-produced film culture. The Commonwealth Film Festival held its last edition in 2006.|$|R
25|$|The {{success of}} Mortal Kombat gave Anderson free rein to choose his next project, the science fiction action film Soldier, written by Blade Runner screenwriter David Peoples. Peoples' script - and {{eventually}} the film itself - contains references to his work on Blade Runner, and can {{be considered to be}} taking place in the same universe, as a sidequel or standalone sequel of sorts. Kurt Russell became attached to star, but decided to take some time off to build up his body, as required by the role, which delayed the production. In the meantime, Anderson directed the 1997 science fiction horror film Event Horizon, which was written by Philip Eisner and stars Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill. Despite attaining praise about its visuals and production design, the film wasn't received well by critics, or audiences (D+ on a Cinemascore poll), and failed to break even, which Anderson blamed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> post-production schedule and studio-enforced cuts. Event Horizon later sold well on home video and gained a small cult following. Plans to complete a director's cut that would restore the deleted footage came to a stop when it was discovered most of it had been lost or degraded. Soldier was eventually completed and released in 1998, but was an exceptionally big critical and commercial disaster, making below $15 million in the US, on a budget of $60 million, and releasing straight-to-video in several other markets. Anderson has expressed his regret about the planned shoot on locations being changed to studio soundstages when the El Niño hurricane swooped in, which ended up compromising the film's look. He also verbalized his disappointment with Warner Bros., who, he believes, tried to market the film to the same male teen audience as Mortal Kombat, rather than grown-up audiences, which would include women.|$|E
500|$|Hard Target had 74 days of {{production}} {{time and was}} shot on location in New Orleans, including sequences shot in the French Quarter.

2500|$|In {{its final}} year of 1978, the Gremlin {{received}} a number of changes, but customers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tighter</b> budget could still get a standard six-cylinder base model Gremlin for under US$3,400. A new [...] "Custom" [...] model featured either the four- or six-cylinder engine with a standard four-speed manual transmission and new vinyl bucket seats, wheel lip moldings, and other trim upgrades. Inside the Gremlin there was a revised instrument panel borrowed from the then-new 1978 Concord. The dashboard had high-level ventilation HVAC, radio switchgear within easier reach, and a flat, full-width top. The X's tape striping pattern was revised to match the 1978 Concord Sport package design, with the stripe at the lower body side and curving over the wheel lip.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} set membership identification algorithm by zonotopes {{is proposed}} for time-varying parameterized discretetime systems. The system noises {{are assumed to}} be unknown but bounded (UBB). The improved algorithm based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tighter</b> description of the intersection of a zonotope and a strip can give a smaller zonotope containing the parameters consistent with measured outputs and the given bounds of the noises. Simulation experiments are conducted showing the performance of the improved algorithm as compared to the original algorithm and the recursive optimal bounding parallelotope (ROBP) algorithm. Two types of parameter variation, uniformly distributed and uniformly heavy tailed parameter variations, are considered. The results show that the improved algorithm is the best in terms of the guaranteed bounds of the parameters...|$|R
