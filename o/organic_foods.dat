40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to understand how Chinese consumers perceive certified <b>organic</b> <b>food,</b> especially the differences between locally and nationally produced <b>organic</b> <b>food</b> compared to food produced overseas. In 2012, a consumer survey was conducted at supermarkets in Hong Kong and Shanghai (N= 245). Participants were asked for their perception on four different food origins: locally produced <b>organic</b> <b>food,</b> <b>organic</b> <b>food</b> from China, imported <b>organic</b> <b>food,</b> and locally produced conventional food. Consumers in Hong Kong had a positive attitude towards local <b>organic</b> <b>food</b> and imported <b>organic</b> <b>food.</b> However, they were sceptical about <b>organic</b> <b>food</b> from China, in particular regarding chemical residues and the trustworthiness of producers. Consumers in Shanghai, in contrast, had a positive attitude towards all three tested geographical origins of <b>organic</b> <b>food.</b> Overall, the results suggest that it is challenging for marketers to promote and boost the sales of China-produced <b>organic</b> <b>food</b> in China. Better communication is essential to convince consumers that <b>organic</b> <b>food</b> from China is of similar quality as <b>organic</b> <b>food</b> produced elsewhere...|$|R

2500|$|Distinct lifestyles, {{consumption}} patterns and values {{are associated with}} different classes. Early sociologist-economist Thorstein Veblen, for example, noted that those {{at the very top}} of the social ladder engage in conspicuous leisure as well as conspicuous consumption. Upper-middle-class persons commonly identify education and being cultured as prime values. Persons in this particular social class tend to speak in a more direct manner that projects authority, knowledge and thus credibility. They often tend to engage in the consumption of so-called mass luxuries, such as designer label clothing. A strong preference for natural materials and <b>organic</b> <b>foods</b> as well as a strong health consciousness tend to be prominent features of the upper middle class. Middle-class individuals in general value expanding one's horizon, partially because they are more educated and can afford greater leisure and travels.
