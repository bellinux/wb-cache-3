40|$|Background: Ethylene {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the regulation of floral organ development in soybean, and 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate synthase (ACS) is a rate-limiting enzyme for ethylene biosynthesis. However, whether ACS also regulates floral <b>organ</b> <b>differentiation</b> in soybean remains unknown. To address this, we constructed an RNAi vector to inhibit ACS expression in cotyledonary nodes. Linear DNA cassettes of RNAi-ACS obtained by PCR were used to transform soybean cotyledonary nodes. Results: In total, 131 of 139 transiently transformed plants acquired herbicide resistance and displayed GUS activities in the new buds. In comparison to untransformed seedling controls, a greater number of flower buds were differentiated at the cotyledonary node; GM-ACS 1 mRNA expression levels and ethylene emission in the transformed buds were reduced. Conclusion: These results indicate that the cotyledonary node transient transformation system may be suitable for stable transformation and that the inhibition of ACS expression may be an effective strategy for promoting floral <b>organ</b> <b>differentiation</b> in soybean...|$|E

40|$|Exposure to xenoestrogens during {{development}} {{has been shown to}} impair sexual differentiation in various species. The major aim of this thesis was to elucidate the respective roles of the two estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ in normal and disrupted differentiation of sex organs and copulatory behavior in the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). The expression of ERα mRNA was much stronger than that of ERβ mRNA in the gonads and Müllerian ducts (embryonic oviducts) in early embryos. By contrast, ERβ seemed to be predominantly expressed in regions of the embryonic brain that are associated with male sexual behavior. Embryos were exposed to the selective ERα agonists propyl-pyrazole-triol (PPT) and 16 α-lactone-estradiol (16 α-LE 2). The estrogens 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and 17 α-ethynylestradiol (EE 2), which activate both ERα and ERβ, were used as positive controls. All substances impaired reproductive <b>organ</b> <b>differentiation.</b> The effects observed included oviductal malformations in females and partial development of oviducts in males. All substances also induced testis feminization (ovotestis) in male embryos. The male copulatory behavior was severely impaired by the positive controls but was unaffected by PPT and 16 α-LE 2 at doses that disrupted sex <b>organ</b> <b>differentiation.</b> A higher dose of 16 α-LE 2 significantly suppressed the behavior. However, it is possible that this effect was caused by cross-activation of ERβ. The substances also induced hepatic expression of mRNA encoding the egg-yolk proteins vitellogenin II and very low-density apolipoprotein II, which are commonly used as indicators of estrogen exposure. In conclusion, the results suggest that ERα is important for female reproductive <b>organ</b> <b>differentiation.</b> Excess activation of ERα by xenoestrogens impairs differentiation in both females and males and induces hepatic expression of egg-yolk proteins. The results also indicate that ERα alone cannot mediate demasculinization of male copulatory behavior in quail, although further studies are needed to test this hypothesis...|$|E

This tool had a fundamental role and has become {{the starting point for}} a series of new functional and genomic studies. Recently, great efforts have been done to characterize the genetic cascades of genes having a key role in early embryonic development and to draw the regulatory networks in which they are involved. In this review, we focused our attention on the last advances obtained in the attempt to clarify the complex molecular events governing ascidian central nervous system development with a special interest for anterior neural and sensory structures. We discussed the more recent theories on its early induction and late regionalization. In particular, we used some conserved genes fully or partially characterized as examples to compare ascidian and vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). By integrating the various results obtained with microarray, morpholino loss of function and promoter analyses, we showed that many progresses have been done to unravel the gene networks controlling early CNS induction and formation.

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is a multifactorial disease caused by complex {{interactions between the}} genetic and environmental factors underlying various innate and adaptive immunity disorders, including cytokine hyperproduction, abnormal B cell activation, impaired intracellular T-cell signaling, and defective apoptotic and necrotic cell clearance. A broad spectrum of genetic disorders associated with susceptibility to the disease and/or its definite variants has been identified. Our knowledge concerning the mechanisms of polyclonal B cell activation in SLE has advanced substantially. Various defects in the T cells regulating a B cell immune response have been detected. The development of genetic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic technologies could identify a group of pathogenetically relevant cytokines, including BLyS (the B-lymphocyte stimulator {{is the most important}} component of cytokine-mediated regulation of B cell function, proliferation, and differentiation), interleukin (IL) 6, 17, 18, type 1 interferon, and tumor necrosis factor- α, which are involved in the development of visceral inflammation and damage. Large-scale clinical trials of different medications, primarily biological agents (BA), were conducted in patients with SLE. Rituximab (RTM) is the first BA to be used to treat this disease. Despite its official registration for the therapy of SLE, RTM is included in the EULAR, ACR, and Russia's Association of Rheumatologists guidelines for its treatment. Belimumab, a fully human recombinant IgG 1 λ monoclonal antibody, specially designed to treat SLE, prevents the interaction of pBLyS with the receptors of autoreactive transitional and naive B cells, giving rise to the suppression of B cell hyperresponsiveness, autoantibody synthesis in particular.

40|$|During {{embryogenesis}} of {{the spider}} crab, Hyas araneus, four developmental phases were distinguished microscopically: cleavage, gastrula,;embryo differentiation, prehatching phase. Changes in fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), ash-free dry weight (AFDW), water, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), total lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and respiration rates were measured in developing eggs. The percentage of water increased from 52 % to 87 % of FW, most rapidly after the beginning of <b>organ</b> <b>differentiation</b> and during hatching. The accumulation of minerals followed a similar pattern, with ash increasing from 3 % to 7 % of DW in the eggs, and to 26 % at hatching. Inverse (decreasing) patterns were observed in organic matter (AFDW, C, N, lipids, proteins). During development from the undivided egg to the freshly hatched zoea larva, 69 % of the initial lipid and 35 % of protein were depleted. Carbohydrates represented a minor constituent of yolk (1 % to 2 % of DW). In spite of a decreasing protein content, N remained almost constant. This suggests a final increase in low-molecular nitrogenous substances, which are not quantitatively detected by the Lowry method (probably free amino acids); we suspect that these {{may play a role}} in the hatching process. In the gastrula, and from about 3 months after the onset of <b>organ</b> <b>differentiation</b> until 1 or 2 months before hatching, low embryonic respiration rates as well as microscopical observations indicated the existence of developmental resting periods. Such diapause-like intervals may coordinate the time of hatching with a short season of planktonic food production in high latitudes.

40|$|The {{ability of}} many insects {{to walk on}} {{vertical}} smooth surfaces such as glass or even on the ceiling has fascinated biologists for a long time, and {{has led to the}} discovery of highly specialized adhesive organs located at the distal end of the animals' legs. So far, research has primarily focused on structural and ultrastructural investigations leading to a deeper understanding of adhesive organ functionality and to the development of new bioinspired materials. Genetic approaches, e. g. the analysis of mutants, to achieve a better understanding of adhesive <b>organ</b> <b>differentiation</b> have not been used so far. Here, we describe the first Drosophila melanogaster mutant that develops malformed adhesive organs, resulting in a complete loss of climbing ability on vertical smooth surfaces. Interestingly, these mutants fail to make close contact between the setal tips and the smooth surface, a crucial condition for wet adhesion mediated by capillary forces. Instead, these flies walk solely on their claws. Moreover, we were able to show that the mutation is caused by a P-element insertion into the Su(z) 2 gene locus. Remobilization of the P-element restores climbing ability. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the P-element insertion results in an artificial Su(z) 2 transcript, which most likely causes a gain-of-function mutation. We presume that this transcript causes deregulation of yet unknown target genes involved in pulvilli differentiation. Our results nicely demonstrate that the genetically treatable model organism Drosophila is highly suitable for future investigations on adhesive <b>organ</b> <b>differentiation.</b> Erratum can be found in Journal of Experimental Biology 2015, Vol. 218, p. 1613 doi: 10. 1242 /jeb. 125120. 7 page(s...|$|E

OPS is a polarly localised membrane-associated protein that is initially expressed in provascular cells, and upon vascular cell type specification becomes restricted to the phloem cell lineage. OPS mutants display a reduction of cotyledon vascular pattern complexity and discontinuous phloem differentiation, whereas OPS overexpressers show accelerated progress of cotyledon vascular patterning and phloem differentiation.

40|$|Two main {{types of}} {{macrophage}} functions are known: classical (M 1), producing nitric oxide, NO, and M 2, in which arginase activity is primarily expressed. Ornithine, {{the product of}} arginase, is a substrate for synthesis of polyamines and collagen, important for growth and ontogeny of animals. M 2 macrophages, expressing high level of mitochondrial arginase, have been implicated in promoting cell division and deposition of collagen during ontogeny and wound repair. Arginase expression is the default mode of tissue macrophages, but can also be amplified by signals, such as IL 4 / 13 or TGF-β that accelerates wound healing and tissue repair. In worms, the induction of collagen gene is coupled with induction of immune response genes, both depending on the same TGF-β-like pathway. This suggests that the main function of M 2 heal type macrophages is originally connected with the TGF-β superfamily of proteins, which are involved in regulation of tissue and <b>organ</b> <b>differentiation</b> in embryogenesis. Excretory-secretory products of metazoan parasites are able to induce M 2 type of macrophage responses promoting wound healing without participation of Th 2 cytokines IL 4 /IL 13. The expression of arginase in lower animals can be induced {{by the presence of}} parasite antigens and TGF-β signals leading to collagen synthesis. This also means that the main proteins, which, in primitive metazoans, are involved in regulation of tissue and <b>organ</b> <b>differentiation</b> in embryogenesis are produced by innate immunity. The signaling function of NO is known already from the sponge stage of animal evolution. The cytotoxic role of NO molecule appeared later, as documented in immunity of marine mollusks and some insects.

Understanding when and how the M 1 and M 2 activities came to be in animals is useful for understanding how macrophage immunity, and immune responses operate...|$|E
