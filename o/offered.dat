30|$|Note, since borrowers only take-up {{candidate}} <b>offers,</b> {{the rate}} {{set by the}} lender maximizing on expected profit is a candidate <b>offer.</b> We did not relate this {{to the quality of}} the candidate <b>offer,</b> i.e., the sequential decision model presented in this section seems to indicate a lower candidate <b>offer</b> rates does not attract more customers as would be expected in practice. The scenario presented here assumes the lender is cognizant of the order in which his <b>offer</b> lies within a sequence of <b>offers.</b> In our model, we assumed all consumers had received the same past <b>offers</b> prior to the current <b>offer.</b> In practice, when an <b>offer</b> is made, a lower <b>offer</b> rate attracts a higher take-up rate, i.e., the quality of the candidate <b>offer</b> affects the response rate. This may be attributed to each borrower receiving multiple <b>offers</b> from different lenders and hence, each borrower is at a different point on their sequences of <b>offers.</b>|$|R

50|$|As may be {{the case}} with other {{contracts}}, real estate contracts may be formed by one party making an <b>offer</b> and another party accepting the <b>offer.</b> To be enforceable, the <b>offers</b> and acceptances must be in writing (Statute of Frauds, Common Law)and signed by the parties agreeing to the contract. Often, the party making the <b>offer</b> prepares a written real estate contract, signs it, and transmits it to the other party who would accept the <b>offer</b> by signing the contract. As with all other types of legal <b>offers,</b> the other party may accept the <b>offer,</b> reject it (in which case the <b>offer</b> is terminated), make a counteroffer (in which case the original <b>offer</b> is terminated), or not respond to the <b>offer</b> (in which case the <b>offer</b> terminates by the expiration date in it). Before the <b>offer</b> (or counteroffer) is accepted, the offering (or countering) party can withdraw it. A counteroffer may be countered with yet another <b>offer,</b> and a counteroffering process may go on indefinitely between the parties.|$|R

40|$|Structure Matters in Negotiation 2 We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} framework and associated propositions for interpreting {{a key component of}} negotiation dynamics – <b>offer</b> exchange. We view negotiation as collaborative search of a complex <b>offer</b> space, whereby negotiators simplify and coordinate search via information contained in <b>offer</b> exchanges, isolating sub-regions of the <b>offer</b> space for potential solutions. We suggest that early search is influenced more by value of <b>offers</b> to the negotiators, but later is influenced more by structure of <b>offers</b> in the exchange, whereby {{there appears to be a}} heuristic for selecting <b>offers</b> that are structurally similar to prior <b>offers.</b> As both negotiators tend to engage this heuristic, the result is a joint-focusing on subsets of the <b>offer</b> space and a bias toward structural proximity of <b>offers</b> and agreements...|$|R
3000|$|The {{decision}} to take up an <b>offer</b> {{by a member of}} the population is dependent on the decision heuristics, the associated parameter, and a history of past and current <b>offer</b> rates. The decision heuristics and the heuristics parameter drives the cognitive process, while the sequence of <b>offers</b> determines the <b>offer</b> experience of the decision maker. In order to estimate the take rates, a sequence of <b>offers</b> must be specified. Let r_i indicate a sequence of i <b>offers</b> with r_i the last <b>offer.</b> Hence, the probability of a Take conditioned on decision heuristics, the associated parameter, and a history of past and current <b>offer</b> rates may be estimated from the historical database, i.e., p(T_i|r_i,ψ _j,h_j). Suppose the last <b>offer</b> r_i is not a candidate <b>offer,</b> i.e., r_i >min_i [r_ 1, r_ 2,...,r_i- 1].

5000|$|The [...] "mirror image rule" [...] {{states that}} if you are to accept an <b>offer,</b> you must accept an <b>offer</b> exactly, without modifications; if you change the <b>offer</b> in any way, this is a counter-offer that kills the {{original}} <b>offer</b> and the original <b>offer</b> cannot be accepted at a future time.|$|R
30|$|Suppose now {{we take a}} {{borrower}}’s view. A borrower {{receives a}} sequence of <b>offers</b> from a lender. We assume the <b>offer</b> expires before the next <b>offer</b> arrives. As each <b>offer</b> arrives, the borrower is required {{to make a decision}} on whether to take the <b>offer.</b> If an <b>offer</b> not taken, the borrower waits for the next <b>offer.</b> When rejecting an <b>offer,</b> the borrower risks the chance of receiving only lower quality <b>offers</b> in the future. A broad set of literature indicates that humans do not necessarily make rational decisions when faced with sequential decision problems, in part because of our bounded ability to take in information and limited cognitive abilities. Such limitations are known as bounded rationality. Bounded rationality may explain why homogenous borrowers accept credit <b>offers</b> at different point of time when faced with a sequence of <b>offers.</b> We provide an example, {{in the form of a}} well-studied problem known as the secretary problem, of how human subjects make decisions in a sequential decision problem setting.|$|R
