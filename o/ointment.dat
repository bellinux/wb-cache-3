5|$|Zinc {{compounds}} {{were probably}} used by early humans, in processed and unprocessed forms, as a paint or medicinal <b>ointment,</b> but their composition is uncertain. The use of pushpanjan, probably zinc oxide, as a salve for eyes and open wounds, is {{mentioned in the}} Indian medical text the Charaka Samhita, thought to date from 500 BC or before. Zinc oxide <b>ointment</b> is also mentioned by the Greek physician Dioscorides (1st century AD.) Avicenna mentions zinc oxide in The Canon of Medicine (1025 AD), which mentioned it as a preferred treatment {{for a variety of}} skin conditions, including skin cancer. Though it is no longer used for treating skin cancer, it is still widely used to treat a variety of other skin conditions, in products such as baby powder and creams against diaper rashes, calamine cream, anti-dandruff shampoos, and antiseptic ointments.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMost steroidal <b>ointments</b> contain {{propylene}} glycol (PG) and surfactants, which improve the solubility of corticosteroids in white petrolatum. Surfactants aid the uniform dispersal of PG within white petrolatum. Since the surfactants used in generic <b>ointments</b> are usually {{different from those}} used in brand name <b>ointments,</b> we investigated the effects of surfactants on the rheological properties of three brand name <b>ointments</b> and six equivalent generic <b>ointments.</b> We detected marked differences in hardness, adhesiveness, and spreadability among the <b>ointments.</b> Further examinations of model <b>ointments</b> consisting of white petrolatum, PG, and surfactants revealed that the abovementioned properties, especially hardness and adhesiveness, were markedly affected by the surfactants. Since steroidal <b>ointments</b> are often admixed with moisturizing creams prior to use, we investigated the mixing compatibility of the <b>ointments</b> with heparinoid cream and how this was affected by their surfactants. We found that the <b>ointments</b> containing glyceryl monostearate demonstrated good mixing compatibility, whereas those containing non-ionic surfactants with polyoxyethylene chains exhibited phase separation. These results were also {{consistent with the findings}} for the model <b>ointments,</b> which indicates that the mixing compatibility of steroidal <b>ointments</b> with heparinoid cream is determined by the emulsifying capacity of the surfactants in their oily bases...|$|R

The lesions were produced by the use of petrolatum-based antibiotic <b>ointments.</b> These <b>ointments,</b> which are marketed as nonsterile products, are {{similar to those}} used for hemostatic packing in otolaryngologic surgery. To date, use of these <b>ointments</b> has been reported to precede the finding of human paranasal sinus myospherulosis. The exact nature of the structures of myospherulosis remains unknown. The experimental evidence strongly suggests that they can be iatrogenically produced by the use of these nonsterile <b>ointments...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} goal is {{to assess}} the efficacy of treatment with two new original <b>ointments</b> for burns with experimental pseudomonas infection. Burns {{have been caused by}} laser to three groups of white rats (20 animals in each group). In 3 days the wounds were infected with clinical strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The wounds of the first group of rats were treated with <b>ointments</b> № 1, the wounds of the second group of rats — with <b>ointments</b> № 2. The third group did not receive any treatment. In 3, 10 and 14 days period the number of microbial cells in purulent discharge was studied. Then they were grown on meat-peptone agar. The number of colonies was counted. The number of cells in purulent discharge of treated wounds was less, than it was in purulent discharge of untreated wounds. The number of cells in purulent discharge of treated with <b>ointments</b> № 1 wounds was higher, than it was in purulent discharge of treated with <b>ointments</b> № 2 wounds. The article concludes that the local antimicrobial effect of both <b>ointments</b> is explained by their main components — some essential volatile oils and chloramphenico...|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An <b>ointment</b> derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.|$|E
5|$|In his Essential Medical Treasures of the Golden Chamber (Jinkui yaolue), Zhang Zhongjing (c. 150– c. 219 CE) was {{the first}} to suggest a {{regulated}} diet rich in certain vitamins could prevent different types of disease, an idea which led Hu Sihui (fl. 1314–1330 CE) to prescribe a diet rich in Vitamin B1 as a treatment for beriberi. Zhang's major work was the Treatise on Cold Injury and Miscellaneous Disorders (Shanghan zabing lun). His contemporary and alleged associate Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was a physician who had studied the Huangdi neijing and became knowledgeable in Chinese herbology. Hua Tuo used anesthesia on patients during surgery and created an <b>ointment</b> that was meant to fully heal surgery wounds within a month. In one diagnosis of an ill woman, he deciphered that she bore a dead fetus within her womb which he then removed, curing her of her ailments.|$|E
5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an <b>ointment</b> to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{morphological}} parameters (viscosity, viscous elasticity and the rate of volatile component loss) of salicylic and boric acid-containing magisterial formulae (<b>ointments).</b> Moreover, the effects of these parameters on the diffusion rate of a therapeutic agent (salicylic acid) to an in vitro external compartment were analyzed. Finally, the applicatory properties of the <b>ointments</b> prepared by way of a conventional technique (in a mortar) and with the aid of an unguator, were compared. The rheological parameters of the analyzed <b>ointments</b> suggest that the preparations made with an aid of an unguator, irrespective of the physicochemical characteristics of their vehicles, are characterized by higher values of diffusion coefficient (D). In addition, conventionally-prepared formulae containing salicylic were shown to be characterized by better viscous elasticity. Surprisingly, irrespective of the preparation technique, the <b>ointments</b> based on an absorptive vehicle (containing lanolin) were characterized by similar viscous elasticity. The rate of volatile (water) component loss from <b>ointments</b> containing a 3 % solution of boric acid suggests that such formulae lose no more than 2. 3 % of their mass when exposed at 37 ℃. Therefore, the viscosity of such <b>ointments</b> applied onto a patient’s skin should remain relatively stable...|$|R

5|$|The {{instruments}} of the Passion were sometimes split between a shield and crest {{in the form}} of an achievement of arms (Neubecker, 222). The Hyghalmen Roll (c. 1447–1455) shows Christ holding an azure shield charged with Veronica's Veil proper. The heraldry continues with the 15th century jousting helmet, which is covered by the seamless robe as a form of mantling, and the Cross, scepter (of mockery) and flagellum (whip) as crest. The banner's long red schwenkel is a mark of eminence in German heraldry, but it was omitted when this image was copied into Randle Holme's Book (c. 1464–1480). The image on the opposing page (shown above) includes a shield quartered with the five Wounds of Christ, three jars of <b>ointment,</b> two rods, and the head of Judas Iscariot with a bag of money (Dennys, 97–98).|$|E
5|$|After {{damaging}} {{the instrument panel}} with a medical <b>ointment</b> and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to be}} an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.|$|E
5|$|Calakmul {{is one of}} {{the most}} structure-rich sites within the Maya region. The site {{contains}} 117 stelae, the largest total in the region. Most are in paired sets representing rulers and their wives. However, because these carved stelae were produced in soft limestone, most of these stelae have been eroded beyond interpretation. Also many elaborate murals were discovered at Calakmul. These murals do not represent activities of the elite class. Rather, they depict elaborate market scenes of people preparing or consuming products such as atole, tamales, or tobacco as an <b>ointment.</b> Also items being sold were textiles and needles. These murals also have glyphs within them describing the actions occurring. The most prominent figure in these murals is identified as Lady Nine Stone; she appears in many scenes. This brings a world of the Maya marketplace to vibrant life for archaeologists. Another highly beneficial resource to Maya archaeological understanding at Calakmul is the ceramic remains. The composition of the ceramic materials identifies the region or more specifically the polity that produced them. Ceramics with the snake emblem glyph found at several sites also give more evidence to identify ties or control over that site by Calakmul.|$|E

The use of isopropyl myristate (IPM) as a dilutent for nonaqueous products during the isolation (membrane filtration) of contaminating organisms has been examined. Both sterile filtered and autoclaved IPM were used. Plastic and aluminium containers (tubes) were compared on an in-use, swept volume basis as part of contamination control, IPM did not interfere with organism recovery and results suggest that bacteria may survive for several days in such <b>ointments.</b> Observations are discussed {{with respect to the}} need for the inclusion of an added preservative in ophthalmic <b>ointments...</b>|$|R
