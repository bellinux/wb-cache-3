40|$|Diversity {{among members}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> <b>Sepiola</b> (Cephalopoda: Sepiolidae) in the NE Atlantic-Mediterranean area is fairly high; 10 {{species have been}} recorded. In this paper, a new species, Sepiola bursadhaesa n. sp., is {{described}} based on ten specimens from the Catalan Sea. They are lodged in the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales of Madrid. The new species is compared with the closely related species Sepiola affinis Naef, 1912 and Sepiola intermedia Naef, 1912, the latter of which is possibly its sister species. Male Sepiola bursadhaesa n. sp. differs from Sepiola intermedia in having a very wrinkled and outward projecting tubercle on the copulatory apparatus, and the first three (rather than two) suckers of the dorsal row of the distal part of the hectocotylus enlarged. The middle sucker of the three suckers is the largest. In female S. bursadhaesa n. sp., unlike all other species in the genus, the bursa copulatrix is fused throughout its posterior rim to the inner side of the mantle. The relationships between the species of the Sepiola atlantica group sensu Naef (1923), to which S. bursadhaesa n. sp. belongs, are described. An identification key for this group is provided...|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>genus</b> <b>Sepiola</b> (Cephalopoda: Sepiolidae) {{contains}} 10 known {{species that}} occur in the Mediterranean Sea today. All Sepiola species have a light organ that contains at least one of two species of luminous bacteria, Vibrio fischeri and Vibrio logei. The two Vibrio species coexist in at least four Sepiola species (S. affinis, S. intermedia, S. ligulata, and S. robusta), and their concentrations in the light organ depend on changes in certain abiotic factors, including temperature. Strains of V. fischeri grew faster in vitro and in Sepiola juveniles when they were incubated at 26 °C. In contrast, strains of V. logei grew faster at 18 °C in culture and in Sepiola juveniles. When aposymbiotic S. affinis or S. ligulata juveniles were inoculated with one Vibrio species, all strains of V. fischeri and V. logei were capable of infecting both squid species at the optimum growth temperatures, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squid host from which the bacteria were initially isolated. However, when two different strains of V. fischeri and V. logei were placed in direct competition with each other at either 18 or 26 °C, strains of V. fischeri were present in sepiolid light organs in greater concentrations at 26 °C, whereas strains of V. logei were present in greater concentrations at 18 °C. In addition to the competition experiments, <b>the</b> ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two bacterial species in adult Sepiola specimens caught throughout the season at various depths differed, and these differences were correlated with the temperature in the surrounding environment. My findings contribute additional data concerning the ecological and environmental factors that affect host-symbiont recognition and may provid...|$|R

40|$|Vibrio fischeri is a bioluminescent {{bacterial}} symbiont of sepiolid squids (Cephalopoda: Sepiolidae) and monocentrid fishes (Actinopterygii: Monocentridae). V. fischeri exhibit competitive dominance {{within the}} allopatrically distributed squid genus Euprymna, which {{have led to}} <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> V. fischeri host specialists. In contrast, <b>the</b> host <b>genus</b> <b>Sepiola</b> contains sympatric species that {{is thought to have}} given rise to V. fischeri that have evolved as host generalists. Given that these ecological lifestyles may have a direct effect upon the growth spectrum and survival limits in contrasting environments, optimal growth ranges were obtained for numerous V. fischeri isolates from both free-living and host environments. Upper and lower limits of growth were observed in sodium chloride concentrations ranging from 0. 0 % to 9. 0 %. Sepiola symbiotic isolates possessed the least variation in growth throughout the entire salinity gradient, whereas isolates from Euprymna were the least uniform at 5. 0 % NaCl. Growth kinetics of symbiotic V. fischeri strains were also measured under a range of salinity and temperature combinations. Symbiotic V. fischeri ES 114 and ET 101 exhibited a synergistic effect for salinity and temperature, where significant differences in growth rates due to salinity existed only at low temperatures. Thus, abiotic factors such as temperature and salinity have differential effects between free-living and symbiotic strains of V. fischeri, which may alter colonization efficiency prior to infection...|$|R
