5|$|Both events, not {{connected}} publicly for several weeks, caused the curious {{to visit the}} website ilovebees.com. The site, which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and beekeeping, was covered in confusing random characters and sentence fragments. Dana, the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site, created a weblog stating that something had gone wrong with her website, and the site itself had been hacked. Suspecting {{that this was a}} mystery that could be unraveled, Halo and ARG fans spread the link and began to work on figuring <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
5|$|The company {{established}} a defensive {{position for the}} night. While they were doing so, Lieutenant D. B. Stuart, the commander {{of one of the}} Papuan platoons, arrived. They had become concerned when radio contact had been lost and he had been sent to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> King ordered him to bring the Papuans up from Sangan with extra ammunition and the No.11 set. At around 17:30, a native appeared with a message for the Japanese commander. The paper was taken from him and he was shot when he tried to escape. Later, a Japanese patrol returned to Kaiapit, unaware that it was now in Australian hands. They were killed when they stumbled across a Bren gun position. Four more Japanese soldiers returned after midnight. One of them escaped.|$|E
25|$|Griffith's {{early career}} {{was as a}} monologist, {{delivering}} long stories such as What It Was, Was Football, which is told {{from the point of}} view of a naïve country preacher trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in a football game. The monologue was released as a single in 1953 on the Colonial Records label, and was a hit for Griffith, reaching number nine on the charts in 1954.|$|E

25|$|On August 10, 2008, Compass-1 entered Emergency mode. The {{cause was}} unknown and FH Aachen {{put out a}} call to all amateur radio {{operators}} {{to try to find}} <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> with the CubeSat. A hard reset occurred, only to bring the satellite into a circle of powering up, turning on the heaters, and then dying again. The only way to exit this loop was to avoid starting the heaters. The team needed as much Telemetry from the ground as possible, which was from amateur radio enthusiasts.|$|E
25|$|Huxley's {{interest}} in education went still further than school and university classrooms; {{he made a}} great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds: after all, he himself was largely self-educated. There were his lecture courses for working men, {{many of which were}} published afterwards, and there was the use he made of journalism, partly to earn money but mostly {{to reach out to the}} literate public. For most of his adult life he wrote for periodicals—the Westminster Review, the Saturday Review, the Reader, the Pall Mall Gazette, Macmillan's Magazine, the Contemporary Review. Germany was still ahead in formal science education, but interested people in Victorian Britain could use their initiative and find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> by reading periodicals and using the lending libraries.|$|E
25|$|The interpreter, Sergeant (Sgt) Simon Hamilton-Jewell, Corporal (Cpl) Russ Aston and Lance {{corporal}} (LCpl) Ben Hyde {{moved off}} {{to the police station}} leaving Corporal Paul Long, Corporal Simon Miller and Lance corporal Thomas Keys to stay behind with the vehicles, weapons and body armour. Whilst the RMPs were talking in the police station, they heard the gunfire and went outside to investigate. When a crowd had formed and some of them were firing into the air, Sergeant Hamilton-Jewell ordered the Land Rovers into the compound. At this point, some of the Iraqi Police left, promising to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> but it was believed that they were planning an escape. The crowd swelled to between 400 and 600 people then advanced upon the police station after finding out that British soldiers were there. At this time, the Ops Room at Abu Naji were being informed that the six RMPs might still be in Majar al-Kabir by their chain of command. As there had been no communication with the six RMPs, it could not be definitely asserted as to where they were.|$|E

5000|$|... “At first, {{there was}} {{definitely}} confusion just because everyone {{was trying to figure}} <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on,” Ben Dudley, former community pastor at University Baptist, told the Waco Tribune-Herald. “Everyone just immediately started praying.” ...|$|R
25|$|As Beaulieu {{tried to}} retreat east beyond the Adda River, {{he found that}} the French were already across the southern-most roads. Hoping to cut his way through in the morning, the Austrian {{commander}} sent Schübirz toward Codogno with two battalions of the Reisky Infantry Regiment Nr. 13 and four squadrons of Uhlans, about 1,000 foot soldiers and 580 cavalrymen. Arriving at Codogno in the dark, Schübirz decided on his own initiative to capture the place. At around 10:00 PM, his troops routed the French pickets and infiltrated much of the town. Soon, Laharpe and his staff received reports of the Austrian incursion and went out to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> It so happened that the French 51st Line Infantry Demi-Brigade was marching through the center of town. As the troops reached the town square, they were ambushed by soldiers of the Reisky Regiment and soon both sides were firing blindly into the darkness. After the French rounded up a number of Austrian prisoners, they found Laharpe shot dead, possibly by friendly fire.|$|E
500|$|Later, {{after reading}} {{an article in}} the San Francisco Examiner, Ryan {{declared}} his intention to go to Jonestown, an agricultural commune in Guyana where Jim Jones and roughly 1,000 Temple members resided. [...] Ryan's choice was also influenced both by the Concerned Relatives group, which consisted primarily of Californians, as were most Temple members, and by his own characteristic distaste for social injustice. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, while investigating the events, the United States Department of State [...] "repeatedly stonewalled Ryan's attempts to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in Jonestown", and told him that [...] "everything was fine".|$|E
2500|$|On 11 December 1808, General John Moore led a British army {{numbering}} 22,500 foot soldiers, 2,500 horsemen, and 66 artillery pieces northeast from Salamanca. Moore {{had written}} to a fellow general, [...] "if the bubble bursts and Madrid falls, we shall have to run for it." [...] Soon after, Moore learned that Napoleon had seized Madrid and that over 200,000 Imperial French troops were in the field. Nevertheless, the British general decided to strike at Marshal Nicolas Soult's isolated II Corps {{in the north of}} Spain. When the British cavalry routed Soult's horsemen at Sahagún on 21 December, the French general was completely surprised. Meanwhile, Napoleon found <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> and ordered 80,000 troops to march north to annihilate the British.|$|E

2500|$|Whirlwind fighter-bombers {{tried to}} engage the fleet around [...] but were intercepted by the fighter screen. The seven Beauforts at Thorney Island were closest to the Brest Group when it was sighted. Two Beauforts had been bombed up and one went unserviceable, before the other four took off at [...] The four Beauforts were late to meet their fighter escorts at Manston and the torpedo-bombers and fighters were ordered {{independently}} to the German ships. The position, course and speed of the Brest Group was given by voice (R/T) to the Spitfires and Morse (W/T) to the Beauforts. The torpedo-bombers failed to receive the orders, because 16 Group forgot {{that they had been}} fitted with R/T for Operation Fuller. When the Beauforts reached Manston they circled with numerous fighters which appeared to ignore them. Two Beauforts flew to the French coast, found nothing and landed at Manston where the confusion was resolved. The other two aircraft had already landed at Manston, where the crews found <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> and set off for the Belgian coast, arriving at [...] (when the Nore Command destroyers were attacking). Both bombers flew through the German flak and attacked Prinz Eugen, dropping their torpedoes at , to no effect.|$|E

60|$|It {{happened}} that the sultan's son, Jalaloddin, {{the one who}} had been set aside in favor of his brother Kothboddin, was at this time on the main land not far from the island, and intelligence was communicated to him of his father's situation.

60|$|At {{this point}} in the {{conversation}} a little dog with a lame leg hobbled {{to the edge of the}} rocks in front of the spot where Dick was seated, and looked down into the water, which was deep there.
