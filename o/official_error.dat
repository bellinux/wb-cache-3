40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTropical cyclone (TC) track forecasts will always contain uncertainty. This thesis relates ranges (bins) of uncertainty measurements with historical TC track forecast errors, to provide statistically distinct error distributions {{for use with}} the Monte Carlo (MC) method. T-test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests are used to confirm distinctness among error distributions associated with the bins of either European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble spread or TVCN Goerss Predicted Consensus Error (GPCE). The statistical tests indicate that distinct error distributions (consisting of <b>official</b> TC forecast <b>error,</b> ECMWF ensemble mean [EMN] error, or TVCN error) exist when using four bins of uncertainty (of either uncertainty measurement). Furthermore, error distributions of ECMWF EMN error are distinct with five bins of ECMWF ensemble spread. Along- and cross-track <b>official</b> <b>errors</b> could not be directly related to either measurement of uncertainty at even three bins. These {{results suggest that the}} National Hurricane Center test and evaluate the use of four bins of uncertainty for operational use with the MC method to further improve its Wind Speed Probability products and overall TC track forecasts.

40|$|The 2009 Atlantic {{season was}} marked by below-average {{tropical}} cyclone activity {{with the formation of}} nine tropical storms, the fewest since the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season. Of these, three became hurricanes and two strengthened into major hurricanes (category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale). In addition, there were two tropical depressions that did not reach storm strength. The numbers of tropical storms and hurricanes were below the long-term averages of 11 named storms and 6 hurricanes, although the number of major hurricanes equaled the long-term average of 2. Many of the cyclones remained relatively weak. Only one tropical cyclone, Tropical Storm Claudette, made landfall in the United States, although Ida affected the northern Gulf Coast as a tropical storm before moving inland as an extratropical cyclone. Hurricane Bill and Tropical Storm Danny indirectly affected the East Coast by producing high surf, rip currents, and beach erosion; Bill also produced tropical storm conditions over Bermuda and parts of Atlantic Canada. Hurricane Ida made landfall in Nicaragua and also affected parts of Honduras, the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, and western Cuba.
