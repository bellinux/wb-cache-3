5|$|The path {{continues}} north {{beside the}} Torridge Estuary, in places following {{the route of}} the Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway, past Northam to Appledore and around the promontory past the Shell middens and a submerged forest, that dates from the Mesolithic period, off the pebble ridge to Westward Ho! (this is the only placename in the UK which includes an exclamation mark). The path then follows the coast around Clovelly Bay where several small villages including Abbotsham lie inland, because of the cliffs. The path passes the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Peppercombe Castle and the village <b>of</b> <b>Bucks</b> Mills. Clovelly itself is a historic village with a small natural harbour. The path continues past the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Windbury Head to Hartland Point and Hartland Quay. Hartland Point features a lighthouse and radar tower, and marks the western limit (on the English side) of the Bristol Channel with the Atlantic Ocean to the west. There is a winter helicopter service from Hartland Point to Lundy, which is visible from many points along the path between Welcombe and the Cornish border.|$|E

With {{the help}} state equations Mathematical Model <b>of</b> <b>Buck</b> Converter is designed in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The obtained output response <b>of</b> open loop <b>Buck</b> Converter is sluggish, not optimum and consists of peak overshoots. PI Controller is used in closed loop model <b>of</b> <b>Buck</b> Converter. Output Voltage is compared with a reference signal, which then is processed through a controller (PI/Fuzzy). The obtained signal is superimposed with a carrier signal and given to switching device used. To further optimize the performance <b>of</b> <b>Buck</b> Converter and eliminate the peak overshoot present in output response, Fuzzy controller is used. Here Suguno type Fuzzy is used...|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the main {{industry}} in the watershed <b>of</b> <b>Buck</b> Run was agriculture. Additionally, the tributary Doe Run served as water power for several mills.

In the early 1900s, major communities in the watershed included Parkesburg, Pomeroy, Doe Run, and Sadsburyville. In 1921, their populations were 2522, 365, 200, and 150, respectively.|$|R

25|$|Like {{the rest}} of the Philadelphia region, Bucks County has {{experienced}} a rapid increase of immigrants since the 2000 census. Known for its very large and established Eastern European population, most notably the Russian community, but also for its Ukrainian and Polish communities, Bucks County is now seeing a rapid surge of other immigrant groups. A 2005 population estimate <b>of</b> <b>Bucks</b> showed that the Indian and Mexican populations had already doubled since 2000. Bucks County is one of only two counties in Pennsylvania where Mexicans are the largest Hispanic community, the other being Montgomery County. Bucks County also is home to large and very prominent Roman Catholic and Jewish populations.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} seal <b>of</b> <b>Bucks</b> County, Pennsylvania {{takes its}} design from {{the inspiration of}} the county's founder, William Penn. The center of the seal consists of a shield from the Penn family crest with a tree above and a flowering vine surrounding it in symmetric flanks. The seal has a gold-colored background and a green band denoting Penn as the county's first proprietor and governor. In 1683, Penn's council decreed that a tree and vine {{be incorporated into the}} emblem to signify the county's abundance of woods. The seal was used in its official capacity until the Revolutionary War. The county government has since used the official Pennsylvania state seal for official documents. Today, the Bucks County seal's use is largely ceremonial. It appears on county stationery and vehicles {{as a symbol of the}} county's heritage. The gold emblem is also the centerpiece of the official Bucks County flag, which has a blue background and gold trim.|$|E

500|$|The {{co-operation}} {{was short-lived}} and arguments over maintenance started again in 1834 when the Buckinghamshire side needed repairs and Berkshire refused to contribute.

Buckinghamshire decided to rebuild with wooden railings whilst Berkshire built its half in iron suspended by chains.

500|$|The {{writers were}} new to screenwriting, so their film {{treatment}} ran to 110-pages; the average was 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to various Hollywood studios. Simmons met with Ned Tanen, {{an executive at}} Universal Studios. He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor; Mount had discovered the [...] "Seven Fires" [...] film treatment as Tanen's assistant, while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive. Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, [...] "We went further than I think Universal expected or wanted. I think they were shocked and appalled. Chris' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. And {{we had a lot}} of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit... We didn't back off anything". As the writers created more drafts of the screenplay (nine in total), the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it. The studio green-lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million. Simmons remembers, [...] "They just figured, 'Screw it, it's a silly little movie, and we’ll make a couple <b>of</b> <b>bucks</b> if we're lucky—let them do whatever they want.' ...|$|E
