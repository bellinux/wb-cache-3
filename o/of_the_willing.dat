40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{controversial}} issues in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> Heidegger’s thought is <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>will.</b> Th e communis opinio is that Heidegger embraced <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> in a non-critical manner at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thirties and, in particular, he employed {{it in his}} political speeches of 1933 – 1934. Jacques Derrida for instance speaks about a “massive voluntarism” in relation to Heidegger’s thought in this period. Also Brett Davis discerns a period of “existential voluntarism” in 1930 – 1934, in which Heidegger takes over a notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> in a non-critical manner. In this article, this interpretation is challenged and a stronger interpretation of Heidegger’s concern with <b>the</b> <b>will</b> is developed. Our hypothesis is that Heidegger’s concern with <b>the</b> <b>will</b> at <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thirties is brought about by his confrontation (Auseinandersetzung) with <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>will.</b> Based on his lecture courses from 1930 and 1936 / 37 and his Rectoral Address from 1933, enables us to discern three main characteristics of Heidegger’s destructed concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> in <b>the</b> early thirtie...|$|R
60|$|All day the men {{who were}} too weak to swing axes sat {{listless}} on the bank, watching in vain for some sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Willing.</b> They saw a canoe rounding the bend instead, with a single occupant paddling madly. And who should this be but Captain Willing's own brother, escaped from the fort, where he had been a prisoner. He told us that a man named Maisonville, with a party of Indians, was in pursuit of him, and the next piece of news he had was in the way of raising our despair a little. Governor Hamilton's astonishment at seeing this force here and now would be as great as his own. Governor Hamilton had said, indeed, that only a navy could take Vincennes this year. Unfortunately, Mr. Willing brought no food. Next in order came five Frenchmen, trapped by our scouts, nor had they any provisions. But as long as I live I shall never forget how Tom McChesney returned at nightfall, the hero of the hour. He had shot a deer; and never did wolves pick an animal cleaner. They pressed on me a choice piece of it, these great-hearted men who were willing to go hungry {{for the sake of a}} child, and when I refused it they would have forced it down my throat. Swein Poulsson, he that once hid under the bed, deserves a special tablet to his memory.

6000|$|While {{she spoke}} thus, we were {{advancing}} hastily towards Inglewood Place, while, {{as if to}} divert me from the task of further remonstrance, she drew a ludicrous picture of the magistrate and his clerk.--Inglewood was--according to her description--a white-washed Jacobite; that is, one who, having been long a non-juror, {{like most of the}} other gentlemen of the country, had lately qualified himself to act as a justice, by taking the oaths to Government. [...] "He had done so," [...] she said, [...] "in compliance with the urgent request of most of his brother squires, who saw, with regret, that the palladium of silvan sport, the game-laws, were likely to fall into disuse for want of a magistrate who would enforce them; the nearest acting justice being the Mayor of Newcastle, and he, as being rather inclined to the consumption of the game when properly dressed, than to its preservation when alive, was more partial, of course, to the cause of the poacher than of the sportsman. Resolving, therefore, that it was expedient some one of their number should sacrifice the scruples of Jacobitical loyalty to the good of the community, the Northumbrian country gentlemen imposed the duty on Inglewood, who, being very inert in most of his feelings and sentiments, might, they thought, comply with any political creed without much repugnance. Having thus procured the body of justice, they proceeded," [...] continued Miss Vernon, [...] "to attach to it a clerk, by way of soul, to direct and animate its movements. Accordingly they got a sharp Newcastle attorney, called Jobson, who, to vary my metaphor, finds it a good thing enough to retail justice at the sign of Squire Inglewood, and, as his own emoluments depend on the quantity of business which he transacts, he hooks in his principal for a great deal more employment in the justice line than the honest squire had ever bargained for; so that no apple-wife within the circuit of ten miles can settle her account with a costermonger without an audience of the reluctant Justice and his alert clerk, Mr. Joseph Jobson. But the most ridiculous scenes occur when affairs come before him, like our business of to-day, having any colouring of politics. Mr. Joseph Jobson (for which, no doubt, he has his own very sufficient reasons) is a prodigious zealot for the Protestant religion, and a great friend to the present establishment in church and state. Now, his principal, retaining a sort of instinctive attachment to the opinions which he professed openly until he relaxed his political creed with the patriotic view of enforcing the law against unauthorized destroyers of black-game, grouse, partridges, and hares, is peculiarly embarrassed when the zeal of his assistant involves him in judicial proceedings connected with his earlier faith; and, instead of seconding his zeal, he seldom fails to oppose to it a double dose of indolence and lack of exertion. And this inactivity does not by any means arise from actual stupidity. On the contrary, for one whose principal delight is in eating and drinking, he is an alert, joyous, and lively old soul, which makes his assumed dulness the more diverting. So you may see Jobson on such occasions, like a bit of a broken down blood-tit condemned to drag an overloaded cart, puffing, strutting, and spluttering, to get the Justice put in motion, while, though the wheels groan, creak, and revolve slowly, the great and preponderating weight of the vehicle fairly frustrates the efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>willing</b> quadruped, and prevents its being brought into a state of actual progression. Nay more, the unfortunate pony, I understand, has been heard to complain that this same car of justice, which he finds it so hard to put in motion on some occasions, can on others run fast enough down hill of its own accord, dragging his reluctant self backwards along with it, when anything can be done of service to Squire Inglewood's quondam friends. And then Mr. Jobson talks big about reporting his principal to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, {{if it were not for}} his particular regard and friendship for Mr. Inglewood and his family." ...|$|E
