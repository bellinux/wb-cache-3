25|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} I {{was part of}} what is now known as the {{emerging}} church and spent some time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network called the Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance myself from the emergent stream of the network because friends like Brian McLaren and Doug Pagitt began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to God as a chick, questioning God's sovereignty over and knowledge of the future, denial of the substitutionary atonement at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of hell which is <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a mistake.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews echoed {{many of the}} {{positive}} aspects of the game. GamePro stated that [...] "Gearbox has done <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a job in creating not just an add-on for Half-Life, but a continuation of a masterpiece", praising both level design and story elements, but noted that it was a little too short. However, some critics dissented on the idea that Opposing Force was as influential as other reviewers made out.|$|E

After agreeing that the mission was possible in principle, Kraft went to his mission planners and flight directors {{in order to determine}} whether they and their teams could be ready within the tight schedule that was projected. [...] "My head was abuzz with the things we'd have to do," [...] remembered Kraft. [...] "But it was <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a challenge." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{resistance}} {{people in}} Norway had been shocked {{when they found}} out that Andersen had been allowed to serve in NOR.I.C.1.

It would have been a great embarrassment if Fritt Folk had been able to publish that Gulosten made a career in King Håkon's armed forces".

500|$|The creators {{used the}} {{ambiguity}} of [...] "coming out of the closet", having Tom Cruise literally refusing {{to come out of}} Stan's closet, in a parody of rumors involving Cruise's sexuality. Cruise has a documented history of litigation against others involving rumors as to his sexuality, and some speculated whether Cruise could sue South Park. Entertainment Weekly asked in December 2005 whether South Park was [...] "cruisin' for a bruisin'" [...] and wondered [...] "how that sort of Cruise-bashing is going to go over with Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's new bosses: Paramount Pictures just inked the dudes to a three-year deal.

50|$|Necroplasm was {{originally}} indistinct/synonymous with psychoplasm, the substance <b>of</b> which <b>Hell</b> itself is composed. It {{is similar in}} properties, but special in that it can exist on Earth without needing to remain in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hell's</b> spheres <b>of</b> influence {{as well as being}} allowed to traverse the mortal world without violating the non-aggression pact between Heaven and Hell. Necroplasm was a creation of the Grand-Mal Demon known as Leviathan and is exclusive to the 8th Sphere <b>of</b> <b>Hell.</b> He used it to create a demon in his own image, known as The Malebolgia (Mal), who turned on his master and usurped the 8th Sphere for his own. This gave Malebolgia full control over the necroplasmic reserves and thus the ability to create a unique army of warriors known as Hellspawn which he uses to tip the balance <b>of</b> power in <b>Hell</b> toward the 8th Sphere.|$|R
500|$|In January 2008, Glen Drover quit Megadeth, {{stating that}} {{he was tired of}} the {{frequent}} touring and wanted {{to spend more time with}} his family. He also cited personal issues with other band members. Drover was replaced by Chris Broderick, formerly of Nevermore and Jag Panzer. Broderick was initially asked by Mustaine's management company at the end of 2007 if he would be interested in auditioning for Megadeth. After an informal meeting at Mustaine's house, Broderick was introduced as the band's new guitarist. Mustaine complimented Broderick's playing skills and called him [...] "the best guitarist Megadeth has ever had". Broderick's former Nevermore bandmate, Van Williams, congratulated Megadeth on [...] "getting <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a good player, more importantly they're getting a great guy to hang out with and a true friend".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his team's success on the gridiron, Tatum caused controversy. Buddy Burris, the first three-time All-American at Oklahoma, said, [...] "Jim Tatum was a con-man, a dictator, a tyrant, and <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a football coach." [...] Tatum greatly surpassed his allocated budget and linked players with sponsors who sometimes paid or bought clothes for their sponsored players. After a 34–13 Gator Bowl victory over N.C. State, University of Oklahoma president George Cross discovered that Tatum had paid the fifty Sooners players $120 each ($, adjusted for inflation). Cross had explicitly warned Tatum not to do so, {{as it was a}} violation of conference rules. With further investigation, it was discovered that $60,000 ($ in inflation-adjusted terms) was unaccounted for in the athletic department budget, which resulted in the relief of athletic director Jap Haskell.|$|E
500|$|By 5 June, {{recording}} for Enter the Grave {{had been}} completed, and Rasmussen had begun mixing the album. Video footage shot during recording sessions was uploaded to Earache Records' official YouTube account on 4 July, providing an exclusive glimpse behind the scenes. In reviewing Enter the Grave, some journalists commented on Rasmussen's role as producer. Chris Kee of Zero Tolerance Magazine said that [...] "getting Flemming Rasmussen to produce [...] {{is a major}} coup and as you'd expect he's done a sterling job, these fine songs all being blessed with a clean, crisp, uncluttered sound", whereas Ian Webster of Terrorizer felt that [...] "booking a band into Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen to record their debut with legendary Metallica producer Flemming Rasmussen is <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a statement of intent from Earache." [...] Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic also commented on Rasmussen's involvement, declaring that his production [...] "is surely one large reason why the album {{is characterized by a}} distinctively crunchy, rhythmically airtight attack." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{relocating}} to Southern California in 1994, Thomas {{was featured}} {{on the cover of}} TransWorld SKATEboarding magazine and filmed video parts for Spitfire and Invisible. In 1995 Thomas left Invisible to join skateboarder/artist Ed Templeton at Toy Machine Skateboards. Thomas filmed and directed two Toy Machine videos, the second one being Welcome To <b>Hell,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most influential skate videos of the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Thought {{to be the}} {{equivalent}} of Satan in the Bible, he is responsible for the creation of Spawn.

It has been noted that Malebolgia is constantly at war with the rulers of the other spheres <b>of</b> <b>Hell,</b> as well as at odds with Mammon.|$|R

500|$|The album {{had limited}} {{commercial}} success, reaching a peak position of No. 111 during a seven-week {{run on the}} US Billboard 200 album chart. Assessments of the album often weigh the poor sound quality against the historic importance and insight provided into The Beatles' early stage act. Rolling Stone reviewer John Swenson called the album [...] "poorly recorded but fascinating" [...] and commented that it showed The Beatles as [...] "raw but extremely powerful." [...] Allmusic, commenting on a reissue, wrote: [...] "The results were very low-fidelity, and despite The Beatles' enormous success, it took Taylor fifteen years to find someone greedy and shameless enough to release them as a record". Q Magazine described the recordings as having [...] "certain historical interest" [...] and remarked: [...] "The show seems like a riot but the sound itself is terrible– like <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a great party going on next door." [...] George Harrison gave the assessment: [...] "The Star-Club recording was the crummiest recording ever made in our name!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video game}} version of Mona Sax was {{critically}} acclaimed for {{being one of}} [...] "relatively complex, non-stereotypical female game characters". She was included on the 2007 list of 50 greatest female characters in video game history by Tom's Games, where she was described as [...] "a stone-cold killer who's incredibly tempting but not entirely trustworthy" [...] and [...] "the perfect female accomplice to Max Payne." [...] In 2008, PC Games Hardware also listed her {{as one of the}} most important female characters in video games. In 2012, David Sanchez of GameZone proposed that Mona appear in her own spin-off game, calling her [...] "one of the sexiest femme fatales in all of gaming", and added, [...] "The fact of the matter is that Mona Sax is <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a character — one that hasn't starred in her very own game, but one that could very well do so and deliver an unforgettable experience." [...] That same year, Austin Yorski of Blistered Thumbs listed Mona among his personal favorites while discussing the portrayals of video game female characters. In 2013, Complex ranked her as the 20th-best supporting character in video games.|$|E
500|$|While critics praised Morgan for his {{performance}} in the role, their reaction to the character has generally been mixed. Don Williams of BuddyTV felt that John is a [...] "rather divisive character", with some fans not understanding John's motivation for keeping his sons in the dark. However, Williams himself found the character to be [...] "completely fascinating". He chose [...] "In My Time of Dying" [...] as the second best episode of the series, mainly because of John's contributions, stating, [...] "Even if you're not {{a huge fan of}} Poppa Winchester, I think it's impossible not to be moved by the final ten minutes of this episode... John's final speech to Dean, where he finally tells his son that he's proud of him, is <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a tear-jerker, and both Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jensen Ackles knock that scene out of the park." [...] Williams praised Matt Cohen's performance of a younger version of the character in the time-travel episode [...] "In the Beginning", believing that he [...] "did an excellent job at portraying a more innocent John Winchester than we've ever seen before".|$|E
5000|$|Rodin {{originally}} {{conceived of}} Eternal Springtime {{as part of}} The Gates <b>of</b> <b>Hell,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the representations of Paolo Malatesta and Francesca da Polenta, but did not include it there because the happiness expressed by the lovers did not seem appropriate to the theme. The Kiss, another famous sculpture by the artist, shares the same origin, but unlike The Kiss in Eternal Springtime the man dominates the composition, sustaining the arching body of his lover that joins him in a passionate kiss.|$|R

500|$|In The Washington Post, Richard Harrington {{said because}} Feat of a Black Planet is a {{challenging}} listen, [...] "How it's met {{depends on how}} it's understood." [...] Robert Christgau, writing for The Village Voice, felt that its [...] "brutal pace" [...] ultimately loses momentum and that the group's lyrics are still ideologically flawed, but wrote that although their [...] "rebel music" [...] is gimmicky, [...] "this is show business, and they still think harder than anybody else working their beat." [...] Peter Watrous of The New York Times called it [...] "an essential pop album" [...] and stated, [...] "On their own, the lyrics seen functional. Taken with the music, they bloom with meaning." [...] Simon Reynolds of Melody Maker remarked that the content epitomizes the group's significance at the time: [...] "Public Enemy are important ... because of the angry questions that seethe in their music, in {{the very fabric of}} their sound; the bewilderment and rage that, in this case, have made for <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> strong, scary album". Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot felt that with the album, [...] "Public Enemy affirms that {{it is not just a}} great rap group, but one of the best rock bands on the planet-black or otherwise".|$|E
500|$|On {{his list}} of the ten best albums of 2013, Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly placed Bangerz third, complimenting Cyrus' ability for [...] "cutting-edge rap , a soulful voice capable of showstoppers , and an underappreciated {{emotional}} directness". The Guardian ranked Bangerz thirty-fourth on their list of the forty best albums, commenting that it [...] " [...] people up for commercial, rather than transgressive, ends" [...] despite initially opining that [...] "the attention-seeking begins to grate". Rolling Stone placed Bangerz at number twenty-seven on their list of the fifty best albums, writing that Cyrus [...] " [...] depth and vulnerability to <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a party [...] amid all the foam-finger hub-hub". Ann Powers from NPR ranked the record tenth on her list of ten records, suggesting that it [...] "should earn her entry into every celebration of pop this year", while the Associated Press ranked it ninth for being [...] "banging". Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle listed Bangerz as the fourth-best record of the year, calling it a [...] "fun, feisty pop album that produced two of the year's biggest, best singles" [...] and summarizing that [...] "with one flick of her tongue, Cyrus easily outdoes recent fare from Gaga, Katy and Britney." ...|$|E
500|$|Byrom is a midfielder, {{and is more}} {{comfortable}} in the centre of midfield. He is left-footed, although the left side is not his natural position, and he is rarely deployed as a winger. In 2007, Clitheroe chairman, Carl Garner, said that Byrom has [...] "tremendous skill and potential", adding [...] "Joel is a quality player. He can do things with the ball that players on the television can't. In May 2009, Stevenage manager Graham Westley believed that the acquisition of Byrom would [...] "give the squad more balance", and has also described him as having a [...] "cultured left-foot" [...] that enables him to open up opposition defences. On securing the signature of Byrom, Westley said, [...] "Joel is very creative going forward {{and is going to}} be <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a player. I was delighted to secure his signature as he is a real talent". Dino Maamria has called Byrom a [...] "creative midfielder", as well as being able to unlock defences. Byrom has called himself [...] "a good passer of the ball", as well as being able to [...] "chip in with a few goals and generally get the team ticking over". In March 2010, following Stevenage's 3–0 win against Crawley Town, a game in which Byrom scored a goal from just inside Crawley's half, Westley said that Byrom has the [...] "ability to score spectacular goals".|$|E

5000|$|Robinson {{has worked}} as a designer, jeweller, painter, print-maker and sculptor. He is a {{colourist}} whose paintings (acrylic) and prints (linocut) are primarily figurative though his prints often focus entirely on words, frequently with punning intent. His paintings tend to be impressionistic, whether they be landscapes and townscapes or portraits. Painting, for Robinson, [...] "is a very subtle thing. You use a soft brush and apply paint and it's all about the gestural type of thing. With printmaking, you've got to push a chisel through the lino, whereas jewellery is all about metal and sawing and hammering, filing and shaping.
