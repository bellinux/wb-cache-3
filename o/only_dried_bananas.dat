Previous studies have proved the existence of vitamin C, E, and B 6 in banana peels, especially vitamin C that can act as an antioxidant. The present study was performed to examine the effect of fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>banana</b> peels consumption on liver function (albumin, GPT, GOT, LDH, GGT and ALP) and lipid profiles cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) on acute liver failure rats induced by carbon tetrachloride. The chemical constituents, vitamins, minerals and fiber were determined for the tested fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>banana</b> peels. This work was carried out on 40 adult male white albino rats randomly classified into eight groups (each of 5 rats). The first group was fed on basal diet as a “negative control”. The other seven groups were injected by carbon tetrachloride to induce liver failure. The second group fed on basal diet as acute liver failure rat’s untreated “positive control”, the third into five groups fed on basal diet containing 5 %, 10 % and 15 % fresh banana peels while the six into eight groups fed on basal diet containing of 5 %, 10 % and 15 % <b>dried</b> <b>banana</b> peels for a period of four consecutive weeks.

To illustrate the use of X-ray microtomography the technique was applied to investigate the effect of far-infrared radiation (FIR) assisted drying on microstructure of a food product viz. <b>banana.</b> Two representative <b>drying</b> techniques, i. e., low-pressure superheated steam drying (LPSSD) and vacuum drying (VACUUM) were tested. <b>Banana</b> slices were <b>dried</b> by LPSSD-FIR at two different temperatures (80 and 90 degrees C) at a fixed pressure of 7 kPa. The total pore volume and pore size distribution of <b>dried</b> <b>banana</b> slices were then determined using X-ray microtomography. The results were also compared with those of products dried by LPSSD without FIR. Far-infrared radiation was found to modify the structure of the <b>dried</b> <b>bananas</b> by increasing their final porosity.
