5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{in the second half of}} the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a single non-homogenous class.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} {{proposed to}} avoid exporting money, and to include high tariffs on {{the import of}} luxury goods. This is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a contradiction of The Representation of the Hacendados, but each request different things. The Representation opposed the absolute prohibition of trade with Britain, {{which is not the}} same than allowing it while following a protectionist policy. As secretary, Moreno reduced the tariffs on national exports, but kept high ones for imports.|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> one of the first advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E

5|$|Degrassi: The Next Generation (later renamed Degrassi for seasons ten through fourteen) is a Canadian teen drama {{television}} series {{set in the}} Degrassi universe, which was created by Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood in 1979. It is the fourth series in the Degrassi franchise, following The Kids of Degrassi Street, Degrassi Junior High, and Degrassi High. Like its predecessors, the series follows an ensemble cast of students at the fictional Degrassi Community School who face various challenges <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> taboo such as graffiti, sex, teen pregnancy, bullying, date rape, drug abuse, self image, homosexuality, self-injury, suicide, abortion, domestic violence, death, racism and many other issues.|$|E

The campaign includes a video PSA featuring a variety of celebrities, both women and men. In September 2017, Burch wrote an opinion piece in TIME on pay equity for women, noting how equal pay benefits society and business across the board.|$|E
5|$|Maharashtraian Brahmins were {{absentee}} landlords {{and lived}} off the surplus without tilling the land themselves per ritual restrictions. They were <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the exploiter of the tiller. This situation {{started to change}} when the newly independent India enshrined in its constitution, agrarian or land reform. Between 1949–1959, the state governments started enacting legislation {{in accordance with the}} constitution implementing this agrarian reform or Kula Kayada in Marathi. The legislation led to the abolition of various absentee tenures like inams and jagirs. This implementation of land reform had mixed results in different States. On official inquiry, it was revealed that not all absentee tenures were abolished in the State of Maharashtra as of 1985. Other social and political issues include anti-Brahminism and the treatment of Dalits.|$|E

5|$|Mary was {{depicted}} by Jacobites as an unfaithful daughter who destroyed her father {{for her own}} and her husband's gain. In {{the early years of}} their reign, she was <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> completely under the spell of her husband, but after she had temporarily governed alone during his absences abroad, she was portrayed as capable and confident. Nahum Tate's A Present for the Ladies (1692) compared her to Queen Elizabeth I. Her modesty and diffidence were praised in works such as A Dialogue Concerning Women (1691) by William Walsh, which compared her to Cincinnatus, the Roman general who took on a great task when called to do so, but then willingly abandoned power.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay {{was part}} of a {{community}} of poets working in Scots and English. These included William Hamilton of Gilbertfield (c. 1665–1751), Robert Crawford (1695–1733), Alexander Ross (1699–1784), the Jacobite William Hamilton of Bangour (1704–54), socialite Alison Rutherford Cockburn (1712–94), and poet and playwright James Thompson's (1700–48), most famous for the nature poetry of his Seasons. Tobias Smollett (1721–71) was a poet, essayist, satirist and playwright, but {{is best known for his}} picaresque novels, such as The Adventures of Roderick Random (1748) and The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751) for which he is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> Scotland's first novelist. His work would be a major influence on later novelists such as Thackeray and Dickens.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Marathon was a {{watershed}} in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars {{can be seen}} to begin at Marathon. The battle also showed the Greeks {{that they were able to}} win battles without the Spartans, as they had heavily relied on Sparta previously. This win was largely due to the Athenians, and Marathon raised Greek esteem of them. Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the Classical Greek civilization, which has been enduringly influential in western society, the Battle of Marathon is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a pivotal moment in Mediterranean and European history.|$|E

5|$|The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 {{appropriated}} {{funding for}} the Interstate Highway System, to construct a vast network of freeways across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the west) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates. Major decommissioning of former routes began with California's highway renumbering in 1964. The 1985 removal of US66 is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{the end of an}} era of US highways.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} expand into new environments {{throughout}} Africa and, ultimately, the world, displays a level of adaptability and, consequently, innovativeness that is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> characteristic of behavioral modernity. This, however, {{is not the only}} evidence of innovativeness that can be seen in early Homo sapiens. The development of new, regionally relevant tools, such as those used for the collection of marine resources seen at Abdur, Ethiopia, Pinnacle Point Cave, South Africa, and Blombos Cave, South Africa. The use of fire demonstrates another innovative aspect of human behavior when it is used in order to create stronger tools, such as the heated silcrete at Blombos, Howiesons Poort and Still Bay, and the heat treated bone tools from Still Bay.|$|E
5|$|Although Greek {{continued}} as {{the language of}} the Byzantine Empire, linguistic distribution in the East was more complex. A Greek-speaking majority lived in the Greek peninsula and islands, western Anatolia, major cities, and some coastal areas. Like Greek and Latin, the Thracian language was of Indo-European origin, as were several now-extinct languages in Anatolia attested by Imperial-era inscriptions. Albanian is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the descendant of Illyrian, although this hypothesis has been challenged by some linguists, who maintain that it derives from Dacian or Thracian. (Illyrian, Dacian, and Thracian, however, may have formed a subgroup or a Sprachbund; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Various Afroasiatic languages—primarily Coptic in Egypt, and Aramaic in Syria and Mesopotamia—were never replaced by Greek. The international use of Greek, however, was one factor enabling the spread of Christianity, as indicated for example by the use of Greek for the Epistles of Paul.|$|E

5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the varied}} and even {{contradictory}} {{interpretations of the}} colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous. In English folklore and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man. Because of its connection with faeries and spirits in early English folklore, green also signified witchcraft, devilry and evil. It can also represent decay and toxicity. When combined with gold, as with the Green Knight and the girdle, green was <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> representing youth's passing. In Celtic mythology, green was associated with misfortune and death, and therefore avoided in clothing. The green girdle, originally worn for protection, {{became a symbol of}} shame and cowardice; it is finally adopted as a symbol of honour by the knights of Camelot, signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; this displays both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour green.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of {{creating}} a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (golden goal), or if one team held a lead {{at the end of}} the first period of extra time (silver goal). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was France's victory over Paraguay in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996. Silver goal was used in Euro 2004. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.|$|E
