A well-known problem is that scatter plots often have a high degree of overlap, which may occlude a significant portion of the data values shown. In this paper, we propose the generalized scatter plot technique, which allows an overlap-free representation of large data sets to fit entirely into the display. The basic idea is to allow the analyst to optimize the degree of <b>overlap</b> and <b>distortion</b> to generate the bestpossible view. To allow an effective usage, we provide the capability to zoom smoothly between the traditional and our generalized scatter plots. We identify an optimization function that takes <b>overlap</b> and <b>distortion</b> of the visualization into acccount. We evaluate the generalized scatter plots according to this optimization function, and show that there usually exists an optimal compromise between <b>overlap</b> and <b>distortion.</b> Our generalized scatter plots have been applied successfully to a number of real-world IT services applications, such as server performance monitoring, telephone service usage analysis and financial data, demonstrating the benefits of the generalized scatter plots over traditional ones.

A well-established model based on kernel functions for input of the maximum length sequence (m-sequence) can be used to estimate nonlinear binary kernel slices using cross-correlation method. In this study, we examine the relevant mathematical properties of kernel slices, particularly their shift-and-product property and <b>overlap</b> <b>distortion</b> problem caused by the irregular shifting of the estimated kernel slices in the cross-correlation function between the input m-sequence and the system output. We then derive the properties of the inverse repeat (IR) m-sequence and propose a method of using IR m-sequence as an input to separately estimate odd- and even-order kernel slices to reduce the chance of kernel-slice overlapping.

According to the magnetic measurements, the magnetic ordering temperature TN (= 560 K) for TlFeO 3 is much lower than that for any other orthoferrites RFeO 3 (R = rare earth). It is suggested that such difference in TN may be explained by different characteristics of the Tl–O and R–O chemical bonds involved and the induced competition with the Fe–O bonds. The effects of covalency and <b>overlap</b> <b>distortion</b> on the spin and charge densities at 57 Fe nuclei are discussed in relation with the hyperfine interactions observed. By using cluster molecular orbital (MO) calculations, it was shown that the low value of the hyperfine magnetic field HFe(= 538 kOe) at 57 Fe nuclei in TlFeO 3 is strongly associated with a decrease of the covalent mixing parameter (bσ) 2 = 0. 048 and (bπ) 2 = 0. 009 values, which characterize the Fe–O bond covalence.

In the insulating (semiconducting) regime, the perovskites are monoclinic, space group P 21 /n, containing two inequivalent Ni 1 (3 +σ) + and Ni 2 (3 ‑σ) + cations; above TMI, the samples become orthorhombic, space group Pbnm, with a single site for Ni 3 +. The 57 Fe Mössbauer spectra of iron-doped (at 1. 5 %) RNiO 3 (R = Tm, Yb) samples recorded below TMI exhibit for Fe 1 and Fe 2 (replacing Ni 1 and Ni 2 sites) hyperfine parameters corresponding to large (Ni 1 O 6) and small (Ni 2 O 6) octahedra.

40|$|Time-frequency {{methods for}} vibration-based gearbox faults {{detection}} {{have been considered}} the most efficient method. Among these methods, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) {{as one of the}} best time-frequency method has been used for both stationary and transitory signals. Some deficiencies of CWT are problem of <b>overlapping</b> and <b>distortion</b> ofsignals. In this condition, a large amount of redundant information exists so that it may cause false alarm or misinterpretation of the operator. In this paper a modified method called Exact Wavelet Analysis is used to minimize the effects of <b>overlapping</b> and <b>distortion</b> in case of gearbox faults. To implement exact wavelet analysis, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used for this purpose. This method have been implemented for the acceleration signals from 2 D acceleration sensor acquired by Advantech PCI- 1710 card from a gearbox test setup in Amirkabir University of Technology. Gearbox has been considered in both healthy and chipped tooth gears conditions. Kernelized Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis functions has used the extracted features from exact wavelet analysis for classification. The efficiency of this classifier is then evaluated with the other signals acquired from the setup test. The results show that in comparison of CWT, PSO Exact Wavelet Transform has better ability in feature extraction in price of more computational effort. In addition, PSO exact wavelet has better speed comparing to Genetic Algorithm (GA) exact wavelet in condition of equal population because of factoring mutation and crossover in PSO algorithm.

50|$|For {{a better}} {{understanding}} {{it is important to}} follow up on how the PJTE is related to intramolecular interactions. In other words, what is the physical driving force of the PJTE distortions (transformations) in terms of well-known electronic structure and bonding? The driving force of the PJTE is added (improved) covalence: the PJTE distortion takes place when it results in energy gain due to better covalence bonding between the atoms in the distorted configuration. Indeed, in the starting high-symmetry configuration the wavefunctions of the electronic states, ground and excited, are orthogonal by definition. By distortion their orthogonality is violated, and a nonzero overlap between them occurs. If for two near-neighbor atoms the ground state wavefunction pertains (mainly) to one of them, while the excited state wavefunction belongs (mainly) to the other one, the <b>overlap</b> by <b>distortion</b> adds covalency to the bonding between them, facilitating the distortion (Fig. 2).|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we apply the {{frequency}} transfer function (FTF) formalism {{to analyze the}} red, green and blue (RGB) phase-shifting fringe-projection profilometry technique. The phase-shifted fringe patterns in RGB fringe projection are typically corrupted by crosstalk because the sensitivity curves of most projection-recording systems <b>overlap.</b> Crosstalk <b>distortion</b> needs to be compensated {{in order to obtain}} high quality measurements. We study phase-demodulation methods for null/mild, moderate, and severe levels of RGB crosstalk. For null/mild crosstalk, we can estimate the searched phase-map using Bruning's 3 -step phase-shifting algorithm (PSA). For moderate crosstalk, the RGB recorded data is usually preprocessed before feeding it into Bruning's PSA; alternatively, in this paper we propose a computationally more efficient approach, which combines crosstalk compensation and phase-demodulation into a single process. For severe RGB crosstalk, we expect non-sinusoidal fringes' profiles (distorting harmonics) and significant uncertainties on the crosstalk calibration (which produces pseudo-detuning error). Analyzing these distorting phenomena, we conclude that squeezing interferometry is the most robust demodulation method for RGB fringe-projection techniques. We support our conclusions with numerical simulations and experimental results. Comment: 12 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

The {{traditional methods of}} the raster pixel data structure {{based on the idea}} of map projections are effective to support local or small-scale areas. However, if this structure is applied to large-scale or whole global image archiving, some significant drawbacks are unavoidable, such as data discontinuity (or <b>overlapping),</b> geometric <b>distortions,</b> etc. To overcome these deficiencies, in this paper the Quaternary Triangular Mesh (QTM) (Dutton, 1989), as a continuous, hierarchal quadtree data structure with uniform grids on a sphere, is proposed for global-scale seamless image archiving.

If all cyan, magenta, and yellow dots overlapped, cyan dots were printed only. If magenta and yellow dots overlapped, magenta dots were printed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces the}} process of optimizing active twist rotor blades {{in the presence of}} embedded anisotropic piezo-composite actuators. Optimum design of active twist blades is a complex task, since it involves a rich design space with tightly coupled design variables. The study presents the development of an optimization framework for active helicopter rotor blade cross-sectional design. This optimization framework allows for exploring a rich and highly nonlinear design space in order to optimize the active twist rotor blades. Different analytical components are combined in the framework: cross-sectional analysis (UM/VABS), an automated mesh generator, a beam solver (DYMORE), a three-dimensional local strain recovery module, and a gradient based optimizer within MATLAB. Through the mathematical optimization problem, the static twist actuation performance of a blade is maximized while satisfying a series of blade constraints. These constraints are associated with locations of the center of gravity and elastic axis, blade mass per unit span, fundamental rotating blade frequencies, and the blade strength based on local three-dimensional strain fields under worst loading conditions. Through pre-processing, limitations of the proposed process have been studied. When limitations were detected, resolution strategies were proposed. These include mesh <b>overlapping,</b> element <b>distortion,</b> trailing edge tab modeling, electrode modeling and foam implementation of the mesh generator, and the initial point sensibility of the current optimization scheme. Examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this process. Optimization studies were performed on the NASA/Army/MIT ATR blade case. Even though that design was built and shown significant impact in vibration reduction, the proposed optimization process showed that the design could be improved significantly. The second example, based on a model scale of the AH- 64 D Apache blade, emphasized the capability of this framework to explore the nonlinear design space of complex planform. Especially for this case, detailed design is carried out to make the actual blade manufacturable. The proposed optimization framework is shown to be an effective tool to design high authority active twist blades to reduce vibration in future helicopter rotor blades...|$|R
40|$|Conformational {{diversity}} of the native state plays {{a central role in}} modulating protein function. The selection paradigm sustains that different ligands shift the conformational equilibrium through their binding to highest-affinity conformers. Intramolecular vibrational dynamics associated to each conformation should guarantee conformational transitions, which due to its importance, could possibly be associated with evolutionary conserved traits. Normal mode analysis, based on a coarse-grained model of the protein, can provide the required information to explore these features. Herein, we present a novel procedure to identify key positions sustaining the conformational diversity associated to ligand binding. The method is applied to an adequate refined dataset of 188 paired protein structures in their bound and unbound forms. Firstly, normal modes most involved in the conformational change are selected according to their corresponding <b>overlap</b> with structural <b>distortions</b> introduced by ligand binding. The subspace defined by these modes is used to analyze the effect of simulated point mutations on preserving the conformational {{diversity of}} the protein. We find a negative correlation between the effects of mutations on these normal mode subspaces associated to ligand-binding and position-specific evolutionary conservations obtained from multiple sequence-structure alignments. Positions whose mutations are found to alter the most these subspaces are defined as key positions, that is, dynamically important residues that mediate the ligand-binding conformational change. These positions are shown to be evolutionary conserved, mostly buried aliphatic residues localized in regular structural regions of the protein like β-sheets and α-helix...|$|R

We surveyed 30 x 25 arcmin region, and the EIGs were found only near the cluster center (< 2. 3 arcmin ~ 750 kpc). The parent galaxies of the EIGs are star-forming or post-starburst galaxies, {{all of which}} are spectroscopically confirmed members of the cluster. Four out of the nine parent galaxies show distortion of stellar distribution in the disk, which can be a sign of recent interaction, and the interaction may have made EIGs. On the other hand, six parent galaxies (one <b>overlaps</b> those exhibiting <b>distortion)</b> show H-alpha emission without stars, which implies a ram pressure stripping. The spe ctrum of the brightest parent galaxy shows a post-starburst signature, and resembles the H-alpha stripped galaxies found in the Coma cluster. Meanwhile, two brightest parent galaxies in A 851 are more massive than the EIG parent galaxies in the Coma cluster. This is consistent with "downsizing" of star-forming galaxies, though it is still in a statistical fluctuation. We also analyzed Suprime-Cam data of another z= 0. 39 cluster, CL 0024 + 17, but found no EIGs. The key difference between A 851 and CL 0024 + 17 would be the existence of a subcluster colliding with the main body of A 851, in which six or seven out of the nine parent galaxies in A 851 exist, and the fraction of EIGs in the subcluster is significantly higher than the main subcluster of A 851 and CL 0024 + 17.

40|$|Assertive {{diagnosis}} of cancer, Alzheimers disease, epilepsy and other metabolic diseases is essentialto provide {{patients with the}} adequate treatment. Recently, different invasive and non-invasive techniques {{have been developed for}} this purpose, nevertheless, due to their harmless properties the non-invasive techniques have gained more value. Magnetic Resonance is a well-known non-invasive technique that provides spectra (metabolite peaks) and images (anatomical structures) of the examined tissue. In Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), molecules containing certain excitable nuclei, such as 1 H, provide the metabolite information. As a consequence, the peaks in the MR spectra correspond to observable metabolites which are the biomarkers of diseases. Finally, metabolite concentrations arecomputed and compared against normal values in order to establish the diagnosis. The method to obtain such amplitudes is also called quantification and its accuracy is essential for diagnosis assessment. Quantification of MRS signals is affected by a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a residual water resonance, lineshape <b>distortions,</b> <b>overlapping</b> resonances and underlying macromolecules and lipids affecting their baseline. Our ultimate goal was, therefore, the development of signal processing toolsand algorithms to improve the quantification of MRS signals. For this, we first proposed a heuristic method to improve the residual water filtering using Hankel Singular Value Decomposition (HSVD). Additionally, a method for lineshape estimation of distorted MR spectra was developed and evaluated in simulated, in vitro and in vivo signals. Furthermore, a baseline approach was implemented via a parametric modelling method based on prior knowledge acquired from a set of in vivo macromolecular signals (measured via inversion recovery), which aims at avoiding long measurements and allowing a flexible set of baseline components. Finally, for the analysis of quantification results we focused on an automatic evaluation of the residual, thereby benefiting MRS spectral analysis in the clinic.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} spectroscopy (MRS) {{has been}} shown to have great clinical potential as a supplement to magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer (CaP). MRS provides functional information in the form of changes in the relative concentration of specific metabolites including choline, creatine, and citrate which can be used to identify potential areas of CaP. With a view to assisting radiologists in interpretation and analysis of MRS data, some researchers have begun to develop computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes for CaP identification from spectroscopy. Most of these schemes have been centered on identifying and integrating the area under metabolite peaks which is then used to compute relative metabolite ratios. However, manual identification of metabolite peaks on the MR spectra, and especially via CAD, is a challenging problem due to low signal-to-noise ratio, baseline irregularity, peak <b>overlap,</b> and peak <b>distortion.</b> In this article the authors present a novel CAD scheme that integrates nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) with an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to automatically identify suspicious regions on the prostate using MRS and hence avoids the need to explicitly identify metabolite peaks. The methodology comprises two stages. In stage 1, a hierarchical spectral clustering algorithm is used to distinguish between extracapsular and prostatic spectra in order to localize the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to the prostate. Once the prostate ROI is localized, in stage 2, a NLDR scheme, in conjunction with a replicated clustering algorithm, is used to automatically discriminate between three classes of spectra (normal appearing, suspicious appearing, and indeterminate). The methodology was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated on a total of 18 1. 5 T in vivo prostate T 2 -weighted (w) and MRS studies obtained from the multisite, multi-institutional American College of Radiology (ACRIN) trial. In the absence of the precise ground truth for CaP extent on the MR imaging for most of the ACRIN studies, probabilistic quantitative metrics were defined based on partial knowledge on the quadrant location and size of the tumor. The scheme, when evaluated against this partial ground truth, was found to have a CaP detection sensitivity of 89. 33 % and specificity of 79. 79 %. The results obtained from randomized threefold and fivefold cross validation suggest that the NLDR based clustering scheme has a higher CaP detection accuracy compared to such commonly used MRS analysis schemes as z score and PCA. In addition, the scheme was found to be robust to changes in system parameters. For 6 of the 18 studies an expert radiologist laboriously labeled each of the individual spectra according to a five point scale, with 1 ∕ 2 representing spectra that the expert considered normal and 3 ∕ 4 ∕ 5 being spectra the expert deemed suspicious. When evaluated on these expert annotated datasets, the CAD system yielded an average sensitivity (cluster corresponding to suspicious spectra being identified as the CaP class) and specificity of 81. 39 % and 64. 71 %, respectively...|$|R
