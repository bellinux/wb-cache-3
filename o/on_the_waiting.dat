50|$|A futex {{consists}} of a kernelspace wait queue that is attached to an aligned integer in userspace.

A properly programmed futex-based lock will not use system calls except when the lock is contended; since most operations do not require arbitration between processes, this will not happen in most cases.|$|R

25|$|Tickets to Maple Leafs' {{home games}} {{have long been}} among the most {{difficult}} to acquire even during losing seasons. The Air Canada Centre holds 18,900 seats for Leafs games, with 15,500 reserved for season ticket holders. Because of the demand for season tickets, their sale is limited to the 10,000 people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list. As of March 2016, Leafs' season tickets saw a renewal rate of 99.5 percent, a rate that would require more than 250 years to clear the existing waiting list. With an average of US$1.9 million per game, the Leafs had the highest average ticket revenue per game in the 2007–08 season.|$|E
25|$|The Packers have an {{exceptionally}} loyal fan base. Regardless of team performance, every game played in Green Bay {{has been sold}} out since 1960. Despite the Packers having by far the smallest local TV market, the team consistently {{ranks as one of}} the most popular in the NFL. They also have one of the longest season ticket waiting lists in professional sports, 86,000 names long, more than there are seats at Lambeau Field. The average wait is said to be over 30 years, but with only 90 or so tickets turned over annually it would be 955 years before the newest name on the list got theirs. As a result, season tickets are willed to next of kin and newborns placed optimistically <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list.|$|E
25|$|Literally {{the four}} paths of distraint, a {{process by which}} one could, under certain circumstances, seize goods owed by another. However, in Brehon law one does not {{immediately}} own the property, rather animals are taken to an intermediary land to wait in case the original owner pays the debt. As time passes, the animals are slowly forfeited. This tract deals primarily with four types of distraint, divided based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> period. The waiting period apparently varies based on the circumstance although {{no one has yet}} determined what exactly those circumstances are.

25|$|Although the {{capacity}} {{has more than}} doubled since Lambeau Field was opened, demand for tickets remains high. The Packers have sold out every game since 1960, and at least 115,000 names are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list (with a reported average wait time of 30 years). The sell-out streak has had the effect (intended or not) of ensuring that all Packers home games are televised in Green Bay and Milwaukee, a streak that started in 1973 (prior to that time, local telecasts of home games were disallowed regardless of how many tickets were sold); the Packers are one of four NFL teams (the others being the Washington Redskins, Denver Broncos, and Pittsburgh Steelers) that have not had a home game blacked out since the 1973 blackout rules were put into place.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{transplantation}} has changed survival from {{as low as}} 15% in the pretransplant era to more than 60% today. Liver transplantation is indicated for many patients with ALF, and survival rates of 56–90% can be achieved. In addition to transplantation, better critical care and the trend toward more benign causes, such as acetaminophen, all contribute to improved survival rates. Spontaneous survival is now around 40%. The application of transplantation among patients with ALF remains low, suggesting that the full potential of this modality may not be realized. Timely availability of an allograft {{is one of the}} major factors determining transplant outcomes. In the largest U.S. study, only 29% of patients received a liver graft, while 10% of the overall group (one fourth of patients listed for transplantation) died <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list. Other series have reported death rates of those listed for transplant as high as 40%.|$|E
