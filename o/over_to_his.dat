5|$|After {{waiting for}} several years, {{the team was}} finally {{admitted}} into the Big Ten Conference as a regular member in 1953. They promptly went on to capture the league championship (losing only one game during the season) and beating UCLA in their first Rose Bowl game. After the 1953 season Biggie Munn, the legendary Spartan coach, turned the team <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> protégé and future legend Duffy Daugherty. Daughtery {{went on to win}} the 1956 Rose Bowl. George Perles was the head coach when the Spartans defeated USC in the 1988 Rose Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Barbera's {{first foray}} into {{television}} was a 1957 collaboration with Robert D. Buchanan, Colonel Bleep. The series, the first ever cartoon produced specifically for color television, would feature some of the futuristic designs and limited animation Barbera would later carry <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> other television productions. Barbera's involvement in Colonel Bleep (and with Buchanan) was apparently short-lived; his only known credited involvement was a creator credit.|$|E
5|$|Barron's fragile health necessitated his resignation; {{he passed}} command to John Rodgers in late May 1805. Barron ordered Cox to command Essex, and turned President <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother, James Barron, on 29May. On 3June, after the Battle of Derne, the U.S signed {{a peace treaty}} with Tripoli. President sailed for the United States on 13July, {{carrying}} the ailing Barron and many sailors released from captivity in Tripoli.|$|E

She is upset when Mark tells her {{he has to go}} out of town but decides to go <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> house to seduce him. She is horrified to meet Mark's wife, Kate, whom she'd originally assumed to be Mark's housekeeper. While initially hostile, the two women befriend one another. Kate then discovers that he is seeing yet another woman, whom she at first believes to be Carly, but they both discover that Mark is seeing a third woman: Amber.|$|E
5|$|During the Games, Romanian gymnast Andreea Răducan won {{the gold}} in women's artistic {{individual}} all-around, so she stripped her gold medal after she tested a banned positive substance. As so, her teammates Simona Amânar and Maria Olaru, originally won silver and bronze, upgraded to gold and silver, respectively. While Chinese gymnast Liu Xuan moved up to bronze. At freestyle wrestling 76 kg event Alexander Leipold of Germany stripped off his gold medal after he was tested positive for nandrolone, handing it <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> American rival Brandon Slay.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a disappointing}} 4–7–2 season the next year, Potteiger was {{replaced}} by LeRoy Andrews. Before the 1929 season, Mara purchased the entire squad of the Detroit Wolverines, including star quarterback Benny Friedman. The Wolverines had finished in third place the year before. Led by Friedman, New York's record soared to 13–1–1. However, their lone loss was a 20–6 setback in November to the Green Bay Packers, and by virtue of this win, and their 12–0–1 record, won the NFL title. Following the season, Mara transferred ownership <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> two sons to insulate the team from creditors. At the time, Jack was just 22, and Wellington only 14.|$|E

After he and his brother split the business in 1986, Michel took the Waterside Inn, which he handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son, Alain, in 2002. He remains an active food writer and has appeared on television shows such as Saturday Kitchen, MasterChef, the Roux family centric series, The Roux Legacy, and on the Woman's Hour programme on BBC Radio 4.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Crease {{presided over}} the trial of John Hall, who owned {{most of the land}} on Burrard Inlet that now makes up the {{community}} of Belcarra, British Columbia, and who was accused of murdering his mother in law. Hall and Crease had known each other for years, and Crease had once employed him as his agent in a dispute with trespassers who illegally logged on land he and his friend Robert Burnaby owned near Hall's ranch. Hall was found guilty of manslaughter, and his land signed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> attorney to pay for his defence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} spring Augustus {{suffered}} a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure {{the continuation of the}} Principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.|$|E

5|$|On 4 August 1972, Amin {{issued a}} decree {{ordering}} {{the expulsion of}} the 50,000 Asians who were British passport holders. This was later amended to include all 60,000 Asians who were not Ugandan citizens. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians emigrated to the UK. Others went to Commonwealth countries such as Australia, South Africa, Canada, and Fiji, or to India, Kenya, Pakistan, Sweden, Tanzania, and the United States. Amin expropriated businesses and properties belonging to the Asians and the Europeans and handed them <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> supporters. The businesses were mismanaged, and industries collapsed from lack of maintenance. This proved disastrous for the already declining economy.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 14 March 2014, his corpse was handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sister and two nephews in Morelia by state authorities. As they left the {{forensic}} installations, they covered their faces in front of cameras and did not specify if they had plans {{to carry out a}} funeral for Moreno González. His family and friends, however, held a funeral for him at the Santa Cruz funeral home in Altozano, Morelia. They did not comment where the corpse was to be taken, but unconfirmed reports suggested that there were plans to cremate him and scatter his ashes at a village in the Tierra Caliente region in Michoacán.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{submitted}} a last request to walk under the stars, play basketball, and watch science-fiction films to prison warden Hank Galetka. Parsons also {{asked for his}} remains to be cremated and turned <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> family. Prison spokesperson Jack Ford said that the requests would be granted, but that Parsons would only be allowed to shoot some hoops in a fenced recreation area instead of a game of basketball in the prison gymnasium. The authorities were concerned that an injury could delay the execution. Parsons was permitted to walk outdoors at night {{to the place of}} execution.|$|E

5|$|Samuel Colt died of gout in Hartford on January 10, 1862, and {{was buried}} in Cedar Hill Cemetery. At {{the time of his}} death, Colt's estate, which he left to his wife and three-year-old son Caldwell Hart Colt, was {{estimated}} to be valued at around $15 million ($350 million by 2009 standards). His professional responsibilities were turned <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother-in-law, Richard Jarvis. The only other person mentioned in Colt's will was Samuel Caldwell Colt, the son of his brother, John.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the New York Giants from 1925 to 1978 covers the American {{football}} franchise from the team's inception until the conclusion of their tumultuous 1978 season. Currently members of the NFL's National Football Conference, the Giants were founded in 1925 by original owner Tim Mara in the then five-year-old NFL. Mara gave control of the team <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> two sons—Wellington and Jack—early in their lives. During this period in their history the Giants acquired four NFL championships, but also suffered some down times, including consecutive non-playoff seasons from 1964 to 1978.|$|E
5|$|When Bohemond III died in April, Bohemond of Tripoli {{hurried to}} Antioch, where, {{because he was}} the late duke's closest living relative, he was {{recognized}} by the commune of the townspeople as his father's rightful heir. The nobles who had regarded Raymond-Roupen (the only son of BohemondIII's eldest son) the lawful prince, fled to the Kingdom of Cilicia. Bohemond repaid a loan that Raymond III of Tripoli had long before borrowed from the Knights Hospitaller, thus winning them <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> side.|$|E

5|$|When the Mongols invaded Syria and {{threatened}} Damascus after conquering Aleppo in 1260, An-Nasir fled from Damascus, leaving the city virtually undefended. The notables of Damascus started {{negotiations with the}} Mongol ruler Hulagu Khan; the city was handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> general Kitbuqa in 1260. When the Mongol army left Damascus to quell rebellions in the countryside, the Ayyubid garrison of the citadel revolted, {{as they had been}} instructed to do by An-Nasir. In response, the Mongols besieged the citadel in 1260. The garrison surrendered after heavy bombardments and without hope of being relieved by An-Nasir. The defences of the citadel were then largely dismantled.|$|E
5|$|Al-Hajjaj {{initially}} retreated {{before the}} rebels' superior numbers, but quickly defeated and drove {{them out of}} Basra. Nevertheless, the rebels seized Kufa, where supporters started flocking. The revolt gained widespread support among those who were discontented with the Umayyad regime, especially the religious scholars known as qurrāʾ ("Quran readers"). Caliph Abd al-Malik tried to negotiate terms, including the dismissal of al-Hajjaj, but the hardliners among the rebel leadership pressured Ibn al-Ash'ath into rejecting the Caliph's terms. In the subsequent Battle of Dayr al-Jamajim, the rebel army was decisively defeated by al-Hajjaj's Syrian troops. Al-Hajjaj pursued the survivors, who under Ibn al-Ash'ath fled to the east. Most of the rebels were captured by the governor of Khurasan, while Ibn al-Ash'ath himself fled to Zabulistan. His fate is unclear, as some accounts hold that, after long pressure from al-Hajjaj to surrender him, the Zunbīl executed him, while most sources claim that he committed suicide to avoid being handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> enemies.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Philip further {{provoked}} Rhodes by attacking Cius, {{which was an}} Aetolian-allied city {{on the coast of}} the Sea of Marmara. Despite attempts by Rhodes and other states to mediate a settlement, Philip captured and razed Cius as well as its neighbour Myrleia. Philip then handed these cities <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother-in-law, the King of Bithynia, Prusias I who rebuilt and renamed the cities Prusa after himself and Apameia after his wife, respectively. In return for these cities Prusias promised that he would continue on expanding his kingdom at the expense of Pergamum (his latest war with Pergamum had ended in 205). The seizure of these cities also enraged the Aetolians, as both were members of the Aetolian League. The alliance between Aetolia and Macedon was held together only by the Aetolians' fear of Philip, and this incident worsened the already tenuous relationship. Philip next compelled the cities of Lysimachia and Chalcedon, which were also members of the Aetolian League, to break off their alliance with Aetolia probably through the threatened use of violence.|$|E
