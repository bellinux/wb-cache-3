5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on <b>ocean</b> <b>temperature,</b> a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.|$|E
5|$|At 0930UTC on August17, {{the center}} of Hurricane Dean passed into the Caribbean Sea through the Saint Lucia Channel between the islands of Martinique and St. Lucia. The {{northern}} eyewall passed over Martinique where a weather station in the island's capital of Fort-de-France reported 13in (33cm) of rainfall. By this time the eyewall had closed, forming a distinct eye, and {{in an environment of}} low wind shear and increasing <b>ocean</b> <b>temperature</b> the hurricane began to intensify rapidly. Hurricane Dean strengthened to a Category3 hurricane by the evening of August17. Satellite imagery showed that a well defined eye and numerous cyclonically curved convective bands remained over the Lesser Antilles. That evening, another reconnaissance aircraft reached the hurricane and discovered that it had strengthened into a Category4 hurricane, and by 0600UTC on August18, Dean reached Category5 intensity {{for the first time with}} 165mph (270km/h) winds. The storm's wind radii increased in all quadrants as the storm grew in both intensity and size. At 0800UTC August18, Hurricane Dean passed directly over NOAA sea buoy 42059 which reported a significant wave height (average size of the largest 33% of waves) of 33ft (10m). On August18, Hurricane Dean developed a double eyewall, indicating that an eyewall replacement cycle was taking place and causing short term fluctuations in intensity as Dean weakened back to a Category4 hurricane. That afternoon the hurricane continued to improve its outflow, and its numerous spiral bands gave it a well defined satellite presentation. Hurricane Dean finished the eyewall replacement cycle early on August19 with some trochiodal wobbles.|$|E

25|$|Marine {{energy or}} marine power (also {{sometimes}} referred to as ocean energy, ocean power, or marine and hydrokinetic energy) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and <b>ocean</b> <b>temperature</b> differences.

25|$|The oceanic {{aspects of}} these circulations can {{generate}} variability on centennial timescales {{due to the}} ocean having hundreds of times more mass than in the atmosphere, and thus very high thermal inertia.

Due to the long timescales of this circulation, <b>ocean</b> <b>temperature</b> at depth is still adjusting to effects of the Little Ice Age which occurred between the 1600 and 1800s.|$|E
5000|$|The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority {{considers}} {{the greatest threat}} to the Great Barrier Reef to be climate change, causing ocean warming which increases coral bleaching.

25|$|The {{temperature}} of the WSC is highly variable. It often depends on atmospheric conditions which are highly variable in their own right. In general, however, the warmest core {{temperature of}} the Atlantic Water in the WSC is around 2.75 °C near Svalbard to 2.25 °C near Franz Josef Land to 1.0 °C north of the new Siberian Islands. Salinity in this warm core is often greater than 34.95 psu. <b>Ocean</b> <b>temperature</b> values {{for the beginning of}} the WSC are typically between 6 and 8 °C with salinities between 35.1 and 35.3 psu.|$|E
25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is supported by}} the data indicating no significant seasonal velocity changes at the calving front and the acceleration propagating upglacier from the calving front. The cause of the thinning could be a combination of increased surface ablation and basal ablation as one report presents data that show a sudden increase in subsurface <b>ocean</b> <b>temperature</b> in 1997 along the entire west coast of Greenland, and suggests that the changes in Jakobshavn Glacier are due to the arrival of relatively warm water originating from the Irminger Sea near Iceland.|$|E
25|$|This empirically derived {{approximation}} equation is reasonably accurate for normal temperatures, concentrations of salinity {{and the range}} of most ocean depths. <b>Ocean</b> <b>temperature</b> varies with depth, but at between 30 and 100 meters there is often a marked change, called the thermocline, dividing the warmer surface water from the cold, still waters that make {{up the rest of the}} ocean. This can frustrate sonar, because a sound originating on one side of the thermocline tends to be bent, or refracted, through the thermocline. The thermocline may be present in shallower coastal waters. However, wave action will often mix the water column and eliminate the thermocline. Water pressure also affects sound propagation: higher pressure increases the sound speed, which causes the sound waves to refract away from the area of higher sound speed. The mathematical model of refraction is called Snell's law.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the early}} 1910s, {{there was no}} system in place to track icebergs to guard ships against collisions, most likely because they weren't {{considered}} a serious threat as ships had managed to survive even direct crashes. In 1907, SS Kronprinz Wilhelm, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow, but {{was still able to}} complete her voyage. The April 1912 sinking of the Titanic however changed all that, and created the demand for a system to observe icebergs. For the remainder of the ice season of that year, the United States Navy patrolled the waters and monitored ice flow. In November 1913, the International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea met in London to devise a more permanent system of observing icebergs. Within three months the participating maritime nations had formed the International Ice Patrol (IIP). The goal of the IIP was to collect data on meteorology and oceanography to measure currents, ice-flow, <b>ocean</b> <b>temperature,</b> and salinity levels. They published their first records in 1921, which allowed for a year-by-year comparison of iceberg movement.|$|E
25|$|Marine energy (also {{sometimes}} referred to as ocean energy) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and <b>ocean</b> <b>temperature</b> differences. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries. The term marine energy encompasses both wave powerpower from surface waves, and tidal powerobtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016 it is being tested at a small scale (50 kW). Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water. The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.|$|E
25|$|Another factor {{important}} to consider {{in the understanding of}} the fishery's collapse is the uncertainty inherent in the assessment of the cod as a resource. Management of a resource is an extremely complex task, with a multitude of interests, perspectives, and sources of information to take into account; when knowledge regarding the resource is limited, or clouded by imprecision, the task of managing it becomes even more difficult. The management of fisheries are associated with an especially high degree of uncertainty due to problems inherent {{in the nature of the}} resource. Newfoundland's cod fisheries were no exception: an imperfect understanding of the ocean ecosystem; technical and environmental challenges associated with observation techniques, which led to incomplete data on the resource (the cod); and the naturally high levels of variability in the population due to dynamic environmental factors (such as <b>ocean</b> <b>temperature)</b> combined to make the discernment of the effects of exploitation an arduous task. Unfortunately, this led to predictions about the condition and future of the cod stock that were mired in uncertainty, making it more difficult for the government to choose the appropriate course of action.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{contributed to}} {{exceptional}} activity. A strong El Niño observed in 2009 rapidly transitioned into a strong La Niña by mid-summer 2010, projecting anomalously low vertical wind shear across the Atlantic <b>Ocean.</b> <b>Ocean</b> <b>temperatures</b> reached record levels across the basin, averaging at 0.82°C above the 1981–2010 average. Not only did <b>ocean</b> <b>temperatures</b> surpass 2005 {{to break the}} record overall, averaged water temperatures across the Main Development Region (MDR) of the Atlantic set monthly records from February to October 2010. This was aided by a strongly negative North Atlantic Oscillation that contributed to weaker trade winds and thus anomalous warming of <b>ocean</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{in the months leading}} up to the hurricane season. Lower sea level pressures were prevalent throughout much of the season, trailing only 1955 for the lowest average values across the MDR during the August to October period. In spite of the high number of tropical cyclones, mid-level dry air dominated the tropical Atlantic throughout the peak of the season, perhaps hindering the season from being even more active.|$|R
