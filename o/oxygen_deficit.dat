5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a jet {{of water}} from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficit.</b>|$|E

40|$|Shallow {{tropical}} integrated culture ponds in the Pearl River Delta, China, {{have been}} found to stratify almost daily, with high organic loadings and dense algal growth. The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration is super-saturated in the epilimnion and is under 2 mg/l in the hypolimnion (> 1 m). The compensation depth corresponds to twice the Secchi disk depth ranging from 50 to 80 cm. As a result, little or no net oxygen is produced in the hypolimnion (> 1 m). The low DO concentration in the hypolimnion causes organic materials, such as unused organic wastes and senescent algae cells, to be incompletely oxidized, since the rate of oxygen consumption by oxidable matter in water is dependent on the dissolved oxygen concentration in water. This material becomes the source of hypolimnetic <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficits</b> (HOD) which can drive whole pond DO to a dangerously low level, should sudden destratification occur.

40|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} {{alters the}} metabolism {{of the most}} common type of cell found in the liver, the hepatocyte. The presence of alcohol in the body causes the liver to use more oxygen—for example, when breaking down the alcohol. Increased oxygen use, in turn, causes <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficits</b> in several key cells, particularly in hepatocytes located near the small hepatic veins. These veins return blood to the heart for re-oxygenation after it has passed through the liver. Hepatocytes surrounding these veins are the first to show signs of liver disease. The damage induced by <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficits</b> may be exacerbated by alcohol-induced deficits in other components that are essential for cell survival. For example, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s main source of energy, is generated primarily during the course of two sets of metabolic reactions: glycolysis and the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation process. Alcohol consumption may interfere with both of these pathways of ATP production through several mechanisms. An inadequate supply of ATP impairs the cell’s ability to perform critical functions, including the repair of alcohol-induced cell damage, and may therefore contribute to cell death and alcoholic liver disease.

The exercise protocol consisted of runs to exhaustion at speeds predicted to represent 120 % and 130 % of V˙ O 2 max. Arterialised blood samples were obtained from a pre-warmed hand via a catheter inserted into a forearm vein. Samples were taken at rest and after 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 min of recovery.

40|$|Physiochemical Parameters of Ponds during Hydrological Year The {{aim of this}} Bachelor thesis was to use the {{obtained}} {{data for}} the assessment of these physiochemical parameters on growth of the carp. The obtained data and their influence on carp grow were compared with literature. The physiochemical parameters had measured on the 29 th June, 16 th July, 12 th August and 4 th October on the Dehtář pond. The followed physiochemical parameters were measured: concentration of oxygen (mg-l- 1), temperature of water (°C), pH, transparency (m) and chlorophyll concentration (?g-l- 1). It was used calibrated measuring device EXO 2 and a Secchi disc. The pond was measured in two transects with focus on depth, inflow, outflow and feeding area. For better evaluation of the results it had included the continuous measurements data from Vltava River Authority, particularly the concentration of oxygen, temperature and light regime. The Dehtář pond is used mainly for intense fish-pond management. Fishery Hluboká manages on this pond. Stock of the pond is polyculture. Dominant fish is common carp, next for example grass carp, pike, pikeperch and catfish. The pond is regular fed, limed and fertilized. From those data, it has produced the spatial and temporal visualisation of basic physiochemical parameters in the pond. From the spatial visualisation follows that the quality of inflow water, depth of water, meteorological situation and position of feeding area had a significant influence on physiochemical parameters. From the temporal visualisation follows that the highest differences in our data were during temperature stratification on 29 th June 2016. This day range of the pH was from 7. 1 to 9. 1. During the other days pH was just about 8. On 29 th of June 2016 the range of the temperature was quite high. The temperature was from 19. 8 °C to 24. 8 °C. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>deficits</b> were very often on this pond. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>deficits</b> had big influence on the death of fishes. The concentration of oxygen went down under the limit values (0. 5 mg-l- 1) for 2 times during the Vltava River Authority measuring. The local places of low concentration of oxygen had located on the depth of 1. 5 m for 25 times during the Vltava River Authority measuring. The Vltava River Authority regularly takes measurements on the Dehtář pond. It should be used for better management and for preventing the critical situation, particularly the drop of oxygen, which could harm the fish.

In a section across the tropical Atlantic, we show that macroscopic particle peaks occurred frequently in the deep sea, whereas microscopic particles were barely detectable.

50|$|The {{downward}} flux {{of organic}} matter decreases sharply with depth, with 80-90% being consumed in the top 1000m. The deep ocean thus has higher oxygen because rates of oxygen consumption are low compared with the supply of cold, oxygen-rich deep waters from polar regions. In the surface layers, oxygen is supplied by exchange with the atmosphere. Depths in between, however, have higher rates of oxygen consumption and lower rates of advective supply of oxygen-rich waters.

Here, we study the dynamics of the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone in a Lagrangian framework, using a coupled physical-biogeochemical numerical model and finite-size Lyapunov exponent fields, to evaluate the role of mesoscale activity. We find that, at depths between 380 and 600 m, mesoscale structures have two distinct roles. First, their mean positions and paths delimit and maintain the oxygen minimum zone boundaries. Second, their high-frequency fluctuations inject oxygen across the oxygen minimum zone boundaries and eddy fluxes are one order of magnitude higher than mean oxygen fluxes.

The severe environmental conditions can impact on metabolism and direct selection of mitochondrial DNA. As a wide-ranging animal, the domestic horse (Equus caballus) has developed various morphological and physiological characteristics for adapting to different altitudes. Thus, this is a good species for studying adaption to high altitudes at a molecular level. We sequenced the complete NADH dehydrogenase 6 gene (ND 6) of 509 horses from 24 sampling locations. By comparative analysis of three horse populations living at different altitudes (> 2200 m, 1200 - 1700 m, and < 900 m), we found that the high-altitude population had the lowest genetic diversity and significant negative Tajima’s D; both values declined with increasing elevation. Moreover, non-directional selection was identified for the ND 6 gene by a tree-based relative ratio test (P = 0. 007); the highest proportion of high-altitude horses was found distributed on the selected branches.
