Pycnoporellus alboluteus has a monomitic hyphal system, meaning {{it is made}} of {{generative}} hyphae, which are thin-walled, branched, and narrow. Hyphae in the flesh layer are thin- to thick-walled, frequently branched, and measure 2–10µm in diameter, while those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pores</b> are roughly similar in morphology, but measure 3–5µm. Both forms have a thin incrustation on their walls that gives them a rough appearance when viewed with a light microscope. The hymenium (spore-bearing tissue layer) is 40–60µm thick, and has abundant cystidia, which are hyaline, and measure 7–9µm in diameter. They are cylindrical, thin-walled to moderately thick-walled, hyaline, have a septum at the base, and measure 60–120 by 5–10µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 25–35 by 6–7µm.|$|E

Cystidia {{on the sides}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with swollen middles and long necks, measuring 33–48 by 7.3–13.5μm; cheilocystidia (on the edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pores)</b> have a similar morphology. The cap cuticle is made of cylindrical hyphae 3.7–5.8μm wide that are interwoven compactly, and the hyphal tips are erect and arranged in bundles. In contrast, the hyphae of the cap flesh is loosely interwoven with hyphae that are cylindrical and branched, measuring 3.7–8.8μm. Hyphae do not contain clamp connections. The mycelium is an unusual yellow colour.|$|E

Grayish-yellow or greenish yellow when mounted in a dilute {{potassium}} hydroxide, they are dextrinoid (yellowish- or reddish-brown) when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), four-spored, and measure 28.8–42.3 by 7.2–11.7µm.

Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the surface of the}} tubes) range in shape from somewhat spindle-shaped to cylindrical, and are hyaline, smooth, and thin-walled, with dimensions of 41.4–61.2 by 7.2–10.8µm.

25|$|Porosity (n) is a {{directly}} measurable aquifer property; it is {{a fraction}} between 0 and 1 indicating {{the amount of}} pore space between unconsolidated soil particles or within a fractured rock. Typically, the majority of groundwater (and anything dissolved in it) moves through the porosity available to flow (sometimes called effective porosity). Permeability {{is an expression of}} the connectedness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pores.</b> For instance, an unfractured rock unit may have a high porosity (it has lots of holes between its constituent grains), but a low permeability (none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pores</b> are connected). An example of this phenomenon is pumice, which, when in its unfractured state, can make a poor aquifer.|$|E

25|$|Overton (a {{distant cousin}} of Charles Darwin) first {{proposed}} {{the concept of}} a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the lipid membrane was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to anions, Leonor Michaelis concluded that ions are adsorbed to the walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pores,</b> changing the permeability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pores</b> to ions by electrostatic repulsion. Michaelis demonstrated the membrane potential (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane. Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a lipid bilayer membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle & Conway showed that the membrane of resting frog muscle was permeable to both K+ and Cl-, but apparently not to Na+, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to K+ , H+, and Cl- as well as the impermeability to Na+, Ca+, and Mg++.|$|E
25|$|This {{extraordinary}} strong {{frequency dependence}} {{can be explained}} by the different distances the ions have to move in the electrode's pores. The area at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pores</b> can easily be accessed by the ions. The short distance is accompanied by low electrical resistance. The greater the distance the ions have to cover, the higher the resistance. This phenomenon can be described with a series circuit of cascaded RC (resistor/capacitor) elements with serial RC time constants. These result in delayed current flow, reducing the total electrode surface area that can be covered with ions if polarity changes – capacitance decreases with increasing AC frequency. Thus, the total capacitance is only achieved after longer measuring times.|$|E
40|$|Light and {{transmission}} electron microscopy were used to describe <b>the</b> leaf cavity <b>pore</b> <b>of</b> Azolla. <b>The</b> morphological analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pore</b> revealed that it remains open during leaf development {{as well as in}} mature leaves.

25|$|If {{water is}} not allowed to flow in or out of the soil, the stress path is called an {{undrained}} stress path. During undrained shear, if the particles are surrounded by a nearly incompressible fluid such as water, then the density of the particles cannot change without drainage, but the water pressure and effective stress will change. On the other hand, if the fluids are allowed to freely drain out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pores,</b> then the pore pressures will remain constant and the test path is called a drained stress path. The soil is free to dilate or contract during shear if the soil is drained. In reality, soil is partially drained, somewhere between the perfectly undrained and drained idealized conditions.|$|E
25|$|Metal-organic {{frameworks}} represent another {{class of}} synthetic porous materials that store hydrogen and energy {{at the molecular}} level. MOFs are highly crystalline inorganic-organic hybrid structures that contain metal clusters or ions (secondary building units) as nodes and organic ligands as linkers. When guest molecules (solvent) occupying the pores are removed during solvent exchange and heating under vacuum, porous structure of MOFs can be achieved without destabilizing the frame and hydrogen molecules will be adsorbed onto the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pores</b> by physisorption. Compared to traditional zeolites and porous carbon materials, MOFs have very high number of pores and surface area which allow higher hydrogen uptake in a given volume. Thus, research interests on hydrogen storage in MOFs have been growing since 2003 when the first MOF-based hydrogen storage was introduced. Since there are infinite geometric and chemical variations of MOFs based on different combinations of SBUs and linkers, many researches explore what combination will provide the maximum hydrogen uptake by varying materials of metal ions and linkers.|$|E
25|$|Early implant designs had the {{potential}} to loosen from their attachment to the bones, typically becoming painful ten to twelve years after placement. In addition, erosion of the bone around the implant was seen on x-rays. Initially, surgeons believed this was caused by an abnormal reaction to the cement holding the implant in place. That belief prompted a search for an alternative method to attach the implants. The Austin Moore device had a small hole in the stem into which bone graft was placed before implanting the stem. It was hoped bone would then grow through the window over time and hold the stem in position. Success was unpredictable and the fixation not very robust. In the early 1980s, surgeons in the United States applied a coating of small beads to the Austin Moore device and implanted it without cement. The beads were constructed so that gaps between beads matched the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pores</b> in native bone. Over time, bone cells from the patient would grow into these spaces and fix the stem in position. The stem was modified slightly to fit more tightly into the femoral canal, resulting in the Anatomic Medullary Locking (AML) stem design. With time, other forms of stem surface treatment and stem geometry have been developed and improved.|$|E

The basidia are thin-walled, mostly attached to four spores, and measure 25–30 by 8–10µm. Another cell type present in the hymenium is the cystidia, larger sterile cells that protrude beyond the basidia into the lumen of the hymenium, and act as air traps, regulating humidity.
