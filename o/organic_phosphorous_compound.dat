40|$|The {{incorporation}} of 32 P and 14 C into organic compounds by Ankistrodesmus is strongly inhibited by X-rays. In the same phosphorylated compounds 32 P-incorporation apparently is more severely inhibited by X-rays than the 14 C-labelling. The 32 P-incorporation into organic compounds is more strongly inhibited than 32 P-labelling of inorganic phosphate in the cell. The inhibition of 32 P-incorporation {{into a number}} of compounds is strikingly uniform. It is concluded that the inhibition of 32 P-incorporation and of 14 C-incorporation into phosphorylated compounds in vivo is due to an uncoupling by X-rays of photophosphorylation as in vitro. The difference in X-ray sensitivity of 14 C- and 32 P-incorporation into one <b>organic</b> <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compound</b> is attributed to a dual action of X-rays on 32 P-incorporation in organic compounds (both via the uncoupling of photophosphorylation) and only a single effect on 14 C-incorporation and 32 P-labelling of inorganic phosphate. The effect of X-rays on 14 C-incorporation into organic compounds included inhibition in most cases but also stimulation {{as in the case of}} glycolic acid. These differences may be due to interference in the intercellular regulations following the application of X-rays. The inhibition of 14 C-incorporation in many cases exhibits different behaviour at low (< 200 krad) and high doses. These changes are discussed on the assumption that at the lower doses X-rays cause uncoupling of photophosphorylation and at the higher doses an additional inhibition of electron transport...|$|E

40|$|The {{bleeding}} rate {{as well as}} {{transport of}} K+, NO 3 − and PO 4 −−− within the bleeding sap of corn plants (Zea mays) has been studied in intervals after raising the nitrate concentration of the nutrient solution from 5 to 10 meq/ 1. Acceleration of the exudation process in response to increased nitrate supply is accomplished after a lag phase. During this lag phase L-ethionine causes a marked stimulation of bleeding sap exudation. A very close correlation (coefficient of correlation r = 0, 996) was found between bleeding rate and phosphate transport within the bleeding sap, whereas transport of K+ (r = 0, 868) and NO 3 − (r= 0, 773) is not that closely correlated. Because phosphate is translocated to the Xylem {{after it has been}} metabolized in a series of <b>organic</b> <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> it is concluded that the exudation process is primarily linked to oxidative phosphorylation in the root, which is apparently stimulated by ethionine after a lag period. Acceleration of respiratory chain phosphorylation may be brought about by increasing the amount of phosphate acceptors. © 1973, Walter de Gruyter. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In a {{pilot study}} in {{conjunction}} with the German Environmental Survey (GerES IV) for Children of the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA), low concentrations of various degradation products of organophosphates were detected in the urine of a majority of the children exam-ined. One possible reason given for this exposure is the consumption of fruit juice because <b>organic</b> <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> are used as pesticides on fruit crops, too. The Federal In-stitute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has evaluated this statement and the method used. The pilot study {{in conjunction with the}} GerES IV for Children was conducted from 2001 to 2002. Urine samples where taken from a total of 363 children aged between 2 and 17 and examined for organophosphate degradation substances. The data collected are not repre-sentative for children in Germany. In the opinion of BfR no causal relationship can be derived {{on the basis of the}} data collected about whether the intake of active organophosphate substances from food – or more specifi-cally from fruit juices – was the cause for the degradation products detected in the urine. Nor is it known whether other entry pathways played a role or whether the degradation products were already formed into juice in the plant beforehand or during processing of the fruit in-stead of during human metabolism. To clarify this, an analysis would have had to be under-taken of the consumed food for organophosphate residues and the respective degradation products. What contradicts above all the statement of UBA is the fact that so far residues of organophosphates have only been detected in isolated cases during the annual official moni-toring tests of fruit juice samples. Based on its assessment BfR comes to the conclusion that the contamination of the chil-dren’s urine cannot be explained simply by contamination of the fruit juices with organophos-phate residues and further studies would be necessary in order to elucidate this...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{variability}} of nitrate (N), phosphate (P), silicate (Si) and Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) due to water mass mixing was objectively {{separated from the}} variability due to mineralization of biogenic materials in the western and eastern South Atlantic Ocean on basis of the constrained Optimum MultiParameter (OMP) analysis implemented in the companion manuscript. Using a consensus linear regression model, AOU/N/P/Si mineralization ratios and the corresponding oxygen utilisation rates (OURs) were obtained for the realm of each water mass defined after the OMP analysis. Combining these results with a stoichiometric model, the organic carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios and the biochemical composition (carbohydrates + lipids, proteins and phosphorus compounds) of the mineralized material, were derived. The vertical {{variability of}} the AOU/N, AOU/P and AOU/C mineralization ratios pointed to a significant fractionation during the mineralization of sinking organic matter. This fractionation was confirmed by preferential consumption of <b>organic</b> <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> and proteins in shallower levels, which produced an increase of the C/N ratio of the mineralised materials of 0. 5 +/- 0. 2 mol C mol N- 1 every 1000 dbar. OURs in the twilight zone decreased quadratically with the C/N molar ratio of the mineralised material and exponentially with pressure (p, in 10 (3) dbar) according to the following regression equation: Ln (OUR) = 6. 2 (+/- 1. 2) - 2. 0 (+/- 0. 7) * Ln (C/N) - 0. 6 (+/- 0. 2) * p(r(2) = 0. 87, p< 0. 006, n= 8).

40|$|Nanosized, {{crystalline}} rutile TiO 2 was synthesized at {{room temperature}} using a microemulsion-mediated system followed by hydrothermal treatment. The formed rutile had a specific surface area of about 40 m 2 g- 1 and the rutile crystals had dimensions of about 10 nm × 150 nm, which aggregated into 200 - 1000 nm sized bundles. The adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) over these rutile TiO 2 nanoparticles in dry and wet synthetic air was investigated by in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared (DRIFT) spectroscopy during simulated solar light illumination. The methyl and isopropyl groups do not dissociate upon adsorption on either dry or humidified rutile nanoparticles. The F atom in DFP is, however, easily hydrolyzed and is readily dissociated upon interaction with hydroxyls on the TiO 2 surfaces and leads to a destabilization of the DFP molecule. The initial solar light induced photodegradation rate for DFP and DMMP is 5. 9 × 10 - 4 and 1. 0 × 10 - 4 s- 1 in dry conditions and 8. 1 × 10 - 4 and 0. 7 × 10 - 4 s- 1 in wet conditions (corresponding to 2 - 3 monolayers (ML) water coverage), respectively. The main intermediate partial oxidation surface products {{are found to be}} surface bound formate-carboxylate-carbonate (R-COO-) and phosphate (R-POO-) species. Among them η 1 -coordinated acetone and μ-formate, bicarbonate, and bidentate R-POO- moieties are detected. These surface species accumulate on the surface during the entire illumination period (60 min), and lead to a decreased total oxidation rate. Controlled humidification of the rutile surface leads to a reduction of the concentration of R-COO- intermediates, {{while at the same time}} maintaining approximately the same rate of DFP and DMMP photooxidation. The latter is due to blocking of Ti surface cation sites, which prevents the formation of strongly bonded surface compounds, in particular μ-coordinated R-COO- and R-POO- species. The findings show that, it is possible to optimize the sustained photocatalytic degradation of <b>organic</b> <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> by controlled humidification of the reaction gas...|$|R

The rates of change in the phosphorous transformation processes are modeled to be dependent on and regulated by environmental factors such as temperature, radiation, water balance, and nutrient watershed load. The model also takes into account the wind action on the horizontal interbasin transport of phosphorus as well as phosphorous exchange between sediment and water. The measurements of temperature, radiation, wind, water balance, and phosphorous loading were used to examine the feasibility of the model in reproducing the phosphorous dynamics in the fourth basin of Lake Balaton for the environmental conditions of 1976 - 1978. The improved version of the possible watershed nutrient loading was used in this study. On the basis of the analysis of the turnover time values, the details of the cycling of the individual <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> and the total P are presented in this report. The explanation of the trends in the phosphorous cycling in the terms of turnover time is considered useful and important for understanding the regime of the phosphorous transformation within the Lake Balaton Ecosystem for the different environmental conditions and changeable nutrient loading.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{saprophytic}} bacteria {{and the presence}} of some physiological groups of bacteria were examined in the supplying waters of Plitvice Lakes, as well as in some of the Upper and Lower lakes. The investigations were carried out in the autumn 1977, and in the spring and autumn 1978. One of the main supplying waters of Lake Prošćan, the Crna rijeka, does not display signs of pollution, while the Bijela rijeka — following bacteriological parameters (Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens) is constantly polluted by domestic waste waters. The presence and a more significant representation of the groups of proteolytic and phosphomineralizing bacteria than {{in other parts of the}} examined region, point not only at the enlarged concentrations of <b>organic</b> nitrogenous and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> in the river water, but also at a possibility of hastening the processes of eutrophization, as the result of their mineralization. Concequently, the water of the Bijela rijeka which after joining the Crna rijeka flown into Lake Prošćan as Matica, would be one of the important factors for speeding the eutrophization processes in the lake, especially in the zone of the river mouth. (Table 2, 3). Relatively low values of all the groups of bacteria were found in the upper and lower lakes, which can be the result of dilution of more polluted supplying waters and the processes of selfpurification. The mean values of number of saprophytic bacteria on MPA in the lakes ranged from 225 (in spring) to 1. 480 (in autumn) in 1 ml, which would correspond to I—II class of bonity or oligo-betamesosaprobic level after Kohl (1975). The number of bacteria of the investigated groups increased considerably in autumn, probably as a result of larger quantities of dead organic matter in the water of the lakes (Table 4). The bacteriological analysis of samples of shallow water from the littoral of Lake Galovac, where a thick layer of fallen leaves and reed stems decayed (autumn 1978), showed high numbers of bacteria of all groups, which is a sign of intensive decomposition and mineralization of dead plant material.

Although a few organo <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as TCP, have been successfully used as vapor phase lubricants in many laboratory experiments, many problems remain unsolved.

Self-recovery means the ability of the vapor phase lubricant to reduce the frictional coefficient of the lubricating system back down to value less than 0. 1 after startup of the interrupted vapor flow.

The microcombustor design permits rapid, efficient heating of the deposited film at low power. To perform calorimetric detection of analytes, the change in power required to maintain the resistive microhotplate heater at a constant temperature is measured. For FID and NPD modes, electrodes are placed around the microcombustor flame zone and an electrometer circuit measures the production of ions. For FPD, the flame zone is optically interrogated to search for light emission indicative of deexcitation of flame-produced analyte compounds. The calorimetric and FID modes respond generally to all hydrocarbons, while sulfur compounds only alarm in the calorimetric mode, providing speciation. The NPD mode provides 10, 000 : 1 selectivity of nitrogen and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> over hydrocarbons. The FPD can distinguish between sulfur and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds.</b> Importantly all detection modes can be established on one convenient microcombustor platform, in fact the calorimetric, FID and FPD modes can be achieved simultaneously on only one microcombustor. Therefore, it is possible to make a very universal chemical detector array with as little as two microcombustor elements. A demonstration of the performance of the microcombustor in each of the detection modes is provided herein...|$|R
40|$|An electro-Fenton {{treatment}} of a solution containing phosphorus compounds using a graphite electrode is described. Different operating conditions are tested to investigate {{the influence of the}} reagent ratio on the oxidative efficiency. Results show that electro-Fenton's reagent is able to provide a powerful conversion of the <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> into phosphate. As hydrogen peroxide is continuously provided by the cathodic reduction of oxygen, the crucial step appears to be the iron dosage whose optimal concentration is found in the range 50 - 150 mg l(- 1). Quantitative oxidation is not reached for concentration lower than 50 mg l(- 1). Nonetheless, an excess of both iron and hydrogen peroxide in the bulk is found to negatively affect the oxidation yield because of the occurrence of undesired side reactions...|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{plastics}} (PA, PBT) {{have their}} own high processing temperatures (250 - 350 °C and even higher). To realize fire-resistant polymers {{it is necessary to}} compound polymers and flame retardants at these temperatures without a serious change in the characteristics of the polymer. Furthermore, a synergistic interaction of condensed phase and gas phase effects often guarantees in particular for fiber reinforced engineering plastics a maximum of the flame retardant efficiency. The chemical environment of <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> (P-O, P-N, P-C) is responsible for the specific flame retardant behavior (1). Due their less plasticizing effect and the marginal tendency of migration bridged rod-like, star-shape, and particularly polymeric compounds are preferred. Here we describe the synthesis and structure of different phosphorus compounds including selected polymers, their thermal stability, and flame retardant efficiency in relation to their chemical environment...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} introductory explanations on sewage sludge technologies. These technologies {{are divided into}} three categories, namely sewage sludge characterization and ecology; municipal wastewater treatment using activated sludge processes; and sludge processing. Commonly accepted sewage sludge compositions, indices, classification criteria, and ecology are summarized in the first part, which forms a foundation for further developments. A study on municipal wastewater treatment using activated sludge processes is then carried out with emphasis on the biological nutrient removal accomplished in the secondary wastewater treatment stage. Biological reaction mechanisms {{for the removal of}} organic carbon, nitrogen, and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds,</b> together with modeling and control issues encountered in activated sludge processes, are addressed. Finally, various sludge processing techniques including thickening and floatation, stabilization, conditioning, dewatering, and drying preceding final disposal and the ecological impacts are analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{involves}} the use of hybrid sol-gel coatings based on silica and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>compounds</b> to develop flame retarded cotton fabrics. To this aim, diethylphosphatoethyltriethoxysilane (DPTS) precursor has been used for the synthesis of several sols in combination with different chemical additives. The DPTS sols were reacted with azo-based compounds to investigate the effect of the concurrent presence of Si, P and N and applied in consecutive depositions on textile samples. Flammability tests were performed to evaluate the flame retardancy of treated cellulosic fabrics. The obtained results have shown that phosphorus-silica network is able to promote the formation of char that acts as insulator barrier. An additive P-N effect of the ceramic oxide matrix in terms of increased residue and decreased heat release rate and total burning time has been observe...|$|R
