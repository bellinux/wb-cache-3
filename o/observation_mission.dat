His disengagement agreement called for (1) Establishment of a demilitarized zone extending twenty kilometers on either side of a demarcated Saudi Arabian Yemen border, from which all military equipment was to be excluded; (2) Stationing of UN observers within this zone {{on both sides of the}} border to observe, report and prevent any continued attempt by the Saudis to supply royalist forces.|$|E
25|$|Next funded earth <b>{{observation}}</b> <b>mission</b> after GOSAT is the GCOM (Global Change <b>Observation</b> <b>Mission)</b> earth observation programme as {{a successor}} to ADEOS II (Midori) and the Aqua mission. To reduce the risk and for a longer observation time the mission will be split into smaller satellites. Altogether GCOM will be a series of six satellites. The first satellite, GCOM-W (Shizuku) was launched on 17 May 2012 with the H-IIA. The launch of the second satellite, GCOM-C is currently planned for 2017.|$|E

Communication between ALOS {{and the ground}} station in Japan will be done through the Kodama Data Relay Satellite, which was launched during 2002. This project is under intense pressure due to the shorter than expected lifetime of the ADEOS II (Midori) Earth <b>Observation</b> <b>Mission.</b> For missions following Daichi, JAXA opted to separate it into a radar satellite (ALOS-2) and an optical satellite (ALOS-3). ALOS 2 SAR was launched in May 2014.|$|E

500|$|In September 2008, {{parliamentary}} elections were held. Lukashenko had allowed some opposition candidates to stand, {{though in the}} official results, opposition members failed to get a seat out of the available 110. OSCE observers described the vote as [...] "flawed", including [...] "several cases of deliberate falsification of results". Opposition members and supporters demonstrated in protest. According to the Nizhny Novgorod-based CIS election <b>observation</b> <b>mission,</b> the findings of which are often dismissed by the West, the elections in Belarus conformed to international standards.

40|$|While {{international}} election <b>observations</b> <b>missions</b> often aim {{to present}} generalizable {{claims about the}} quality and integrity of an election, their findings are rarely based on {{a representative sample of}} observations, undermining the credibility of the missions. Bias in the selection of polling stations, among other things, can inflate or deflate the percentage of polling stations where observers find significant flaws. This article uses original data from Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) election <b>observation</b> <b>missions</b> to illustrate the nature of the problem of selection bias in international election observation, and show how the percentage of ‘bad’ polling stations (in the absence of selection bias) can be estimated through a weighting procedure. The article finds that, while there is a strong degree of selection bias, this does not significantly impact the overall percentage of ‘bad’ polling stations that is reported by OSCE <b>observation</b> <b>missions...</b>|$|R
500|$|No {{candidate}} {{gained more}} than half of the votes in the first round, while in the second round of the election, held on 30 March, Kocharyan won 58.9% of the vote. The British Helsinki Human Rights Group suggests that [...] "ordinary Armenians turned to Robert Kocharian as someone untainted by mafia connections and the intrigues of Yerevan politics." [...] The OSCE <b>observation</b> <b>mission</b> described the first round as [...] "deeply flawed," [...] while their final report stated that the mission found [...] "serious flaws" [...] and that the election did not meet the OSCE standards. Although Demirchyan didn't officially dispute the election results, he never accepted them and did not congratulate Kocharyan. After the election, however, Sargsyan suggested Kocharyan appoint Demirchyan Prime Minister to decrease the tensions in the political scene.|$|E
