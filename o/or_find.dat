5|$|According to Dickens {{specialist}} Trey Philpotts, {{the newest}} arrival was usually placed with the youngest prisoner {{who was living}} alone. A wealthier prisoner could pay his roommate to go away—"buy out the chum"—for half-a-crown a week in 1818, while the outcast chum would sleep in the tap room <b>or</b> <b>find</b> another room to rent in the prison. The only prisoners not expected to pay chummage were debtors who had declared themselves insolvent by swearing an oath that they had assets worth less than 40 shillings. If their creditors agreed, they could be released after 14days, but if anyone objected, they remained confined to the poor side of the building, near the women's side, receiving a small weekly allowance from the county and money from charity.|$|E
5|$|By early 1960, James Kinne was contemplating divorce, {{partially}} {{because of his}} wife's spendthrift habits and {{partially because}} he strongly suspected she was being unfaithful to him. He spoke to his parents {{about the possibility of}} divorce on March 18, 1960, telling them that Sharon had agreed to give him a divorce if he allowed her to keep the house and the couple's daughter and paid her $1,000, but the elder Kinnes, devout Mormons, urged James to stay in his marriage. Sharon, too, was thinking about ways out of the marriage; according to John Boldizs, she once offered him $1,000 to kill her husband <b>or</b> <b>find</b> someone who would, although he later claimed that she may have been joking.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the average}} {{depth of the}} ocean is about 4300metres, the photic zone {{represents}} {{only a tiny fraction}} of the ocean’s total volume. However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Life forms which inhabit the aphotic zone are often capable of movement upwards through the water column into the photic zone for feeding. Otherwise, they must rely on material sinking from above, <b>or</b> <b>find</b> another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.|$|E

5|$|Robert {{endeavours}} {{to steal}} the funds needed for King Richard's ransom, and begins robbing the rich {{with the help of}} Sherwood's outlaws, whom he has gradually befriended. At the same time, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard's mother, is working to raise the ransom through more legal methods: by taxing clergy and laymen for a quarter of the value of their property, confiscating the gold and silver treasures of the churches, and imposing scutage and carucage taxes. Back in the small village of Locksley, Marian is captured and sent to the Sheriff's dungeon, where she is given an ultimatum: marry DeLacey <b>or</b> <b>find</b> herself charged with witchcraft. She is rescued by Robert, who arrives with his friends to free her. Just as they are about to be arrested by a wrathful Prince John, whose money has been stolen by the outlaws, King Richard arrives unexpectedly, allowing Robert and his associates to escape.|$|E
5|$|Shantae is a {{platform}} adventure game, in which players play as the eponymous Shantae, a half-genie who must travel across various areas {{in order to}} stop the evil lady pirate Risky Boots. Shantae's default attack involves using her hair like a whip. Shantae can also use gems obtained from defeated enemies to purchase items, such as life-restoring potions and damaging items with various uses, as well as learn upgraded combat moves. The game features five towns, with various areas filled with enemies and obstacles in between them. In order to progress through the game, Shantae must seek out various characters who will open up dungeons, with each dungeon containing a guardian genie that will teach Shantae a new dance. By using these dances, Shantae can transform herself into different animals, including a monkey that can climb on walls, an elephant that can smash objects such as boulders and tree stumps, a spider that can climb across webbing in the background, and a harpy that can fly in mid-air. Shantae must use these abilities to reach new areas <b>or</b> <b>find</b> hidden items.|$|E
5|$|The Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry {{declared}} a State of Emergency in 17counties {{and described the}} outbreak as the worst natural disaster he had seen since becoming governor. On February 15, President Obama approved Henry's request for federal assistance in Carter, Logan and Oklahoma counties. A disaster recovery center {{was set up by}} the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on February20. Homeowners were allowed to borrow $200,000 to repair damages to their home <b>or</b> <b>find</b> a temporary or permanent shelter. They were also allowed to borrow up to $40,000 to replace lost property. Businesses were allowed to borrow up to $2million for damage repair, property loss, and economic loss. By February23, about $781,000 had been given in federal grants. On February 25, FEMA approved Governor Henry's request for public assistance in Carter, Coal and Love counties. The estimated cost to clear the 7,000 tons of debris in Lone Grove was placed at $500,000, of which $90,000 has been paid for by FEMA. The Department of Homeland Security offered to assist with the reconstruction of homes and businesses and to support those who were left homeless. President Barack Obama passed along his condolences and best wishes to the victims of the tornado.|$|E

5|$|The Honduras Packet {{reached the}} Black River in November 1822. Bemused {{to find a}} country rather {{different}} from the Sketchs descriptions, and no sign of St Joseph, the emigrants set up camp on the shore, assuming that the Poyaisian authorities would soon contact them. They sent numerous search parties inland; one, guided by natives who recognised the name St Joseph, found some long-forgotten foundations and rubble. Hall quickly came to the private conclusion that MacGregor must have duped them, but reasoned that announcing such concerns prematurely would only demoralise the party and cause chaos. A few weeks after their arrival, {{the captain of the}} Honduras Packet abruptly and unilaterally sailed away amid a fierce storm; the emigrants found themselves alone apart from the natives and two American hermits. Comforting the settlers with vague assurances that the Poyaisian government would find them if they just stayed where they were, Hall set out for Cape Gracias a Dios, hoping to make contact with the Mosquito king <b>or</b> <b>find</b> another ship. Most of the emigrants found it impossible to believe that the Cazique had deliberately misled them, and posited that blame must lie elsewhere, or that there must have been some terrible misunderstanding.|$|E
5|$|To the Milanese, Sforza's victory {{now seemed}} certain, {{but he found}} his Venetian allies {{beginning}} to have doubts about their Captain-General. They decided that Milan run by Sforza {{would be far more}} dangerous and detrimental to their interests than if it were run by a weak Republic. The last of the territory claimed by Venice, namely Crema, was now captured. Venice went behind Sforza's back and signed a peace treaty with the Republic. They conceded conquered land to the Republic in return for peace, and let Sforza keep only Pavia, Cremona, Piacenza, and a narrow strip of land. They ordered him to accept the treaty <b>or</b> <b>find</b> Venice his enemy. The Republic rejoiced, and the citizens were confident the war was over and their future was secured. But Sforza could not accept the conditions of the treaty, and decided to persevere in the struggle. He was already very powerful, and moreover was close to Milan. The Milanese in their assurance of peace had nearly exhausted their resources to plant crops and return to the old way of life. He was confident that Milan would quickly fall to him. After reinforcing his peace with Savoy with the concession of a few unimportant castles, he defeated the Venetians under his rival Sigismondo Malatesta and continued the siege.|$|E
5|$|Whether an epikleros who {{was married}} {{at the time of}} her father's death was {{required}} to divorce her current spouse and marry the anchisteia is unclear. Most modern historians have come to the conclusion that this was only required if the epikleros had not yet had a son that could inherit the grandfather's estate. The clearest evidence is from the Roman playwright Terence, in his play Adelphoe, which includes a plot element involving a claim that a girl is actually an epikleros. Although the play was written in the 2nd century BCE, Terence adapted most of his plays from earlier Athenian comedies, which makes it slightly more reliable as a source. And common sense argues that if a son had already been born to an epikleros, there was no need to parcel out the epikleros to a relative in order to provide a male heir to the grandfather's estate. Although the anchisteia had the right to marry the epikleros, he was not required to do so, and could refuse the match <b>or</b> <b>find</b> another spouse for the heiress. It was also possible for the husband of an epikleros, who was not her anchisteia, to buy off the anchisteia in order to remain married to his wife. Such cases were alleged by the speaker of Isaeus' speech Isaeus 10 as well as a character in Menander's play Aspis.|$|E

5|$|William Booth {{began his}} 'Christian Revival Society' in 1865, preaching the gospel {{in a tent}} erected in the 'Friends Burial Ground', Thomas Street, Whitechapel. Others joined his 'Christian Mission', and on 7 August 1878 the Salvation Army was formed at a meeting held at 272 Whitechapel Road. A statue commemorates both his mission and his work in helping the poor. Dubliner Thomas John Barnardo came to the London Hospital, Whitechapel to train for medical missionary work in China. Soon after his arrival in 1866 a cholera {{epidemic}} swept the East End killing 3,000 people. Many families were left destitute, with thousands of children orphaned and forced to beg <b>or</b> <b>find</b> work in the factories. In 1867, Barnardo set up a Ragged School to provide a basic education but was shown the many children sleeping rough. His first home for boys was established at 18 Stepney Causeway in 1870. When a boy died after being turned away (the home was full), the policy was instituted that 'No Destitute Child Ever Refused Admission'.|$|E
5|$|In his prime, Buffon was a talented, complete, aggressive, {{and often}} instinctive goalkeeper, who was {{recognised}} for his speed, prowess, and anticipation when coming off his line in {{one on one}} situations, {{as well as his}} confidence, goalkeeping technique, reactions, and ability to get to ground quickly to collect, parry, or even challenge for the ball with his feet; when playing in teams that relied upon high defensive lines, he often functioned as a sweeper-keeper, frequently rushing out of his area to clear the ball or face opponents who had beaten the offside trap. He was also highly regarded for his handling, aerial ability, and command of the area; however, throughout his career, Buffon has occasionally been accused by pundits of being overly cautious on high balls and of not always coming out to collect crosses, and has also drawn criticism for preferring to punch the ball out to his team-mates at times rather than holding on to it. Although not as adept with the ball at his feet as the newer generation of goalkeepers that emerged in his later career, Buffon also possesses good footwork, as well as reliable distribution, which allows him to play the ball out from the back on the ground to his defenders and start swift counter-attacks, <b>or</b> <b>find</b> his teammates further up the pitch or out on the wing with deeper kicks with his right foot; in his youth, his ball skills occasionally led him to take on opponents, whenever he was put under pressure by on-running strikers.|$|E
