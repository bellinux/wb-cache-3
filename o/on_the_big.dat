5|$|Early on August 15, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for the Big Island of Hawaii, meaning gale force winds were possible within 36 hours; concurrently, a high surf advisory was put into effect for all eastward facing shorelines. By late on August 15, the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for {{the entire state of}} Hawaii. Early the next day, the CPHC upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the Big Island of Hawaii, as Fernanda was expected to continue its westward track. When the hurricane slowed, its movement was uncertain, although all watches and warnings were canceled by August 17, when Fernanda began its northwest track. Officials opened nine shelters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Island, and about 200 people stayed in them until the hurricane watches were canceled. One shelter near Hilo held 80 people due to concern of the high waves. Officials <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Island closed and evacuated all of the beach parks on August 15. On Molokai, 40 hikers were evacuated from a valley prone to flooding. Residents bought emergency supplies on Kauai, which had been struck by powerful Hurricane Iniki 11 months prior.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iselle was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Island of Hawaii in recorded history. The eleventh named storm of the annual hurricane season, Iselle developed from an area of disturbed weather southwest of Mexico on July31, 2014. Assuming a west-northwest course that it would maintain throughout its existence, generally favorable atmospheric conditions allowed for gradual strengthening, with the cyclone attaining hurricane status a day after formation. Continued strengthening progressed for several days up until August4, when Iselle reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg), making it a Category4hurricane. Thereafter, Iselle encountered hostile environmental conditions and quickly weakened before making landfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Island on August8 as a moderate tropical storm. Its passage over the island disrupted the cyclone, and Iselle later dissipated on August9.|$|E

5|$|Despite his rapidly failing health, Djajakusuma {{remained}} {{active in}} the arts.

5|$|In 2001, {{banks were}} {{deregulated}} in Iceland. This {{set the stage}} for banks to upload debts when foreign companies were accumulated. The crisis unfolded when banks became unable to refinance their debts. It is estimated that the three major banks held foreign debt in excess of €50 billion, or about €160,000 per Icelandic resident, compared with Iceland's gross domestic product of €8.5 billion. As early as March 2008, the cost of private deposit insurance for deposits in Landsbanki and Kaupthing was already far higher (6–8½% of the sum deposited) than for other European banks.

5|$|Millwall's fiercest rival is West Ham United. It {{is one of}} {{the most}} passionately contested local derbies in football. The two clubs have rarely met in recent years due to them playing in {{different}} leagues; the majority of their meetings happened before the First World War, with some 60 meetings between 1899–1915. The clubs have played 99 times since the first contest in 1899. Millwall have won 38, drawn 27 and lost 34. Despite violence between the two sets of supporters and calls for future games between the clubs to be played behind closed doors, they last met in the Football League Championship in 2011–12 with no outright ban on either set of fans, and no repeat of crowd trouble. The rivalry between the sides, specifically the clubs' two hooligan firms has been depicted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> screen several times, in films such as Green Street.|$|E
