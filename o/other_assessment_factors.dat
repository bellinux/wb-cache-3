40|$|An area {{of major}} {{investigation}} in the SPICE trials is the reliability of assessments. In particular, their evaluation and improvement. Previous reliability studies in the trials have focused on evaluating reliability. In this paper we report on a study that focused on generating recommendations for improving the reliability of assessments {{through the construction of}} a model. The study attempted to identify factors that have an impact on reliability. Using data from three assessments, we constructed a model that explains some of the variation in the reliability of <b>assessments.</b> The two <b>factors</b> considered were the capability of processes and when ratings were made during an <b>assessment</b> (<b>other</b> <b>factors</b> such as assessor experience were held constant). Our model suggests that future assessment processes should have two contiguous phases in order to increase reliability. The first phase focuses only on data collection. During the second phase, ratings are made...|$|R

The lowest NOEC {{value in}} the test dataset is divided by an <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> between 10 and 100 dependent on the diversity of test organisms {{and the amount of}} data available.

50|$|The use of <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> {{allows for}} laboratory, single-species and short term {{toxicity}} data to be extrapolated to conservatively predict ecosystem effects and accounts for the uncertainty in the extrapolation. The value of the <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> {{is dependent on the}} uncertainty of the available data and ranges from 1-1000.|$|R
30|$|The {{size of an}} <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> that is used {{to derive}} a PNEC from these tests should cover several {{uncertainties}} such as intra- and interspecies variations, short- to long-term toxicity extrapolation, intra- and inter-laboratory variation or laboratory-to-field extrapolation [3, 14]. An <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> of 1000 is applied on the lowest effect value of acute tests from the three trophic levels of algae, invertebrates, and fish if only data from acute testing are available. This <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> can be refined to 100, 50, or 10 if the values of NOECs are available from long-term tests covering one, two, or three trophic levels, respectively [4, 7, 8]. Although not explicitly mentioned the procedure implies an acute-to-chronic extrapolation factor of 100 based on the difference of the <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> on the acute L(E)C 50 value (1000) and the chronic NOEC (10) if data are available for three trophic levels.|$|R

The <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> applied to acute toxicity data is typically 1000.|$|R
40|$|The general {{goal of this}} {{discussion}} paper is to contribute toward the further harmonization of human health risk assessment. It first discusses {{the development of a}} formal, harmonized set of <b>assessment</b> <b>factors.</b> The status quo with regard to <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> is reviewed, that is, the type of factors to be identified, the range of values assigned, as well as {{the presence or absence of}} a scientific basis for these values. Options are presented for a set of default values and probabilistic distributions for <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> based on the state of the art. Methods of combining default values or probabilistic distributions of <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> are also described. Second, the effect parameter, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), is discussed. This NOAEL as selected from the toxicological database may be a poor substitute for the unknown, true no-adverse-effect level (NAEL). New developments are presented with respect to the estimation of the NAEL. The already widely discussed Benchmark Dose concept can be extended to obtain an uncertainty distribution of the Critical Effect Dose (CED). This CED distribution can be combined with estimated uncertainty distributions for <b>assessment</b> <b>factors.</b> In this way the full distribution of the Human Limit Value will be derived and not only a point estimate, whereas information on dose-response relations is taken into account. Finally, a strategy is proposed for implementation of the new developments into human health risk assessments...|$|R

Currently, there are no indications that <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> differing from the existing ones are needed for ENMs. For risk assessment, the PNEC values have to be compared with environmental concentrations (PEC).

The purpose of this study is to identify airway <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> and total airway score (TAS) for predicting DI defined by the IDS. Methods: There were 305 ASA physical status 1 - 2 patients, aged 19 - 70 years, who underwent elective surgery with endotracheal intubation. During the pre-anesthetic visit, we evaluated patients by 7 preoperative airway <b>assessment</b> <b>factors,</b> including the following: Mallampati classification, thyromental distance, head & neck movement, body mass index (BMI), buck teeth, inter-incisor gap, and upper lip bite test (ULBT).

40|$|Risk {{assessment}} approaches {{within the}} regulatory framework of the European Union (EU) based on single species tests were compared to those using data from terrestrial model ecosystems (TMEs). In a case study with the fungicide carbendazim, single species data led to ratios of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) and predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) of above 1000, depending on available data and related <b>assessment</b> <b>factors,</b> indicating concern for the terrestrial environment. Considering {{the high degree of}} realism of the TME studies with multiple endpoints measured, but also residual uncertainty related to higher variability of endpoints, an <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> of 5 was applied on TME data. The most sensitive reliable endpoint was earthworm biomass. With the TME studies yielding slightly higher effect thresholds compared to laboratory data, and due to the lower <b>assessment</b> <b>factor,</b> the PEC/PNEC ratio was lowered to 5. This means that there would be concern for high application rates of carbendazim...|$|R

Risk assessment is based on NOEC and/or EC 50 values, which are reduced by <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> {{to compensate for the}} limited number of test organisms[26]. The use of <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> means that the consideration of test concentrations above environmental values is justified. Therefore, it is essential to develop procedures that allow the application of comparably high test concentrations for subsequent risk assessment.|$|R

However, {{the appropriateness of the}} <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> can be debated as currently there is no reference tier that would allow for calibration. Extending the standard ecotoxicological tests for non-target terrestrial plants under worst-case greenhouse conditions to more realistic field conditions or community level is not feasible. Not only reproducibility is a major constraint, but there is also the question of representativeness of higher tier studies for different landscapes under different climatic conditions. Additional data are needed to reduce uncertainty associated with predicting the potential long-term impacts on non-target terrestrial plant communities from short-term individual-level greenhouse studies.|$|R
40|$|For human risk assessment, {{experimental}} data {{often have to}} be extrapolated for exposure duration, which is generally done by means of default values. The {{purpose of the present}} study was twofold. First, to derive a statistical distribution for differences in exposure duration that can be used in a probabilistic concept for combining <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> in risk characterization. Second, to obtain insight in the magnitude of the change in No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) with exposure duration, which will lead to more science-based <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> for exposure duration. A large historical database, including 198 substances, was consulted. Ratios were calculated for pairs of NOAELs for systemic toxicity from oral toxicity studies with the same species (rats or mice, various strains) and different exposure duration categories. The Geometric Mean (GM), Geometric Standard Deviation (GSD), and the 90 th and 95 th percentile values were determined. The traditionally applied default factors for subacute to semichronic (10), for semichronic to chronic (10), and for subacute to chronic exposure (100) corresponded with the 93, 87, and 99 -percentiles of the respective distributions. Options are presented for a set of default values and probabilistic distributions for <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> for exposure duration based on data from the consulted historical database...|$|R

RAPATAC In Gävle Level: Final {{assignment}} for Bachelor Degree in Business Administration Authors: Peiying Kuang and Zhonglv Song Supervisor: Dr. Maria Fregidou-Malama Examiner: Jonas Kågström  Date: 2013 May Aim: The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate the factors that influence social enterprises to access funding. Method: This study has chosen a social enterprise as a single case study. We design the questions and collect the data based on five <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> from both the social enterprise and funders’ perspective. We use interview and questionnaires to investigate whether these five <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> influence funders’ decision.       Result and Conclusions: In our study, we found that five <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> could influence the funders’ decision. Social mission and the qualities of the leader are crucial factors influencing funding decisions. The performance of SE, financing sustainability and communication transparence influence social enterprise to maintain a long-term relationship with funders.   Suggestion for further studies: This investigation based on a single case study in Gavle, and we have collected data from a limited number of responders. Thus, we suggest using multiple case studies and collecting data from more responders. The further study should not be limited to one city. Contribution of the thesis: Our theoretical contribution is providing a model to complete theory. This model includes five factors which affecting funding of social enterprise. In managerial aspect, both current and potential social entrepreneurs can refer to these five <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> to improve their competence to attract funders. For the societal implication, this study shows the value and challenge of social enterprise to people and government, which enhance the public recognition of the social enterprise.
