5|$|Ultima Underworld II {{is set in}} {{the fantasy}} world of the Ultima franchise. It takes place across {{multiple}} parallel dimensions, the first being Britannia, the traditional setting of Ultima games. The protagonist is the Avatar, the main character of the series. Chronologically, the events of the game occur directly after those <b>of</b> , <b>rather</b> than those of the original Ultima Underworld. As with Ultima VII, the villain of Ultima Underworld II is the Guardian, an evil being who seeks to conquer Britannia. The game features recurring characters from previous Ultima games, such as Lord British, Nystul, Dupre, Iolo and Mayor Patterson. Also present are Lady Tory and Miranda, the latter of whom appeared in Ultima VII.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{were made}} in 1876, {{introducing}} more elaborate uniforms for commissioned officers based on those worn by the 13th Hussars, with similarly militaristic uniforms for the other ranks, using gold braid to distinguish the non-commissioned officers. These uniforms were initially <b>of</b> <b>rather</b> low quality, as the government had contracted out the work to prison convicts. The winter uniforms comprised grey overcoats with fur caps and moccasins, although the police preferred wearing warmer buffalo coats, which were available until the herds died out. In 1886, the hussar-style uniforms were replaced by a simpler dragoon version, and dark-blue undress uniforms introduced. In the 1880s, blue pea jackets made from pilot cloth became popular among the police {{as part of their}} winter outfit, and were officially issued from 1893 onwards. There were continual attempts to produce a consistent uniform across the force, but this was only ever partially successful due to the multiple government suppliers who each produced slightly different variants.|$|E

Stanley was full <b>of</b> <b>rather</b> vague industrial and commercial propositions that never came to any resolution. Stanley also paid for suits for Gibson and Minister of Works Charles Key.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{automated}} optimizations {{are almost}} exclusively limited to compiler optimization. However, because compiler optimizations are usually {{limited to a}} fixed set <b>of</b> <b>rather</b> general optimizations, there is considerable demand for optimizers which can accept descriptions of problem and language-specific optimizations, allowing an engineer to specify custom optimizations. Tools that accept descriptions of optimizations are called program transformation systems and are beginning {{to be applied to}} real software systems such as C++.|$|E
25|$|His lechery was {{so strong}} that it broke out even in the midst <b>of</b> <b>rather</b> hectic circumstances. While {{accompanying}} Thomas Kavanaugh on his daring escape from Lucknow, he paused for a quick rattle with a local prostitute, and during the battle of Patusan, he found himself galloping one of Sharif Sahib's concubines without even realizing it but nonetheless continued to the climax of the battle and the tryst.|$|E
25|$|Current use and {{application}} of nanotubes has mostly been limited {{to the use of}} bulk nanotubes, which is a mass <b>of</b> <b>rather</b> unorganized fragments of nanotubes. Bulk nanotube materials may never achieve a tensile strength similar to that of individual tubes, but such composites may, nevertheless, yield strengths sufficient for many applications. Bulk carbon nanotubes have already been used as composite fibers in polymers to improve the mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of the bulk product.|$|E

25|$|The {{external}} {{history of}} the Talmud includes also the literary attacks made upon it by some Christian theologians after the Reformation, since these onslaughts on Judaism were directed primarily against that work, the leading example being Eisenmenger's Entdecktes Judenthum (Judaism Unmasked) (1700). In contrast, the Talmud was a subject <b>of</b> <b>rather</b> more sympathetic study by many Christian theologians, jurists and Orientalists from the Renaissance on, including Johann Reuchlin, John Selden, Petrus Cunaeus, John Lightfoot and Johannes Buxtorf father and son.|$|E
25|$|Achatinidae are {{a family}} <b>of</b> <b>rather</b> large land snails, and, {{in spite of}} their size, one that poses {{tremendous}} taxonomic problems, and Dolf {{is one of the few}} people who knows his way in the chaotic taxonomy of this group. He devoted various papers partly or wholly to the family and introduced six new species and subspecies. He was a friend of the recently deceased American Achatinidae specialist Albert Raymond Mead (1915–2009). They regularly exchanged opinions, but did not publish jointly.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} the Pratiharas was {{weakened}} by dynastic strife. It was further diminished {{as a result of}} a great raid led by the Rashtrakuta ruler Indra III who, in about 916, sacked Kannauj. Under a succession <b>of</b> <b>rather</b> obscure rulers, the Pratiharas never regained their former influence. Their feudatories became more and more powerful, one by one throwing off their allegiance until, by the end of the 10th century, the Pratiharas controlled little more than the Gangetic Doab. Their last important king, Rajyapala, was driven from Kannauj by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1018.|$|E

25|$|Virtual Murder {{was in the}} mould of some earlier off-beat series, such as The Avengers and Adam Adamant Lives!, both {{shown in}} the 1960s. Like Steed and Emma Peel or Adam Adamant and Georgina Jones, Cornelius ("JC") and Valentine {{investigated}} a succession <b>of</b> <b>rather</b> eccentric or bizarre occurrences. They often did so {{in cooperation with the}} police, represented by Stephen Yardley as Inspector Cadogan and Jude Akuwudike as Sergeant Gummer. Complementing the occult elements and those of virtual reality, there was a thread of playful, sometimes dark humour running through the scripts and an underlying sexual frisson between Clay and Thomson.|$|E
25|$|By common usage, {{the term}} {{chemotherapy}} {{has come to}} connote the use <b>of</b> <b>rather</b> non-specific intracellular poisons, especially related to inhibiting the process of cell division known as mitosis, and generally excludes agents that more selectively block extracellular growth signals (i.e. blockers of signal transduction). To avoid these connotations, recently developed therapies (against specific molecular or genetic targets) which inhibit growth-promoting signals coming from classic endocrine hormones (primarily estrogens for breast cancer and androgens for prostate cancer) are called hormonal therapies, while the inhibition of other growth-promoting influences (especially those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases) is known as targeted therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} Epi-Olmec {{culture on}} {{the western edge of}} the Olmec heartland coincides with the {{depopulation}} of the eastern half of the Olmec heartland and the decline of the Olmec culture in general. The Epi-Olmec culture represented a gradual transformation <b>of,</b> <b>rather</b> than a sharp break with, the Olmec culture. Many Olmec motifs, for example, were employed by its successor culture. Tres Zapotes, one of the largest Olmec sites, continued as a regional center under the Epi-Olmec culture. And daily life for the non-elites continued much the same: subsistence farming with opportunistic hunting and fishing, wattle-and-daub houses, thatched roofs, and bell-shaped storage pits.|$|E

25|$|Engines on the 737 Classic series (-300, -400, -500) and Next-Generation series (-600, -700, -800, -900) do {{not have}} {{circular}} inlets like most aircraft. The 737 Classic series featured CFM56 turbofan engines, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy {{and a reduction in}} noise over the JT8D engines used on the −100 and −200, but also posed an engineering challenge given the low ground clearance of the 737. Boeing and engine supplier CFMI solved the problem by placing the engine ahead <b>of</b> (<b>rather</b> than below) the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides (rather than the bottom) of the engine pod, giving the 737 a distinctive non-circular air intake.|$|E
25|$|Vegetarian cookery in Korea may {{be linked}} to the Buddhist traditions that {{influenced}} Korean culture from the Goryeo dynasty onwards. There are hundreds of vegetarian restaurants in Korea, although historically they have been local restaurants that are unknown to tourists. Most have buffets, with cold food, and vegetarian kimchi and tofu being the main features. Bibimbap is a common vegan dish. Menus change with seasons. Wine with the alcohol removed and fine teas are also served. The Korean tea ceremony is suitable for all vegetarians and vegans, and began with Buddhist influences. All food is eaten with a combination <b>of</b> <b>rather</b> slippery stainless steel oval chopsticks and a long-handled shallow spoon called together sujeo.|$|E
25|$|Debates {{between the}} Socialist Party of Great Britain {{and other groups}} were of {{particular}} importance in bringing the party case to an outside audience without the sometimes off-putting rhetoric of platform speaking, or the one-sidedness of educational talks. A prime instance of this importance for the party {{is the case of}} Richard Headicar, a former Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament speaker, won over after debating with the party. <b>Of</b> <b>rather</b> wider historical importance were the debates with the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) in the late 1940s. In the course of these Sammy Cash persuaded the RCP’s Jock Haston of the view that the Soviet Union was state capitalist. The idea was then relayed to Tony Cliff, whence (in a somewhat different form) it formed the genesis of today's Socialist Workers Party.|$|E
