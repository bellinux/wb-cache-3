5|$|Initial asymmetries {{have also}} been {{confirmed}} in TypeIa supernovae through observation. This result may mean that the initial luminosity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of supernova depends on the viewing angle.

5|$|Many of the cannons {{and other}} weapons from the Mary Rose have {{provided}} invaluable physical evidence about 16th-century weapon technology.

30|$|However, when agents <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{particular}} <b>type</b> abound (say {{the other}} type {{is close to}} extinction), an agent <b>of</b> <b>this</b> particular <b>type</b> will generally be matched with agents of his/her own type (see footnote 15). Thus, if all the agents in a group are of the same type, they respond {{in the same way}} to the same environment. They all perform equally. The competitors of a particular agent in his/her own group are as successful (or unsuccessful) as he/she is. Thus, selection does not depend at all on the performance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> particular <b>type</b> <b>of</b> agent: the probability of winning depends almost entirely on how many people are selected. Therefore, the probability <b>of</b> <b>this</b> particular <b>type</b> <b>of</b> agent winning is strongly influenced by an increase in the strength of competition.|$|R

5|$|Britain, {{which had}} {{concluded}} in 1892 {{that it needed}} twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire's sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers. Between 1899 and 1905, it completed or laid down seven classes <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>type,</b> a total of 35 ships. This building program, in turn, prompted the French and Russians to increase their own construction. The Imperial German Navy began to build large armoured cruisers for use on their overseas stations, laying down eight between 1897 and 1906.|$|E
5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of sheep are attempting to use {{a few of these}} traditional breeds for alternative purposes.
