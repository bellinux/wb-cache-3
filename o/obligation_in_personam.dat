40|$|This Article takes a {{fresh look}} at the power of courts and {{creditors}} to force debtors to repay their <b>obligations</b> through <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> collection techniques. Variously known as “debtor’s examinations,” “turnover orders,” “citations to discover assets,” “supplementary proceedings,” “proceedings supplementary,” and “proceedings in aid of execution,” <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> remedies force the debtor, under threat of the court’s contempt authority, to turn over money or property directly to a creditor. Because the exercise of the court’s contempt authority can result in a debtor’s imprisonment, <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> techniques have long been regarded as a critical but potentially very coercive arrow in a debt collector’s quiver. Recently, the Federal Trade Commission and others have endorsed major changes to a debt collection system labeled as “broken. ” These reform proposals, however, have overlooked key problems <b>in</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> proceedings, where excessive creditor leverage and insufficient protection of debtors’ procedural rights risk validating a view that the judicial system is functioning as creditors’ private collection arm. Following the transfer of power to a newly established Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, this Article resurrects a subject that has received virtually no attention in the scholarly literature for over a decade. It analyzes the particular features of <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> proceedings and debtor behavior that contribute to a longstanding imbalance in the leverage asserted by creditors over debtors. The Article recommends specific changes to the way courts conduct <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> proceedings to ensure that the in terrorem effects of these remedies do not upend important social policies, including the protection of exempt property and the adjudicative fairness of the collection process. Debt collection is a fundamental component of the consumer credit system. The strength and legitimacy of its procedures, however, depend on maintaining a difficult balance between the state’s and creditors’ interest in rigorous judgment enforcement and debtors’ interest in imposing reasonable limitations on the coerciveness of debt collection...|$|R

Under territorial jurisdiction, pure <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> jurisdiction could only be established by serving notice upon the individual while that individual was within {{the territory of the}} state.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the central}} tenets of the Torrens system is that the {{registered}} proprietor is conferred indefeasible title. Indefeasibility of title is subject to cm <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> exception. The content of the <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> exception to indefensibility {{has been a source}} of debute in many Torrens jurisdictions. The purpose of this article is to map out a theoretical structure to analyse the ambit of the <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> exception so as to provide a principled development of the law in this area. This article will also attempt to explain how this proposed theoretical structure of the <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> exception deals with constructive trust claims, knowing receipt, undue influence, unconscionable dealing, duress and certain restitutionary claims...|$|R

50|$|Justice Jackson {{began his}} {{examination}} of {{the issues of the}} case by discussing the nature of the jurisdiction which the Surrogate's Court was exercising. He explained some of the differences in the service of process required in in rem, quasi in rem, and <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> actions.

5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>personam</b> is {{distinguished}} from in rem, which applies to property or [...] "all the world" [...] {{instead of a}} specific person. This technical distinction is important to determine where to file a lawsuit and how to serve a defendant. <b>In</b> <b>personam</b> means that a judgment can be enforceable against the person wherever he/she is. On the other hand, if the lawsuit is to determine title to property (in rem) then the action must be filed where the property exists and is only enforceable there.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{distinction}} between <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> contract rights and in rem property rights. It presents a functional explanation for why the legal system utilizes these two modalities of rights, grounded {{in the pattern of}} information costs associated with each modality. To test this theory, the Article examines four legal institutions that fall along the property/contract interface [...] bailments, landlord-tenant law, security interests, and trusts [...] in order to determine how the legal doctrine varies as the underlying situation shifts from <b>in</b> <b>personam,</b> to <b>in</b> rem, to certain relations intermediate between these poles. With respect to each institution, we generally find that <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> relations are governed by flexible default rules; in rem relations are governed by bright-line rules that impose immutable and standardized obligations; intermediate relations, as befits their intermediate level of information costs, feature a type and degree of standardization beyond pure contract but short of pure property...|$|R

5000|$|Claimants take {{advantage}} of the action in rem, rather action <b>in</b> <b>personam,</b> because an action in rem is more easy and convenient to institute. It is more difficult, in an action <b>in</b> <b>personam,</b> to summon the defendant via writ outside the jurisdiction unless the defendant is a resident of EU or EFTA countries. Besides, the processes to find the rightful shipowner, the defendant, are very complicated and time consuming due to the complex and inconsistent ship registration in different countries. An action with respect to a bareboat ship will frequently encounter this problem.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{facet of}} a court's jurisdiction in common law countries is the court's <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> jurisdiction {{under which the}} court is able to adjudicate a dispute involving a defendant present or resident within the court's territorial limits. Recent decisions of the highest courts in Nigeria, {{which is also a}} common law country, have tended to overlook the concept of the court's <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> jurisdiction and to hold that a court did not have jurisdiction, simply because the cause of action arose elsewhere, contrary to common law principles long established in Nigeria. This is especially prominent in the context of which court, as between different State High Courts within Nigeria, should hear and determine a particular dispute. This article explores the concept of <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> jurisdiction <b>in</b> Nigeria's historical jurisprudence, contrasts this with recent decisions of Nigeria's Supreme Court and Court of Appeal, and suggests a preferable alternative approach for the courts...|$|R

5000|$|The literal {{contract}} was, {{according to}} Gaius, a nomina transcripta, {{and capable of}} functioning in two ways. The first is a re <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> ("from thing to person"), and transformed a debt resulting from another contractual arrangement (sale, hire, for example). A fictitious loan would then be constructed from the creditor to the debtor, thereby charging the debtor with fulfilling that obligation whilst discharging the other. The alternative was in transferring a debt from person to another: a <b>personam</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam.</b> The debt would be entered {{under the name of}} the person to whom it was being transferred. [...] Gaius' account indicates that it was a previous <b>obligation</b> was required <b>in</b> the classical law, and Watson believes this can be conclusively shown for the last century of the Republic. However, it is possible that {{that was not the case}} originally. Appert was argued that the literal contract was created as an enforcement method for consensual contracts, before they became actionable in their own right.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{ordinary}} injunctions {{of the previous}} paragraph there also exist the so-called Mareva injunctions in Article 9(2). In common law, these are ex parte and <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> orders used to freeze assets (including bank accounts) to prevent abuses of process. They can be issued as worldwide injunctions, preventing worldwide dispersal. In that case, their effectiveness depends on their <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> character, as a party who {{is found to be}} guilty of disposing of assets will be held to be in contempt of court. Like Anton Piller orders, their use is confined mostly to the UK.|$|R
50|$|The {{principles}} {{relating to}} the rule huur gaar voor koop were discussed. Under Roman law, a lease of property (locatio conductio rei) conferred only jura <b>in</b> <b>personam.</b> More particularly, the lessee held no real right in the leased property; he merely enjoyed contractual jura <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> against the lessor {{by virtue of the}} agreement of lease. Consequently, if during the currency of the lease the lessor alienated the leased property in terms of, say, a contract of sale, the purchaser (and new owner) was not bound to recognise the lessees rights of occupation under the lease, unless he had undertaken to do so.|$|R

This article respectfully ventures to suggest {{that the majority of the}} Court have erred in suggesting that the otherwise indefeasible title of a buyer, registered pursuant to a court order, set aside on appeal, can be disturbed and, that the minority member of the Court was correct in holding that the right to restitution of the title to registered land in those circumstances did not fit within the <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> exception to indefeasibility...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{equitable}} jurisdiction, {{the phrase}} <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> {{has been used}} to describe the means of enforcement of the equitable decree, the justification for equitable jurisdiction generally, and the mechanism by which chancery rulings effectively override the common law. In the context of curial proceedings, the phrase is also used to describe the nature of jurisdiction assumed over a person, as well as the effect of a decree against a person, as opposed to a thing. In the discourse on rights, it is used to distinguish personal from property rights. <b>In</b> <b>personam</b> reasoning <b>in</b> the equitable sense has been used historically to justify the assumption of jurisdiction in disputes relating to foreign immovable property, and the application of the principles of equity of the forum without reference to choice of law. In more modern times, similar reasoning {{has been used to}} justify cross-border anti-suit injunctions and asset-freezing orders. In this lecture, the uses of <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> reasoning <b>in</b> private international law in these contexts will be evaluated, and further implications for the context of recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments will be considered, with particular reference to the law in Singapore...|$|R
50|$|The {{form of the}} styling of {{this case}} — the {{defendant}} being an object, rather than a legal person — is {{because this is a}} jurisdiction in rem (power over objects) case, rather than the more familiar <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> (over persons) case.|$|R
5000|$|To {{understand}} the principles in this case, one must understand {{a little about}} quasi in rem actions and jurisdictional principles at the time. At that time, a state court could not assert <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> jurisdiction over someone who was not physically served [...] in that state. However, if a defendant, on whom <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> jurisdiction was unable to be asserted, owned property {{in the state in}} which plaintiff was situated, plaintiff could [...] "attach" [...] to the action whatever property defendant owned in that state. Such an action was labeled quasi-in rem and, when this occurred, state courts were permitted to assert jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant on any matter, with the limitation that any remedy be limited to involving only the attached property.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{maturing}} of the <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> claim, and its relationship with the concepts of supervening fraud and landlocked land. The paper concentrates solely on the enforcement of the claim against the class of registered owners and uses two decisions concerning a sub‐set of that class — the access‐blocking owner — to tease out the principles. The claim will supersede supervening fraud, a principle that may be neither 'necessary [nor] consistent with the statute'. The circumstances in which claims <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> are, and will be, recognised are wide. This paper highlights well‐established known legal or equitable causes of action to which the unconscionability of a registered owner may attach. The claim's relationship with ss 326 ‐ 331 of the Property Law Act 2007 adds a further dimension to the debate. So how do the parties fare under the three concepts? Both the Suttons and the McGraths clear the hurdles of supervening fraud and the <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> claim. Had they resided in New Zealand, the McGraths would probably have successfully defended a landlocked land application from the Campbells. However, Mr O'Kane would have dealt his winning card and, pursuant to ss 326 ‐ 330 of the Property Law Act 2007, his access would have been reinstated. A tricky trio indeed...|$|R
50|$|The {{claim is}} {{enforceable}} <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> and <b>in</b> rem. The ship or the sister ship {{can be held}} in lien to enforce the claim. A property salvage attracts a maritime lien against all property saved; however, the liability salvage (special compensation under Article 14) does not.|$|R
5000|$|Action in rem (property) is {{an action}} {{separated}} from the action <b>in</b> <b>personam.</b> The action is against the maritime property such as vessel, cargo or freight, but not against the owner. This concept is why such an action {{is said to be}} against “all the world”.|$|R
5000|$|This {{procedure}} (in full, [...] "legis actio per iudicis arbitrive postulationem", [...] "complaint {{before the}} judge or arbiter") was used only <b>in</b> some <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> cases laid down by statute. It did not require any wager at all and so was much less risky for the plaintiff.|$|R
5000|$|The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment {{limits the}} power of a state court to {{exercise}} personal or <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> jurisdiction against a nonresident defendant.
