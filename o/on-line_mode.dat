50|$|The {{motivation}} for pre-estimate aggregation {{may be that}} no ground truth data are available. This may occur in situations where diagnostics {{does a good job}} in detecting faults that are resolved (through maintenance) before system failure occurs. Therefore, there are hardly any run-to-failure data. However, there is incentive to know better when a system would fail to better leverage the remaining useful life {{while at the same time}} avoiding unscheduled maintenance (unscheduled maintenance is typically more costly than scheduled maintenance and results in system downtime). Garga et al. REF describe conceptually a pre-estimate aggregation hybrid approach where domain knowledge is used to change the structure of a neural network, thus resulting in a more parsimonius representation of the network. Another way to accomplish the pre-estimate aggregation is by a combined off-line process and on-line process: In the off-line mode, one can use a physics-based simulation model to understand the relationships of sensor response to fault state; In the <b>on-line</b> <b>mode,</b> one can use data to identify current damage state, then track the data to characterize damage propagation, and finally apply an individualized data-driven propagation model for remaining life prediction.|$|E

Responses to these perceptions of traditional and <b>on-line</b> <b>modes</b> of delivery are compared and analysed for significant differences. While students were generally positive in response to the learning experiences, analysis of the results shows that students found the traditional modes to assist in their learning significantly more than <b>on-line</b> <b>modes.</b> Students were neutral regarding the opportunity for engagement that <b>on-line</b> <b>modes</b> provided.

40|$|An {{approach}} to on-line design of fuzzy controllers of Takagi-Sugeno type with gradually evolving structure is {{treated in the}} paper. Fuzzy rules, representing {{the structure of the}} controller are generated based on data collected during the process of control using newly introduced technique for on-line identification of Takagi-Sugeno systems.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. An {{approach}} to control non-linear objects based on evolving Rule-based (eR) models {{is presented in}} the paper. Fuzzy rules, representing the structure of the controller are generated based on data collected during the process of control using newly introduced technique for on-line identification of Takagi-Sugeno type of fuzzy rule-based models. Initially, the process is supposed to be controlled for few time steps by any other conventional type of controller (P, PID or a fuzzy one with a fixed structure determined off-line). Then, in <b>on-line</b> <b>mode</b> the output of the plant under control (including its dynamic) and the respective control signal applied has been memorised and stored. These data has been used to train in a non-iterative way the eR model representing the fuzzy controller, which aim is to control the plant at a given set point. The indirect adaptive control approach has been used in combination with the newly introduced on-line identification technique based on unsupervised learning of antecedent and consequent parts separately. This approach exploits the quasi-linear nature of Takagi-Sugeno models and builds-up the control rule-base structure and adapts it in <b>on-line</b> <b>mode.</b> The method is illustrated with an example from air-conditioning systems, though it has wider potential applications...|$|E
