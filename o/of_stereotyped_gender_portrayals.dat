40|$|As one of {{the most}} visible {{marketing}} tools, advertising is no new to social controversy and ethical concerns. Despite advertising ethics has been defined as the ultimate oxymoron (Beltramini 2003), the study of ethics of/in advertising is quite ancient and extensive. However, advertising ethics has been studied mainly in a moral-philosophical perspective and from a “macro” viewpoint. Few scholars have examined the ethical practice of advertising professionals (Drumwright & Murphy, 2004) or the specific topic of the advertising practice relating to gender representations. In spite of persistent criticisms of advertising’s treatment of gender (Kilbourne, 1999) and despite some studies about professionals’ ethical dilemmas (Drumwright & Murphy, 2004, 2009; Fraedrich, Ferrell, & Pride, 1989; Moon & Franke, 2000; Pratt & James, 1994), few authors have focused their attention on the production process behind the gendered messages (Tuncay Zayer & Coleman, 2014). In Italy, in particular, there is a rich literature on gender stereotypes in advertisements, a recent surge of attention among professionals about the bias in the media representations of women, but there is no study about the production processes or the perceptions of gendered images among professionals. Thus, the paper focused on the advertising practice as it relates to gender. In order to appreciate the commercial “culture of production” (du Gay, 1997), we studied the production processes that lead to particular gender representations {{and the manner in which}} advertising professionals make sense of ethical issues related to gender portrayals within their societal contexts. In particular, we tried to discover where the ideas for certain gender representations come from, who determine how and what gender-based advertising should be, which are the prevailing cultural norms and practices in the advertising gender representations, what are practitioners’ perceptions of how advertising gender portrayals impact male and female audiences, in what ways do ethics inform their creative and strategic choices regarding gender portrayals in advertising. We hypothesized that the professionals are actors in a broader institutional system and their beliefs and actions are shaped within the organizations to which they belong and the society where certain gender discourses prevail (Tuncay Zayer & Coleman 2014). Because the study’s aim is to understand practitioners’ thinking about the work of advertising in their own terms and to evaluate those thoughts relative to existing theories, a qualitative design was selected. Semistructured in-depth interviews with senior-level agency practitioners (at least 20 creative, planning, and account directors working in Italy) were used as the key field method. Respondents were selected using snowball sampling. First results provide evidence for the existence of such autonomous practitioner knowledge schemas. Advertising agency professionals know well the bias of the most common representations of gender in Italian advertising. They recognize the most frequent sex-stereotypes and are particularly critical towards them. In particular, the respondents believe that the gendered images are mainly caused by inexperienced operators or customers. They appreciate the cases of innovative representation of gender identity and strongly believe in the need for professional ethics that protects a more equitable and respectful gender representation. Finally, they are aware of the impact on the public <b>of</b> <b>stereotyped</b> <b>gender</b> <b>portrayals,</b> but they do not believe in the need for more or stricter codes of conduct...|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the topic <b>of</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in advertising and discover the reason for the continued use <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in advertising. This paper aims to explore whether or not there is a purpose behind the use <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> and explore how consumers respond to advertising campaigns of this nature. This will be achieved by comparing past academic studies and primary research conducted by the author on this paper. Having conducted an in-depth study into the literature on the topic a study was conducted based on this research. This study used a quantitative approach using an online questionnaire which was created and distributed by the author. This questionnaire was constructed with all of the objectives and sub-objects in mind in order to gain a better insight into how consumers actually respond to this issue. The literature found there was a great divide between people who cared about the use <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in advertising and those who were either indifferent and those who liked their use. This was quite similar to the results found from the survey. Although opinions were divided on the reaction to the use <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes,</b> it was clear that the use <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> affect a brand’s image and may even go as far as stopping people from buying their products. This observation is something that marketers need to be made aware of for future actions. From the literature there is a difference in opinion amongst scholars on the subject <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> in advertising. Furthermore the effect <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> on brand equity was not examined in-depth.

40|$|The {{assignment}} investigates {{whether the}} new module at the teacher training institute; Gender, Sexuality and Diversity, can support the work against the <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> in Danish kindergartens. The subject is investigated {{on account of the}} following problem definition: How can the teacher training institute work against the reproduction <b>of</b> the <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> in kindergartens? The offset of the assignment is Bourdieu’s theory of symbolic power, the masculine dominant and habitus. Through this theoretical framework interviews with students and a teacher from the teacher training institute attempt to highlight which problems occur in the kindergarten’s work with gender. An analysis of the fieldwork done in the report: “Flere end to slags børn” – combined with the theories of Bourdieu – show that teachers who have not had an education in the subject Gender lack knowledge within this area. This has the effect that the teachers are less attentive of the categorisation of the boys and girls they unconsciously exercise. When these observations are combined with Bourdieu’s theory, the assignment deduces that the teacher’s embodied habitus play a great role in determining which gender categorisation the kindergarten exercises. The analysis uses examples from the report combined with data from the interviews to show which new possibilities the education could offer the students in order to highlight attention on the subject Gender. The interviews of the assignment show that the new module at the teacher training institute; Gender, Sexuality and Diversity, is a large step in order to work against the reproduction <b>of</b> <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> – as mentioned by Bourdieu...|$|R

40|$|Advertising {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pervasive}} means of mass communication, and is widely acknowledged as a potent social artefact. In advertising, gender forms a fundamental basis for segmentation, and creation, of advertising design of verbal and visual rhetoric. In light of the strong relationship between gender and advertising, this study explores the representation of men and women in magazine advertisements. This study presents a conceptual extension of the gender display frameworks by (Belkaoui and Belkaoui, 1976), Goffman (1979), and extended by Kang (1997). A new category, ‘Eye Contact’ was also added to test as a relevant form of gender display. For this research, 167 advertisements from fashion and lifestyle magazines in the UK were analysed to assess the presence <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in the advertising characterisations and imagery. Previous research identified an overwhelming presence <b>of</b> gender-based <b>stereotyping</b> in advertisements in all forms of media. Women were often found to be associated with either domestic or sexualised contexts. Male images were characterised by professional settings, or in highly active, masculinised settings. Based on past research, this study explored the extent <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> in contemporary advertisements based on location, setting, behavioural display, and magazine type. It further sought to investigate the applicability <b>of</b> Goffman’s <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in contemporary advertising, and identify new ones. Content analysis revealed that <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> continues to exist in magazine advertisements. However, the degree and nature <b>of</b> <b>stereotyping</b> has changed.

Moreover, the study also found a high level <b>of</b> reverse <b>stereotyping,</b> with men observed to be displaying typically ‘feminine’ forms of behaviour, such as ‘Licensed Withdrawal’, ‘Feminine Touch’, and Body Display’. The distribution of images displaying ‘Body Display’ was observed to be equal between male and female images.
