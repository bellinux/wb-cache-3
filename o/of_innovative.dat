The game world is populated by roaming enemies: three dragons that can eat the avatar and a bat that randomly steals and hides items around the game world. Adventure introduced a number <b>of</b> <b>innovative</b> game elements to console games, including a playing area that spanned several different screens and enemies that continued to move even when not displayed on the screen.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues of the economic conditions transformation is formation of a weighed regional policy.

The aim of the article is the conceptual approach grounding of the scientific and technical management <b>of</b> regional <b>innovative</b> development in order to ensure government efficiency in solving regional economic problems. The conceptual seme of the scientific and technical management <b>of</b> regional <b>innovative</b> development includes the following stages: 1) analysis of a country scientific, technical and legal innovative development support; 2) analysis <b>of</b> a country <b>innovative</b> development programs; 3) elaboration <b>of</b> regional <b>innovative</b> development strategy; 4) formation of the scientific and technical managing mechanism <b>of</b> regional <b>innovative</b> development.

5|$|After {{five years}} at West Point, Devers was {{selected}} to attend the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He began his studies there on 3 September 1924, and finished as a Distinguished Graduate on 28 June 1925. He was ranked 42nd {{in the class of}} 258, which was topped by Dwight Eisenhower. He was then posted once again to Fort Sill, this time as the director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929. Among the officers he worked with was Captain Edward H. Brooks. During his tour, Devers was credited with making a number <b>of</b> <b>innovative</b> artillery tactical and technical improvements, including advanced fire-support techniques that would later be successfully used during World War II. He remained a staunch advocate of mechanization throughout the inter-war period. The idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the districts}} include Norman- or medieval-era churches, {{many of which}} are {{included}} in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic architecture church towers. The prolific construction of the towers—some started before 1360—was typically accomplished by a master mason and a small team of itinerant masons, supplemented by local parish labourers, according to Poyntz Wright. But other authors reject this model, suggesting instead that leading architects designed the parish church towers based on early examples of Perpendicular design and ornamentation developed for cathedrals—their most important commissions. Contract builders carried out the plans, adding a distinctive mix <b>of</b> <b>innovative</b> details and decorations as new designs emerged over the years. These are included in the List of towers in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three decades, Kilburn led the {{development}} of a succession <b>of</b> <b>innovative</b> Manchester computers. The first, commenced in 1951, was a development of the Mark I known as the megacycle machine or Meg, that replaced the vacuum tube diodes with solid state ones. This permitted an order of magnitude increase in the clock rate. To add further speed, Kilburn provided for 10-bit parallel CRT memory. It {{was also one of the}} first computers, if not the first, to have floating point arithmetic. Meg operated for the first time in 1954, and nineteen were sold by Ferranti, six of them to customers overseas.|$|E

5|$|The Ilyushin Il-20 was a Soviet {{prototype}} for a heavily armored ground-attack aircraft {{to replace the}} Ilyushin Il-10. It featured a number <b>of</b> <b>innovative</b> concepts including a cockpit mounted {{on top of the}} engine, directly behind the propeller, and wing-mounted autocannon that could be adjusted on the ground to fire level or depressed 23° to allow the aircraft to strafe ground targets while remaining in level flight. However it was slower than the Il-10, and its M-47 engine was problematic in flight tests in 1948–49. It was not placed into production. The test pilots called the aircraft the Gorbach (Hunchback).|$|E

5|$|When compared, Black signers {{were more}} likely than were White signers to produce signs outside of the typical signing space and to use two-handed signs. Adverbs are most likely to use a larger signing space. Less marked forms, such as pronouns, determiners, plain verbs, and nouns, tend to be less likely to be {{produced}} outside the typical signing space. The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have systematic constraints on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign; if the following sign was two-handed, they {{were more likely}} to produce a two-handed variant, while if the following sign was one-handed, {{they were more likely to}} produce the one-handed variant. The use <b>of</b> <b>innovative</b> one-handed forms, though, even in environments which favored them, did not exceed 50 percent.|$|E
40|$|I {{study the}} {{determinants}} of global R&D collaboration in a dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous innovation by researchers from two regions: one more innovative, and the other less <b>innovative.</b> The extent <b>of</b> global R&D collaboration is found {{to depend on the}} size of global and local markets. Globalization through the entry <b>of</b> new, less <b>innovative</b> country into the world trading system enhances inter-regional R&D collaboration, while the entry <b>of</b> more <b>innovative</b> conutries discourages it.

5|$|Keep {{design in}} England {{began to change}} only {{towards the end of}} the 12th century, later than in France. Wooden keeps on mottes ceased to be built across most of England by the 1150s, {{although}} they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Welsh Marches. By the end of the 12th century, England and Ireland saw a handful <b>of</b> <b>innovative</b> angular or polygonal keeps built, including the keep at Orford Castle, with three rectangular, clasping towers built out from the high, circular central tower; the cross-shaped keep of Trim Castle and the famous polygonal design at Conisborough. Despite these new designs, square keeps remained popular across much of England and, as late as the 1170s, square Norman great keeps were being built at Newcastle. Circular keep designs similar to those in France really became popular in Britain in the Welsh Marches and Scotland for only a short period during the early 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Much of Sibelius's reputation, {{during his}} {{lifetime}} and subsequently, derived from {{his work as a}} symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time {{there was no reason to}} suppose that the flow <b>of</b> <b>innovative</b> orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh.|$|E
