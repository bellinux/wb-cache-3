5|$|In 1922, {{the number}} of {{supporters}} had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number <b>of</b> <b>spectators</b> at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the team's six home matches had {{an average}} {{attendance}} of 22,753. In a survey of German football fans, 65percent of the male and 62percent of the female respondents said {{they were interested in}} women's football. However, this popularity is mostly limited to international matches. Although the number <b>of</b> <b>spectators</b> in the women's Bundesliga has more than doubled since 2003, the average attendance in the 2007–08 season (887) was still less than three percent of that of the men's Bundesliga (38,612).|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, home matches {{were mostly}} played in smaller towns with no {{professional}} football clubs.

Today, the team usually plays in stadiums with 10,000 to 25,000 seats. The ten largest German cities have only hosted five international matches. The team have played twice in Frankfurt and Berlin, and once Hamburg. Bremen, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Essen, Cologne, Munich and Stuttgart have never hosted an international match of the women's team.|$|E

5|$|On September 30, gales {{from the}} former {{hurricane}} swept across the Great Lakes. Hundreds <b>of</b> <b>spectators</b> lined the shores of Lake Michigan at Chicago, Illinois, to watch the enormous waves. A schooner was torn from its moorings at Chicago, and crashed into nearly a dozen smaller vessels while being blown about. The schooner Belle from Racine, Wisconsin, went missing amid the storm, while the barge Sumatra broke up and capsized near Milwaukee, taking the lives of four crew members; the captain, first mate, and cook were safely rescued. The storm damaged around $75,000 worth of property on the Great Lakes.|$|E

On September 18, 2007, the court issued its decision in Conaway v. Deane, overturning the trial court ruling for the plaintiffs in a 4–3 decision, and holding that the statutory ban on same-sex marriage did not violate the Maryland Constitution.|$|E

40|$|World {{football}} (or soccer) {{has undergone}} an intensive hypercommodification {{over the past}} decade or so. This article examines the impact of this process on forms <b>of</b> <b>spectator</b> identification with top professional football clubs. Drawing upon previous analyses by Taylor and Critcher (on football) and the theories of Bryan Turner (on body culture), the article advances four ideal types <b>of</b> <b>spectator</b> identity: supporters, followers, fans, and flâneurs. The broad trend in sports identification is away from the supporter model (with its hot, traditional identification with local clubs) and toward the more detached, cool, consumer-orientated identification of the flâneur...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} relationships between personal life values and spectator sport consumption. From Kahle (1983), Rokeach (1973), and Schwartz (1992, 1996) value systems, twenty-eight personal values were identified probably relevant to spectator sport consumption {{for inclusion in}} a survey. A questionnaire was designed to assess the importance of each value and the frequency <b>of</b> <b>spectator</b> sport consumption. The questionnaires were administered through which 384 participants rated the importance of each value in their daily lives. The questionnaires also included assessment <b>of</b> <b>spectator</b> sport consumption in terms of in-person viewing, media consumption, and discussion with others. Using an exploratory logistic regression with values as predictor variables and consumption as a dependent variable, {{it was concluded that}} values of loyalty and a sense of accomplishment predicted consuming spectator sports. These values might stimulate motives of team affiliation and vicarious achievement for watching sports. On the other hand, those who placed importance on creativity and morality tended to consume spectator sports to a lesser degree. These results provided a better understanding of motivation for sport consumption and indicated possible negative connotations <b>of</b> <b>spectator</b> sports...|$|R

Eventually, police agreed to a deal with the counsel, in which Sumaji's pre-trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from his lawyers to not sue for wrongful arrest. Sumaji was released on 17 December, awaiting trial. In early 1997, Sumaji's case was refused by the prosecutor's office several times due to weak evidence.|$|E

Tunis' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America. He believed that amateur participation in sports taught values important for good citizenship like perseverance, fair play and equality, and that the emphasis on professional sports was turning America into a country <b>of</b> <b>spectators.</b> His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality.|$|E

With its debut to a Western audience at the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, the company redesignated the aircraft as Su-35.
