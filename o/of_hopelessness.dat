5|$|The interwar {{years were}} marked by {{economic}} stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness</b> that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipbuilding}} industry {{expanded by}} a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 {{and it did not}} fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness</b> that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|A pervading sense <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness,</b> {{brought on}} by {{physical}} exhaustion, poverty and monotony.|$|E
60|$|A sense <b>of</b> the <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> her task oppressed Mary. She {{put on her}} hat without replying, {{and turned}} to go.|$|R
60|$|Another negative. The next {{girl was}} Becky Thatcher. Tom was {{trembling}} {{from head to}} foot with excitement and a sense <b>of</b> the <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> the situation.|$|R

25|$|The trauma {{resulting}} from these crimes included {{a range of}} {{mental and physical health}} problems including feelings <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness,</b> flashbacks, erectile dysfunction, orgasmic dysfunction, and coital pain.|$|E
25|$|Hope - a {{man trying}} {{to break out of}} the museum <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness.</b> His muscles, brain and {{backbone}} have been removed and his pickaxe has been blunted, rendering his attempt hopeless.|$|E
60|$|Jim Scroggles {{shook his}} head, {{partly as a}} rebuke to the impertinent little monkey and partly as an {{indication}} <b>of</b> the <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> his being able to return a satisfactory answer to his own question.|$|R
6000|$|... "He does. This {{statement}} of a force, which you may freely examine {{with your own}} eyes, if so disposed, must convince you <b>of</b> the <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> resistance, and will, he thinks, induce you to accept his offers." ...|$|R
50|$|Bernardo O'Higgins, {{who knew}} him before the {{revolution}} (because both were powerful neighbors in the same province), offered to recognize his rank if he joined the patriot army. Lantaño, apparently convinced <b>of</b> the <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> the royalist cause, accepted the offer.|$|R
25|$|Mathieu Vilandré and Steve Chartier (aka Esteve Decalisse) {{were brought}} on guitar and bass {{respectively}} {{just in time}} for touring in support of Fuck the Fact’s next release, Legacy <b>of</b> <b>Hopelessness.</b> This six-song EP had been recorded in the fall of 2004 and was co-released in June 2005 through Topon's Ghetto Blaster Recordings and Steve's label Capital Kill. A much more experimental release, Legacy <b>of</b> <b>Hopelessness</b> featured more electronic and ambient elements combined with the usual Fuck the Facts grindcore sound. The summer support tour for the EP took the band all the way from Sydney, Nova Scotia to Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
25|$|People with {{borderline}} {{personality disorder}} are particularly {{likely to use}} emotional blackmail (as too are destructive narcissists). However, their actions may be impulsive and driven by fear and a desperate sense <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness,</b> rather than being the product of any conscious plan.|$|E
25|$|Peter Hays {{has refused}} to give his lawyer any {{information}} on his background, something that counted against him with the district attorney, and seems depressed to the point <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness,</b> using the novel's title Might as well be dead to describe how he feels. This tends to validate Archie's tentative identification, but a personal meeting of Archie with Hays {{would be needed to}} be sure.|$|E
60|$|For Mariposilla {{alone the}} {{announcement}} of Sidney's marriage contained crushing evidences of his final desertion. The poor child had always believed that her lover would return. We {{had never been able}} to convince her <b>of</b> the <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> the dream.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} Clayton {{regained his}} feet, and without thought <b>of</b> the utter <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> it, he rushed forward {{to drag the}} ape from his wife's prostrate form.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can’t say," [...] said Halibut; [...] "but I don’t think it’s {{any good}} your waiting at all, because if I see any signs that Mrs. Riddel {{is waiting for}} you I may just give her a hint <b>of</b> the <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R
25|$|Upon {{return from}} the Legacy <b>of</b> <b>Hopelessness</b> tour, Mathieu Vilandré and Steve Chartier were brought into the band as {{permanent}} members. It was {{at this time that}} the band recorded a two-song pre-production demo as an indicator of the direction the band would be taking for their next album. These demos were eventually released on two splits (with Pleasant Valley and Mesrine), and were used to look for a possible record deal.|$|E
25|$|When Backstabber Etiquette was {{recorded}} in 2002, vocalist Mel Mongeon had replaced Christoff, and her distinctive growl was markedly different than Brent's deep sound. Mel's higher pitched scream became the norm for the band. The musical style became more heavily influenced by death metal and showed more technical aspirations. This style persisted over the splits recorded between Backstabber Etiquette and Legacy <b>of</b> <b>Hopelessness</b> (these recordings are largely what make up the tracks on the Collection of Splits 2002-2004).|$|E
25|$|The {{desire of}} the German people to be one nation again {{remained}} strong, but {{was accompanied by a}} feeling <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness</b> through the 1970s and into the 1980s; Die Wende, when it arrived in the late 1980s driven by the East German people, came as a surprise, leading to the 1990 elections which put a government in place that negotiated the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany and reunited East and West Germany, and the process of inner reunification began.|$|E
50|$|Institutional depression: A pattern <b>of</b> anxiety, <b>hopelessness,</b> demoralization, isolation, and disharmony {{circulating}} {{through an}} organization.|$|R
5|$|Kesselring {{endorsed}} Hitler's {{order that}} deserters should be hanged {{from the nearest}} tree. When a staff officer sought to make him aware <b>of</b> the <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> the situation, Kesselring {{told him that he}} had driven through the entire army rear area and not seen a single hanged man.|$|R
5000|$|After Stalingrad, {{the main}} theme changed to Germany {{as the sole}} defender of what they called [...] "Western European culture" [...] against the [...] "Bolshevist hordes". The {{introduction}} of the V-1 and V-2 [...] "vengeance weapons" [...] was emphasized to convince Britons <b>of</b> the <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> defeating Germany.|$|R
25|$|Explanations for {{the delayed}} {{presentation}} {{among women in}} Ghana have been traced to the cost of, and access to, and routine screening mammography. Furthermore, women with breast cancer in Ghana describe a feeling <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness</b> and helplessness, largely due to their belief in fatalism, which contributes to denial {{as a means of}} coping. Mayo et al. (2003) conclude, however, that lack of awareness may be a more critical variable than fatalism in explaining health care decisions among women in Ghana.|$|E
25|$|Legacy <b>of</b> <b>Hopelessness</b> showcased {{a bit of}} a {{departure}} for the band in that it had a lot more electronic influences. Keyboards are featured on nearly every track, and are sometimes the primary focus. Of course, grindcore is still quite present as well as Mel's distinctive vocals. The change in musical style can probably be attributed to this being initially intended to be a solo release by Topon, but was migrated over to the band when it was realized that another full-length release was not quite feasible.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} {{widespread}} political discontent characterized by bitter armed conflict. King Louis-Philippe of France was overthrown in the Revolution of 1848 and a republic was declared with a Provisional Government. Three new political groups emerged during that era: {{they were the}} liberals, radicals and the socialists. The combination of man-made and natural disasters in Corsica created an acute feeling <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness.</b> All this came about {{at a time when}} Spain was growing fearful of the possibility of a rebellion in her Caribbean possessions, which consisted of Puerto Rico and Cuba.|$|E
60|$|Bradley rose. He {{would have}} done more had she asked it. He began by {{speaking}} of the Grange and its decline, and <b>of</b> the apparent <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> expecting the farmers to remain united.|$|R
60|$|The {{little fellow}} was half-dozing, but words {{of prayer and}} faith kept {{dropping}} from his tongue. Pain, and a stronger vitality alike, kept Jock free from the torpor, and he used his utmost efforts to rouse his brother; {{but every now and}} then a horrible conviction <b>of</b> the <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> their condition came over him.|$|R
40|$|This article gives a brief {{introduction}} <b>of</b> teamed <b>hopelessness</b> {{with special}} emphasis on how the <b>hopelessness</b> theory <b>of</b> depression is developed (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989) and its application to studies <b>of</b> learned <b>hopelessness</b> in achievement domains. Within the theoretical framework, the concepts of attributional styles, causal attributions, learned hopelessness, and hopelessness deficits are discussed. The research problems in conceptual and assessment issues, particularly on learned hopelessness and attributional styles are highlighted. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} known associations between the media and suicide arose from Goethe's novel Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (The Sorrows of Young Werther). Soon after its publication in 1774, young men began to mimic the main character by dressing in yellow pants and blue jackets. In the novel, Werther shoots himself with a pistol after he is rejected by the woman he loves, and shortly after its publication {{there were reports of}} young men using the same method to kill themselves in an act <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the major}} themes {{explored}} in Wendy Rose’s works are themes relating to the Native American experience (both specifically her own and also more broadly applied to other cultures of marginalization): colonialism, imperialism, dependency, nostalgia for the old ways, reverence for grandparents, resentment for conditions of the present, plight of reservation and urban Indians, sense <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness,</b> {{the power of the}} trickster, feminism as synonymous with heritage, deadly compromise, symbolism of all that has been lost (such as land), tension between the desire to retrieve the past and the inevitability of change, arrogance of white people, problems of half-breeds (or mixed-bloods).|$|E
25|$|A boom {{was created}} by the First World War, with the {{shipbuilding}} industry expanding by a third, but a serious depression hit the economy by 1922. The most skilled craftsmen were especially hard hit, because there were few alternative uses for their specialised skills. The main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense <b>of</b> <b>hopelessness</b> that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|Often {{the leaders}} {{are the first}} to change loyalties, for they have had access to privileged {{information}} and are more aware <b>of</b> the <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> the situation for their former cause. This is especially apparent in dictatorships and authoritarian states when most of the population has been fed propaganda and triumphalism and has been kept in the dark about important turns of events.|$|R
6000|$|Ida {{dropped her}} glance. [...] "Yes, that's so; I'll {{admit that it}} has that effect, or it would if you didn't talk <b>of</b> the <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> trying to do anything. Don't feel alarmed," [...] she said, turning to the others, [...] "Mr. Cargill and I {{understand}} each other very well. We've known each other so long that {{we can afford to}} talk plain." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed a}} useless, because impossible, task {{to attempt to}} check the {{progress}} of or extinguish the burning oil, and yet the assembled multitude attacked it with a will that seemed all the more heroic because <b>of</b> the well-nigh <b>hopelessness</b> <b>of</b> the labor.|$|R
