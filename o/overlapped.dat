5|$|NY43 was {{extended}} slightly following {{the construction of}} a new alignment for NY30 near Central Bridge in the early 1940s. NY30 now left its old alignment southeast of Central Bridge and bypassed the community to the east. The former routing of NY30 into Central Bridge became an extension of NY43, which <b>overlapped</b> NY30 between the new alignment and Schoharie. When NY30A replaced NY148 in the late 1950s, the short piece of NY43 near Central Bridge became part of NY30A and NY43 was truncated back to NY30 near Schoharie. In the late 1960s, NY43 was rerouted through downtown Rensselaer to follow 3rd Avenue (previously NY381) east to US4.

Lastly, the part of US4 south of Northern Drive (then-NY40) in Troy was concurrent to NY40. By 1932, NY40 was rerouted through Troy to follow a more easterly alignment through the city.

Two types of <b>overlap</b> were observed: <b>overlaps</b> that were continuers or assessments and did not substantially contribute to the conversation or demand attention away from the speaker, and <b>overlaps</b> that were questions or statements and moved the conversation forwards. The majority of <b>overlap</b> during the study consisted of continuers or assessments that were non-interruptive. <b>Overlapping</b> questions and their interactional environment were analyzed in particular.

In response, speakers who are interrupted by <b>overlapping</b> questions continue on to clarify their meaning. This suggests that <b>overlapping</b> questions, while interruptive in the fact that they demand attention away from the speaker, are cooperative in nature in that they significantly contribute to achieving mutual understanding and communication.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Overlapping</b> {{community}} detection is {{a popular}} topic in complex networks. As compared to disjoint community structure, <b>overlapping</b> community structure is more suitable to describe networks at a macroscopic level. <b>Overlaps</b> shared by communities {{play an important role}} in combining different communities. In this paper, two methods are proposed to detect <b>overlapping</b> community structure. One is called clique optimization, and the other is named fuzzy detection. Clique optimization aims at detecting granular <b>overlaps.</b> The clique optimization method is a fine grain scale approach. Each granular <b>overlap</b> is a node connected to distinct communities and it is highly connected to each community. Fuzzy detection is at a coarser grain scale and aims at identifying modular <b>overlaps.</b> Modular <b>overlaps</b> represent groups of nodes that have high community membership degrees with several communities. A modular <b>overlap</b> is itself a possible cluster/sub-community. Experimental studies in synthetic networks and real networks show that both methods provide good performances in detecting <b>overlapping</b> nodes but in different views. In addition, a new extension of modularity is introduced for measuring the quality of <b>overlapping</b> community structure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Between {{five and}} {{fourteen}} per cent of {{genes in the}} vertebrate genomes do <b>overlap</b> sharing some intronic and/or exonic sequence. It was observed that majority of these <b>overlaps</b> are not conserved among vertebrate lineages. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain gene <b>overlap</b> origination the evolutionary basis of these phenomenon are still not well understood. Here, we present results of the comparative analysis of several vertebrate genomes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine <b>overlapping</b> genes in the context of their evolution and mechanisms leading to their origin. Results Based on the presence and arrangement of human <b>overlapping</b> genes orthologs in rodent and fish genomes we developed 15 theoretical scenarios of <b>overlapping</b> genes evolution. Analysis of these theoretical scenarios and close examination of genomic sequences revealed new mechanisms leading to the <b>overlaps</b> evolution and confirmed that many of the vertebrate gene <b>overlaps</b> are not conserved. This study also demonstrates that repetitive elements contribute to the <b>overlapping</b> genes origination and, for the first time, that evolutionary events could lead to the loss of an ancient <b>overlap.</b> Conclusion Birth as well as most probably death of gene <b>overlaps</b> occurred over the entire time of vertebrate evolution and there wasn't any rapid origin or 'big bang' in the course of <b>overlapping</b> genes evolution. The major forces in the gene <b>overlaps</b> origination are transposition and exaptation.

40|$|Abstract Background Although the <b>overlap</b> of {{transcriptional}} units occurs {{frequently in}} eukaryotic genomes, its evolutionary and biological significance remains largely unclear. Here we report a comparative analysis of <b>overlaps</b> between genes coding for well-annotated proteins in five metazoan genomes (human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly and worm). Results For all analyzed species the observed number of <b>overlapping</b> genes is always lower than expected assuming functional neutrality, suggesting that gene <b>overlap</b> is negatively selected. The {{comparison to the}} random distribution also shows that retained <b>overlaps</b> do not exhibit random features: antiparallel <b>overlaps</b> are significantly enriched, while <b>overlaps</b> lying on the same strand and those involving coding sequences are highly underrepresented. We confirm that <b>overlap</b> is mostly species-specific and provide evidence that it frequently originates through the acquisition of terminal, non-coding exons. Finally, we show that <b>overlapping</b> genes tend to be significantly co-expressed in a breast cancer cDNA library obtained by 454 deep sequencing, and that different <b>overlap</b> types display different patterns of reciprocal expression. Conclusion Our data suggest that <b>overlap</b> between protein-coding genes is selected against in Metazoa. However, when retained it {{may be used as}} a species-specific mechanism for the reciprocal regulation of neighboring genes. The tendency of <b>overlaps</b> to involve non-coding regions of the genes leads to the speculation that the advantages achieved by an <b>overlapping</b> arrangement may be optimized by evolving regulatory non-coding transcripts. </p...|$|R
