2500|$|Written history {{relevant}} to the Aché begins with the founding of Asunción in 1524. A few years later, in 1554, a small village (Guaira) was founded by the Spanish on the Parana river {{near the site of}} modern-day Guaira, Brazil. [...] Fr. Luis de Bolaños arrived in Paraguay 1575, mastered the Guarani language and founded 18 Guarani villages in the province of Guaira between 1580 and 1593. Evidence of groups in Eastern Paraguay, that might have been Aché, comes from the earliest Jesuit archives around 1620. [...] Non-Guarani groups that lived from hunting and gathering were often referred to as Caaygua or Caigua (Kaingang groups from the Southern Je language family). Descriptions of some Caaigua match fairly well with 20th-century descriptions of the Aché. For example, Techo (1897) describes them as hunter-gatherers who ate only palm pith and fruits, venison and roots, and fastened little stones to their lips, which made them look ferocious, and he states that they worshipped only thunder. [...] This is congruous with the Aché, whose economy is indeed based on palm pith and meat, and whose spiritual beliefs place [...] "Berendy" [...] (associated with booming meteors) in a central position. Lozano (1873) provides a seven-page early description of the Aché (whom he called [...] "Guayagui"), using a summary of Jesuit archives from the 17th century. [...] This description includes accurate information about the Aché economy, social <b>organization,</b> <b>culture</b> and belief system. [...] Lozano and Techo also described how some Aché bands were captured near the mouth of the Acaray river in the 1630s, and forcibly brought to a Guarani Mission. [...] That group of Aché captives all perished from disease within a few months.|$|E
