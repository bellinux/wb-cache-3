Their route went along the Warta and Noteć rivers, then crossed Kujawy and Masovia, turned south along the Bug River and continued <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> today is Moldavia, where they settled and developed the Poienesti-Lukasevka culture. The route is marked by archeological findings, especially the characteristic bronze crown-shaped necklaces.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{debate over}} the {{applicability}} of the Hague Conventions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki revolves around whether the Conventions can be assumed to cover modes of warfare that were at the time unknown; whether rules for artillery bombardment can be applied to rules for aerial bombing. As well, the debate hinges <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> degree the Hague Conventions was being followed by the warring countries.|$|E
25|$|Until this time, the Byzantine Empire {{had been}} {{concerned}} solely with survival and with holding <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they already had. Numerous expeditions to Crete and Sicily were sadly {{reminiscent of the}} failures of Heraclius, even though the Arab conquest of Sicily did not go according to plan. After Leo's death in 912 the Empire became embroiled in problems with the regency of the seven-year-old Constantine VII and with invasions of Thrace by Simeon I of Bulgaria.|$|E

25|$|The {{conclusion}} contained many factual errors: eating {{fish and}} shellfish from {{other areas of the}} Shiranui Sea, not just Minamata Bay, could cause the disease; eating small amounts, as well as large amounts of contaminated fish over a long time also produced symptoms; the outbreak had not, in fact, ended in 1960 nor had mercury-removing wastewater facilities been installed in January 1960. Nevertheless, the government announcement brought a feeling of relief to a great many victims and their families. Many felt vindicated in their long struggle to force Chisso to accept responsibility for causing the disease and expressed thanks that their plight had been recognised by their social superiors. The struggle now focused <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> extent the victims should be compensated.|$|E
25|$|When she {{discovers the}} truth about Zelena's {{feelings}} for Hades' from Regina, Cora suspects that her daughter is being played for a fool by Hades, so she makes a potion from the Lethe that would make Zelena forget about Hades. When Cora finally meets Zelena, this mother-daughter reunion doesn't go smoothly as planned, and even Zelena is <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they did with {{the water from the}} River Lethe they put the spell on, as she turns down her mother's false apology. This leads to a fight between Regina and Zelena but before this escelates, Cora restores their childhood memories of each other and she regretted the way she raised them, and apologizes to her daughters. Now that the sisters have made peace, Cora decides that it's time for her to move on from her unfinished business. As they see their mother walk toward the bridge, the flames from the River of Fire erupt and wrap around her. But the flames die down, the bridge forms, and the gate opens, allowing Cora to move on to Mount Olympus to join her husband, Prince Henry Mills. Later on, Regina gives Zelena her blessing to be with Hades, who is waiting for her at the Underworld Diner for their second date, which Zelena sees as an opportunity to reform him.|$|E

The employees decide not to tell David about Andy's unapproved absence out of gratitude for Andy's past kindnesses, but at the meeting they cannot resist crafting made-up recent events in the hope that he will blow his own cover. However, when David meets with Andy he is almost completely oblivious to Andy's erroneous statements, and Andy quickly catches <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the employees are up to.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, most {{of these}} former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime forces were not from Chiang Kai-shek’s own clique, but instead, they were mainly {{consisted}} of troops of warlords who were only nominally under the Chiang Kai-shek’s before World War II, since they were nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independent and semi-independent status. [...] These warlords were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power {{in exchange for their}} collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet regimes once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. [...] Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists to gain more territories by holding <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over. [...] Chiang Kai-shek’s objective was to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, which proved to be an extremely fatal mistake for him and his nationalist regime later on, as shown in this conflict.|$|E
2500|$|Santa Anna's army marched toward Mexico City, winning small {{victories}} {{along the}} way. [...] Iturbide gathered and sent troops to combat Santa Anna, {{but the effort}} was not very strong. [...] Many of the military leaders that Iturbide appointed later turned on him upon contacting Santa Anna's forces. Iturbide later admitted {{he had made a}} mistake by not leading his armies himself. Iturbide recognized that, although his provisional Junta was working to call a new Congress, such a process would take too long, and all of the nation had accepted the Plan de la Casa Mata. Recognizing the wishes of the country, Iturbide did as he promised and personally reopened the same congress he closed in March 1823 to present his abdication to this body. This measure surprised the congress, as none of the rebellions had made a point out of demanding Iturbide's abdication. He later wrote that he was choosing abdication over bloody civil war. However, congress refused to accept it, arguing that such would imply that the existence of the throne was legitimate. [...] Instead they nullified their own election of Iturbide as emperor and refused to acknowledge the Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of Córdoba. This was recognized by some members of the Congress as very irregular. The Congress' powers flowed from Iturbide's naming of the Congress. By nullifying Iguala and Córdoba, the Congress nullified its own legitimacy. However, these inconsistencies within the mandate were brushed aside. [...] Leadership of the country was passed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was called the [...] "triumvirate," [...] made up of generals Guadalupe Victoria, Nicolás Bravo and Pedro Celestino Negrete.|$|E
2500|$|The second grave {{strategic}} miscalculation made by {{the retreating}} nationalists was also {{similar to the one}} the nationalists had made when it attempted to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long with the problem of the exterminating communists together: Those warlords allied with Chiang’s nationalist regime were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. [...] After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet regimes once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and those bandits and former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists to by holding <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was under their control and fighting off communists, and they and the communists would both be weakened. [...] Similarly, the bandits Chiang’s government had failed to exterminate were obviously not good candidates for neither joining the regular troops nor being honorably discharged, and using them to fight communists appeared to be the only logical alternative. [...] If the communists were great weakened by the bandits, then it would the nationalists would have easier time in their counterattacks to retake China. [...] If the bandits were defeated, then the nationalists would have easier job to eradicate them later after retaking China. [...] However, just like those warlords, these bandits were mostly only interested in keeping their own power also, and thus did not put any real efforts to fight the communists like some of the nationalists who were dedicated to their political cause. [...] The eradication of bandits by the communist regime only strengthened its popular support since previous governments dating back from Qing Dynasty had failed to do so.|$|E
