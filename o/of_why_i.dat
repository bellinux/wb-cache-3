And from this relationship between the words as a phonetic-semantic entirety and the music as the composed expression of the words, all of my later choral compositions are to be understood. And it is complete nonsense to conclude, from the analytic treatment of the sound shape of the text, that the semantic content is cast out. The question <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> chose just these texts and no others for a composition is no more intelligent than the question of why, in order to express the word [...] "stupid", one uses the letters arranged in the order s-t-u-p-i-d.|$|E

The game sold 5,822 copies on its first week, placing ninth for all game sales for that week.

Siliconera {{referred}} to the game as [...] "pretty much The Idolmaster meets Danganronpa." [...] Chris Carter of Destructoid opined that Idol Death Game TV is [...] "not something you typically see in an ocean of shooters and 'immersive' open world games, and that's part <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> love it." ...|$|E

It is always {{twilight}} in one's cell, as it is always twilight in one's heart. And in the sphere of thought, no less than in the sphere of time, motion is no more. The thing that you personally have long ago forgotten, or can easily forget, is happening to me now, and will happen to me again to- morrow.

"And now, my dear Mr. Syme," [...] said Gregory, {{throwing}} {{himself in}} an expansive manner {{on the bench}} under the largest bomb, [...] "now we are quite cosy, so let us talk properly.

Suffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow, and, to do you justice, you are still. I would break twenty oaths of secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg.

60|$|It {{is curious}} how one's motive for {{embarking on a}} course of conduct changes or disappears {{altogether}} as the action develops. Once started on an enterprise {{it is as if}} one proceeded with it automatically, irrespective of one's original motives. I had begun what I might call the second phase of this matter of the Little Nugget, the abandoning of Cynthia's cause in favour of Audrey's, with a clear idea <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> was doing it. I had set myself to resist the various forces which were trying to take Ogden from Audrey, for one simple reason, because I loved Audrey and wished to help her. That motive, if it still existed at all, did so only in the form of abstract chivalry. My personal feelings towards her seemed to have undergone a complete change, dating from our parting in the road the night before. I found myself now meeting hostility with hostility. I looked at her critically and told myself that her spell was broken at last, that, if she disliked me, I was at least indifferent to her.|$|E

In fact, I like your nephew much, and have long had my eye on him. I think him the very man for my purpose. I want a companion, too, in my business--one who is good at the pen and can turn his hand to anything. In short, {{it would be difficult to}} explain all the outs and ins <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> want him. But he's a tight, clever fellow, as I know, and I do want him, and if you'll let him go, I promise to bring him safe back again in the course of two years--if we are all spared. From what you've told me, I've no doubt the lad will be delighted to go. And, believe me, his golden dreams will be all washed out by the time he comes back. Now, what say you!" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{fragments}} of futile journalism or fleeting impression which are here collected are very like the wrecks and riven blocks that were piled {{in a heap}} round my imaginary priest of the sun. They are very like that grey and gaping head of stone that I found overgrown with the grass. Yet I will venture to make even of these trivial fragments the high boast that I am a medievalist and not a modern. That is, I really have a notion <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have collected all the nonsensical things there are. I have not the patience nor perhaps the constructive intelligence to state the connecting link between all these chaotic papers. But it could be stated. This row of shapeless and ungainly monsters which I now set before the reader does not consist of separate idols cut out capriciously in lonely valleys or various islands. These monsters are meant for the gargoyles of a definite cathedral. I have to carve the gargoyles, because I can carve nothing else; I leave to others the angels and the arches and the spires. But I am very sure of {{the style of the}} architecture, and of the consecration of the church.|$|E
6000|$|I {{will write}} you as nice a letter as I can, but {{would much rather}} [...] have a good talk with you. As I can't have the best thing I am [...] putting up with the second-best, {{contrary}} to my pet theory. I feel [...] as if I were in heaven to-day--all because the day is splendid and [...] I have been driving about all the morning in a small sleigh in the [...] fresh air and sunshine, until I found that I had in spite of [...] myself, for the time being, stopped asking the usual inward [...] question <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> was born. I {{am not going to}} Canada--I know no [...] better reason for this than because I said I was going. My [...] brother-in-law makes such a clamour when I propose departure that I [...] am easily overcome by his kindness and my own want of energy. [...] Besides, it is great fun to live here; the weather just now is [...] grand, and I knock about all day in a sleigh, and do nothing but [...] enjoy it and meditate. Then we are so near town that we often go in [...] for the day to shop and lunch with some of our numerous friends, [...] returning with a double relish for the country. We all went in on a [...] spree the other night and stayed at the Everett House; from which, [...] as a starting-point we poured ourselves in strong force upon Mrs. [...] Gracie King's ball--a very grand affair, given for a very pretty [...] Miss King, at Delmonico's. Our raid consisted of thirteen Emmets [...] and a moderate supply of Temples, and the ball was a great success. [...] It was two years since I had been to one and I enjoyed it so much [...] that I mean very soon to repeat the experiment--at the next [...] Assembly if possible. The men in society, in New York, this winter, [...] are principally a lot of feeble-minded boys; but I was fortunate [...] enough to escape them, as my partner for the German was a man of [...] thirty-five, the solitary man, I believe, in the room. Curiously [...] enough, I had danced my last German, two years before, in that very [...] place and with the same person. He is a Mr. Lee, who has spent [...] nearly all his life abroad; two of his sisters have married German [...] princes, and from knocking about so much he has become a thorough [...] cosmopolite. As he is intelligent, with nothing to do but amuse [...] himself, he is a very agreeable partner, and I mean to dance with [...] him again as soon as possible. I don't know why I have tried your [...] patience by writing so about a person you have never seen; unless [...] it's to show you that I haven't irrevocably given up the world, the [...] flesh and the devil, but am conscious of a faint charm about them [...] still when taken in small doses. I agree with you perfectly about [...] Uncle Henry--I should think he would be very irritating to the [...] legal mind; he is not at all satisfactory even to mine. Have you [...] seen much of Willy James lately? That is a rare creature, and one [...] in whom my intellect, if you will pardon the misapplication of the [...] word, takes more solid satisfaction than in almost anybody. I [...] haven't read Browning's new book--I mean to wait till you are by to [...] explain it to me--which reminds me, along with what you say about [...] wishing for the spring, that we shall go to North Conway next [...] summer, and that in that case you may as well make up your mind to [...] come and see us there. I can't wait longer than that for the [...] Browning readings. (Which would have been of The Ring and the [...] Book.) Arthur Sedgwick has sent me Matthew Arnold's photograph, [...] which Harry had pronounced so disappointing. I don't myself, on the [...] whole, find it so; on the contrary, after having looked at it much, [...] I like it--it quite harmonises with my notion of him, and I have [...] always had an affection for him. You must tell me something that [...] you are sure is true--I don't care much what it may be, I will [...] take your word for it. Things get into a muddle with me--how can I [...] give you [...] "a start on the way of righteousness"? You know that way [...] better than I do, and the only advice I can give you is not to stop [...] saying your prayers. I hope God may bless you, and beyond those [...] things I hardly know what is right, and therefore what to wish you. [...] Good-bye.|$|E
