2500|$|By 1883, {{the economy}} was now no longer {{in a state of}} {{monopoly}} conducted by the Japanese as it had been <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The majority was in control by the Koreans while portions were distributed between Western nations, Japan and China. In 1884, the first Korean commercial firms such as the Daedong and the Changdong Company emerged. The Bureau of Mint also produced a new coin called [...] "tangojeon" [...] in 1884, securing a stable Korean currency at the time. Western investment began to take hold as well in 1886.|$|E
2500|$|In 1931, after a {{visit to}} Berlin, Lewis {{published}} his book Hitler (1931), which presented Adolf Hitler as a [...] "man of peace" [...] whose party-members were threatened by communist street violence. This confirmed his unpopularity among liberals and anti-fascists, especially after Hitler {{came to power in}} 1933. Following a visit to Germany with his wife in 1937, Lewis changed his views and began to retract his previous political comments. He later wrote The Hitler Cult (1939), a book which firmly revoked his earlier willingness to entertain Hitler, but politically Lewis remained an isolated figure in the 1930s. In Letter to Lord Byron, Auden called him [...] "that lonely old volcano of the Right." [...] Lewis thought there was what he called a [...] "left-wing orthodoxy" [...] in Britain in the 1930s. He believed it was not in Britain's interest to ally itself with the Soviet Union, [...] "which the newspapers most of us read tell us has slaughtered out-of-hand, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> millions of its better fed citizens, as well as its whole imperial family".|$|E

2500|$|Vliet {{was forced}} to quickly form a new Magic Band to {{complete}} support-tour dates, with musicians who had no experience with his music and in fact had never heard it. Having {{no knowledge of the}} previous Magic Band style, they simply improvised what they thought would go with each song, playing much slicker versions that have been described as [...] "bar band" [...] versions of Beefheart songs. A review described this incarnation of the Magic Band as the [...] "Tragic Band", a term that has stuck over the years. Mike Barnes said that the description of the new band [...] "grooving along pleasantly", was [...] "...an appropriately banal description of the music of a man who <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> composed with the expressed intent of shaking listeners out of their torpor". The one album they recorded, Bluejeans & Moonbeams (1974) has, like its predecessor, a completely different, almost soft rock sound from any other Beefheart record. Neither was well received; drummer Art Tripp recalled that when he and the original Magic Band listened to Unconditionally Guaranteed, they [...] "...were horrified. As we listened, it was as though each song was worse than the one which preceded it". Beefheart later disowned both albums, calling them [...] "horrible and vulgar", asking that they not be considered part of his musical output and urging fans who bought them to [...] "take copies back for a refund".|$|E
2500|$|The Low German house first emerged {{towards the}} end of the Middle Ages. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> a Hallehuis was {{discovered}} in the Dutch province of Drenthe, the frame of which can be dated to 1386. In 2012 a [...] "hallehuis" [...] was discovered in Best, in the Dutch provincie of North Brabant, which dates back to 1262 and is still in use as a stable. The living part of the farm itself is built in recent times, in 1640 at the earliest, but probably around 1680. The farm is an official monument. The oldest surviving houses of this type in Germany date to the late 15th century (e.g. in Schwinde, Winsen Elbe Marsh 1494/95). Regional differences arose due to the need to adapt to local farming and climatic conditions. [...] The design also changed over time and was appropriate to its owner's social class. From the outset, and for a long time thereafter, people and animals were accommodated in different areas within a large room. Gradually the living quarters were separated from the working area and animals. The first improvements were separate sleeping quarters for the farmer and his family at the rear of the farmhouse. Sleeping accommodation for farmhands and maids was created above (in Westphalia) or next to (in Lower Saxony and Holstein) the livestock stalls at the sides. Finished linen, destined for sale, was also stored in a special room. As the demand for comfort and status increased, one or more rooms would be heated. Finally the stove was moved into an enclosed kitchen rather than being in a Flett or open hearth at the end of the hall.|$|E

At the same time he noted that the Dutch copers, or floating grog-shops, were regularly appointed to supply the fleets with cheap and bad spirits, and stuck to them through fair-weather and foul, in summer and winter, enduring hardship and encountering danger and great risk in pursuit of their evil calling. Up to that time a few lay missionaries and Bible-readers had occasionally gone to visit the fleets in the summer-time, [see Appendix], but the visitor of whom we write felt that there was a screw loose here, and reasoned with himself somewhat thus:-- ...|$|E

The maelstrom was there still, but he himself had crept out of it. What was there left? Peace, haunted with memories, rest, troubled by desire.

If youth had passed him by, still there were compensations! ...|$|E

He engraved his blast furnace, and the casting of a beam of a steam engine. This, to him, was the power of God,--it was his life. No greater earnestness was ever given by man to promulgate a Gospel. Nevertheless, the engraving is absolutely worthless. The blast furnace is not the power of God; and the life of the strong spirit was as much consumed in the flames of it, as ever driven slave's by the burden and heat of the day.|$|E
