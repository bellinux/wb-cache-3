Hickenlooper, also in state district court, seeking the same outcome. Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> are raising children, and five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> have married in other states. The suit named Governor John Hickenlooper and Denver City Clerk Debra Johnson as defendants. Hickenlooper responded by noting Colorado's support for civil unions.

Colorado Attorney General John Suthers, a Republican, announced he would defend the state's ban.|$|E

25|$|During {{its time}} of {{existence}} the legal settlement that gives the rabbinical courts the monopoly on conducting the marriages and divorces of the entire Israeli Jewish population {{has been a source}} of great criticism from the secular public in Israel, but also to the ardent support from the religious public. The main argument of the supporters of the law is that its cancellation will divide the Jewish people in Israel between the Jews who would marry and divorce each other within the Jewish religious authorities and the Jews who would marry and divorce each other within the civil marriages—which would not be registered or inspected by the religious authorities, and thus their children would be considered illegitimate to marry the children <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> married within the religious court, from fear of them being considered Mamzer.

[...] Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin-off, and Ted Shackelford assumed the role.
