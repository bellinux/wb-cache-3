50|$|For example, {{consider}} {{a company that}} has a net income of $100 this year, and its A/R increased by $25 {{since the beginning of the}} year. If the balances of all <b>other</b> <b>current</b> <b>assets,</b> long term assets and current liabilities did not change over the year, the cash flows could be determined by the rules above as $100 - $25 = Cash Flows from Operating Activities = $75. The logic is that, if the company made $100 that year (net income), and they are using the accrual accounting system (not cash based) then any income they generated that year which has not yet been paid for in cash should be subtracted from the net income figure in order to find cash flows from operating activities.
