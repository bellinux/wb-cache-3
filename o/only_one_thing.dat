25|$|The narcissistic manager {{will have}} two main sources of narcissistic supply: inanimate – status symbols like company cars, company-issued {{smartphone}} or prestigious offices with window views; and animate – flattery and attention from colleagues and subordinates. Teammates may find everyday offers of support swiftly turn them into enabling sources of permanent supply, unless they are very careful to maintain proper boundaries. The need to protect such supply networks will prevent the narcissistic managers from taking objective decisions; while long-term strategies will be evaluated according to their potential for attention-gaining for the manager themself. Organizational psychologist Alan Downs wrote a book in 1997 describing corporate narcissism. He explores high-profile corporate leaders (such as Al Dunlap and Robert Allen) who, he suggests, literally have <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> on their minds: profits. According to Downs, such narrow focus actually may yield positive short-term benefits, but ultimately it drags down individual employees as well as entire companies. Alternative thinking is proposed, and some firms now utilizing these options are examined. Downs' theories are relevant to those suggested by Victor Hill in his book, Corporate Narcissism in Accounting Firms Australia.|$|E

500|$|When Lennon went to Hamburg {{again in}} April 1962, {{she found a}} bedsit in a terraced house at 93 Garmoyle Road, Liverpool. Shortly after having failed her art teacher's diploma exam, in August 1962, she found she was {{pregnant}} with Lennon's child. She later explained that she and Lennon had never used contraception, had never talked about it, and didn't think about it at the time.

[...] The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool. His marriage began just as Beatlemania took hold across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day, and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.|$|E

500|$|In Work Suspended and Other Stories [...] Waugh {{introduced}} [...] "real" [...] {{characters and}} a first-person narrator, signalling the literary style he would adopt in Brideshead Revisited {{a few years}} later. [...] Brideshead, which questions the meaning of human existence without God, is the first novel in which Evelyn Waugh clearly presents his conservative religious and political views. In the LIFE magazine article, [...] "Fan Fare" [...] (1946), Waugh said that [...] "you can only leave God out [...] by making your characters pure abstractions" [...] and that his future novels shall be [...] "the attempt to represent man more fully which, to me, means <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> man in his relation to God." [...] As such, the novel Helena (1950) is Evelyn Waugh's most philosophically Christian book.|$|E
500|$|While Saw {{received}} mixed reviews, {{a general}} consensus among reviewers was that {{fans of the}} film series would enjoy it. Reviewer for Xbox 360 Achievements Alan Pettit wrote that while he enjoyed the game, {{it was not an}} outstanding title. Pettit commented that the game suffered due to the choice of Zombie Studios as the developer and that the franchise could be successful if a sequel was made with changes in developer and budget. Although he claimed it was repetitive, Pettit mentioned that [...] "If there was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> the game did well, I'd say the puzzles that are put before you are excellently constructed, well thought out and best of all, difficult enough that you may not get it on your first attempt." [...] The resulting score from Pettit's review was a 74 out of 100.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I really feel that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite Weed's efforts, Taylor was {{nominated}} {{on the fourth}} ballot, to the anger of Clay's supporters and of [...] Conscience Whigs from the Northeast. When order was restored, John A. Collier, a New Yorker and a Weed opponent, addressed the convention. Delegates hung on his every word as he {{described himself as a}} Clay partisan; he had voted for Clay on each ballot. He eloquently described the grief of the Clay supporters, frustrated again in their battle to make Clay president. [...] Collier warned of a fatal breach in the party, and stated that <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> could prevent it: the nomination of Fillmore for vice president, whom he incorrectly depicted as a strong Clay supporter. Fillmore in fact agreed with many of Clay's positions, but did not back him for president and was not in Philadelphia. Delegates did not know this was false, or at least greatly exaggerated, and there was a large reaction in Fillmore's favor. At the time, the presidential candidate did not automatically pick his running mate, and despite the efforts of Taylor's managers to get the nomination for their choice, Abbott Lawrence of Massachusetts, Fillmore became the Whig nominee for vice president on the second ballot.|$|E
500|$|Evelyn Waugh's {{professional}} and private circumstances, {{in the years}} after the Second World War, prefigured those of his fictional counterpart Pinfold. Before the war he had established himself as a writer, mainly of light satirical fiction. His wartime experiences, including service in the Royal Marines and the Royal Horse Guards, changed his personal and literary outlook, and put him into what his biographer David Wykes describes as [...] "a mood of introspection... that endured {{to the end of his}} career". Despite occasional reversions to his former style, in general Waugh's post-war fiction aspired to a more serious purpose. In an essay published in Life magazine in April 1946, he wrote: [...] "In my future books there will be two things to make them unpopular: a preoccupation with style and the attempt to represent man more fully, which, to me, means <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> man in his relation to God." [...] The commercial success of Brideshead Revisited, published in 1945, provided Waugh with the financial means to pursue his writing career in a leisurely fashion. He worked intermittently on his novel Helena for five years, while completing shorter projects and carrying out much unpaid work, particularly for Catholic organisations. In a marked change from his pre-war life, he ceased to socialise and became increasingly concerned to protect his privacy. To this end he adopted an overtly hostile persona as a defence mechanism, to repel the outside world.|$|E
500|$|Before the film's US {{television}} debut, Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times {{was critical}} of the film's objectives: [...] "he trouble with The Girl is that it tries to psychoanalyze Hitchcock but fails by trying to know the man too much. It's a movie about Hitchcock that ignores his best advice: 'Suspense is like a woman. The more left to the imagination, the more the excitement. Richard Brody of The New Yorker also gave the film a negative review, writing that, {{instead of being a}} drama, the film is an unoriginal work of criticism which [...] "points to what everyone ought already to have been talking about in the first place: not least, that it's no surprise to learn that a filmmaker whose art is devoted to pain, fear, control, and sexual obsession also experienced and inflicted them in life". On the day of its UK premiere, James Rampton of The Independent wrote that The Girl was [...] "no mere black-and-white hatchet job on Hitch. It does not seek to portray him as an unambiguous monster; rather, it highlights the profound psychological damage that plagued the director throughout his life". The Guardians Deborah Orr was generally positive about the film: [...] "here was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> wrong with The Girl. There was no Hitchcock in the director's chair to make it the utterly compelling psychological drama that it could have been." ...|$|E

500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} major pop/rock LP to include its {{complete}} lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album {{was the subject of a}} scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were [...] "listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy". Poirier identified what he termed its [...] "mixed allusiveness": [...] "It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> or expressing themselves in only one style... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives." [...] McCartney said at the time: [...] "We write songs. We know what we mean by them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it.... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs." [...] The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their [...] "brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms" [...] as a knowingly [...] "anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment" [...] display. [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number one on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".|$|E
500|$|Although the eponymous Baker {{brothers}} are the default {{stars of the}} film, Susie {{is considered to be}} the film's [...] "centerpiece". Film critic Mike D'angelo, writing for The Dissolve, observed that [...] "the character's name is Susie Diamond, and she's written like a woman named Susie Diamond, and Pfeiffer plays her ... like a woman named Susie Diamond." [...] As a romantic film, The Fabulous Baker Boys focuses on [...] "the unfulfilled longing between" [...] bandmates Susie and Jack. Susie is the only woman capable of changing [...] "the aloof, uncommunicative Jack... by throwing incendiary tantrums and sounding even tougher than he does", slowly inspiring the pianist to change the person he has allowed himself to become. Rolling Stones Peter Travers believes that Susie and Jack bond because both characters are [...] "losers who've sold themselves on the cheap"; Jack is a skilled musician who despises himself for squandering his talent, which reminds former escort Susie of herself. Pfeiffer agreed that her character essentially becomes [...] "a mirror image for Jack" [...] although both remain very different individuals. While Jack is depicted as timid and cautious about his decisions, Susie rather [...] "embraces life" [...] instead. An adventurous individual, Susie refuses to do <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> including perform, for her entire life. Pfeiffer observed that although her character has spent a significant portion of her life as an escort, she remains less of a [...] "whore" [...] than Jack because she retains her individuality, while Jack [...] "has ceased to be a vital human being." [...] When Susie and Jack have their final argument, the profanity Jack uses actually helps establish Susie as the stronger character, according to Mark R. Hasan of KQEK.com. Susie's nicknames for her bandmates reveal exactly how she feels about both brothers individually; while she refers to Frank as [...] "Egghead" [...] because of his growing bald spot and tendency to act unintelligent at times, she calls Jack simply [...] "Baker" [...] because, in her opinion, [...] "there's really only one Baker brother and he's it." [...] The way Susie teases Frank is reminiscent of how Jack used to treat him several years before she joined the band when he had energy to do it.|$|E
2500|$|Eysenck’s {{attitude}} was summarised {{in his autobiography}} Rebel with a Cause: [...] "I always felt that a scientist owes the world <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> {{and that is the}} truth as he sees it.

Tact and diplomacy are fine in international relations, in politics, perhaps even in business; in science <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> matters, and that is the facts."
